But I could not get a clear picture of how to go about things, and how to prioritize the things I wanted to do. Then, I came across \\"Maui Revealed\\". This book was a lifesaver, and is written in such an excellent way, that it made everything very very easy for us - right from the choice of beaches we should visit, to the choice of Luaus. I loved how they have laid out all the pros and cons, without tilting towards any particular choices. This was the best few bucks I have ever spent. In fact, now I force this book onto every one of my friends who is going to visit Maui :)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have never purchased books on Amazon before. I was always skeptical about the description. This was exactly what I was looking for, a very informative book, with off the beaten path sites to see. It gave inch by inch directions and we had a great time in Maui. The best surprise is that the book was actually in better shape than described. It was literally brand new and the price from the partnering vendor, was excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Price was really low.. 1.38. Shipping was the only real expense. Book came in fab. condition.. Really good guide w. maps of the areas I intend to visit this April. So what if the book dates from 2007. All the tourist attractions and most of the restaurants are still there. Granted the hotel prices may have changed, but I am doing TimeShare anyhow.. and that is not my major concern. Some of the tours I intend to take are really highlited w. good descriptions to help me forsee what they involve. Greatly recommended, even and especially for BEACH reviews, too."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I ordered several of the books from the \\"Revealed\\" series and found all of them up to date and accurate. This book was extremely helpful during our \\"Road to Hana\\" trip. It offered several time saving and useful tips. Try and read up on the areas you are visiting in advance. If you are just out for the adventure, this book is also excellent and easy to use on the go."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We are embarking on our 5th Hawaiian vacation. We bought the entire set for our third trip. The last two trips plus the upcoming trip were on the Norwegian cruise that cruises out of Honolulu. Each stop is two days on Maui, Kaui, and the big Island Hawaii. Since we are there for just two days at a time it is esssential to plan carefully. We just purchased the latest editions with all the updates. Although you can get the updates on their website, I prefer to have them in print. The books are very simple to read and easy to follow. Much of the information cannot be found in other publications. The author personally experiences everything in the book including the restaurants. We consult them religiously and have never been disappointed."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Absolutely the best guidebook on any destination I have ever used. I brought some other books but never pulled them out - they have gone to great effort to make the maps very relevant and easy to use, provide comprehensive and locally relevant reviews, and do it in an entertaining fashion. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook (Maui Revealed)Excellent guide. Referred to it constantly while in Maui. Reviews of sites, restaurants, etc. are very frank, which was most helpful. I must say it is obvious that the author is not on any restaurant's payroll.Word of caution; we did find that points of interest were not as well marked ( if at all) as normally found on the mainland. This was particularly true on the road to Hana. The mile markers noted were helpful, but it was still easy to drive on by the destination. The drive, while tiring, was worth the time. The fresh banana bread sold along the way was worth the trip."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is THE Maui guidebook.

We spent many days using the information and maps. My brother who lives on Maui even found it a great resource! It made our trip so much better. All other Maui guides don't even compare. It is written with humor and authentic knowledge. I'll be keeping an updated version on hand always!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui revealed is excellent!

We found this book to be invaluable and think it should be standard issue to everyone who visits the island.

Really a must have."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was very helpful and finding interesting places that are out of the way."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I didn't realize they sent me an outdated version of this book until I got to Hawaii.

The updates do matter."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book has a lot of very interesting information. It give descriptions of all of the places I am anxious to visit. It also allows you to go online and read the reviews on all of the lodging on Maui. I have used those reviews to find a place for us to stay. I can't wait to get to Maui to check it out."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"...it was pretty close to worthless for vacationing to Maui with a small child. I guess that makes it \\"mostly worthless.\\" I found more useful information on the internet from parenting blogs and forums. I hate that people told me to practically stick to it like a travel bible... and I couldn't help but feel bad for local businesses that weren't reviewed/\\"ONO'ed\\" because it seemed like tourists were more likely to skip over them if they weren't mentioned.My visit to Kauai seemed more enjoyable and memorable than our visit to Maui, and I think part of it was because my husband and I decided to skip the guidebook and leave most of the exploring to whatever came along our way... we asked locals to give recommendation and just did basic pre-vacation homework on one or two things before leaving. By the latter half of our vacation in Maui, I was ready to throw the book in the garbage... but I didn't because it was a library book.The second star it recieved is for the maps with mile markers. There were other small tidbits that were interesting about island history... but nothing you couldn't gather from reading the local travel magazines and/or watching Maui's visitor's channel (available on television at pretty much any resort you stay at). Next trip to anywhere in Hawaii, I'll just borrow the book in the library and then photocopy or scan the maps to save the packing space in my bag."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The transaction went well. We recieved a good product in the allotted time."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Have not made the trip yet, however will feel comfortable with the information I will gain from this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"A guide book should help a tourist have a successful trip, while respecting the local people and nature. This book failed my friends and I and the author even mentions how he pisses off the local people."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The book itself as a resource for information appears to be good so far. However, the edge of the cover of the book arrived damaged. The damage either occured prior to it being sent, or during packaging."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My vacation was great because I was able to use this book to look things up. My only regret was not having enough time to see everything the author pointed out."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was exactly what I was hoping for. I had used their other book \\"Kaui\\" before, and I am just as pleased with the reviews and information in this publication. They are straight forward and not paid by the places they review or list so you get an honest, real world evaluation on good/bad, what works what doesn't, best values, in real terms. Would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I found this book to be up to date and an excellent resource for planning my trip to Maui this spring (2011). The author has a website that lists any changes since the Edition 5 of the book went to publication. The book was recommended to me by a woman who grew up in Hawai'i and visits Maui regularly. She thinks it is 'The Ultimate Guidebook' on Maui. I guess I will have a better idea in another two weeks after I have spent a week there."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is an outstanding guidebook for the Island of Maui. Clear, honest, and very helpful! This book made planning our trip to Maui enjoyable and easy!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just finished reading the entire book. It has excellent information that will come in real handy on my upcoming vacation. I had done some online research for certain activities and after reading this book found out I could have made some very wrong choices."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have used Andrew Dougherty's guide books for Oahu, Kauai, and the Big Island. Our next trip will be to Maui, so there is no better guidebook with the inside scoop than Dougherty's Maui Guidebook. By now we are very familiar with how he organizes the sections so it is relatively easy to find something we are looking for. My husband (who also reads the directions for every product he buys) will read this book in its entirety prior to our trip and highlight what he finds interesting. I have been to Maui, so I will then follow up with what I know to be good and can arrange activities in a way that limits excess driving and maximizes fun. We both especially appreciate the humor interspersed with the facts, all of it made interesting by someone who obviously knows the territory he writes about."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"On our first trip to Hawaii several years ago a local recommended the \\"Big Island\\" book to us. Boy, where they right! It had everything! On subsequent trips we've made a point of having the latest edition of the book for whatever island we're visiting. This time is it Maui. I'm not finished with the book, but it's up to the standards for detail I expected from them. What to do, where to eat, tips and advice...it really helps to maximize your time and enjoyment if you've gone through this book before you travel.I will continue to collect these books every time we go to Hawaii."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I certainly would suggest purchasing this book BEFORE booking your trip! It would be better to waste a few dollars on a cheap book, rather than waste a lot of dollars on an overpriced vacation."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I haven't read this yet as I'm not going to Maui for a little while. I just wanted the book to read for now since I've been there before."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We spent one month in Maui this summer. It was a dream come true. This book is, hands down, the best guide to Maui. We had many guidebooks and none of them even came close. You will never see a comment like \\"this place is a dump\\" or \\"the locals like to send the tourists to this murky beach\\" in a Fodor's guidebook. These guys shoot straight and give you all of the little details (like turn right at the giant bell-shaped rock) about the places that tourists would normally not see. The locals feel that this book has done more bad than good for Maui, as the tourists armed with this book now visit many of the places that were traditionally kept secret. I'm not saying that I agree with commercializing all of the natural beauty of Maui, but the people with this book are given detailed descriptions of how to see things that the average tourist will not hear about in their Fodor's or Dummies guide book.If you are only buying one book, buy this one."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We've just returned from a trip to Maui with a well-thumbed copy of Maui Revealed in hand. My impression before the trip was that the book was fantastic -- and a great resource for planning. During the trip itself, I was substantially less impressed.Let me say up front that the book was perfectly adequate as a guidebook for the first time Maui visitor (and probably as good as any of the alternatives). The beach reviews were generally quite accurate, the maps were great and the book was well structured. However, there were several things that started to annoy me more and more.Most importantly, the book is somewhat of a victim of its own success. There are lots of \\"hidden secrets\\" that the author is revealing \\"just to you\\"...and to every other tourist in Maui. You will spot this book in every rental car, on every beach mat, and in every coffee shop. Rest assured, the \\"hidden spots\\" are no longer so. Moreover, this has apparently (understandably) annoyed the locals to such an extent that they have become hostile to tourists trampling over their land in search of hidden spots. Especially on the road to Hana: we found animal carcasses blocking trails and ominously threatening signs about trespassing. You will not discover any hidden waterfall trails without potentially running your vacation by an encounter with an enraged local. The personal, chatty style of writing also starts to grate after a while.Finally (not the fault of the author), the restaurant reviews were very outdated. There seems to be a lot of turnover, and many of the places were out of business although the book was published relatively recently. Stick to yelp and you'll be fine."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My family and I used this book on an 11 day trip to Maui (first time). We had a great time largely due to this book. Reviews were generally spot on of hotels and dining spots as well as snorkeling and SCUBA sites and destinations on the road to Hana. I can, however, see why some locals would be a bit angry at the author. Many remote sites described in this book have not been treated as well as they should be. When using this book, please be responsible stewards of the beautiful places on Maui which you would not otherwise be able to find."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Andrew Doughty is the type of traveler you expect to be mouthing off in your living room telling you what to do in Maui. Imagine my surprise when I discovered his intimate knowledge of the island has produced one of the most helpful and personalized of guidebooks anywhere, much less the island paradise. The usual suspects in this genre- Lonely Planet and Rough Guide, in particular - pale in comparison because Doughty offers no-holds-barred opinions on everything from the questionable living conditions at renowned hotels to the suitability of swimming at heavily visited public beaches. It's no wonder that local officials and merchants have been trying to ban his book from unsuspecting tourists, as he unobtrusively expresses his first-hand knowledge of all the experiences to be had on the island from dining to hiking to snorkeling to beachcombing.For example, he candidly states not to dip your toe in the beaches lining the northern part of Kihei because of the relentless presence of city sewage on the shoreline. Personally I'm grateful for the advice since there are so many beaches to choose from, and any such insider's information helps winnow down the choices easily. Doughty also does a thorough job on describing the big tourist spots such as Haleakala, the road to Hana and snorkeling at Molokini. Each has his descriptive opinions on what to do and what to avoid, and some may surprise, for example, he considers the famous downhill cycling from Haleakala Crater to be overrated and quite dangerous (his niece was traumatically injured on one such innocently-positioned ride).I followed Doughty's advice on what waterfalls and swimming holes to visit on the way to Hana, the best of which he identifies with \\"diversion alert\\" signs in the book. He was absolutely right, as I managed to avoid the crowds at higher profile sights such as the much-ballyhooed Seven Sacred Pools, which was predictably overrun with indifferent tourists. Doughty also includes a thorough dining guide and designates the best ones with an \\"Ono\\" symbol. For key sights all over the island, he identifies \\"real gems\\" for the highlights to be found. He also included tour company operators he recommends, as well as details on excursions to neighboring islands like Molokai and Lanai. There are a number of helpful maps as well. All in all, I consider this to be the essential guide for a trip to Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If nothing else, you can recoup the price of the book by avoiding the over-priced, under valued restaurants that try to take tourists for a buck in Maui.We bought two books before we headed off to Maui (another on diving), and we found this one quite helpful. We used it for directions on highways, on hikes, to find beaches, to get to the volcano and know how much it would cost, to find restaurants (on a daily basis), to find shopping...just about everything we did merited a look in the book first. Of course, we could have survived without it, but we would have spent more money and missed some really cool stuff.A couple of things you might not realize...nearly everyone else visiting the island has this book, too. Therefore, many of the places described as quiet and quaint aren't. Also, we were told that the natives hate this book so much that they are more likely to break into your rental car if they see it on the seat. I'm not sure about that one, but I wouldn't leave it out.Yes, the book has it's weaknesses, but given the choice, I would definitely pick it up again before heading off to Maui. Aloha!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The depth and quality of content in this guide delighted us for 2 solid weeks on Maui. Excellent reviews on restaurants and lodging, insightful guides to attractions - the exact opposite of the blatantly dishonest and cheaply done Frommer's Maui.We were steered to Maui Revealed by a local visiting Maine, and we were lucky we got it. A pity we used Frommer's Maui guide to book a week's lousy lodging and visit some cheesy overpriced restaurants!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Easy to use. Mile marker descriptions are invaluable. It enhanced our recent vacation tremendously. I had to pry the book from my wife's hands, or all she would eat is recommended restaurant food."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have been to Maui several times, but I had Maui Revealed this time, and I'm so glad I did. Lots of places we knew about, but there were a few wonderful surprises we were able to experience courtesy of the guidebook. It was never far from our side!! It is organized extremely well, and it was easy to find whatever we needed. It certainly helped when we did the Road to Hana...had a CD in the car, but turned that off shortly after we started our journey, and just referred to the guidebook. It also gives a lot of history, and we were very interested in the story of the Ritz Carlton, and why it isn't oceanfront. The detailed maps of different areas of the island helped a lot. It's a nice size- fits into the door pocket of a car, or in a carry-on to read on the flight over, and the plastic covered front and back covers keep it nice!! Don't buy another guidebook- all you will need is this one!! Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is incredible. Besides the glossy, hard to tear, 4 color pages and the beautiful pictures, the information presented is second to none. We are planning a trip for later this year, and right off the bat, we used this book to determine which properties were on decent swimming beaches. And the books is brutally honest when discussing issues like traffic, grocery prices and even questioning the safety of some of Maui's tourist activities. Anyone even thinking of going to Maui should pick this book up."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"As others have said, this is a pretty complete and generally accurate guide. One problem: it may be *too* good/popular, as several of the \\"secret\\" spots and adventures listed are now closed, as they have become too popular! These would include \\"the Aquarium\\" and \\"the Fishbowl\\" snorkeling spots near LaPerouse Bay. The entire reserve area has been closed to all uses for two years, starting in August 2008. Hefty fine and possible court date for violators. In addition, the rangers and others told us that Molokini will likely be closed as well. No one mentioned Honolua Bay, but...We did many of the \\"trails\\" and \\"adventures\\" described...and none of the trails were at all hard to find, as a clear path has been pretty much beaten in.Overall, it's a helpful book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My family and I just returned from an 8 day trip to Maui and this book, Maui Revealed, was everything the book promised and more. The maps of the areas, the information/history of Maui, the hotel reviews, the restaurant/dining reviews, the tourist reviews and the entire book was just outstanding. Every place we ate (that was recommended as \\"ONO\\" in the book) turned out to be 100 correct.This is one of those travel books that is honest and the authors live the islands and respect the islands and know what is and what is not worth the time and effort. This book, in my opinion, is one of those \\"must have\\" books and I saw several other people while we in Maui using the same book. I only wish other travel books were as comprehensive, user friendly, funny and informative as this book.If you are going to Maui and need ONE book - get this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If you are going to Maui on anything other than a guided tour, get this book and you will not regret bringing it along. Not only is the information excellent and up-to-date, but the writing is top-notch and quite entertaining to read. We travel all over and I find myself wishing that all our destinations had guidebooks written in this style by Andrew Doughty."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Excellent resource for combing the beautiful island of Maui. The Road to Hana gave a detailed description of sights along the journey which we used in conjunction with a CD that you can purchase anywhere in Maui.

Other island treasures were described in a way that made it easy to read as the \\"passenger\\" and \\"guide\\"."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have been going to Maui for many years. I had been borrowing a first edition of this book, but wanted to give it as a gift for Christmas, and got one for myself too. It is a must have reference book for anyone traveling to Maui. It really improves your experience... without it, you will miss much."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"An absolute great job.

Very useful for driving around Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have used the third edition of this guide for the past two vacations to Maui and have received the fourth edition for my next trip a week from now, 4/18/08. Of the guides I have previewed at the book stores, I have found this one to be the easiest to navigate. The information is given in a narrative form for the most part. Humourous in places, it is nice to have a guidebook written by people who actually go to the restaurants, luau's and shops without revealing the nature of their visit, thereby receiving special attention. In simple terms their reviews are without bias. They are also extremely accurate. Though I find that the maps in the guide could be a little more detailed, at least the written directions are spot on. Color photography throughout. Yes Maui IS that beautiful! You will enjoy every minute."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I just returned from Hawaii this morning. I purchased this book on a friend's recommendation. While in Maui we rented a car and this book was our tour guide for everything from the sites worth seeing to the restaurants to visit to the best places to shop. This book was so worth the money and I would tell anyone who is planning a visit to Hawaii to pick up each and every \\"Revealed\\" book!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Goes WAY beyond your average guide book. I lived in Hawaii for a year and felt like a local thanks to this book (and the series of books for the various Hawaiian islands). No need to carry several guide books to Hawaii - this is all you need. And the online information (which you receive by purchasing a book and getting a special password) gives you even more information on housing, restaurants, etc. and keeps the info in the book fresh and up to date. Cant recommend enough. Mahalo!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I recently sat beside a passenger on the plane trip to Maui who'd purchased another guidebook (not Maui Revealed) and we discussed activities to do while on the island. After talking for a few minutes, it became apparent that their travel guide was sorely missing the detailed and unique information you'll get in this guide. If you're going to Maui for the first time, buy this guide and read every page of it before you go. When you get to Maui, you'll see people using this book and you can compare details about your adventures with them. We found this to be a fun way to meet people while you're there. Our copy has been to Maui three times and, its so useful, its trashed!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui Revealed Guidebook was such a great resource to have!

Reading this book is like having the author in the back seat telling you where to go, how to get there and why you should go there. He gives great tips that only an insider would know and allows you to travel off the beaten path, if you are inclined to do so. His writing is direct, concise and witty, like a cheeky, sarcastic uncle who has lived on 'Maui all his life. He is honest in his reviews and quite accurate, therefore giving you reassurance that you can trust what he says. I have also used his Big Island book and find it to be equally reliable and helpful."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Aloha!

Love it!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book provides info that one would take years to find on their own even with multiple trips to Maui. very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Lots of info in this book, Island broken down in sections, with info on dining, shopping, activities, shows, tourist traps, and more.Very detailed, and very informative."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This resource was recommended by a local from Maui & she was absolutely correct! This book provides great tips for a successful trip to Maui. A must read for anyone visiting or living on this Island!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Great reference book if you're visiting Maui. It has a lot of \\"insider\\" info on places to go, to stay, etc. We had an earlier edition, and there doesn't seem to be much updating in this edition."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Travelled to Maui a few years ago with this book. With it we found incredible beaches & waterfalls that we'd never have found otherwise. It's a must if you're going to take \\"the road to Hana\\". We passed our Maui Revealed to another couple we met in Hawaii. We're talking about going back next year and I ordered another. I've read through it again :)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Andrews knowledge of the Hawaiian Islands make your vacation the very best it can be, and then some!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I love the design of this book: quality paper, all colored pages, free website for more information and updates, many photos and maps, easy to read, well organized, what else? I've purchased many other travel books by author publishing companies, but I definitely like Maui Revealed. I love how durable the book is because I plan on using it alot since we own a timeshare in Maui. I am very tempted to buy it for Kauai even though we plan on going only once for our honeymoon. A new edition is coming out in April, so I'd wait to buy that one.When I mentioned going to Maui, a friend of a friend recommended the \\"Blue Book\\", which is what the locals in Hawaii call this line of travel books. These is a great resource of unbiased reviews by people who have lived there or been there for a long time. There are no advertisements. You can check out a preview of a few pages of their book online too before making the decision to buy. But I definitely recommend this book to family and friends on my wedding website."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My wife and I have used Andrew Doughty's books for visits to three other Hawaiian islands before our trip to Maui. As usual, we were completely satisfied with all of the information, tips and suggestions that he included in this book on Maui. We are not into long, strenuous hikes so I can't comment on his guidance in this area. However, for the average tourist, I feel that this book contains the best, most helpful guidance you can get to make your visit fun and efficient. The book will probably help you find some sights and activities that you won't find in other guidebooks. We had a great time thanks to the many suggestions in this book and will definitely buy another one the next time we plan a trip to any of the islands."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great book and very popular. It seemed most people doing driving tours around the island had one. They also have them for sale on Maui but it is best to buy ahead of time and mark up the things you want to go see. There is so much to go and do in Maui, I was shocked. We didn't get to see half of it. The authors are great because they aren't boring, they talk with humour & give you the truth of all situations from history to present day ownerships, also places to see & not to waste your time on, & where to eat & not eat. There are lots of visuals of places to see & maps & mile markers to help guide you. I recommend this book to anyone going to Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Took this book on our trip to Hawaii and it came in handy. It took us to some hidden gems around the island."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Have traveled many times to Maui, and thought we knew all the hot spots. After thumbing through this guide, we decided to try Nakalele Blowhole on the North shore. This location is not on the map, and no signs will direct you there. One tip - unless you are into intense, no- or little-trail hiking, take the second route identified in the book. Awesome site, with little tourist traffic. We had been 200 yards from this spot before and never noticed it. This is just one example of the type of information you will get from Doughty in this book. He uses mile markers to guide you to the precise points to turn off. His descriptions are direct and objective. He also includes insights on local lore and enough history to help you appreciate the context of the sites, without bogging down the guide."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a must have for anyone travelling to Maui! You don't need to buy anyother guide book, this is it! Take some time and read it before you go - and then take it with you. Pays for itself tenfold with the enjoyment of your travels..."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the book that you will want for your visit to Maui. Plenty of information. You need to read it before you go. Loaded with tips and secret places that not many people know about. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"You can not go wrong with this guidebook in Maui. We just returned from the island and we have both mentioned how valuable this guidebook was. While we were there, we commented multiple times that the authors must have been reading our minds when composing their reviews! In fact, we stayed in Oahu for two days at the conclusion of our trip and felt somewhat lost with out the guidebook for that island. Way to go! Beats Lonely Planet and even Fodors any day."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"In my opinion, this is the best of the best. A well laid out guide book, with lots of good iinformation."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is the best! Very honest and specific. I have purchased this as gift for a friend going to Maui for their honeymoon. I gave it to them a few months early so they could read thru it. Maps and directions are awesome too!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"As a wedding and event planner, I use the Ultimate Hawaii guides when I plan Hawaiian honeymoons for my clients. I find them to be a great source of information. I've been to many of the places that are critiqued in the guides and, for the most part, their reviews are very accurate. I've only had a few occasions where I've found a review to be inaccurate. Overall, these guides are very useful."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is a must have for anyone visiting Maui. Hidden trails, beaches and reviews on local companies, restaurants were excellent. It's like having a local guide with you on your trip.

I bought all three."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"BEST BOOK EVER! We used this book on our trip to Maui for our Honeymoon and couldn't have done as much as we did w/o it.Road to Hana: great tips on where to stop, where NOT to stop, what time to leave to beat the traffic, where to eat along the way and what to look for!Restaurants: the book rates restaurants on their food, cleanliness, appearance, overall expereience...and much moreActivities: listed out what activities are worth the money and what one's are not"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Before going to Maui we researched the sites, had a general idea of where and what there was to see. But after getting there we were at a loss of what to do. I guess all that research was lost on the way. We did not buy the book initially since we figured we researched enough and could just do our own thing and find the stuff on our own. NOT THE CASE. Alot of the stuff in the book would be very had to stumble across and even with the directions and descriptions at times were hard to find things.We purchased this book from the ABC stores on Maui and paid Full Price. In retrospect I wish we would of bought this book before and dog eared, highlighted, postit noted'ed the heck out of it before we got there.Some of the review say that alot of the information is old news which may be true but this book was well worth the 20.00 we paid and I seriously dont thing out Vacation would of been nearly as awesome as it was with out it..Highly recommended, Especially if its your 1st trip to Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book helped plan a dream-come-true week in Hawaii for our family. We planned several mornings of scuba diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, based on the book's recommendations. We ate at several recommended restaurants, including the Aloha Mixed Plate. Yum! We rode horses for 6 hours to the crater of Haleakala volcano (and back), and drove the full day road trip to Hana. We experienced an authentic Hawaiian luau and the Ulalena show. Fantastic! Finally, we toured the Maui Gold pineapple farm and ate lunch at The Hali'imaile General Store. By the end of the week, we needed a vacation! Great reviews and recommendations. Is it any wonder this book was being sold as THE guidebook to Maui in the on-island stores? This book is BIG on activities on Maui, so you may want to consult other guidebooks for food and lodging recommendations."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great book, but beware because when you go to Maui just about every store sells it and the locals know the tourists because they are ALL carrying this book. Or mentioning it somehow or another."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great Guide book to carry with you on your trip to Hawaii. I suggest booking your package vacation through a Certified (by the Visitors Bureau) Hawaii Destination Travel Professional like myself, then carrying this book with you along the way."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We visited Maui in September 2010 and used this book on a daily basis. It was especially helpful on our road trip to Hana. I've just bought another Revealed book for the Big Island as we are going there in 2013. I hope it's just as useful!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book gave us some wonderful tips on just about everything and we were using it from the moment we arrived on the island. Well worth every penny spent on it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just like the Oahu book, I highly recommend this guide for anyone going to Maui. I read it cover-to-cover before we left and took it along to reference often. Great to find some lesser known places and to know which places to skip. I wish this author would review everywhere I travel."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Purchased this guide before our trip to Maui and it provided us with some recommendations and ideas that we never would have known otherwise. On the road to Hana it directed us to some great out-of the-way sights and waterfalls that made our trip unbelievably memorable. It is easy to look back and think of the many great sights that we would have missed out on had we been following the mainstream trip planners. It's recommendations were spot-on. We didn't use it much for eating, so I can't really comment on that aspect."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was very helpful for us. Concise, easy to find the topics. We used their dining guide the most and it never steered us wrong. We also appreciated their recommendations on beaches. I think it is THE book to use when going to Hawaii."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the only guide you'll need- it helps keep your luggage weight down by eliminating extra books. The info is accurate and well organized. It's also fun to read and prevents you from dozing- it's hard to lose focus when you're laughing."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If you're planning a trip to Maui, this book is a must have! It is packed full of information with an entertaining flare of humor. It has become the single most valuable tool in preparing for our trip. The authors have gone to great lengths to provide the reader with everything you need to know about Maui and everything the island has to offer."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I found this book to be a great help in planning a Maui vacation. It has good inside tips and great input on beaches and activities."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"this book is full of info about every inch of Maui. alot of it is mere fluff. the info may be accurate as to location of stuff, but the language used to describe what is there is way over blown-especially the road to Hana section."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just got back from 2 weeks in Maui and found that this book was awesome! The author really depicts an accurate view of what things are like right now, not just a rehash of some old reviews of drives/towns/restaurants/beaches that are no longer relevant. I'm sold on this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My fiance and I recently went to Maui and used this book as our first and foremost guide. It actually got to the point where he wouldn't go anywhere without the book because he believed so fully in what the authors were saying. But it's true, it was all we really needed; most of the other books stayed in the suitcase! (We did occasionally resource 50 Thrifty Maui Restaurants for some cheap eats.) It's very informative and has a lot of cool tips in it. Even the maps are helpful. The only place we used an extra map was in Kahului. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great book that you should have on your Maui trip. I agree that it is especially useful for those who want to see the natural beauty of Maui. Some of the directions seem a bit misplaced (we never found the Road to Nahiku). The restaurant reviews were spot on."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Absolutely the most comprehensive travel guide I have read...We just got back from Maui and this book was a vital companion and helped us get around and not miss anything and maps were a big help.....Especially good and above all others for the trip to Hana. Only thing I would like different that other guides (Lonely Planet) do is to not separate the beaches and food places into other sections when describing the sights of a certain area........but Revealed does it more comprehensive than anybody and I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book during our week long trip to Maui.The book is very accurate and we found the tips extremely helpful. Not only it made our trip enjoyable but also saved us money. The hotel, we were staying in, was trying to push a lot of paid activities and after reading the review of the activities from the book, we were fortunate to avoid most of the ones. Many others at our hotel were not so fortunate.We were able to plan and do all our activities ourselves, including the beaches and hikes.I did find a few places a little over hyped in the book. For example, black rock beach - which is quite deep and not the best for kids. We really enjoyed the Mala Ramp beach and the Baby beach (1 mile south of Black Rock) with our kids. Easy parking and shallow water with a lot of marine life.We also discovered very good vegetarian food in Farmer's Market at Lower Honoapiilani Road. They have 50% off after 6 pm. This was great after eating $15 burgers :) . Baby beach and Farmer's market deal were not mentioned in the book.In addition to the book, make sure you talk the locals (e.g. the folks who work at the stores) to get tips on restaurants and places to visit. Most locals were happy to share things tourists can never learn.Get the book, enjoy your trip."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I picked up this book on a recommendation from a friend. I used it to plann most of our trip weeks before arriving on Maui. The book was incredibly helpful and guided us to several sites that we might not have otherwise seen. A tour guide on one of the buses, a local, said that tour guide was her favorite. I highly recommend this for those vacationing on Maui. I had another friend tell me the Oahu get was excellent as well."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My wife and I just got back from Maui. This book was GREAT at giving the location of things to do on the island. Such as snorkeling spots, beaches to visit, and unique geographic locations (e.g. blowhole). We made a lot of cool discoveries because of this book!!! BUY IT!!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"What can I say? Awesome! I've read Frommer's Hawaii 2008. Frommer's is just a book telling you there is a beach here and there is a fall there. And I notice Frommer's involves A LOT of ads from activity companies who try to sell their activities to you. In contrary, Andrew Doughty's book offers you a really personal but neutual experience of every place in Hawaii. Because Doughty and his group actually been to every place and experience by themselives, you feel that each evaluation and comment he gave towards a sight or activity is solid and trust-worthy. Not to mention his fun-to-read style. I would say even if you just want to know about Hawaii not visit, the book is a fun to read. ABSOLUTELY!!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have used The Ultimate Guidebooks several times and think that they are the best in giving information the way it really exists. They let you know about many of the out of the way beautiful places and eating places. We have also used the book info to obtain condos or hotels. They say it like it is! That is what is great about the Ultimate Guide. We are again using the Maui Revealed Guide for our trip to Maui. Thanks for producing reviews that are honest."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Fantastic guidebook. Simply put, the most outstanding I've ever used and I just happened upon it by chance, after finding out last week my wife and I will be vacationing in Maui next month. Covers everything one would possibly want to know about visiting this island gem and then some. Revised every 2 years by Andrew Doughty, with updated info all the way up to press time. Mr. Doughty takes you on a journey down each road, and even points out hidden finds you won't read about anywhere else.Initially, I figured on maybe thumbing through a few choice pages, but ended up reading from cover-to-cover. The author has personally traveled these routes on numerous occasions, and even sampled the food at nearly every establishment. You won't find a single black-and-white photograph amongst the hundreds of breathtaking examples of Maui's beauty, compliments of the 2 photographers, one of which is Mr. Doughty himself. And those map illustrations that are so helpful? Once again, partial credit goes to Mr. Doughty in that department as well.Even if you've never thought of visiting Maui, I believe this guide will spark the desire. And done with the perfect balance of humor too. It's like having your very own personal tour guide. I can't say enough good things about this find. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Excellent book. Enjoyed the humor as much as the useful tips and information. However, one critique I would have, is that it would've been alot easier to locate the eateries recommended in the book. A number, or a symbol right there on the map would have made it much simplier to pinpoint a restaurants location, other than just the address and phone numbers.David"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I'm so glad I bought this book! We just returned from a family vacation for Thanksgiving! (Nov. 17-26, 2007). This book is on hit! It tells you exactly where to turn, what to look for and step by step instructions on how to find the best beaches, restaurants and signs that say \\"closed...turn around\\" but if you keep going it is really open. If we didn't have this book we would have missed so many wonderful things on our trip. We even ran into other tourists and locals who knew this same book and even had it in their hands. It was soooo cool! This is by far a must have book if you want to venture off away from the resorts/hotels and see the real Maui!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I just returned from Maui. We used the book the entire time we were there and found it to be very helpful and informative. It contains a lot more USEFUL information than the other guidebooks that we took with us. We used the advice about restaurants, snorkel trips, the Hana Highway, and the trip around the West Maui Mountains. We would have missed some breathtaking sights had we not had this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is going to visit the island. From the look of things, it was recommended to a lot of other visitors as well. We saw the book being used everywhere!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We arrived with no guidebook and found this one in our condo. It was basically our Bible on the island, and every review we followed was right on the money. Great book, very helpful!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a must have travel guide when in Maui. I had a previous edition and have been to Maui countless times, using my edition every time. With the new edition, I know that I'm getting the most for my money in Maui and with the purchase of this book.If you've never been to Maui - GET THIS BOOK. If you've been to Maui before GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui Revealed:The Ultimate Guidebook is the best guidebook for Maui that I have ever seen. My son lives in Maui and he uses this book all the time. It is very detailed in its descriptions of hikes, tourist places to visit, restaurants, shopping and other information.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone traveling to Maui. THis is the only book you need."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Order this book so you have it at least a month before your trip. It includes tips on what to bring, what you should schedule in advance, and what can wait until you arrive. It has reviews of nearly all the activities of the island, including reviews of the companies, restaurants, etc. It is well-worth buying and will really make your trip smoother."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We just got back from celebrating our 5th anniversay with a week in Maui yesterday and this book was an indespensible resource that never left our side. Each day we were there, we explored a new part of the island or went on a new tour or trip and this book helped us through every part. If you are like us and like to pack every day of your vacation with new and fun things, then you should buy this book right now. But even if you prefer to just relax and visit a few places and restaurants, this book has reviews that will help you choose.The author is a native, and is cynical and has a *very* dry sense of humor. However, for someone who is making recommendations, this is really a good quality. I personally don't want someone who is willing to give everyone and everything 5 stars. I prefer and appreciate someone who will tell me the negatives of each choice so that I can evaluate those and make a decision instead of just hearing the bubbly positives of every option.We got to our hotel on Sunday night (we stayed at the Mahana in Ka'anapali and would recommend it for anyone, btw). We were on the island for a week and loved it.*Monday: We went around NW Maui and used this book for sightseeing. Excellent!*Tuesday: We learned to surf and went to a Luau. Both places were reviewed in this book.*Wednesday: We took the road to Hana. This is where this book really shined. He identifies every sight to see along the way using mile markers and tells you right where to turn off to not miss a thing.*Thursday: We went on a boat trip to Molikini based upon the review in here and loved it!*Friday: We went up Haleakala and traveled around the Upcountry visiting the spots he recommended. Beautiful sights and great food!*Saturday: Surfing and snorkeling again.We saw several people with printouts of stuff from the internet that they were using to navigate, and we saw some people that actually hired locals to tell them where to go. I can honestly say that this was the best $15 we spent on the whole trip because it provided us the freedom and convenience that those other options couldnt provide. We loved our trip and will continue to buy books from the \\"Revealed\\" series when we visit other islands or other locations on vacation. Thanks Andrew!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I took this book (along with a few other books/guides/maps) with us on our honeymoon to Maui and it was priceless! It was absolutely the only guide/map, etc. that we needed or even used! The descriptions of various places, stops, etc were dead on. It brought up points and ideas that we'd never even thought of. And the drive to Hana (as directed in the book) was great and a must for everyone! And all of the little out-of-the-way stops were fantastic! (the banana bread and coconut candy was soooooo good!) I can't praise this book enough!!!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We were told about this guide several years ago, and we located it and bought it. It not only tells you where things are, but how exactly to get there and what to expect. Sometimes the ratings are brutally honest. For example, don't go on the Road to Hana expecting to buy lunch or dinner there. There is only one place to get food, and the food is definitely not worth eating. The authors have a great sense of humor when describing such situations. We recently bought the new edition to update the old one, and it's even better than the old one. I have yet to disagree with any of the judgments or recommendations in the book. If you are going to Maui for the first time, BUY THIS BOOK. If you're going for the tenth time, you better buy it, also. A great guide book, well written and interesting reading, and up-to-date."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was amazing. We would not have enjoyed Maui nearly as much if it were not for this book. It lead us to our favorite beach that we definitely would not have found without it. It gives great directions and leads you to places you would not usually think to go. Absoulutely terrific. The Gem system is very helpful in locating key places.YOU NEED THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have been to Hawaii 6 times. Mostly stay on Maui for 5 days and than to another island for 5 days. I have bought every guide book that is sold for Maui and this is the best. Everything in it is accurate. Especially the self guided tours. Shows you exactly where to stop and what to see. The humor is also very enlightening."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I enjoyed Maui Revealed. It had a lot of great tips on finding out of the way locations that were beautiful. It's listing of hiking trails is better than I've seen in any other guide to Maui. It's description of the backcountry road beyond Hana talked me into taking that route, and I'm glad I did. Along that route I saw scenery I would never have otherwise.Like any guidebook, you need to know how to use it. It makes nearly EVERY location sound like a must-see place of stunning beauty. Based on the book's description, you might find yourself hiking over wet, slippery rocks for a couple hundred yards to be rewarded with a spectacular view of what looks like a glorified drainage ditch. Of course, this will vary depending on the season.The author of Maui Revealed continually references his 'outsider' status an a guidebook writer, and leads the reader to beleive that you are recieving little-known information. The truth is that nearly every tourist on Maui has this book, and you will find people joking with you about it as you pass them along a trail to some remote waterfall.Also, the book has generated some controversy among the locals. Formost in this is the book's insistance that it's ok to hike on private property. Several locations 'discovered' by the writer of this book have since become popular (and crowded) attractions. Imagine several hundred people a day trekking across your formerly private, quiet backyard and you'll understand why some locals don't like it.Overall, it's a really useful, and insightful book, and very useful, especially if you like finding out of the way things to see and do. Just be aware that as a result of this book's popularity, that remote beach may now be filled with tourists."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I used a previous edition when we last visited Maui. It was fun to see other people referring to the book when you pulled up to a feature on a drive. I am planning another trip so had to had the latest edition. The book in connection with its associated website are very valuable to anyoine planning a trip to Maui - BUT be sure to investigate as many online sites as you can for other reviews since no book can cover everything and online sites can have news recent devlopments."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We are planning a trip to Costa Rica and I am disappointed that there are no books similar to Maui Revealed. My husband and I purchased Maui Revealed and the Frommer's Guide. Maui Revealed was the best - hands down. We traveled around the island - eating coconut candy, getting flowers from locals, seeing blowholes, and eating freshly made banana bread. None of this would have happened if we stuck to the Frommer's Guide. Plus - the pictures are awesome and the tips on parking helped tremendously. I cannot recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book gives you the detail you normally would only wish for at a bargain price. I am very impressed by the practical nature of the information which has actually helped me refine my travel plans. The maps, directions, and photos alone are impressive. Add to that tips about dos and don'ts, beaches, activities, adventure companies, and restaurants in a well organized format and it is easy to see why this is called \\"The Ultimate Guidebook\\"!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I personally have never gone wrong with these guides. My family and I have been visiting the islands for a few decades, and ever since we found these guidebooks, we have used them exclusively. I don't know exactly how many years we've used them, but we've seen a few editions fill our book case.While some people won't necessarily have the same experiences as the author, all of our trips to recommended areas have resulted in enjoyment.If it wasn't for this series, I probably wouldn't eat at 'Da Kitchen' every time I'm on Maui.One thing to note, however, is that these guides were somewhat revolutionary in the extensive, unbiased reporting they provided when they first came out. Now that more people are using them and discovering the 'secrets,' not every place is as private as they once were. The hidden gems are now \\"revealed,\\" so one might find less traveled paths a little more occupied. However, while there aren't really new spots being pointed out (mostly just reiterations of old editions), they still are pretty spot on in the descriptions and suggestions.Be sure to check the publisher's website for updates, I mark them in my book to limit unwanted surprises each trip!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"After visiting the island a few times, I met the author of this book at a book convention and became intrigued with his insights. And, after visiting the island numerous times since getting this book, I'd say it's the best thing available for finding out what Maui has to offer.The restaurant reviews and other recommendations in this book are usually spot on, and the tips and hints about special sights to see--as well as the history of various locales--make the book invaluable.I especially love the honesty about what is NOT good. Most of the other review books put a sugar-coating on every restaurant and every activity mentioned in their books. As a result, those books read more like advertisements than reviews. Fodor's is one example of this - don't even waste your money on its sugary-sweet \\"everything is wonderful\\" hype.That said, I have to agree with many of the other reviews that critique Maui Revealed for its vagueness and perhaps (unintentionally) misleading descriptions about the ease of accessing some of the \\"off the beaten path\\" hikes.The author of this book is a physically fit individual, so when the text says \\"a relatively easy hike,\\" he's talking about it from his perspective. Unfortunately, I've seen relatively frail-looking people in their 50's and 60's who were trying to access some of these \\"relatively easy\\" hikes. At least one review on this book mentions tourists getting medivac'd to a hospital every few weeks as a result of trying to visit some of the sites this book recommends. Although I've not witnessed that, I can certainly see how it could happen.Along these lines, keep in mind that the 'off the beaten path' walks recommended in this book are just that - off the beaten path. While you'll see this blue book on the dashboard of many cars, a lot of the places that require a short hike are not set up for tourists at all. No hand railings. No paved paths. In some places if you slip and fall you could end up falling a long way.My advice: Take the author's physically fit athleticism into account when reading this, and evaluate each location with your own sense of what's safe for you and what's not. Just because the author says it's easy doesn't mean it will be easy for everyone.Additionally, I also agree with the observation that details on how to access some of these hikes are vague. On more than one occasion I and the people I was with gave up and turned around because nothing we were seeing was like anything described in the book.For all this critique, I still think this book is the best available for learning where to go / where not to go on Maui. If for no other reason, get this book to learn about the island's history. For example, you can drive past a non-descript location a dozen times and not think anything of it. But in Maui Revealed you might learn that some famous event occurred at that site more than 100 years ago. It's those kind of golden nuggets that set the book apart from the standard tourist publications, which are mainly focused on getting you to spend money in a particular location.Bottom line, if you're going to Maui - or even if you've been there before - this is the one book I recommend you have with you. You'll need to engage your common sense, but you'll probably have a much more fulfilling trip from the insights and tips this book provides."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have been to Maui 3 times with this book. I would say it's one of the most helpful travel books I've ever bought, and I have a shelf full of them. The detailed descriptions of Maui's beaches are especially good. It's organized in a way that we had an easy time finding the information we were looking for, whether it was a snorkel spot in South Maui or a good family restaurant in Kihei. However, I did have one big problem with this book: in an attempt to \\"reveal\\" Maui, the author encourages people to tramp around where there are no trails, walk past \\"No Trespassing\\" signs, etc. We visited some of the sights in the book that were off the beated path, and to tell the truth it wasn't really worth it. Maui is so wonderful that the places that are well served by roads and trails are just as spectacular as those that are in more primitive and well-preserved areas. And any place described in this book won't be deserted. In other words, you can swim under a waterfall, find great snorkeling, and lounge in natural pools without walking past dozens of \\"No Trespassing\\" signs, treking a mile over rough lava, or scampering 500 feet down slippery wet rocks. For your own convenience and the health of the island, I would skip \\"Fishbowl,\\" \\"The Olivine Pools,\\" and \\"The Blue Pool.\\"These reservations aside, I loved the book. The writing style is colorful, personal, and amusing. I disagreed with some of the restaurant reviews (hated Cheeseburgers in Paradise, thought Stella Blues was great), and some of the activity companies that the author was lukewarm about I thought were excellent. If your are going to spend thousands of dollars going to Maui, learn something about it. Buy this book and a couple more, and do some research on the Internet."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have never been moved to write a review before but this book is totally amazing!! I have been to Maui several times and I find this book more accurate and honest than any other. I had also purchased 3 other books and they are currently on a shelf. After reading them, I have gone back to Maui Revealed every time. My husband and I are planning to spend our 25th anniversary in Maui February 2008."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Oh, yeah. This is the book to get. If you are going to visit Maui you need no other guide book, and everything you need for a great exploration of this exquisite island is right here. One problem with Maui is that almost nothing is marked--stream names, the location of waterfalls, great beaches. Without this book my wife and I would have found only a fraction of the fantastic places we discovered on our recent trip. I know that many who live in Maui would like to keep the tourists confined to the resorts and the shops, but that is unfair. Maui is a national treasure, and Andrew Doughty unlocks it with his very specific directions on how to get to just about everywhere. This is a travel guide as all guides should be written--opinionated, witty, fun to read,comprehensive, and designed for both the beach-bumming sun worshiper and the intrepid backwoods explorer. Buy Maui Revealed. It sets the standard."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the guide I used for my trips to Maui, without a doubt the best book. I have used it for two trips and will be using it for a 3rd next year. When I first went to Maui, I bought this book along with the Frommers book, both were nice, but Maui Revealed was much better with details. Had better pictures, and the way it guides you around Hana Highway is very tough to beat. Highly recommend this book for the Maui traveler."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is a lifesaver when traveling in Maui. We used it daily and found it so helpful in making decisions and visiting locations. It's written so well and is almost like talking to a friend about the best places to see on the island. I also highly recommend the book about Kauai by the same author. I believe it's called \\"The Ultimate Kauai.\\" You MUST have it if you plan on visiting!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is extremely well-written & organized, and it was very helpful. All the color pictures & maps were a big plus, and I believe the travel agents & locals who said it was the best guidebook available. However, the authors failed to provide a caveat: some excursions are best suited to very active people unencumbered by kids or seniors who aren't uptight about crossing other people's land to get to the best hikes or waterfalls. By the 3rd day, after the drive to Hana, we were jokingly calling the book \\"Maui for Swinging Singles.\\" We enjoyed the sights & the Hana drive was well-worth the time, but spending several hours on a winding road with kids who would rather be back at the beach or pool is not reviewed in the book. When we drove to Haleakala (also a beautiful change of scenery), we had it figured out & left the 3 youngest kids back at the condo with a willing adult.The authors do a fabulous job of outlining the huge number of activities available, and I'd love to go back someday & get some hiking in when the kids are older. But in the quest to get the most from your vacation, I think it bears remembering that it is perfectly okay to lay on the beach and do nothing. Our favorite days were just hanging out on the beach by the condo, going in the ocean with the kids, watching them make sand castles, and snorkeling on the reef right there. The one time we tried to drive to a recommended snorkeling area, we couldn't figure out how to get in the water over all the rocks, and with an 11-year-old in tow, headed straight back for our home reef. This is Hawaii, and the beautiful warm, blue waters & clean white sand studded with palm trees are pretty nice without the compulsion to experience every single thing the island has to offer."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just got back from a Maui vacation and I cannot say enough about this book! Our group of four had quite a few Maui travel books, but ended up only using this one. Very informative and humorous. It was especially helpful on the road to Hana."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I head to Maui annually and this book is our go-to guide every time. We loan it to friends heading to Maui and periodically buy the newer editions. The practical and common sense approach to travel info works well for us. We especially use it for tips on beaches and snorkeling spots since that's a primary focus of our time in Maui. The online updates and additional travel info provided by their website is a definite bonus and has been helpful when reviewing condo options and checking for changes in hiking trail access, etc. I recommend this guide book over any other and encourage Maui travelers to use this for planning their time - you'll learn about opportunities you may otherwise miss."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I don't think this book has any real competition from other books. My Maui Trailblazer had some supplementary and detailed info on places like Iao Valley, but it came nowhere close to this book in useful coverage of big and little sights to see and why you would want to see them.The restaurant section alone is worth the price of the book. We went to five restaurants with an ono rating on Maui and Oahu and everyone was outstanding. I must say the bakeries the book recommended on Maui were absolutely pitiful, though.The author tells you what you need to know to prepare for your Hawaii vacation and has strong opinions on what to see and do, including where to hike and snorkel and the best beaches. You're time in Maui is extremely valuable, because even if you're staying two weeks, you can only do so much. I bought my book a month in advance of the trip and I'm glad I did, because it takes a while to read and absorb the information. Of course you'll have to plan earlier than that for flight, places to stay, etc. The book is easy to read and entertaining and has many color photos to backup their descriptions and put them in perspective. There is also good coverage of offshore islands of Molokai, Lanai, and Molokini.I didn't agree with everything in the book. I have a fair amount of company when I say that Molokini is a pitiful place to snorkel. There are very few fish here. The book recommends many excellent snorkel spots, including Hulopoe Beach on Lanai, which had lots of fish, including schools. You might want to backup their opinions on some activities with the tripadvisor website, which has many visitors' opinions on popular attractions.The complaints I have about the book are actually very minor. It was extremely helpful in extracting the most out of my week on Maui. It's a must have."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"All quide books should be this informative. The writer takes no payoffs, but he does take his own trips and photos. This book has been highly recommended by others and I want to add my endorsement to the list."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I had previously used the Big Island Revealed and Kauai Revealed books, so you can tell I'm a fan of this series. (Interestingly, the Maui version is one third thicker than either of the other two.) They are all beautifully laid out and presented, with good maps, a full range of suggested activities, and a helpful system of graphic icons to indicate Real Gems (can't miss sights, hotels, beaches, etc.) and Solid Gold Values (hotels that offer the most value). Unlike some guidebooks, this one isn't afraid to tell you what to avoid as well as what not to miss. The condo recommendations on the accompanying website (there's a password and link included in the hotel section of the book) alone were more than worth the price of the book. (I stayed at the Kihei Surfside, and found it exactly as promised.)The section on beaches in South Maui seemed very well researched and well-documented in terms of how to find them. Another thing I like about this series is that the author is an active scuba diver and provides recommendations for dive operators as well as diving and snorkeling sites. (I dived with Prodiver out of Kihei, and also found them just as described -- highly recommended.)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was so useful when I last visited Maui that I didn't hesitate to buy the newest edition for my upcoming trip. It is chock full of great information and gives the real scoop on a lot of restaurants, tours and adventures. Don't leave home with out it if you are going to Maui!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"After looking at many guidebooks, it was an easy decision to purchase this one. Unlike most others, it is full of many full color pictures that complement the clear descriptions. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We just got back from Maui and found Maui Revealed to be right on with repects to sites and restaurants (the items we used most).The descriptions of the road to Hana were also very good.I would highly recommend if traveling to this island."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My wife and I just returned from 10 days in Maui. We used this book to plan much of our trip and used it extensively while we were there to choose activities and restaurants, especially. We found the books recommendations and cautions to be exactly on the mark.This book has something very rare in a travel guidebook - high standards. So many guidebooks out there are really just advertizing for the businesses they promote. Not so with this book. The author has high standards for what he recommends and, in our experience, his judgements are correct. Not all recommended businesses are the most expensive. In fact, Doughty take a number of expensive restaurants to task for not delivering value.We liked the comprehensive nature of this guidebook - he covers hiking trails, drives, restaurants, dive operators, snorkeling spots, beaches, whale watching, etc. The only category he doesn't cover thoroughly is accommodations - which would make the book too long.We also like the humorous writing style employed. We actually had a few occasions to laugh out loud.We did have a couple other guidebooks. In particular, Maui Trailblazer is a good good to hiking in Maui, but Maui Revealed is the best overall guide to Maui we have seen."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is by far the most widely-read Maui guidebook on the market, and one reason for it's popularity is the many \\"secret\\" places that the writers claim to have discovered and are \\"revealing\\" to their readers. The problem is that many of these \\"secret\\" places are actually on private property!! Maui Revealed blithely recommends that visitors ignore 'no trespassing\\" signs and follow trails that lead to \\"secret\\" waterfalls and \\"hidden\\" pools. If you take this advice, be prepared to encounter irrate locals, some of them large, intoxicated Hawaiians, who are totally fed up with chasing tourists off their land. Furthermore, many Maui residents don't want to mar the beauty of their island with neon-colored \\"Keep Out\\" signs and barbed wire fences, so much private land is not obvious as such. Bottom line, if you're not completely sure it's ok to go somewhere, don't do it, despite the fact that \\"Maui Revealed\\" has recommended the place. Having said all this, \\"Maui Revealed\\" is an excellent, easy to read, and very helpful guide to Maui. It's too bad the writers have decided to disregard local folks privaTE property rights, because Maui Revealed is an excellent book in every other way, and Maui has many wonderfuland uncrowded places for visitors without Maui Revealed encouraging them to trespass."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just got back from Maui, and had little time to prepare for the trip, so had asked friends, &#34;What guidebook do I take?&#34; They all recommended this book. After 10 days in Maui, I can appreciate some of the candid comments on cleanliness of beaches, but I can't recommend this book very highly for the following reasons:1) Organization. My own way of travel means that I like to flip to a section of the book that addresses the area I'm in, and learn everything I need to know about that section RIGHT THERE. This book splits things into categories such as hiking, beaches, dining, etc. This means I have to flip to four or five different sections just to find out what's going on in this area. Very frustrating. I got really sick of going to the back to look up my location (in the unfamiliar Hawai'ian names) and find 6 different pages that might tell me what I'm looking for. The organization really did not work for me at all.2) Narrative method of info delivery. When I use a guidebook, I don't want to have to scan critical information from what essentially is a witty little essay. I really struggled to find a consistent way to discern how to get to these places, where to park, how long the hike was, what to expect when I get there, etc. Sometimes, this info would be at the top of the section, and sometimes, it would be sprinkled throughout, and sometimes it wouldn't be there at all, and I would have to read 10 pages of info to find out one tiny bit I needed. Sometimes it would say, &#34;turn to p. XX for info on hiking&#34; and sometimes, it would just leave me to my own devices. Very frustrating.3) can't figure out the dining section. You read about the type of food first, then the street name, and after his description of it, you finally get the town it's in. Weird. And not sure what ranks as good food or service, since many good places we discovered were not in there, and several recommendations were pretty feeble despite good reviews. No description of cost beyond &#34;pricey&#34; or &#34;sort of cheap&#34; and no consistency. For example, you'd think Kahului had no restaurants at all, when we found a couple that would have been great to include.4) unclear as to safety of areas recommended. What is absolutely not covered at all in this book is that everything really cool that you wanna go see in Maui is accessible by a twisty, narrow road that is shared by crazy drivers AND pedestrians. You are more likely to be injured by a driver than a wave on Maui. For example, he mentions that the road to Jaws really should be driven by 4WDs, but doesn't mention that pedestrians use it too, so you've got vehicles, children, and adults navigating sticky, slippery mud together for over one mile.I wish I'd spent the time looking for a guidebook that was better organized for my trip - lesson learned."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I feel it is a good resource, but not the best resource there. You could get similar information on things-to-do, eat and where to stay from other resources, like trip advisor, but this book has all this information in one place. I used this book as well as trip advisor to plan my trip. The book expresses the author's opinion and experience on various topics and it may not hold true for you and you might want to experience it for yourself. For restaurant reviews, I'd also consider Yelp in addition to what has been reviewed in this book. I think for the cost of book, it is a good investment. I'd rate this book 3 1/2 stars if AMZN had given me the option."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"A few years ago we went to Kauai and bought the same book for Kauai so I knew this one would be a winner -- and we weren't disappointed at all. Lots and lots of info!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is fun to read, as the author has a nice, breezy, humorous style. The author is not afraid to be brutally honest when he finds an attraction or restaurant that is sub-par. However, unless you are an outdoor fanatic, take his hiking descriptions with a grain of salt. What is an easy jaunt for him may not be a easy walk for you. We also found incorrect information in the book about Waipoli Road (to the redwood forest on Haleakala). The author states that regular passenger cars can go there, but after driving several miles on a steep extremely twisty narrow road we came to a sign posted by the State of Hawaii that said \\"four-wheel drive vehicles only.\\" (It would have been nice if they had posted it at the bottom of the hill..) Being that we were up the side of the mountain in a low-slung rental car without another single soul around, and probably out of cell phone range to boot, we decided to believe the sign and turned around. It was a beautiful drive, by the way, but don't go there unless you have a jeep. Also keep in mind that the cattle on the hill are not in the least afraid of cars, and will blithely walk right into the road in front of you without hesitating a bit. This is a good book, but does encourage people to go places that they probably shouldn't."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone visiting Maui.Its well written with lots of very useful maps and tips.It covers almost everything you would want to do on Maui.Excellent/unbiased reviews of many tourist related businesses.Read the book, plan your trip and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"One of the best all-around guides for Maui.

Helped us find several nice beaches and hidden spots that we'd have never discovered otherwise. Not sure I like how they seemingly encourage travelers to trespass in several places - we avoided those spots. Only real complaint was the lack of detail on certain parts of Maui, like the road to hana. The maps for that drive however were superb, best I've ever seen. Ultimately this is a fantastic drive for Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Was not clear that the edition I was purchasing was the third edition and the book is now up to the 5th edition.

We were only able to spend a few days outside of Lahaina. Ka'anapali Shores Hotel was an affordable and comfortable place to crash. Java Jazz/Soup Nutz was perfect for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Beaches were beautiful. Everyone...and I mean EVERYONE was friendly. You won't regret your stay on the island. Even the airport was tranquil. Take plenty of pictures. Such a different experience from Oahu (both were great, but Maui is the best). Sugarcane fields, winding beachfront drives, crystal-clear waters. No other place like it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I had a couple people tell me about this book when they heard we were going to Maui.

They are without a doubt the best most up to date and informative guide books of any publisher. The only negative I can say is that the books are so popular with visitors that they almost single handedly influence visitor traffic to interesting spots. If you are planning your vacation, the specific book for you Island is a must read. Also, the lodging info is very helpful. Wizard Pub also supplements the book info with info on their website for lodging. This info is also very helpful. [...] I would check out their website first to take a look at the hotel and condo info."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The most redeeming quality of this book is its brutal honesty in the information it provides and recommendations it makes. When something sucks, the book says it sucks and to avoid it. That's the kind of information I want when I know my time and money are at stake on a vacation.Web reviews of hotels and condos are free on their website and they are short, candid and informative (if a place is bad, they say it's bad). They also provide an aerial photograph of the property that really lets you know what you're getting--which is worth the price of the book itself.Road maps are outstanding and directions are good for the most part. Occasionally directions are a bit vague, but it's still better than any map you will find anywhere else. The real value comes from the stuff that you won't find in other guidebooks like backwoods hiking trails, little known spots off the main path and insights that come from the fact that the authors actually live in Hawaii. The chapters are well organized and information is easily found thanks to a detailed table of contents, color-coded chapters (tabs would have been better, but probably more expensive) and index. Related info is cross-referenced throughout the book, which is also helpful. Best of all, the book is small and easily carried wherever you decide to go.Perhaps the only negative aspect of the book is that the authors do tend to get lost in their narrative at times--mixing collateral trivia with the guide information. It's a nice story, but at times I could have done without the extra stuff.This book is truly and outstanding guidebook for all types of tourists, but is especially valuable for those kind of people that hate guided tours and prepackaged vacation experiences. It adds a sense of adventure to your trip and a satisfying feeling when you realize that your time and money were spent on your own terms."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui Revealed is a very informative, easy to read guide book.

Problem is, everyone reads these books so the secrets aren't very secret anymore. Only downside to these books is they don't go into great detail on lodging accommodations for the budget minded traveler. They touch on it, but there's so many more neat places you can stay on the islands without breaking the bank, a simple web search will turn up plenty of results, though some of the reviews are hard to trust.

If you read enough of them, you'll get a good feel for the place in question. (ASIDE: Both times we went, we rented a private home for part of our trip.

They also share a great, concise overview of Hawaiian history, which you can read in the Kindle preview.We packed four (heavy) guidebooks from major publishers, but soon found ourselves relying overwhelmingly on a borrowed copy of this book. It proved savvier and more trustworthy.The authors have lived for decades on Maui, Kaui, and the Big Island, so they know details that elude parachute travel writers. They also communicate brilliantly -- clearly, wittily, and with a distinctive voice.If you ever wished Rick Steves wrote South Pacific guidebooks: these folks are like Rick Steves on steroids. They offer you more options than other guidebooks, but also much better prioritization.Where Lonely Planet's multiple authors will collectively insist you must visit every nook and cranny, Doughty et al. will tell you candidly: \\"If your time is limited, be sure to see A, C, and F. But it's OK to save B, D, and E for a return visit; they can be redundant.\\"Also refreshing: these folks skip nutty florid hype (no \\"...delights to last a lifetime...,\\" yadda yadda). They simply take it for granted that you're visiting paradise, and help you maximize your scarce time there.Three particular time-savers: Lots of great color photos (averaging one per page), which help you quickly choose your own must-see attractions. Large color maps that are brilliantly selective -- adding important details that standard maps omit, while stripping out unneeded distractions. Finally, the book is rigorously organized by region. This minimizes redundancy and annoying page flips back and forth.The only shortcoming is limited coverage of accommodations. So you should supplement this with another guidebook that includes more lodgings info.As boho/budget travelers, we were surprised that our 2nd choice was Frommer's Maui. It includes itineraries, and some nice prioritization (like island-wide and regional lists of best hotels, B&B;'s, and beaches). But it's fussily bound, and burdened by internal redundancy.LP's \\"Discover Maui\\" has lots of photos, and some unique info., but its assertions and advice often proved flat wrong. \\"Hidden Hawaii\\" has great lodging info., but limited maps, no photos, and confusing geographic organization.Finally, LP's \\"Hawaii\\" (all-islands) book is great to consult in advance for hotel reservations, but we never opened it in Maui. It's bulky and heavy, and hides essentials like itineraries. (Its Kindle edition eliminates bulk and weight, but -- at least on 6\\" B+W Kindles -- it's awfully rendered, with unreadable maps.)Finally: If this edition still recommends the gorgeous Blue Pool waterfall (near Hana) -- that's now closed to public access. Bummer. Enjoy the rest of the island!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I just love this book. It is wonderful to plot out our January trip to Maui ahead of time.

Just used this book last week on my trip to Hawaii...."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Well, this used to be the best book out there...no doubt...but after being in the hands of hundreds of thousands of people for a decade, nothing in here is a secret, by far.Google \\"smartmaui\\", a good (free) online reference we use (disclosure: I write for it.)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I've been reading Maui Revealed since the 2nd edition. There are plenty of useful maps, it's well organized and easy to browse and read, colorful with pleasing typography and many photos, and the author's writing style is informal. There's typically little difference between editions, so no need to upgrade if you're only 1 edition out of date. I don't rely on this book for restaurant, activity or hotel advice. In the age of online reviews it really doesn't make sense to listen to a single opinion in that regard. We often travel with kids and grandparents and I need those perspectives too, especially for activities. Instead I rely on urbanspoon for restaurant advice, and tripadvisor for activity and hotel information.I recommend this book to friends but nowadays tell them to read with caution. The author does well to build your trust in the book. He explains how well he knows the island, how hard he works on the book, and how residents and businesses are at odds with him for \\"revealing\\" what he does. The tendency is to trust him implicitly with everything he says because you feel like he's trying to help you have a great vacation. The danger here is that you defer to his guidance on activities that require caution, and there are many cases where he has a somewhat cavalier attitude.For example, he highly recommends ultra light flights and goes on about how safe they are. If you're in the industry you know that they're actually quite dangerous. He talks about several sites that require going over private property, which I think readers interpret as \\"the land owner doesn't care that's why he's telling us.\\"One example that really stands out is his description of the Nakalele blowhole. He has a full page picture of a couple embracing 20 ft from the blowhole as water jets over them. It looks amazing and so exciting. His only warning: \\"there's no guardrail to stop you from shrinking the gene pool should you use bad judgment and fall into the hole....get as close as common sense dictates.\\" If you look up this attraction on Youtube you'll see why this place can be so dangerous although it's not entirely obvious, especially if you don't understand the ocean. That's where the Guide book author should step in. The blowhole is given the \\"real gem\\" stamp and listed as \\"the best place to see the ocean explode\\" and \\"the best hike\\" in West Maui, so I'm sure it gets plenty of tourists.So that's the whole point of my review. It's important to use your personal judgment and take responsibility for the safety of your family, and do some extra research about an attraction when needed. We used an iphone app (Maui gps tour guide) on our last trip that did a good job of providing warnings. Perhaps the best thing you can do is talk to island residents at every opportunity.Speaking of apps, you may be wondering what the difference is between the book and the Maui revealed App. It appears to mirror the book exactly, and add hotel information from the book's website. There are additional photos too but they're small for some reason. If you've never been to Maui the book is the better choice. It's much easier to read and browse through to find information. The App allows you to search for things, but it's out of context, in that it only shows the specific thing you looked for - you can't see the \\"pages\\" before or after the excerpt, and in the book those pages often give information relating to what you're looking for. For seasoned Maui travelers, the App is probably all you need, to look up odds and ends.I haven't tried the Kindle version but this is an example of a book that you need in paper form so that you can page through quickly, and cross reference with maps. Not to mention the photos..."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I found this guide useful for planning my trip before I left home, mostly because it includes several pictures and fairly good maps. I used it to make a prioritized itinerary for the road to Hana---which stops to make, which hikes to go on, etc. We only had one day for the road to Hana, so we could not make every stop. I thought the guide did a pretty decent job of sorting out the mundane sites from the must see. The maps for the road to Hana are also very useful. We returned from Hana via the South road at night. It was no problem at all. It was certainly more fun than turning around and going back the way we came. The road is a lot less winding, which was nice. It does go up and down a lot, though. There was nothing wrong with the road at all, but you do need to watch out for the cows. There are signs warning you when you get to cattle country. The cow crossings are kind of a give away too. FYI, we made the trip in an economy car.I am in debt to Maui Revealed for its recommendation to see Warren & Annabelle's, which was great. I would recommend, however, that anyone going to see this hilarious show should go late. An hour and a half killing time and eating snacks before the show was a drag. I suppose the wait might be more entertaining if you plan to get drunk.When we actually got to Maui, we used Lonely Planet's guide almost exclusively. We started with Maui Revealed, but then we found that Lonely Planet's instructions were considerably more useful than those in Maui Revealed. In fact, with the exception of the road to Hana, the Lonely Planet guide was far superior for everything.I would recommend getting both guides if you have never been to Maui before. If this is not your first trip and you do not plan to go to Hana, skip Maui Revealed entirely. It simply does not have enough substance to be worth the time reading it. The \\"revelations\\" in the book are all regular tourist destinations that appear to have been visited for at least a hundres years. You will never be alone. Everyone has Maui Revealed on their back seat or in their hand. The recommended restaurants are over priced. I had to laugh when I saw long lines of people waiting to get into a hamburger joint or a local dive for lunch. I would suggest trying the restaurants NOT listed in Maui Revealed. I think you will get food that is just as good and avoid rediculous lines. Best meal we had on Maui? Maui Tacos on our Lanai at sunset. Cheap, great food, and our lanai had a better view than any restaurant we saw! Perhaps Maui Revealed mentions Maui Tacos. I wouldn't know. I got the tip from Lonely Planet.About the 3rd edition of Maui Revealed, I checked out the 2nd edition from the library and read it cover to cover. I then ordered the 3rd edition online from Amazon. After a page-by-page comparison, I was shocked to find that the only difference seems to be that a couple of pictures were changed. This is the saddest \\"update\\" I have ever seen in a travel guide. Buy the 2nd edition if you can get it cheap.Lastly, we saw several signs with messages like, \\"Contrary to Maui Revealed,please respect our rights. This is private property.\\""},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was excellent. We loved exploring some of the hidden sights, such as the olivine pools and secluded waterfalls. Based on information from this book and my recent vacation in Maui, here are some of my personal recommendations:-Definitely do a loop when driving to Hana. Take the regular \\"road to Hana\\" to get there and take the back road along the south part of Maui for the drive back. The back road is not bad at all. It has very few unpaved sections and they are well groomed. A 2WD car can easily do it. The back road will offer different views including tons of lava rock. It is important to note that the \\"road to Hana\\" is about the journey not the destination. Stop at waterfalls along the way and scenic overlooks. We left at 6am and didn't get back until after 7pm. There is so much to do along the way.-On the road to Hana, take a short detour down Nahiku Road as suggested in the book. Keep driving until you get to the end, which is when you reach the ocean. The view is amazing.-Do not miss the 400ft Waimoku waterfall at Oheo Gulch. The 2 mile hike each way is well worth it.-Haleakala at sunset is awesome, especially if you do not want to wake up at 3am and deal with the crowds for sunrise. There were very few people at the summit for sunset and we watched the sun set over clouds which was awesome (a ring of clouds almost always forms partway up the mountain, but the summit is usually clear). We stayed to look at the stars once it got dark... we saw a ton of stars!-Kula Lodge restaurant on the way to Haleakala has great views, but go for lunch because dinner is very expensive.-The redwood forest hike in Polipoli state park was awesome, however the drive was terrible. 4 miles of bumpy, unkept dirt road. I would recommend an SUV for driving this road.-Definitely stop at Julia's, as listed in the book, when driving around the west/north side of Maui. The banana bread is awesome but so are the coconut candies, dried mango and taro chips.-The book lists a hiking/snorkeling adventure at La Perouse in south Maui, however when we attempted to do this we saw lots of off-limits signs posted by the government, saying you can't walk in that entire area until July 2010. So instead we snorkeled at the nearby \\"Dumps,\\" which was awesome.-Food recommendations... Ululani's Shaved Ice in Lahaina and Flatbread Company in Paia."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have been buying these guide books since they first were published. They are, by far, the very best. More authors of travel guides should take this approach when reviewing tourist spots. The turn by turn travel directions, along with witty commentary - well, you can't go wrong. Maps are detailed and accurate. Both places that are must-do's, as well as probably-not-worth-it, are covered. Any activity you could ever want to try is reviewed. Food recommendations are spot-on. I have these guide books for several of the islands, and I always buy a new edition before I go since things can change quickly in Hawaii. Don't go to Hawaii without one!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just returned from a seven day trip to Maui. Loved it. The \\"blue book\\" was our hilarious companion the entire time. If you are a fan of learning the history of places, this is the book for you. It truly speaks from a local perspective and provides loads of historical context about each location.A few comments/suggestions:-Be forewarned, every \\"secret\\" hike and snorkel spot in this book will be packed full of tourists. I guess that's what happens when you publish the #1 guidebook for a top vacation destination. It's been revealed already!-The author is an adventuresome person! His hikes were way out of our league in the scary/difficult department (I'm an in-shape 28 year old). I would go elsewhere to find hike suggestions, especially along Hana Highway.-His restaurant recommendations were solid picks. Some of our favorite places included: Bubba Gump's, Cool Cat Cafe, Da Kitchen, Paia Fish Market.-His beach suggestions were solid picks. Big Beach, Black Sand Beach, and Kama'ole beaches were some of our favs.-Choose your own adventures! Some of my favorite moments of the trip is when we were looking for one of his recommendations, yet stumbled upon a different (often less crowded) beach, etc.Enjoy Maui, it's a gem!Aloha"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This was the first of the Revealed guidebooks that we've owned back in 2002. And from that first usage of the book, we were blown away by how candid its reviews were and how it seemed to present every nook and cranny of the island.We consulted it for local restaurants, dinner splurges, and most (if not all) of Maui's reasonably accessible waterfalls (including the Blue Pool, Waihe'e Valley, 'Ohe'o Gulch, etc).We liked this book so much that we bought all the other Revealed guidebooks for each of the other main Hawaiian Islands.Fast forward 5 years (and several trips to all the Hawaiian Islands)...The Blue Pool - closed due to unhappy residents lamenting the traffic; Upper Puohokamoa Falls - access closed due owner's fear of slip-and-fall lawsuit; Venus Pool - kapu due to trespassing; Waihe'e Valley - closed to public except for Eco-Maui tours; Proliferation of No Trespassing signs everywhere...That's when we realized that while this book tells you everything you want to hear with the attitude and spunk that we can appreciate, it's problematic in that it has resulted in (thanks to its popularity) increased cases of trespassing, closures from frivolous slip-and-fall lawsuits, deaths from following their \\"Adventures\\", a tourism economy dependent on reviews from this book (e.g. you can expect higher prices if they got an Ono rating and closures if they got bad reviews), and overexposure/high impacts to fragile and endangered habitats.I think it's sad that more and more parts of Maui (as well as other islands) have lost their spirit of Aloha, and I suspect this book's well-deserved popularity has something to do with it.But even with all that said, my wife and I still consult this book because we feel we're getting good advice from a kama'aina (long time resident). It just shows how useful this book is despite the problems it's causing. But I sense it's starting to become a victim of its own success and the island is becoming a far different place than the paradise that was originally envisioned and communicated by the book when we first used it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just returned from Maui. Many items are accurate but the book has some major misses as far as restaurant and entertainment recommendations. Use care."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I've visited Maui a number of times, and I think this is a fine guidebook to the island. It has plenty of excellent maps and some great photos as well. Yes, quite a few other people have this book, so if you try to see some of the sites it recommends, you will not be alone. And yes, some of the places it mentions used to be known mostly by the locals, not the tourists, but that is no reason for keeping information about the place a secret.There's plenty of good advice on places to stay, places to eat, beaches, and much more. One excellent (roughly 40-page) section is on the road to Hana, and there's plenty of useful material here. Without this book, I wouldn't have known how to get to Nahiku (although in retrospect, I don't think it is quite as special as the book implies). Nor would I have known how to get to the Blue Pool (about a mile West of the turnoff for Wai'anapanapa, you will find 'Ula'ino road, which you take West for about three miles. You'll have to scramble over some rocks, so it's better to wear tennis shoes, not sandals). The Blue Pool, with its gorgeous waterfall, is a nice highlight of the Hana drive, but as this book shows, there are plenty of other waterfalls which are right by the side of the Hana highway.I recommend this guidebook."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We just went on a trip to Maui and used this guidebook as our reference. It's the best thing you can use for your planning, and in our eyes it gives you sites that no one else unless you know some informative locals will give you. Our friends who are out there frequently were amazed at the things we saw through this book that they never heard off.Just to start off though take their advice on stopping at Costco. It will save you quite a bit of your hard earned money to spend somewhere else on Maui and trust us. You will spend it. In fact, one local told us they pay more for things grown and made on the island than when they visit the mainland US. That tells me this place is definitely for the tourist but it's a great vacation destination expensive and well worth it.Now back to the book, The Road to Hana is a good trip but if you get seasick or even get a touch of motion sickness don't go unless you take something. I don't get any of the aforemention afflictions but my future wife was literally wilting in the seat next to me from all the winding turns and narrow bridges. We also suggest a packed lunch and plenty of drinks for the ride. There's a neat eclectic grocery store in Pa'ia right off the main street with good sandwiches. Grab your food and drinks to picnic at one of the secluded waterfalls and enjoy. Finishing up on the Hana trip, you can definitely take your rental vehicle all the way through Hana and back down and around again. The road is bumpy but we didn't find it a problem. Just don't go crashing off the side of the road into a ditch!As for accomodations, we suggest if you like to eat at the restaurants and want a little something less than quiet stay somewhere near Lahaina or Ka'anapali (Definitely grab a burger at Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina). There's a ton to do around there whereas other more secluded parts of the island do not offer you the same choices in entertainment and dining. Last but not least, take in a nice sunset at a beachside restaurant. We recommend Leilani's On The Beach. It's at Whalers Village in Ka'anapali. The food is good and the view is better! Have fun!!PS... Try a surfing lesson. We had a blast, and Goofy Foot Surf School had some really good teachers. They guarantee you'll stand up at least once or you will not get out of the water.

Simply put - if you're going to visit any of the Hawaiian islands, this is the one book you want to have. The authors are honest and fair - no fluff. They tell what's worth seeing and what's not. They actually seem to spend a considerable amount of time eating at the different restaurants, doing the different activities and they write what they experienced themselves.They talk about activities and provide context to the point where you can decide if something is going to work for you or not.They recommended the Warren and Annabelle magic show in Lahaina, something that we normally wouldn't go to. But it was fantastic and their description of it, without giving away too much, was right on the money.The beach and snorkel spot ratings are super-accurate.bottom line - if you want to spend your precious vacation time doing the really great things at the best places, this book is a must-have."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is a must if you're planning a trip to Maui.

Whenever I struck out on my own to a beach, site, or restaurant, or followed a recommendation from another source, I was let down because the choice never matched the outstanding quality of recommendations in this book.Time after time, we found great local restaurants, exciting local shops, great things to do, and terrific places to visit based on this book (and based on the companion Big Island book as well). Having GPS coordinates for some of the destinations was especially helpful (yes, you should bring your GPS).Of all the resources available for my trip, including Trip Advisor and many tourist guides, this book was easily the best. I could have saved a lot of time by using ONLY this book, and I really should have paid attention when the authors suggested a 4 wheel drive on the Big Island and a convertible on Maui (Unfortunately, I did the reverse)."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"being from hawaii i was a bit wweary of this book, but after using this book it was very helpful in finding some of the out of the way places. i was not very impressed in the restaurant guides though. we tried some fo the places and found them lacking in good local type food. we got better results talking to the local boys for they're reccommendations. also if the book says enter at your own risk but it would probably be alright don't go there. they are kapu( hawaiian heritage sacred land and the locals get very angry about ignoring no trespassing(kapu) signs."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"So we are still in Maui, and planned our trip mostly around the sights listed in this book. Overall, I am finding it very informative; however, I am sad to say that a lot of the snorkeling sights in the South Maui portion (atleast) are now closed according to the Park Rangers. We went to explore Fish Bowl and the Aquarium this morning to be greeted by park rangers telling us that both areas were closed and that we would be arrested if we went there. We still had an unbelievable hike in the area, but the snorkeling was non-existent for the most part. As we were leaving, I saw a different ranger in the parking lot and asked him why the \\"Fishbowl\\" and \\"Aquarium\\" were closed? He first corrected me that those were not the right names for those areas (I am not going to try and pronounce their proper names), and then proceeded to tell me that the book \\"Maui Revealed\\" was disturbing the natural beauty of this island and the rest of Hawaii. He said that if we were caught snorkeling there, we would be arrested. He told me that the authors were \\"purely money hungry\\" and \\"not interested in preserving the island\\". We did not want to test it, but I could certainly tell that this was a pride issue and stirring up a lot of debate in that area. The roads are tiny, and certainly not supposed to handle the amount of traffic that now exists (because of this book according to the Ranger).The bottom line is that we are finding the book very informative (I would not ask for a refund at this point), but be careful with some of the more adventurous recommendations as it is clear the park rangers now have copies of this book and are making it their job to intimidate the main-landers who are following the recommendations. We were really disappointed that we could not get to experience these large snorkeling areas. I would love for the authors to respond, and maybe update the people who bought this book on areas that are now closed to the public..

If anyone else has experienced similar issues, can you please respond to this?????"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This series of Hawaiian travel books is by far the best ever! His brief history of Hawaii is the best, most interesting, and most thorough I've ever seen in so few pages.Highly informative, accurate, well-illustrated, a pleasure to read, and filled with up-to-date information, much of which is not found elsewhere. Icing on the cake. Road information is very helpful. Restaurant descriptions are right on.One of the few travel books I actually read cover-to-cover.Get them all if you visit Hawaii!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"A couple years ago my husband and I purchased this same book for our trip to Kauai. We didn't go anywhere without it. It has everthing you will possible need. Food, prices, beaches, secret trails, maps, etc. Planning our trip this year to Maui and had to have this book. I have already used it for booking our hotel stay. I am currently working on planning our activities now. Would definitely recommend for anyone going to Maui or any Hawaii island."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have found this to be best guidebook for Maui. The only issue, as other have indicated, is that some of the best local places are no longer secret...but one can't really fault this guidebook for that..."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a must read guide for exploring the island of Maui. Everything stated has been vetted and it true."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have three other Maui guidebooks and this is the best of the bunch. It is very thorough and frank on reviews. You can tell that the writers actually spend a great deal of time on the island. Only problem is that word has gotten out that this is the guidebook to get so everyone has it. Those secret little places aren't so secret anymore."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"this book is so worth having if you are traveling to maui. Its a must. The road to Hana info was invaluable. It kept us from wasting our time looking at small waterfalls."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Great guidebook! Very detailed local knowledge. It never steered us wrong, and it had a lot of things that we never would have found without it.We had also bought a Fodor's guide to Hawaii. It's a little unfair to compare a book that covers the entire state to one that can focus on one island, but we definitely found this one more useful."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased this book after being overwhelmed trying to weed through websites, recommendations, etc. of what to do, see and eat while on our first trip to Maui. The book was written by someone who lived on Maui for 2 years exploring and experiencing everything Maui has to offer. For a guide book it's interesting, humorous and pleasant to read. I love how the introduction to each region or site has a small history lesson (or legend). If you're headed to Maui, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This Maui Revealed guidebook has everything you need to know! It's written with the first-time visitor in mind by someone who lives there & knows how to get around! We started reading before we traveled, and referred to it every day we were there."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We bought this book on our first trip to Maui some years ago and use it very time we return. I realized I had left it behind earlier this year (after we were already on our way) and ordered a new copy to meet us there. Once we were in Maui I realized I could get a copy for my iPhone, so I did that and enjoy having both versions available.If I had to pick only one, I would lose the hard copy and stick with the iPhone version. The iPhone version has features that the hard copy book does not and cannot have. I can search, mark favorites, get updates (so far at no charge) and find stuff fast.One gotcha... I subsequently bought an iPad that I love, but the book does not display well on it. The view is not optimized for the iPad and so all one can see is the same as the iPhone, just a whole lot bigger."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I found this book to be excellent during a recent week long trip to Maui.Positives:- Good maps- Good breakdown of Maui regions- Discussion includes not only things to see but things to avoid which is relatively uncommon (\\"This restaurant is not mentioned in the book. Is it because it's bad or because they didn't bother?\\")- The book has a general no-nonsense tone: it does not fawn at everything on Maui and it manages to balance good and bad things quite well.- It really shines in the adventures department. It has very detailed directions for finding trails, lookouts etc. Many of these are not marked and so the directions at the level of detail of \\"cross the empty parking lot and find the path by the second light pole on the right\\" to be very helpful. Sure, I'd have probably found this anyway but why waste time?Negatives:- I thought the restaurant ratings were not as good as the rest of the stuff in the book. The book is good at pointing out reasonable cheap eats but not as good at differentiating between different high-end/expensive options."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased this book based on reviews from other websites to read for more info on Maui. So far, very informative and hope to see how much it will help on my upcoming trip."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Once we got to Maui we realized how well known this book has become on the island. Some Maui residents are unhappy with the fact that this book discloses many \\"secret\\" hikes etc for fear that they will become touristy. I understand this fear but we followed one hike word for word and found waterfalls where it felt no one else had ever been to. It really is a wonderfull experience to have an adventure of your own on an island as beautiful as Maui. The trails and adventures are described with precise detail so even the beginner can do it! Get the book and enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book for our 1st trip to Maui and it was great!!!

The pictures and maps are great for finding the tucked away places!!!!! Job well done on this one!!!! :)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"You will be among the many visitors who are traveling to Maui with this book. But that is OK. There is so much great stuff in here that you will also be one of the only ones visiting that great snorkeling spot or visiting the cool side road eatery.

It is very informative and will be very useful on our trip to the islands."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I really felt I could trust this book, as, having been to Maui a few times, I could compare my feelings against the commentary included.

It was not only much more informative, but it was fun to read as the author has a lot of humor in it. The fact that they took two years to research Maui and went and did everything everywhere made it so much more credible and informative. We actually found \\"the fishbowl\\" that he talks about and snorkeled there. Was incredible. I found the shave ice in Paia, it was terrific. The book was full of great info!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"It is great, big, lots of info., I personally highly recommend this book to everyone, from fist time traveler to expert travelers.Great pictures, maps and useful info about hotels, condos, attractions and more.

It is very accurate, and useful to our trip planning."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"At last, a guide book that is written from the honest perspective of someone who has obviously been to Maui and knows it well. Far better than any other guide book, this is an insider's view of the island written clearly, concisely, and with humor. There are many tips on side roads, hikes, and beaches that you won't find in any other guide. Particularly helpful are the online reviews of resorts and hotels, which indicate the benefits and shortcomings, and rate them by amenities and upkeep. I ordered three books on Maui to plan a family trip and ended up using this one (and the accompanying online hotel/condo reviews) almost exclusively. The only drawback is that if you want to go to Maui and plan your stay while you are there, the accommodation reviews being online will be an issue. Otherwise, buy the book, plan your trip, and expect to have a fabulous time!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Have to give thumb up for this book. It's awesome. Just like talking to a friend that knows a lot of information. The writing style is casual. Very fun to read. Yet you get all the details you can use. We took the book with us everywhere. Ran into a lot of people carrying the same book and everyone loved their book. The instructions on how to get to some 'secret' attractions are so exact. The speedometer clicked to the exact decimal the book said."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We travel to Hawaii, usually Maui or Kauai, at least once, if not more often, each year. I don't think you can find a better guide book out there that shows you the island of Maui from a fresh perspective. Restaurant and leisure activity reviews are accurate and updated on a regular basis, so that you know which tour boat to take to Molokini or where to eat in Lahaina. Directions to specific hikes and attractions are also execellent and easy to find based on accurate descriptions involving the mile markers on the island. Whether it is your first time on Maui or you have been there dozens of times before, buy this book. It's the only one you'll need and I'm sure you will found out things about Maui that you never would have known about, without first reading the book. Check out their books for the other islands in Hawaii too....they are also excellent!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I am finding the book very helpful. There is so much to see in Maui, it is helpful in narrowing down what you want to see, as one could never see it all.I was happy to see a good review for Cafe 808, as I enjoyed a wonderful Mahi Ala, the last time I was here, and plan to go again, on this trip, Jan 2007."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book on a trip last month. We encountered several other people on the Road to Hana with book in hand. It was great for that trip, alone! The maps were terrific.

Not extremely popular with the natives though."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"\\"The Blue Book\\" - the more I devoured it, the more I loved it.

Get out your marker, go get some index tabs, devour the book, then go online for even more!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Our friends recommended that we get this before going on our honeymoon to Maui in April 2005. It was the best thing we took! The Oahu one was pretty good, too."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book has no respect for anything but itself. For example, it sends people across a huge lava flow to get to a secluded reef. That reef is a lively snorkel spot, but so are others that don't imperil the tourists, or put them in a position to leave trash in a pristine area & otherwise trash the place. This is a pattern. People on Maui call this book Maui Reviled. Other editions revile other islands. It's a very negative influence."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I live on Maui. This book and others like it are ruining what makes this island special. What used to remain secret and thus (private), has become widely known. This increase in foot traffic has brought; litter, excessive trail corrosion, as well as the crime that follows the tourists like flies to dung. What used to be a secluded retreat has been transformed into crowded public hangouts. Since there are no restrooms in any of these places, the woods have been reduced open air toilets, TP and feces have become increasingly difficult to avoid along with the stench of urine. THIS ISLAND IS BEING TRANSFORMED INTO A CESSPOOL (or at least the best parts of it)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Saw book in condo. We are long time Maui visitors (1965). Would not buy this book and have heard nothing but negative things about it. The authors showed a complete lack of respect to Hawaiians by advising visitors of places only known to the local people. There are plenty of wonderful places to go in Maui without invading other people places, many of them private.Much of their land has been taken and they have been made to feel as if the island no longer belongs to them and then these authors expose places only known to them for all the world to find. Their attitude seems to be that everyone has a right to see all the places on the island. Well, we don't. We are guests on Maui and guests don't go through private things belonging to our hosts. The word I hear on Maui is shame on the author and don't buy this book... and we won't .... and we tell everyone we know not to buy it and why. There are plenty of other good, respectful guidebooks."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Amazon claims this item is \\"In Stock\\". After I ordered, the e-mail showed the book may take up to 3 weeks to ship.If you need the book in a reasonable time, Barnes and Noble ships within 24 hours.Obviously this has nothing to do with the quality of the book (which I re-ordered from B&N;) but thought this info might be helpful."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book made our vacation so much better as it covered every inch of Maui.

It gives excellent tips for the most beautiful beaches. I wouldn't go to Maui without it!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I bought this book based on all the positive reviews on Amazon. The book did not disappoint. I used it every day on our trip to Maui last week and consulted it on everything from directions to where to go and where to eat.We were stuck on the island an extra day due to the Aloha, ATA airlines mess and the hotel section in the back was convenient in being able to call up different hotels for availability that last night.We pretty much followed their restaurant recommendations and advice on whale watching companies and Hana sights.I really appreciated their honest feedback and I highly recommend this book. I heard other tourists on the island who also recommended the book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a very good book. I could go on & on as others have, but the good reviews here are pretty much true. This is THE guidebook to take.On the other hand, there really are many locals that really do hate this book (I encountered a few during a 3 week stay). Be careful not to trespass where you are not wanted. Be sure to check this book's website for updates & corrections. Some locations mentioned in the book have been closed off due to too much traffic generated by this book.My advice is to buy this book & combine it with another book calledMoon Maui (Moon Handbooks) (Paperback)by Robert Nilsen (Author)That way you can get a balanced view of things."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The book was easy to use, very informative. There are lots of photos of the places of interest and activities. The book also \\"reveals\\" some of the favorites of the locals. The maps and directions were an invaluable resource as signage in the islands is sparse or non existant. This was purchased as a gift to a cousin who will be a first timer on Maui. We purchased our first book (the first of four) on the recomendation from a young man on the plane who lives and works on Maui. We also purchased Kaui Revealed when we went to the Garden Isle. Highly recomend this book for returning visitors as well as first timers."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Solid book that provides great things to do in Maui in a simple and straight-forward manner. Definitely would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We purchased this book for our trip to Maui; I'll hit the highlights since the other 'read with caution' reviews are pretty dead on. I actually give this book a 3.5.Essentially, it's helpful for maps, points of interest and some insider knowledge about parking, seasons, etc. but please don't just read this book--use online resources like trip advisor and urbanspoon too. There were several highly recommended restaurants in the book that we found to be mediocre. Once we looked on urbanspoon (after the fact), we discovered most people felt the same way.While the west Maui coast and Hana trip descriptions give upbeat sightseeing advice, they really don't give adequate safety warnings or other information. For example, the paths to see many waterfalls on Hana were barely visible and involved scaling slippery rocks and crossing uneven and muddy terrain...Not doable for pregnant women, the elderly, small kids, etc. But there was no real discussion of path conditions. Other things not discussed are the lack of restrooms, dangers to get to the blowhole on the west Maui coast, etc."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was everything it promised.

I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just returned from 7 days on Maui and this book was indespensible. It led us to some of the best (and least visited) spots on the island. Personal favorites were the Olivine pools (we had them all to our selves) and the hike to the Na'Ili Ili waterfalls (again, the only group that went all the way to the fourth falls due to the recommendations in the book.)Every trip suggestion was spot on. Beaches, hikes, restaurants...everything was as advertised. We had visited Maui a few years ago without the benefit of the Ultimate Guidebook and it might as well have been a different island. A much more crowded, superficial one than the beautiful and intimate island we discovered this time araound with the help of this indespensible guide.

Don't go to Maui without this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have read previous editions (just bought the 5th) cover to cover and have used/read his book while on Kauai too. Thoroughly enjoy the thoroughness, candidness and sense of humor. I too live & work in a major tourist area in California. Recognizing that the exposure of certain pristine locations by guidebooks has caused areas to be closed by the State of Hawaii: i.e. Aquarium, Fish Bowl. Too many times a wonderful place which went unnoticed and unused gets crushed by anxious tourists seeking to enjoy and experience all of Maui's wonderful creatures and features. We humans can love a place to death. Maui, and Andrew's books (along with his website) are well beyond compare. Aloha!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I really enjoy this author's writing style. He keeps the subjects vivid and the reader captivated.

I purchased the book during the trip and was hooked. For our trip to Oahu in 2006, I purchased the Oahu Revealed book, and when we returned to Maui in 2008 I purchased the newer edition of Maui Revealed.The Revealed Series books are filled with great information. We have followed the information from the books and found everything to be current and correct. They seem to know everything about the islands and they share it with their readers. We have found the restaurant reviews to be spot on, even the local banana bread stands! The book also includes the best snorkeling spots that are not mentioned in other books.

We went there to meet up with our son who is a US Marine and who we hadn't seen for almost 2 years. Maui was a halfway point. So my husband and I were there with him (21 years old) and our youngest son (18 years old). We couldn't have a quiet, boring vacation with all that testosterone hanging around! Maui Revealed saved the day for us! This book told of all kinds of exciting places and things to do in Maui. We hiked, zip-lined, swam in caves, flew in ultralights, geocached, snorkeled, swam with sea turtles and many more adventures. I think we spent one day out of 10 just relaxing on the beach. It was perfect! And we owe it all to this book. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book really gives insight into the \\"real deal\\" of Maui.

One of them has actually been 10 times, so I felt very confident in trusting his advice. When the book arrived, I was suprised to see all of the pictures. It is nice to have an idea of what things will look like when we get there. We first bought the Frommer's guide, but it is so overwhelming that it is hard to narrow things down. This book is just right. The author is very thorough. He gives details about the weather and tells you what to expect on each part of the island as the weather varies. He gives advice on what the best activities are to do on each section of the island and there is also a section on dining. My co-worker said that he and his wife always trust this advice and so far have not been disappointed. The book also tells you things to avoid, which I find helpful as well. The other great thing about the book is that it isn't too cumbersome to carry with you. This is by far the best book on Maui that we have purchased so far."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Andrew Doughty has done an excellent job highlighting the island of Maui and inviting the reader in to some secrets of the Valley Isle.I took along this book on my first visit to Maui and I can tell you - it was indispensible.Doughty advises which airport to land in, (Kahului Airport)so that you can see the breathtaking coastline along highway 30 - if you are staying on the West side of Maui.Lahania is a beautiful little down town - it has many funky shops, interesting art galleries and world-class eateries that are an experience to behold. The 2 most popular dining places are BUBBA GUMPS and CHEESEBURGER In PARADISE. Those sit right on the water and the window seated patrons are not at all surprised if they should get splashed by a Maui surf wave while eating at their window table.North of Lahaina is Ka'anapali which boasts the luxury high-rise hotels. The best being the HYATT, with actual penguins in their main lobby! The beach walk in front of the ocean allows hotel stayers to walk up all of the resort high rise hotels.THe most economic place to stay is in one of the many condos that are available for rent.Make sure yours comes with an air conditioner...it gets mighty hot in MAUI and the humidity will make you sweat.Napili Bay is not to be missed for it's fabulous snorkeling and swimming...up further north is one of the most spectacular sights to see in all of Maui - the Nakalele Blowhole, which is a short jog from where one would park their rental car.The lava shelf has a large round hole near the shoreline, and when waves crash in, they send up steam and then pressurized water that shoots straight up in the air.Depending on wave action, the blow hole can be small or it can roar up to 70 feet up into the air, rumbling the lava rock like a 747 jetplane on take-off! It's an incredible sight to behold!Bring your camera!Doughty covers all of this in detail and we're only on page 59 of his splendid book, which contains many color photos of the places he is discussing.NO visit to MAUI is complete without the famous day-long road to HANA --which is described on page 73 to 101.It's a jungle over on the windward side of this island, but one of the most beautiful natural drives one could ever hope to witness. Again, bring your camera and your bathing suit and enjoy the trip to HANA...which is more of a process than the end result. The road has about 600 turns and 57 one way bridges on it and is quite the ordeal to drive, but it's well worth all the effort.Many natural waterfalls will line the way....some folks warn that once you're on highway 360, the Highway to Hana, there's no place to turn around and head back.Well, that's not true at all.There are many pull-offs on the side of the road that you could use if you wanted to stop taking the curves and wearing the bejeesuss out of your rental car brakes.Anyhow - I've told you some of the highlights.Avoid Molokini, the crescent shaped island that they say is the best fishbowl for snorkelers...there's much better snorkeling that is swimmable from the beach at Black Rock or Napili Beaches. Don't spend $80.00 per person just to get wicked sea-sick and swim with your goggles and snorkel in a washer machine.Take this book before you get to MAUI.I saw it for sale at the COSTCO in Maui - yes, they have a nice COSTCO right by the airport.Something I learned from reading this marvelous guide to the most beautiful island on Earth.Read MAUI REVEALED and discover some secrets of the island.Whomeve made MAUI our 50th state was a brilliant person."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I didn't agree with all the positive feedback here.

One reviewer said that Maui Revealed wrote glowing reviews of absolutely everything... which I found to be the case.The information was organized in a different fashion than I was expecting. It may work fine for other readers, but I found it a bit cumbersome.It has reviews for dining, lodging, beaches & activities, but doesn't list much about kid-friendly travel.This is a nice book, but I am going to primarily use the Fodor's guide."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book so much on our vacation that we started to refer to the author, Andrew Doughty, as simply Andy. \\"What does Andy say we should do here?\\" From his pin-point accuracy in his directions to his reviews of restaurants and attractions, this book is \\"a real gem.\\" It got to the point where we wouldn't eat somewhere if it didn't have the \\"ONO\\" rating. We never went anywhere without checking the book first... and it was helpful every time. Easy to read, informative, funny, INCREDIBLY HONEST, and filled with excellent maps. Don't go to Maui without Maui Revealed."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This guide book was perfect with one exception and that was a terrible kabob restaurant in Lahaina. Every other recommendation/write up was exact. We stayed at Prince Maui which was wonderful. The beach was crystal clear in the morning. We saw a couple of sea turtles and I saw an octopus while snorkeling. While we stayed in South Maui, we spent a lot of time in Lahaina. Where we stayed it was quiet and beautiful and my kids (18 & 14) loved it. For surfing, Goofy Foot Surfin School was EXCELLENT. My kids were up on the first time and the guys that work there were very nice and patient. I can not say enough good things about them. Good shopping in Lahaina. The Hana Highway was the most beautiful place I have seen and I wish we would have spent 2 days. All of the waterfalls were excellent. Pg 86 is re Waikani Falls--from where you park, you have to walk across the bridge. Like the book says, it is a tricky first step, but once you get past that, it is an easy hike to the waterfall and the pools below. All of the stops that the book recommends are worthwhile. We did see broken glass so be sure to take valuables with you. For the waterfall on Pg 80, after you pass the stream where you have to cross several large boulders, take the path to the left to get to the waterfalls. It is a bamboo forest and really cool. I think there was a drought so the waterfalls were kind of small but it was really neat. PuPu Lounge was excellent as well as Pita Paradise. We had the Brouchetta plate and I loved it. The blow hole on pg 56 is awesome. You can hike down to the base and it is worth it (I had flip-flops on and did not have too much trouble but you should wear \\"tenny-shoes\\" to be careful. We had a wonderful trip and the book helped so much."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great source for anyone visirting Maui for the first time and also an ongoing source for reference."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"All the inside scoop from people who live on Maui.

With so much to do, you really need someone to help weed out the bad stuff.

My friend lives on the island, and he told us to get this book, and the map in another review. This book is great because it has pictures, descriptions, and tells you why one area or another is better. So if his opinion is based on entertainment value vs. some other factor, you can decide for yourself what will suit you. The pictures are up-to-date, as are the directions to the secret hideaways. Gave us an excellent way to plan our visit to all the best beaches, most we never would have bothered visiting if it weren't for the detailed descriptions in this book. Big Beach, black sand beach, red sand beach, Koki Beach and Hamoa beach near Hana.

I should have looked it over more carefully before leaving, but I was short on time so I didn't get to really look at it until we were on the plane to Maui. This is a great book for discovering the out-of-the-way spots on Maui, and a true guide to the places to stop as you travel the island. But it is NOT for families. The only mention of kids/keiki snidely says something like \\"maybe this should go under Hazards.\\" If you need to know whether a place/activity is kid- or family-friendly, you'll need to look elsewhere. It's not a flaw of the book; I fault myself for assuming that this book would be great for us based on one recommendation. If you're traveling without kids, I highly recommend this book. But families or anyone traveling with children should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If you're going to Maui, you must get this guide book.

Great tips, advise, detailed maps, and general stories about the culture. Reading it is almost like being there. I bought the Oahu Book and used it on my 3 trips to Oahu and discovered trails and sites that my native friends didn't even know about. There was no doubt I was going to buy the Maui Book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the most valuable book you can take to Maui. The authors were right on. We had a wonderful time and they never steered us wrong."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I used this book in June 2010. It had great maps and lots of helpful information about anything you want to do on Maui. I highly recommend this if you are planning a trip. We used the maps and phone numbers listed to plan all our activities and driving trips. It was especially helpful on the drive to Hana finding the waterfalls ect.."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The book has a lot of valuable information, I can't say that all of it was helpful because we haven't traveled to Maui yet. Going next month....."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"A lot has been written already about how good this book is,I feel I should I add my bit.We had such amazing time in Maui thanks to this book.I discovered this book 2 days before our trip ,so it was too late to order it from amazon.Its very popular so it was available at both borders and barnes and nobles nearby.This book helped us discover such amazing places which we wouldn't have tried loooking for otherwise in Maui ,the waterfall hikes,The blow hole,olivine pools,the blue pool,polipoli state park hike,the west shore drive and of course Julie's famous banana bread.The list goes on and on.....Don't even think of seeing Maui without this book.This is the essential bible for Maui.Also,the trails for the hikes described in the book were very accurate.Even though I didn't really like some of the restaurants recommended in the book[except for the Kula Lodge,Anthony's and Kimo's,the food and service here were outstanding],I guess its a matter of taste when it comes to food.The reason our trip was was so special was because of this book.Very highly recommended"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We recommend this book to anyone going to Maui, and I wish there was one like this for each city in the world! No commercial bias exists, and we confirmed every opinion in the book to be true....except, we think that they were too hard on Trilogy, which was very family friendly. We would have liked the restaurant rating ONO to be differentiated further by adding a VERY ONO rating. Thanks for making our trip GREAT!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This guidebook is truly the ultimate! We just returned from our Maui vacation and we used the book all the time while we were there. The information in the book is so honest and the driving directions are so right on the mark. This book is definately a best buy ... and just like they said, Julie's Banana Nut Bread in West Maui is the best!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If you are looking for on all-around guide for the island of Maui, then let this be your guide. Maui revealed covers everything you could likely ever want to know on the worlds \\"best island.\\"The perks of this guide are how well it covers restaurants, shopping, activities, and adventures. The maps are superb and alone make the book worth the buck. The detail on most spots is more than enough to prepare you for your trip.The downside of this guide is how it is so vague on certain locations that you'd expect more detail on. We lost a few trails (and hours) due to some bad directions. Why they didn't use maps for some of their trails like they did for the roads is beyond me. I also was well aware of how much the locals dislike the guide, I was sure to hide it when in public after getting some harsh looks early on.In the end the guide has more perks than not. I wouldn't go to Maui again without it and I likely will pick up a copy of their other island guides for future trips. We also took along (and greatly utilized) 'Maui Trailblazer' and 'Maui mile by mile' as additional guides. Between the three guides, Maui was a fantastic treasure for us and we look forward to returning soon."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"As far as I can tell the kindle version is worthless as a guide book. A guide requires you to find your way around. There are not any real features to search and find stuff."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Each book in the \\"...Revealed\\" series offers the best single guide to sites, sights, and activities on its respective island(s). They also share a great, concise overview of Hawaiian history, which you can read in the Kindle preview.We packed four (heavy) guidebooks from major publishers, but soon found ourselves relying overwhelmingly on a borrowed copy of this book. It proved savvier and more trustworthy.The authors have lived for decades on Maui, Kaui, and the Big Island, so they know details that elude parachute travel writers. They also communicate brilliantly -- clearly, wittily, and with a distinctive voice.If you ever wished Rick Steves wrote South Pacific guidebooks: these folks are like Rick Steves on steroids. They offer you more options than other guidebooks, but also much better prioritization.Where Lonely Planet's multiple authors will collectively insist you must visit every nook and cranny, Doughty et al. will tell you candidly: \\"If your time is limited, be sure to see A, C, and F. But it's OK to save B, D, and E for a return visit; they can be redundant.\\"Also refreshing: these folks skip nutty florid hype (no \\"...delights to last a lifetime...,\\" yadda yadda). They simply take it for granted that you're visiting paradise, and help you maximize your scarce time there.Three particular time-savers: Lots of great color photos (averaging one per page), which help you quickly choose your own must-see attractions. Large color maps that are brilliantly selective -- adding important details that standard maps omit, while stripping out unneeded distractions. Finally, the book is rigorously organized by region. This minimizes redundancy and annoying page flips back and forth.The only shortcoming is limited coverage of accommodations. So you should supplement this with another guidebook that includes more lodgings info.As boho/budget travelers, we were surprised that our 2nd choice was Frommer's Maui. It includes itineraries, and some nice prioritization (like island-wide and regional lists of best hotels, B&B;'s, and beaches). But it's fussily bound, and burdened by internal redundancy.LP's \\"Discover Maui\\" has lots of photos, and some unique info., but its assertions and advice often proved flat wrong. \\"Hidden Hawaii\\" has great lodging info., but limited maps, no photos, and confusing geographic organization.Finally, LP's \\"Hawaii\\" (all-islands) book is great to consult in advance for hotel reservations, but we never opened it in Maui. It's bulky and heavy, and hides essentials like itineraries. (Its Kindle edition eliminates bulk and weight, but -- at least on 6\\" B+W Kindles -- it's awfully rendered, with unreadable maps.)Finally: If this edition still recommends the gorgeous Blue Pool waterfall (near Hana) -- that's now closed to public access. Bummer. Enjoy the rest of the island!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"It is an excellent book for traveling on Maui.Besides its detailed guidance, the price and quality of the printing are very good."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I love researching on the internet, but sometimes I just sit there with all your excel spreadsheets and the pile of paper notes and just let out a sigh of all this information I'm trying to organize. Thank god I decided to see if there was a good book out that can solve all my issues.This book is a god send as it really helped plan my days. Plus it gives a good overview on what to do and what to see. We sadly didn't get to do as much as we hoped (we just laid on the beaches for a few days) but when we go back we will definetly tackle more adventures!PRO:Must have, even as a general get you started guideCON:Need a better map for driving."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui Revealed was a wonderful guidebook for those who want details about the island from a local perspective! All of his suggestions were dead on. Take the time to read it before you go and then again while you are there because there is so much information. We had an amazing trip thanks to his knowledge! The road to Hana was amazing! All of the hidden gems he describes are so worth it. Just be careful of your time! We were on the road 12 hours total. We didn't watch our time well until it was getting late. You don't want to be driving on that road after dark so we took very little time at the seven pools. No big deal because we had seen so many beautiful waterfalls, ocean and foilage up to that point. Definitely do the caves at the black sand beach park. We jumped in and they were so cold but so refreshing! That was a beautiful stop on the road. We only ate at the suggested places and every meal was wondeful! We stayed at the Napili Kai beach resort (which he gave an ono to). It was a beautiful beach and resort. Definitely try to get a kitchenette or at least a fridge because food in Maui is expensive. We knew that but were glad we had the choice to eat breakfast/lunch in the room. The snorkeling places he suggested are amazing! Sea turtles, fish galore. We loved Honolua Bay the best. It was calm water and the visibility was amazing. The book doesn't warn you enough of the danger of the currents in Hawaii so just use common sense. There were several spots that the book suggested snorkeling in that we wouldn't go because of the ocean being too rough. The best time in morning to see the fish and to avoid the high surf. Overall the book was the perfect vacation guide!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"very useful guide with helpful suggestions for food, travel destinations and various challenges the traveler might face! The book is well known on the island and some of the businesses were not too thrilled with the reviews and made their feelings pretty clear! By and large, we concurred with the positives and negatives listed in the book. However, as with most things, we did find additional top choices not listed in the book. The book provides a great foundation to work off of while planning your visit."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Had a great time on Maui with this book discovering beautiful beaches, snorkeling sites, and unique lava formations.What I loved about it is that it's structured for road trips, by giving the mile marker locations where people can find Maui's beautiful attractions.However, don't expect any of these sites to be hidden, secluded, or all to yourselves. Instead, expect many, many other tourists at those sites each carrying their own copy of \\"Maui Revealed\\".It will make you feel like a lemming to follow all those other rental cars (which mostly seem to be Chrysler Sebring convertibles) down the same route - especially on the road to Hana and on the West Maui shoreline road - but in the end it's worth it to see everything that makes Maui unique.One comment I have about how \\"Maui Revealed\\" portrays the Blue Pool on the way to Hana: the book makes it seem like a ride down a dead end and then a short, easy walk from there. It actually involves paying someone $2 to park on his property, a walk across a 1'-2'river with a fast current and then a hike over a rocky shoreline. But it's definitely worth it! Bring your swim suit - a swim in the Blue Pool is the highlight of the road to Hana!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the only Maui guide book we kept (out of 5) after our trip -- just in case we go to Maui again some day soon. I agree with other reviewers that some of the hikes could use more detail or maps. In general, however, this is the best guide we saw of the several we had. Unfortunatley, every other visitor to Maui seemed to have the same book, so the \\"secret spots\\" were flooded with other like-minded tourists. Of course, this is not the fault of the writer. This is a very good book for anyone traveling to Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We just returned from our first visit to Maui. I got the guidebook just before we left and am really glad I did. It helped us find good restaurants, the best place to get a REAL Hawaiian shirt, beautiful snorkeling sites and beaches. We had only a week and wanted to see the best of everything. The book was so helpful; it's full of history and insight only locals could share (and it's written with a great sense of humor!). If you've only got a week on Maui, like we did, you couldn't have a better guide. We were there for our goddaughter's wedding and ended up leaving the book for them to use on their honeymoon. While we were there, in airports and at various sites on the island, we ran into lots of others with the book--all agreed it was invaluable. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"On my last trip to Vegas the couple I sat by told me about this book when I was telling them about our upcoming trip to Maui.

We were able to find waterfalls mentioned in the book that were not on the local trail markers."},{"Title":"The sonata in the Baroque era","review":"This is the first volume of three that seemed to constitute a lifelong monomania in its author. Certainly, they consitute an authoritative monument to the survey of the kinds of compositions called sonatas from the mid-sixteenth century to our own day. However, there are so many kinds of pieces that fall under that word that it can fairly be wondered what groups them together more than a simple noun.Since the word seems to have arisen in the 1550s and 1560s, it is simple to begin there. However, where the word comes from and what it actually means are not as clear-cut. It seems to signify an instrumental composition and nothing more. That is, a \\"sound piece\\" rather than something for voices or voices and instruments. Yes, the word can be seen with vocal pieces, but they are more the exception that proves the rule.Newman takes us through the whole range of composers working in this topic and it is a list that includes names long forgotten to the world of living music. It is not that it isn't worth delving into some of these composers, but the hard part is knowing which ones are worthwhile. History has shut the book on most of them for good reason, but there may have been mistakes and something delicious is waiting on the shelf to be discovered.So, look through this book has you wish. I use it more as a reference book than something to read front to back."},{"Title":"Breaking Even.","review":"This is an engrossing, at times chilling, novel, almost three novels in one. The first part deals with the &quot;ugly&quot; sister, Hekuba, who unwittingly falls in love with Seth Strummar, the irrestible rouge who is at the heart of all three parts of this novel. The second deals with Strummar's friend, Joaquin, and becomes almost a Cormac McCathyish quest-into-Mexico story. The third part is told from Seth's daughter, Elena's point of view, and it was this third part that put me off as a reader. I never connected with Elena the way I did with Hekuba and Joaquin. I also resented the short shrift given to Hekuba's death, when I had become so emotionally attached to her. But despite this and some minor anachronisms, particularly in the language, this is a whopping good page-turner which I have recommended it to others."},{"Title":"Breaking Even.","review":"I finished this book in the wee hours of the night--I couldn't put it down. I cried at the ending. Maybe because Elena might never race again, or because Seth was trying so hard to do the right thing, or because Hekuba lost so much. Most western fiction is concerned only with violence, but in the Seth Strummar series, the author asks all of the most probing questions of life. She certainly presents stark portraits of social inequity, yet the books are quite poetic. The continuing metaphors of the bullfight and macho were very effective in Breaking Even. I highly recommend all of Elizabeth Fackler's novels to anyone interested in character studies revolving around the great issues of life."},{"Title":"Breaking Even.","review":"I loved this story. It's the most true-to-life and touching novel about friendship and family love which I've ever read. Joaquin and Seth are soul brothers. Elena broke my heart."},{"Title":"First Steps In Egyptian (Kegan Paul Library of Ancient Egypt)","review":"This book is an excellent continuation for someone who has worked through a possibly more easily absorbed introduction like Manley and Collier or Janice Kamrin. Anyone who has a more up to date foundation obtained from one of these more recently published works will be able to easily make use of this book. This book provides much useful vocabulary and line by line translation/transliteration although Budge's transliteration differs somewhat from current standard. The book's strong point is that: it enables the student to acquire vocabulary, presentation of vocabulary being a (somewhat) weak point in the more comprehensive grammars available.Despite some of the rather negative views of Sir Wallis expressed in these book review forums, Budge continues to be published. Why? It's not because the material is out of copyright and therefore cheap, publishers don't go to the trouble and expense of printing books nobody buys. Sir Wallis's many and varied books continue to fascinate and to be the starting point par excellence for many people's life long interest in Egypt. He lives. There's a reason. Dated scholarship? O.K. Contemporaries disagreed with some of Sir Wallis's assertions? That's what academics do. That's how progress is made. Knowledge in all fields evolves and advances. Read, learn, compare. The progress made since Budge published should be easy for the serious to see and doesn't make this scholar second rate by any standard. Sir Wallis does not deserve the negativity he receives.

He takes the reader through an endearing journey of this family's life in the 30s in the small town of Artas, SD. The Thirties have such a tough reputation and yet this book focuses on one family's strength, humor and internal support as their keys to withstanding the external pressures of the era."},{"Title":"Alice, Artas, and Alzheimer's","review":"Cecil D. Jahraus (1925-2004) was born in Artas, South Dakota and in his later years wrote this timeless account of his childhood in rural South Dakota during the \\"dirty thirties\\". The account of his boyhood escapades, and those of his siblings, serve as a backdrop of normalcy for the eventual decline of his sister, affected by Alzheimer's disease in her later years. The book is divided into two parts, the first, a charming account of life on the plains, the latter, a more clinical depiction of one sister's eventual decline. This book is sure to be a favorite for its good natured humor, and for its compassionate depiction of one sibling's greatest challenge."},{"Title":"Carry Me Over the Threshold: A Christian Guide to Wedding Traditions","review":"have this book and I've enjoyed it. I'm not sure why one reviewer here thought it was a wedding planning book. It is not.This book looks at wedding traditions (some well-known, others not) and where they come from. I've read a lot of the wedding myth type websites, too, but there's lots of new or rarely seen information in this book. For example, the author points out that while some traditions are usually traced to pagan cultures, they can be traced back to early Christian or Jewish cultures. Not all the traditions are Judeo-Christian in origin, but a surprising number are.Also, I love the information about unity candles. Usually, you hear they developed from a soap opera, but the author explains that this isn't true and why.These are just some examples of information you don't usually see online or in wedding books.The information is arranged alphabetically within these categories: pre-ceremony traditions, wedding ceremony traditions, and post-ceremony traditions. There's also an index.Overall, a fun book to read, especially if you're getting married."},{"Title":"Carry Me Over the Threshold: A Christian Guide to Wedding Traditions","review":"I've really enjoyed this book because it tells about all kinds of traditions (both Christian and non-Christian) that we commonly see in weddings today!

Boy, was I wrong! All the information could be found by searching the Internet.

It's one of the more important movies ever made, in my view. The screenplay in this book is excellent as is the introductory essay which tells the tale of the movie, of making the movie and the political setting. It is, however, essential to see the movie itself which is also available for sale AND is on youtube without cost: [...]. Unless you see the movie, the book will make less sense than it would otherwise."},{"Title":"Salt of the earth (The California quarterly)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I feel the passive tone allowed me the reader to enter unconciously into a realm of magical occurences. Indeed a true find."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I've only gotten through about 100 pages of the book, and I have decided to put it down (thank the lord it was only 6 bucks). So far it went from bad to worse. The &quot;Illuminati&quot; group described by Burkett is nothing like I have ever read before. It is my understanding that while they are enemies of the Catholic Church, they are not hellbent on putting &quot;Satan's Kingdom on Earth&quot; (pg. 85).Also, the characters that Burkett places into the Society are noncharacteristic of what is understood about it. The Illuminati are said to have trusted politcal, financial and military (the list goes on) leaders of great power within their highest ranks. Burkett places an Arab arms dealer as the leader of the Illuminati (not quite what I expected), and gives no men of high statute a place within his version of the Society.His biased view towards Christianity distorts the percieved truth of the Illuminati. Burkett could be just trying to undermine a group against his personal beliefs (suprise!).Do not read this book if you are looking for an objective study on the Illuminati. However, if you like silly futuristic tales; be my guest. Angels and Demons by Dan Brown (Author of The Da Vinci Code) would be a much better choice."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This is the second straight book I've read about the Illuminati. Dan Brown's 'Angels and Demons' I thought was a little better, but this one had some worthy points - a carefully laid out thriller type of plot, and ingenious interpretation of the book of Revelation. Dan Brown's book was a little more cohesive and gave a better history of the shadowy group called the Illuminati and its intermingling with society and the Church; this book, on the other hand, was very much stuck in the present.I have no idea how the (near) end of time is going to play out based on the Bible, but you'll know it when you see it (whoever is around then). A fairly literal reading of Revelation and Matthew chapter 24 might play out something like this book does: some really bad people doing catastrophic things, and persecuting Christians and Jews, to bring about a takeover of the world before Christ finally returns and takes it over Himself. This can make for some exciting scenarios, and that is what Larry Burkett provides. I was able read it without getting too upset because I'm more of an au-millennialist who believes the end-of-time will not necessarily include catastrophes, but I'll admit I'm not absolutely sure. I guess what I'm saying is that I have no problem reading and enjoying books that I might not agree with; in fact, I do it all the time to one extent or another.Like 'Angels and Demons', this was like a blockbuster movie: lots of action and destruction, and no discernible cleanup. A nuclear bomb might drop somewhere, for example, but you don't hear anything about the aftermath. A few pages later, you almost forget about it because something else catastrophic is going on.There must have been about 50 characters in the book, and I had to keep a list of them so I could keep up with the plot. Dan Brown's book was a lot leaner in that regard with only a few characters tracking through a lot of plots. I liked 'Angels and Demons' better partly for that reason.Don't read the computer parts too carefully or you'll find it out-dated and unworkable, since the book was written in the early '90's. I was not too bothered by this since I was more interested in the plot flow.It does help to know something about the Bible references before reading this book, to see where it is coming from.It was an OK book, but not great."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The scariest thing about this book is that it reads like something we could see in the headlines.Mr. Burkette really did his homework on this piece,the action is nonstop and the attention to detail is incredible.From the moment you pick it up you will want to read it right through,IT'S THAT GOOD ! When you compare this book with eschatological scripture in the bible and current world events and organizations it becomes almost nonfiction, especially when you know that there really is a worldwide organization called the Illuminati ! This is must read literature."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Based on an interesting idea and a truly scary vision the author succeeds in totally wasting every opportunity to catch the reader.The characters are undeveloped, stereotypical and flat. The plot is thin and predictable. The technology used in the book to first control the entire USA and then in the hands of the freedom fighters liberate it is totally unrealistic and described in a manner that makes you want to laugh.During most of the book the author describes how greedy media-conglomerates and a naive and easily duped population allows WWII nazi-germany happen all over again in the USA, but nowhere does he discuss anything about anyone reacting to the lies and deceptions that the corrupt government pours out through the media. It is as if noone even reacted when hundreds of thousands neighbours, friends and family were rounded up and sent off to camp.Besides, who can for one second believe that any American would allow the government to tatoo an ID number on your hand, a number that you have to show to get food and supplies? The revolution would come well before that happened...Luckily, Jesus and Christianity saves the world at the end of the day.A silly and ridiculous book totally ruining a could-be great conspiracy theory plot."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This was entertaining for a number of reasons, none of them what Burkett intended. After a few chapters, I had to reframe my experience of the book - I chose to experience it as a crude and cartoonish parody of itself. In that way, it became moderately enjoyable.For starters, the Society depicted in the book bears very little resemblance to any version of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; I've ever seen. Fearless Leader (Amir Hussein)is a ranting gorgon with no people skills to speak of, and even the inevitable scheming plutocrats haven't a shred of organizational smarts. The whole megilla is basically a dress rehearsal for a very specific version of the Tribulation from the book of Revelation - think of &quot;Left Behind&quot; by LaHaye but shorter and more badly written. Of course, we know it's not the real Trib because there's been no Rapture.Reading this at the end of 2001 - the year the events in the book are depicted as taking place - added a special tang to the mess. Having Dubya in the White House and Ashcroft safeguarding or liberty makes an amusing contrast with the ergot-frenzy dystopia Burkett confabulated. What prompts people like him to persist in imagining 'Christians' as the current or imminent victims of vicious secularist pogroms is and will forever remain a mystery to me."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Where are we now? One europe currency-us next? Really makes you think this was written in 1996!!! Maybe to easy for some to read-no high brow stuff but thats the point. Easy, grade school language so ANYONE can get the drift. To make you aware, make you thing for OURSELVES before its TOO late. Read this in 1996 and again in 1999. WalMart scans chips in your hand,kids have inplanted chips and so do animals already- what NEXT ! Maybe this isn't so far fetched after all."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"While somewhat interesting as a premise, this author wanders all over the place and has a hard time focusing. The characters are shallow and unbelievable as well as confusing. The whole concept of a christian fearing elite taking over the world reads like the &quot;Turner Diaries&quot; in sheep's clothing. My fear would be that some in the religious right would like to be the ones doing the controlling."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Eeerie... how did the author come up with this illuminati 2001 plot? Conspiracy theorist will drool over this read. I dont think much of it as a whole, but weird coincidences like this make me show everyone these fascinating details. Beyond that though this book is a waste of time when there is sooooo much more in the conspiracy theory genre. 2"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"When I first read this book in 1992, I enjoyed the story, but did not believe that the plot was a possibility. Now that I have read it again during the presidential election of 2008, I believe the plot it not only realistic, but potentially happening. This book reinforced my vote for McCain for president!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I found Larry Burkett's The Illuminati to be a great book,a fun read and not only that, but I believe Mr. Burkett was more prophetic in this book than he himself believed.

It's written really well, its fast, the characters are great, i loved it. I reccommend it all the time, please buy and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Although this book is fiction, it seemed like another good reminder of the commonly held hidden agenda of the antichrist. I had seen Apocalypse 2/Revelation the video, and Cal Rutland in the Illuminati reminded me of the anitchrist's henchman in Apocalypse 2/Revelation. This book emphasized the tremendous weight of the media/television to impact public opinion. Even now, you have to force yourself to do other things besides watch TV because its easy to just sit there and justify the ungodly stuff that comes over the TV. If you listen to the voice in your conscience that says &quot;breakaway&quot;, you are doing good. This was the fastest that I have read a book since JAWS. I thought the parallels concerning what happens to those who serve Satan rivaled the scene in the movie Ghost in which the guy who killed the lead character was being clawed and dragged to hell screaming in fear. This also, matched what Carmen's video shows as the way the warlock dies in &quot;A Witches Invitation&quot;. Basically, satan lures people by their own desires and when he is through with them, he discards them to suffer. I think that books like this might possibly re-enforce that christians will have to suffer, and this is a potential warning of it. Jesus said we would be hated because of Him. We are hearing it from many sources such as the bible, prophecy books and fiction. Like training. A good read ! Somewhat farfetched at times. But still a good read !"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Before this book I had no idea there was such a thing as 'Christian Fiction'. So this is what the Reborn do for fun. Well, for the real thing they should read Thomas Pynchon's &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; and be really frightened while having a much more enjoyable read if the satire is not lost on them."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"If you fantasize happily about the painful death of everyone who isn't a born again Protestant Christian, who isn't heterosexual, or who holds any vaguely liberal opinions about anything from foreign policy to feminism, this book is for you. Its racism is more subtle than that in The Turner Diaries, but otherwise it's pretty much as awful and reprehensible."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Mr. Burkett has opened several &quot;SECRET&quot; government doors with this novel. It is an intense and eye-opening sequence of events that every Christian, Jew and &quot;so-called&quot; atheist needs to take note of. Will we continue to plead the old adage of &quot;...that doesn't concern me&quot;, or &quot;its happening to those people, not my kind&quot;, until there's no one left but &quot;your kind&quot;? God used Mr. Burkett to get us thinking &quot;what if...?&quot; This novel made me think &quot;what if...?&quot; I believe it will make you think it also. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The scenes move rapidly so it keeps your interest until the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"My mind cannot fathom how anybody could possible label this piece of trash \\"thought provoking\\" or \\"riveting\\" or even that such a scenario is even remotly possible or realistic.This was a gift from a bible thumping aunt and for years I have always gotten these churchy books. As this one didn't mention the words \\"God\\", \\"Christ\\" or \\"religion\\" on the back cover so I thought I'd give it a try.Man what a piece of garbage! It's funny how the liberal people are all the bad people and the Christians and the Jews are the \\"good guys.\\" And any of the good guys who weren't Christians when they are first introduced in the story become Christian by the end of the book.The most hilarious passage in the book and one that sums up my feelings nicely is the following:_________________Wells sat down at the terminal and typed in the access code that had been hidden inside the operating system. As soon as the computer connection was made, the screen responded:\\"Access approved, Luke. The force be with you.\\"\\"Just a little private joke of his,\\" Karen said as she narrowed her eyes at Jeff.\\"Maybe 'The Lord be with you' would be more accurate,\\" Elder said.\\"Good idea,\\" Jeff agreed. \\"I'll make the changes when I exit.\\"________Seriously, tears rolled down my face I was laughing so hard when I read that.There's just so much wrong with the book. To move the plot along he has some of his Christian characters just say \\"you know I have long suspected a secret society was at work within the government.\\"Bad dialogue bad plot bad everything.It's a waste of paper."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"(This review is based on the 1991 edition of the book. apparently some details have been altered in the 2004 edition)I suspect the title of this book was chosen to cash in on the mythical Illuminati, which has nothing to do with the secret society in this novel, \\"The Society\\" (although Burkett calls it the Illuminati a few times when first describing it). Burkett's Illuminati is a group whose goals, besides world power, is to \\"establish Satan's kingdom on Earth\\". Needless to say, they hate Christians, which we are told more times than I can count. The novel is set in 2001 (re-edited version in 2015), ten years after it was written, and somehow everybody in the USA, except for a small minority, is now against Christianity. Considering that a vast majority of americans are christians, this scenario is just too implausible to believe.Instead of just telling his story, Burkett constantly voices his own opinions, calling liberals \\"fanatics\\" and portraying liberals as anti-Christian, foul-mouthed, coke snorting homosexuals who somehow managed to outlaw religious broadcasters and turn their tv and radio stations over to the evil \\"Gay power\\" groups. The bad guys are laughable stereotypes:\\"By this time an avowed socialist and atheist, Sievers was attracted to a young English woman traveling with the group. Their mutual interests included an elitist view of themselves, a disdain of religion, and a desire to establish a new world order.\\" (p.90)Later in the book we have large mobs assaulting and killing Christians, carrying signs with an inverted cross, which according to Burkett is a symbol of the gay rights movement. The gay rights people continue their killings and in the meantime we learn how liberals want to harvest organs from babies. If Ann Coulter would write a novel, it would probably be like this one.In the foreword, Burkett tells us he is a talented writer (leave that up to the reader to decide, why don't you?) and that the story is realistic. Unfortunately, he's wrong on both points. As for the realism, there is none. The Christian resistance movement can do absolutely anything by hacking the \\"Data-Net\\", and the government is left clueless as to how they do it. And the writing, all other flaws aside, is awful. He constantly jumps between different perspectives and even locations within the same scene. It's a mess.A reliable source told me that Burkett was, although a bad fiction author, a wonderful man. If that is true, this book doesn't show it. Instead he comes off as simple minded, homophobic and paranoid. And an incompetent writer. Read this book only if you want to read some of the worst religious fiction there is. As trash, it is somewhat entertaining but it's too boring to qualify as true \\"so bad it's good\\" trash."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"A superbly written, woven tale of government corruption, conspiracy theory, and the struggle for world dominance. It's obvious Mr. Burkett has done his research.The suspense is great, the story is well above the average for any fiction, religious or non-religious. One of the few books I have read that I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I don't think I have read a funnier book in all my time. What made this book hilarious, was that it was not trying to be a wacky book. The Illuminati is a novel so poorly written (A ten year old has better grasp of the language), and so full of prejudice (Pat Robertson has it next to his toilet), you will find yourself laughing and groaing at the same time. One hopes that Burkett would crawl back under his rock and never try joining the literary world again. Even though ignorance can be really funny"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"It is clearly obvious that many of those who have posted a review of this book do not understand how the Illuminati operates or they want to keep people from buying this book to keep them in the dark. I encourage you to first do some research on the Illuminati (particularly in relation to 9/11)and then read this book. The book is mind blowing and highly suspensefully from beginning to end. Keep in mind it is a novel and does not clearly lay out information about the Illuminati it simply use brilliant characters to depict how the Illuminati operates. You must read this book if you want to know the truth and as you read it think about the world we live in and what is going on today. Keep in mind this book was originally published in the 70's or 80's and the story is set in the year 2020 10 years from now. The author is a true genius, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I picked up The Illuminati because I am very interested in eschatology or what is more commonly referred to as the &quot;end times&quot; and more specifically, my particular interest lies in a Biblical interpretation of the end of those times. And I love good fiction. And also I have read elsewhere about the existence of an international group of powerful elite policy-makers known as The Illuminati, so I wanted to learn more about them. But this book has seriously let me down on all three counts. Even the title is misleading because it does not really focus on any intelligent discussion of the Illuminati. Seriously, you would be hard-pressed to find a book built upon a more weakly constructed storyline, cookie-cutter characters, and all caving in upon itself with the worst dialogue that I think I have ever come across. If a wall of water 60 feet high were about to roll on top of two of Burkett's characters, I'm sure they would turn to each other, grasp hands, and say... &quot;Quick, let's run!&quot;Well, it's unfortunate, because he has chosen a very serious topic to write a poor book about. It will make many people take the real issues that are here MIS-represented less seriously. Burkett has written tremendous (and I think the very best) books about personal financial management, but The Illuminati proves that fiction is a genre wherein he ought not to have strayed."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"An interesting plot, quite easy to read although very religious(directly describing the anti-christ, heaven/hell etc. - the author isobviously a devout christian) and somewhat too exaggerated and farfetched at times. The author certainly has a vivid imagination though - it is amazing (although thoroughly unbelievable) all the worldshaking events that he described happening in just the space of the next 10 years.The characters are interesting and well thought out, although the author has an annoying habit of giving ALL of the characters names, however important or unimportant they may be. This results in the reader reading half the book before he realises which characters are important and which are not.This book is however worth reading if you're interested in plots, conspiricies etc. Disappointingly, however, it does not tell you very much about the Illuminati."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I did not read it to find out more about the \\"Illuminati\\" but to read a fiction thriller.What I came away with is a scenario of what could happen to freedom when we allow the media, government, social and political groups to shape our morals and our convictions.It is always said, \\"History repeats itself.\\" and this book shows situations that could happen with society's moral decay so personally I found most of it believable.There were quite a few characters to keep up with but I didn't feel that it detracted from the story.It also is an example of a good fiction book can be written without curse words and sex scenes."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Cons: The title of the book wasn't really appropriate...The Illuminati is referred to as the Society throughout the whole book. There was one part in the middle where I wanted the book to pick back up, but it did within the next chapter.Pros: The storyline moved quickly with turns and enough going on to keep me interested. I could barely put it down and couldn't wait to pick it back up. I liked the characters and the settings. Burkett went wild with it, but made it believable. I really enjoyed reading this book and I plan on reading it again.If you like books that force you to pay attention and think, you'll really like this one. The government conspiracy was so interesting to read about. I hope I never see anything like this happening!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"There are several problems with this story that might prove to be a distraction (which caused me to give it two stars). It is supposedly updated to take into account technology advances since its publication in the 1990's. But they missed a bunch. Also the book lacks characters that are compelling either in their goodness or their evilness. There is no apparent main character until the last few chapters so the novel suffers from point of view issues. BUT all that being said, if you are curious about how a super elite might come to power in the US and how this matches up with end times Bible prophecy, there is still great value in reading the novel."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This book was amazing! It is so hard to believe that Larry Burkett wrote this book 24 years ago because there are so many things in it that are similar to what is happening today. The economy, government control, anti-Christian laws, etc. The timeline in the book even includes 2010 and beyond. Reading it makes you ponder the cost of losing freedom to government control. However, it affirms that those who really know the Lord will be able to endure to the end. It is a must read for Christians today!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This book is filled with Christian paranoia, and stereotypical references to youth, gays, other religions and government.Scattered with fantastic events but hard to believe any of them, from futuristic computers that can tract everyone in the country to super dooms day weapons and corruption of government. I guess if I was paranoid that the government was planning to out law Christianity I would really like this book, but as it is I forced myself to finish this book, only because I don't like to start a book and not finish it."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"While reading this book, I found myself asking what would I do if I were in the same position as the Christian characters.What I discovered was that I honestly had no idea what I would do, but I this book has really begun me thinking about that.I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys reading fiction that makes them think."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Though I have to agree with others that there wasn't too much history on the Illuminati mentioned in the book, there was a good and necessary chunk mentioned. I also found it to be very interesting a read and the way it was laid out did have the 'perfect mix of fiction and reality' contained within it. I'm not quite sure where the bias against all liberals calling them monsters and evil people was(as a few others mentioned), if it was there I didn't see it. I saw a bias against the evil society running everything and even some of the 'liberals' that supported the society switched their view when things started getting too crazy, so I fail to see that bias. I liked the book all-in-all."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I liked this book. It was good. He wrote it well. It reminds me of a hiku. it think i will tell you it_ Silly cat climbs up.

Larry Burkett is a genious."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I thought the book was well written, but the story is very similar to \\"the Turner Diaries\\""},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This review covers the 2004 edition of this book, it's language has been updated to \\"fit\\" into the modern era.The title \\"The Illuminati\\" is a misnomer, this book is more about the concept of the \\"Rapture\\" in the religious community. Anyone who knows anything about the Illuminati will be greatly disappointed in this book. It portrays them as evil and bent on taking over the world while destroying religion as it accomplishes these goals.The storyline isn't horrible, but it is a stretch to the imagination and in some sections of the book, it is quite unrealistic. What makes this story so difficult to \\"believe\\" even fictionally, is that it uses modern technology and governments. If these things had been made-up, I would have found it more believable.The dialogue isn't very good; in fact, in some places it is downright unbelievable. Characters giving quotes that don't fit into their personalities such as a seven year-old child spewing long, complex sentences and the internal dialogue is even worse.The internal dialogue commits a cardinal sin of writing, it is used to \\"tell\\" the reader what is happening or what the character is thinking rather than \\"show\\" the reader--and there is a lot of internal dialogue.This book is a religious man's take on how he perceives the world to view Christians and Jews. I'm not a member of the Illuminati nor am I a Christian or Jew; however, I was offended by his protrayal of how Americans react when provoked by their government."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"When I started the read the book, it seemed very strange. The plot was highly imporbably, the author messes up technical details too often, and the whole &quot;It's the Masons!&quot; conspiracy theory seemed a bit old.But still...I loved it, and I finally figured out why. It's _happy_. Pure evil is a contender, and you know it's going to lose! Whether or not you agree with the author's Christianity, you'll find yourself going &quot;Yeah!&quot;If good, depressing works have gotten you down (like _Of Mice and Men_ or _The Glass Menagerie_), have fun and read this book."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Sadly, Mr. Burkett's book is merely a fictionalized version of a massive amount of Christian conspiracy literature out there these days. The common &quot;New World Order is going to get You&quot; genre is sadly all too common in Christian publishing these days. Indeed, Burkett's nonfiction (Coming Economic Earthquake) is based on Illuminati fantasies. Burkett, as well as others, appear to either be unaware or unconcerned that their theories are based on Facist and Nazi ideology, not to mention rampant anti-Semitism. Do yourself a favor, save some money and leave this book on the shelf"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This book was originally released in 1991. It's been about that long since I've read it, but I do recall how amazed I was that it seemed like prophecy (even though there was a statement made on the inner sleeve saying it was not prophetic and was merely a fictional novel).I recall it mentioning &quot;the net&quot;, a world wide computer network to accommodate a one-world money system and government. Sound familiar?If memory serves me right, I think there was a character named &quot;Hussein&quot;......interesting, huh?A prophetic book? Maybe......Amazing insight from a highly trained, respected, and revered financial guru? Definitely!I will re-read this book and be amazed at how many &quot;prophecies&quot; have come true."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"\\"Makes you think!\\". I love the writer's perception of the government, media and the possibilities to come in the future if we aren't more careful. This book really gives you pause to think."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This is one of those books that once you start reading it, you can't put it down. Very exciting and incredibly believable. Larry Burkett has an awesome talent and you are hooked from the first chapter. I have read several of Larry's book and have never been disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This book has it all -- economic disaster, a tsunami, a bad guy named Hussein, Christians and Jews vs. Arabs, nuclear bombs, oil shortages, rigged elections, conspiracies, secret societies, assassinations, riots, and a computer \\"genius\\" hero. The characters and the dialogue in this book make Dan Brown look like a literary genius. It's bad. However, the plot is so ridiculous that it's somewhat entertaining to read.I must give the author credit for one thing -- his imagination came up with all of this in 1991, before things like $150/barrel oil, terrorism, and major tsunamis became reality..... and, before Dan Brown's novels brought this literary junk to the mainstream."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This is the first &quot;Illuminati&quot; book I've read so far and I'd like to share my utter disappointment.1. The plot is EXTREMELY WEAK. In fact it is so lousy and predictable that I gets even funny - pretty much like watching a really bad movie - you actually start enjoying it towards the end...2. The Author doesn't have a slightest clue about computers, yet 2/3 of the book deals with &quot;computer stuff.&quot; Those of you having some minor understanding of computer terminology will be abhorred by meaningless collection of buzzwords intended to impress those raised in Nebraska (no pun intended ;). My personal favorite is (page 168):&quot;He had simply commanded the central computer controller to interrupt Loo's &quot;trap&quot; and then reinstate it once Jeff had access to the main compiler.&quot;I'll appreciate if someone, personally acquainted with the Author would give him some &quot;Computer for a complete Idiot&quot; book as a gift.3. Finally, the Author is a devoted protestant and so is the book. The good guys are protestants (with some Jewish people mixed in). The bad guys are abortion supporters (represented as killing children for organs in the book), gays, freemasons, and all kinds of sadists and perverts. The author gets completely delirious towards the end...To summarize, if you haven't left the Bob Jones University campus for 5 years, this is a book for you. Otherwise, don't even bother."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The overall idea of this book gives you pause, especially when you consider all the things Burkett came up with that have actually come to pass. But what is with the junior-high writing? It seems that whenever any of his &quot;heroes&quot; is in a bind an implausible magic solution surfaces just in the nick of time."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This book started out okay for me, but the storyline never went anywhere. More than halfway through the book, I gave up and stopped reading it. The basic plot had lots of potential, but as I said, the storyline went nowhere and wasn't even close to keeping my interest."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I found this book enjoyable reading but, it is not Larry's best work. The title is misleading, as it does not focus on the Illuminatti. It is, however, interesting how he takes his knowlege of finance and applies it to the story line. I found the characters believable and entertaining. I would recommend this to the christian reader, especially those interested in the endtimes. Obviously, those of other religious persuasions will not appreciate the biblical application. Overall, I think it is a pretty fair first effort at fiction."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The characters are shallow and stereotypical, little more than charicatures. The villains are mindlessly violent and unhuman, little more than reptiles. The heroes are saints without a shred of human weakness. The books starts out suspiciously biased and finishes in a crescendo of unmasked right-wing fundametalist doggerel that categorizes all pro-choice and drug legalization opinions as products of Satan himself. Quite hillarious is the complete absence of sex in what is supposed to be a book about international intrigue. The good guys win and the bad guys lose by no plausible reason but by the grace of God. Simplistic and uninteresting. Struggled to the end just to see how completely the author could lose himself in his own thinly veiled trilling of &quot;Hallelujah! Praise tha Lord!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I'm half way through this book and I'm pondering putting it down. The story line is okay. The writing is good considering Burkett is a Non-Fiction writer. The plot of course is recycled, but that's to be expected. The Characters though are horrible. The antagonist(The Leader, a middle eastern mad man/Hitler reincarnation/Super-Power in himself) is a complete moron. It's like he never read an history book in his life. The Society/Illuminati is controlled by this ONE man and he's totally bent on completing his own personal vendettas before completing the Illuminati's Goal. You would expect the Illuminati to be smarter and less religous than Burkett portrays them as. They've only been at this &quot;Control the World&quot; plot for seval centuries. The protagonist is almost as bad. He's the stereotypical computer genius that figures out the whole plot with his girlfriend whom he is just too shy to consider his girlfriend. Of course, this chick is completly in love with him because of his intelligence and the fact that he respects her because of her abilities and not the fact that her did is this super physicist. The plot after a good build is slowly degrading to predictable. It belongs more in a &quot;&quot;What If&quot; Nazi Germany had occured in America&quot; comic book then in a full fledged novel. The title of the this book should seriously been changed to Nazi America, or Hitler's America. The only thing that stops it from becoming one of those is that it includes this secret (stupid) society that has enginered the fall of the American Economy and rise of the World Economy. I'm just hoping that there is no happy ending and this computer hack protagonist falls flat on his face so I can truly see this &quot;Satan's kingdom on Earth&quot; being strived for by the antagonist. Illuminati Fans Do Not Read This Book. Everyone else: Enjoy a frightning &quot;What If&quot; of America's future manipulated by a secret society bent on world domination"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"It's disturbing to think that trees died so this could be printed...This is an incredibly weak novel, attempting to capitalize on the name \\"Illuminati\\". Horribly slanted from a right-wing, conservative, religious bias that is childlike in nature. The two-dimensional people in this 'novel' bounce around like puppets in a Punch and Judy show.....no, sorry, Punch and Judy's characters are more developed than that.Save your money to buy a sandwich, it will be more fulfilling both physically and intellectually."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This was obviously a first-time fiction author's book, and if I were the editor, I would have sent it back for revision. It had very common first-time author problems, such as pacing issues as well as the problem of not really knowing how to effectively write dialogue. Even when I was supposed to feel something in the dialogue, I didn't. I knew what I was supposed to feel, but I didn't feel it. In addition, there are problems that I have with the writing style. For example, the author shows a panoply of personal biases against anything liberal. Granted, legalization of drugs isn't necessarily a good idea, but that doesn't mean that all homosexuals or all liberals use them, which is implied by the story. All liberals don't agree with abortion, either, but that generalization is made too. It's all right to put things like that in and to let your voice show through, but the condemnation that the characters receive from the AUTHOR is rather harsh. In addition to that, the author cites, several times, the taxation of churches as being unconstitutional. I can only assume that he means the Separation Clause of the First Amendment, but it never guarantees the freedom of churches from taxation. Realistically, they should face property and income taxes like any other institution, and be held to the same laws requiring proof of tax exemption status. However, he is correct when he cites the banning of Christian television shows from being aired as being unconstitutional.Another problem that I had was that characters would make revelations, completely without cause, simply to move the story along. An informant to give them that information may have been more plausible. With experience, the author may correct that problem.One side note, I have read several Christian \\"End of The World\\" fiction pieces, and I think that it is quite humorous that all of them have a Democratic, Liberal president taking away the rights of the people, when the closest things in history to these activities were performed by Abraham Lincoln's signing of a law suspending posse comitatus, and President Bush's lovely \\"Patriot\\" Acts.Anyway, the only other real problem with the story was one that is common to Christian fiction, and it comes from their viewpoint. In the end of the story, it is a foregone conclusion that all of the good characters are or will be Christians. I understand that they believe that God provides morals, but some morals are provided by society. I don't think that I would standby and allow my neighbors to be rounded up as terrorists for what they believed. No matter how much I disagree with what others believe, I refuse to take their right to believe it away.If you have some free time and want to read an easy novel, pick it up, just get it cheap. You probably won't enjoy it too much.Harkius"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"bought 3 copies of this book from 2 sources...both came in record time and were new or like new; everything was as promised and price was great!!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The book was a fast read but I was annoyed with the way it was written. I didn't like the charactors of the computer whiz and his girl-friend; made you root for the bad-guys. I liked the plot. If somewhat interested in conspiracies and Illuminati purchase the book."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The story is interesting - tying in current events with history and a bunch of paranoya conspiracy stuff. The author weaves in a ton of Christian dogma - slowly at first and then so hard core it slaps you in the face. Very anti liberal, morally equating abortion with organ harvesting and the legalization of narcotics. He does mention the Jews in a positive light, but of course hard core testifyin'and witnessing and on your knees prayin' is the way to save the world.Strangely the right wing saves the world (I don't think I'm ruining the story by saying that). People who have been agnostic their whole lives start to open up to the &quot;wisdom&quot; of Christian dogma and the whole world is saved from the antichrist. Liberals, the media, and people who are against gun-toteing are the cause of all the mess in the world. Sounds realistic!My recommendation- convert now and hand over your mind to those who really want a new world order. Those who would dictate right an! ! d wrong to you and tell you they know what's best so don't make your own decisions.We, the real Illuminati like this kind of thing since the author obviously knows nothing about how we really operate. We like disinformation.-Fnord."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Most of the activity in this book is actually happening right now, but at a lesser scale. As you read the book, you will say to yourself, &quot;hey, this stuff is happening now!&quot; It keeps you reading from beginning to end without putting it down. I enjoyed it completely."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Written at a middle-school level, this story is laugh-out-loud funny, until you realize how chillingly accurate it is at predicting the end of democracy. The author describes step by step the playbook our leaders followed to curtail freedom in America. The irony is Burkett got it backwards. That's right folks, it turns out The Illuminati are real. They're just not who the author thought they would be."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I have a bit of a facination with the whole conspiracy theory idea.

A must read!!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"As a mother of six, I don't have much time to read, but I made the time for this one and I couldn't put it down. I'm not a religious fanatic, but there were enough elements of truth, that I can only hope and pray that we never come to what Larry Burkett suggests could happen."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I read this book over ten years ago and it still haunts me to this day.

Very well written and a gripping tale."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I have been extremely bothered by the Obama Pelosi ambitions, in a sense carrying out a plan that has often runs contrary to the will and sense of the people. I can't help but feel a sense of unease that there are greater powerplays being made behind the scenes. Burkett was a financial genious, so I picked the book up to see what he had to say about political conspiracy.Well, he hit a patch of quicksand called character development... and subsequently made Dan Brown look like a good writer! This book was so poorly written, and soooo one sided for the Christian cause, talk about victimization. Burkett wishes Christians could be martyred like this. Instead our churches are crumbling into dust, destined to be museums someday like those of Great Britain and France.And the sensitive issues he touched on...I don't believe in gay marriage but I also don't believe that if you declare marshall law, Castro street will flood the airwaves and carry flags with upsidedown crosses. And where the heck were any strong women characters in this book??? None, all subservient mice. And the bad guy...a really scary Arab who was the right hand man of Lucifer... yikes... 24 used that one up a long time ago.Burkett needs to stick to numbers and not words. Economic manifestos but not Left Behind- Book 8."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"The central idea is wonderful: there are powers controlling the powers that we see. (Someone controls the president who controls the FBI etc.) Unfortunately after the being well set up in the first 1/4 - 1/3 of the book, the story degenerates into a lot of wild-eyed religious hand-wringing. Which is ironic because after the first part sets up the reader to think about manipulation and control, the heavy-handed remainder comes across as propoganda and causes the reader to wonder who is controlling the author. I would love to see other authors take the basic idea and craft something really sinister. This one, however, I would skip."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I read the book years ago and must have given it to someone to read. I like to read prophetic books and then go back and see if they have made valid conclusions. I think Larry was a real visionary. There are many correlations that make you think. You can make some substitutions and see a revelance to today. I found it similar to Sinclair Lewis's book \\"It can't happen here\\" having a good story to go along with prophesy. On my reread, I still could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Perhaps the conspiracy buffs wouldn&#65533;t be so disappointed if the name of the book were &#65533;You asked for it, you got it&#65533;. As this book provides a truthful extrapolation of current events left unchecked by a people not willing to take stand against evil. The author isn&#65533;t &#65533;polished&#65533; in his writing style, but is very insightful in his understanding of human nature and social trends. The sequel &#65533;The Thor Conspiracy&#65533; is even better."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I read this book for the first time just days after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake. Along with other world events of that time... well, let's just say that it was an eerie coincidence to read what was in The Illuminati. Yes, it's a bit paranoid and dogmatic, but it's rare when I read a book cover to cover without hardly stopping to even eat. I literally could not put this one down! Definitely worth the read and the consideration even if it is fiction (we hope)."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"A must read for every Christian who realizes the importance of being wise and innocent in these last days.

Let us all realize the importance of our time."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"Fanatical right-wing cyberpunk. So badly written I still suspect that Burkett is really a leftist in disguise.

Love the book!"},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"This book has the feeling of a book that has been rushed but the author knows what he's talking about. I read it all. The layout is sprawling with long listings included. Personally, I liked this book but I think maybe the editor let it down. It's full of information; the key is how to find it. However, it just about covers everything and that is both its strength and weakness. If you want an overview - it's here but be prepared. Patience is a virtue with this book. The layout is clunky. I personally found the accompanying source code to be very useful and I'd recommend the book on that alone. The code ain't pretty - but it works and would be good for prototyping."},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"1 star because one can't give a rating lower than that. The authors do a good job of repeating trivial stuff over and over again. But when it comes to algorithmic or mathematical treatment of the subject, they seem to be at their wit's end. Consider this : According to authors, 2^56 + 2^56 = 2^112. Basic mathematics knowledge would have been suffiecient to calculate the above i.e 2^56 + 2^56 = 2*2^56 = 2^57.I think now one can start judging the faith one can have in the authors and the book. The authors make it apparent in the first few chapters itself that one should not expect any sensible treatment of the topic. I would recommend this book to all those who have never experienced frustration in life and are looking for a first-hand experience."},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"This is the third Java Security book that I have read. The first two left me wondering about why I would apply a technology. This book covers the all standards and api's for implementing security in a Java based environment, but it adds the element of why and when to apply a particular strategy. The Heltons have described many different types of attacks and what you can do to combat them by using the strategies outlined. I found that much more useful than a regurgitation of specs, standards, and api's.This book also has details, with code, of crytographic algorithms and key exchange algorithms, and describes the strengths and weaknesses of all of them. Really detailed.This book covers all the bases. It could be used as a reference manual, a text on Java Security, or a handbook for an IT Security Manager. I'm keeping right by my keyboard."},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"I picked up this book some time ago, when I needed a good book on how to manage certainproblems with a cryptographic application I was developing. I already had exposure tothe concepts of cryptography, and all I needed was a way to tie it in with Java. I hadread the Security FAQ at the Java website, but was needing more.This book was an excellent contrast to the Security packages FAQ. Cryptic comments wereexplained in much more detail, and many examples are included. For those who don't havemuch exposure to cryptography, there's a whole section on it.All in all, a great value!"},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"I ordered this book along with few other items and I recieved this for a $ and the shipping is also free.

If you buy few books, I doubt this one will help."},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"This book not only provides the information necessary to understand and implement Java security, but does so in a very organized and readable manner. The use of comparisons to real world (non-IT) security should prove particularly useful to those fairly new to IT security issues. Similarly, the implementation examples are very helpful to those actually implementing Java security solutions. Very nicely done!"},{"Title":"Java Security Solutions","review":"This book has some of the same code from an earlier book title the \\"Java Security Handbook\\".

I recommend it highly as a source for how Christmas was depicted and celebrated in 19th Century America. It even shows the first known Christmas card."},{"Title":"Conversations With Menuhin","review":"Conversations with Menuhin is a bountiful book, fully engaged, intelligent, and important. It contains a lengthy conversation between two men - Yehudi Menuhin, by every standard one of the 20th century's greatest artists and thinkers, and David Dubal, a provocative writer and musician. I repeat: this book presents a CONVERSATION. It is not a smacking little knock off of injudicious tidbits, and not a glitzy, pre-packaged, hit-the-gossip points tv interview. Granted there are few enough Americans who any longer have even a vague notion of what conversation consists, but one finds in these pages what one may have lost. The vitriol often concocted against Dubal is simply fantastical, and displays an unfettered prejudice never explaining itself. Dubal is completely engaged as a full partner in a conversation with Menuhin, nothing less. The conversation takes place during the course of a number of sittings, and fully states so. Yes, one of course reads the book to absorb the thought of Menuhin, yet Dubal-- to his credit--respects Yehudi Menuhin sufficiently to engage himself fully as a worthy partner, enabling a wonderful conversation between two thinking people to ensue. And it's a beautiful conversation we're lucky to have. Both men are by turns humorous, unafraid, and knowing. Certainly the insights with which the book abounds lay waste to the regrettable idea that musicians should talk about Beethoven and play their instruments and leave engaged thoughtfulness to others. For those with such views, A Current Affair and Entertainment Tonight should remain your intellectual source, and more power to you. Don't be misled. I will turn to this book again and again to this thoughtful book over the years, finding in its richness and concision a poignant and vital antidote to a culture saturated to the point of delirium with the gross flimsiness of the worship of so-called entertainment values. Buy it, read it, be encouraged and renewed."},{"Title":"Conversations With Menuhin","review":"Editorial reviews are not always fair. Very often they are ambivalent and when they are not, it is because they are biased. Not so on this occasion. It hits the nail right on the head.One should also take note that Menuhin is not the author, not at all! For the first part on musicians, there is some sort of balance between the interviewee and interviewer. Coming to the second and third part, the author alone is taking the lead, asking questions which Menuhin had obviuosly not given much thought to, and wouldn't care much about. Many of them are framed in a way that appears bizarre to any intellectual.The most disappointing thing would rather be, there is not much on music and musicians. Who cares about what the author says anyway, if he was not talking to Menuhin? But if the author intended to eclipse Menuhin, what is the point of talking to him? That must be the reason why the book is titled Conversations With Menuhin: for this isn't even an interview as such!In any event, the most detailed coverage Menuhin made was on his own mentor Enescu. That was apparently not to the interest of the authour. So the coverage was brief and is restricted to a few words of compliment on what a great violinist and musician he was. In response to the author's extremely leading questions, Menuhin also touched upon Kempff the pianist. Again, that was restricted to how his approach-- and approach only-- in interpreting Beethoven is different from the other less established pianists. He also mentioned about his admiration for Furtwangler, particularly the latter's relationship with Karajan and vice versa. Again, very brief. There is almost nothing beyond common knowledge.Instead, the author at variuos points, instead of drawing from Menuhin's strength as a topmost music maker-- probabaly because of the author's inadequacy in making any genuine music -- verged onto exposing Menuhin's weakeness as a musicologist by showing himself off! The author at one point suggested that music after the Classical Period, be it Chopin or whosoever, is sensuous and devious... despite the fact that the author is so blind worshipping the sexually oozing Horowitz; and yet he is so quick in rediculing the childishness of the great modern composer and pianist B. Britten!! Fortunately, Menuhin avoided many such naive questions. How could anyone expect Menuhin, as a top performing artist, to comment on this, however true the assertion might have been? What kind of conversaton is this, when his guest has to resort to avoid the questions?In the third part, what the author even roamed into politics and life and philosophy etc. He was in fact making a ridicule of both the interviewer and interviewee (and also the readers).There isn't much substance in the whole book, not just the third part. And yet, with regret, that is about the breadth and depth of this book! This books should fairly and squarely be renamed \\"One-sided Conversations With Menuhin\\" a books that is engineered to boost the author's own fame in a rather reckless way. All stars given should go to Menuhin alone and for those taken away all, it was all because of the ulterior-motive and deficiency of the author and him alone."},{"Title":"Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho","review":"I am from WI so Ed Gein was a household name. I hadread one book before, but this one was MUCH better.It grabs you from the moment you start it. Even thoughyou know the ending, it gives you a lot of insight intoEd Geins world, which was wicked. What you saw on theoutside. A man with no family left, a mother who taughthim women were evil. People made mention of the factthat he was \\"weird\\" but just Eddie Gein. Little didthey know the evil inside his mind and his farmhouse.Yes, he was mentally ill but I do believe he knew whathe was doing,as he made lampshades etc.In a way you do feel sorry for him, only a little.It took me one day to read. Lets just thank he was neverlet out...."},{"Title":"Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho","review":"This is a well-researched book about Ed Gein, the mild mannered, Midwestern psychopath from Plainfield, Wisconsin who, in the nineteen fifties, would shock the nation with his gruesome crimes. Ed Gein would become the basis for the best selling book by Robert Bloch, \\"Psycho\\", as well as for the Hitchcock film of the same name. Accounts of Ed Gein's heinous crimes would also enter the consciousness of a young Tobe Hooper who, as an adult, would write and direct the classic cult film, \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\".The author writes a cogent, factual account of the life of Ed Gein and the grisly crimes that shocked the nation at the time of their discovery. It details the hold that Ed's domineering mother had on him, a hold that would manifest itself in unimaginable ways. It is almost hard to believe that this small, inoffensive man could be such a madman, but who but a madman would do what he did? Ed Gein, it was discovered, had turned his small farmhouse into a gruesome charnel house, replete with furnishings adorned with human flesh and bones.Aficionados of true crime will find this book fascinating, as it is a well-written account of one of the most horrifying and bizarre series of crimes ever to be committed. Eight pages of photographs are included in the book and serve to provide the reader with a brief, visual glimpse into the life of Ed Gein, a man with a secret hobby so depraved that it would shock the entire nation when it came to light. Lovers of true crime accounts will be fascinated by this well researched foray into the life of a seemingly innocuous man from America's heartland who ended up being so deviant from the norm."},{"Title":"Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho","review":"Either Investigation ID or Bio did a piece on \\"Eddie\\" Gein (rhymes with \\"Fiend\\") which is why I bought this non-fiction 1987 account of his life & crimes...to see why Norman Bates was based on Wisconsin Eddie is now understandable. Ma had a ginormous destructive effect on young Eddie's psyche and it turned into incomprehensible violence and worse when he came of age in little ol' Plainfield...this is a very objective period piece of the 50's when life as well as most movies were black and white. The author does a great job-covering all the bases- and is objective (which is hard to be in the end). Very much worth a read for those who are fascinated by serial killers; necrophilia; human skin harvesting and the evil that some mothers do...this is a top shelf book in its genre."},{"Title":"The Walls of Jolo","review":"Soldier, actor and writer Alan Caillou was not some sort of great literary figure or novelist but he was just a good storyteller and \\"Walls of Jolo\\" is a perfect example of his work. This entertaining, vivid and suspenseful novel is a bloody (there is an incredible amount of headcutting in this book) fictional telling of the quite savage \\"wars of peace\\" between the US Army and Filipinos at the turn of the 20th century. In this case it focuses on the deeds of the brutal, brave, skilled but somehow doomed Moros of Sulu Island. The main characters, US Army officer Shay Sullivan, Moro warlord Jokiri, his adopted daughter(?) Medina, and British deserter Dawson are skillfully drawn. Yes, the story can be a bit hackneyed and melodramatic at times but also touching and horrifying. You also learn a fair amount about guerrilla warfare and various nasty Moro edged weapons - the barong, the kampilan and others. Lots of fun and would make a great (R-rated) movie!"},{"Title":"The Walls of Jolo","review":"I just saw the movie, The Last Samari, and scenes in the movie could have been taken from this book.

This is not instead of Father, or the Good Shepherd, or the Rock, or any of the many words we use to describe God. Smith shows how the words used in the Bible are male based because of the culture of the times. Allowing ourselves to call God Mother opens up a whole new view and image of God, without destroying the Male image. If we here on earth believe that a child grows up best with a father and a mother - doesn't it also make sense that as a child of God we have a heavenly Father AND a heavenly Mother? Smith doesn't destroy the image of God he adds to it, and challenges us to use inclusive language in church messages and music. With single parent families ever increasing and mothers mostly doing the raising of the children, it is getting increasingly harder for people to conjur up the image of a loving heavenly Father. This book will help you see a bigger, clearer, and beautiful image of God. A strong recommend."},{"Title":"Is It Okay to Call God \\"Mother\\"?: Considering the Feminine Face of God","review":"Smith writes an excellent book that goes into great detail on how to understand God as female and Mother. He writes not with anger, but with great love and concern and sensitivity, coming from a background as I do of not originally believing this was appropriate. To do this, he goes through point by point in the Old and New Testament, and early church history, looking at how God was understood and referred to, and how Jesus saw God. How El Shaddai can be very easily read in the Hebrew as \\"The Breasted One\\"- She who provides us with the milk of mercy and compassion of the womb, as the early church mothers and fathers referred to her, and as is referred to countless times in metaphor in the Old Testament. Smith takes us through his own process of discernment and revelation, as the Holy Spirit revealed to him who She is (using the Hebrew gender case in the Old Testament), and the steps that one can take in their own church to assist in this revelation. Yet he always insists that, on a personal level, the feminine be used only if it is helpful for the individual. He shares the meanings and interpretations of Paul's writings on women, for Swift rightfully points out that our treatment of women is intimately connected to our treatment of God- whether or not we see God as also female. Through it all, Swift remains committed to orthodoxy, and has a strong commitment to scripture. He in no way rejects seeing God as male, or advocates that God is a person and has gender in the same way we do- but rather, that God encompasses both male and female, both being acceptable metaphors for understanding who He is.The only thing I'd question in this book was Smith's extensive use of the argument that Father God was used at one time because Father represented power and compassion in a society, and Mother did not, and so, back in the day, it would have been inappropriate to use Mother in referring to God, but now, in this day and age, it is permissible. While the argument has some merit, it really refers only to the West. It would imply that, within the 2/3rds world, where the concept of Woman and Mother are still often denigrated, that God should not be spoken of as Mother. And I think the rest of the arguments and discussion Swift lays out belies this idea. There are simply too many other positives to being able to see God as Mother, even in a culture that does not value women in the same way as men. For the women in the culture learn that God is like them, for they also are in Her image, and the men in the culture learn to value the women much more, for they also are in His image.Having gone through my own conversion experience to see the Gospel's call for he emancipation of women, I related with relish to much of what Swift wrote. This I think will be a further step on my own journey. I have often referred, in my most intimate of moments, to God as Girlfriend. God as Mother is a bit more difficult, a bit more jarring. As Swift points out, there is cognitive dissonance there to begin with. But often, dissonance can be good, in helping us appreciate new realities, and break open the box we've put God into, stripping us of idolatry. It can often be simply that we have for so long understood God in one way, it is difficult in the beginning to understand Her anew. But as I practice this, I also begin to see God anew, and feel Her presence as a Mother, in a new, and very intimate way, being born again, as Spirit gives birth to Spirit."},{"Title":"Is It Okay to Call God \\"Mother\\"?: Considering the Feminine Face of God","review":"In this book Paul R. Smith points out a number of places where Hebrew or Greek words that have a feminine origin have been translated as masculine rather than implying their origin. He also demonstrates some mistranslations in the Bible. For example, the word \\"ezer\\" which is used for woman as a \\"helpmate\\" or \\"helper\\" for Adam actually has the implication of one who is a life saver.He builds a case for the actual masculine AND feminine nature of God based on qualities and meanings of the original Hebrew and Greek words. He also analyzes the meaning of the word \\"Abba\\" as being like \\"Daddy,\\" meaning a nurturer and protector and educator, that is, not in a masculine disciplinary or simply authoritarian role but a role much like modern moms.In addition he makes a case for the damage that can be done in presenting God only as masculine. Some people have been abused by their fathers, or males. Of course, some people have also been abused by their mothers and females. Therefore to limit the depiction of God as a male or a female is actually harmful to many. Also, it easily can both make females feel marginalized and may perpetuate an attitude of male superiority and values. He shows how these attitudes do not represent those of Jesus or Paul.Naturally there is more to this book, but the above examples show some of the content of the book. He argues that using feminine language as well as masculine language to depict God allows men and women to change their attitude to God and women in a positive AND accurate way.As a woman, I was glad to see such a book written by a male. My experience has been that when a woman makes the same type of arguments, her opinion is often devalued as coming from a strident feminist.I think EVERY Christian pastor and person in a position of influence in a church should read this book, and I would hope they put Mr. Smith's recommendations into practice even if it feels uncomfortable or \\"unnatural\\" at first. Since generally more than 50% of churchgoers are women, why not use inclusive language wherever it can be used? (This does not imply that one should mis-translate the Bible, but truly translate it.)"},{"Title":"Is It Okay to Call God \\"Mother\\"?: Considering the Feminine Face of God","review":"This book helped me to see the value of women in the eyes of God. Not just as a delicate flower but as a strong spiritual force in the body of Christ. This book is theologically sound and easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in expaning their perception of God!"},{"Title":"Carrier 18: Island Warriors","review":"I am starting to lose my patience with the Carrier series. Ever since the publisher started putting the books on a six or so months sched, the quality has really taken a nose dive.In this book, the character development is really poor. Instead of getting to know the odd aviator or seaman, they all seem to be interchangeable parts with similar dialogue. I can't tell at times whether Batman or Coyote is doing the talking.It seems that the plotting is out of control. In the earlier books, the secondary and diplomacy scenes helped the plot, but in this book they distract from the main plot.The last three books have been the worst of the series and I am at the point where I have almost given up. It seems when the author spent the time to write, the book was good. If you really want to enjoy this series, read the first eight books.I'd rather wait a couple of years to get a good book than get mediocre stuff every six months."},{"Title":"Carrier 18: Island Warriors","review":"this is fairly typical of the last few books in the series, unresolved sub plots, shoddy editing, implausible scenarios. But the next one starts getting the series back on track.The thing that disturbs me most is that the author barely mentioned an important recurring character at the beginning of book 16, killed the character off at the end of book 17 after not being mentioned anywhere else in the story, and then in books 18 and 19 acted as if the character disappeared in book 16 not 17. He's writing the books so fast he can't even keep track of his own characters."},{"Title":"Carrier 18: Island Warriors","review":"Plot is kinda lose needed to be tighten up a bit over all a fairly good read ..

Ms. Andrews acknowledges that although fissures occurred within the Methodist religion, cohesiveness existed among its followers. In fact, an interesting chapter explains that Methodism precipitated opportunity for freedom and advancement for African-Americans. Paradoxically, Methodism advocated the separation of church and state. The narrative illustrates how Methodism differed from other religions in one aspect: Methodism inculcated the members into the faith prior to churchgoers learning the tenets. Additionally, Ms. Andrews argues that the American Revolution galvanized the Methodist association; by 1800, Methodism influenced a large part of the United States. Overall, the author uses useful documentation and appendices, but sometimes quotes to an excessive extent."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Biochemistry","review":"I used this book while pursuing my B.S. in Biochemistry and it is the best study guide I ever used.

However, the book is not perfect, and in spite of its strengths it pales in many respects to other, more obscure textbooks.Leney's book generally follows the contemporary Teach Yourself format: dialogues are followed by vocabulary (first phrase-for-phrase glosses, then individual new words), then come exercises, and finally at the end of each lesson is a dialogue spoken more quickly in more authentic language that the student is challenged to at least get the gist of. Each lesson is dedicated to a specific subject, such as shopping, going to the doctor, or (towards the end) talking about history and politics. There are Finnish-English and English-Finnish vocabularies and, something which all other TY volumes should emulate, some advice on where to go next (books, websites, radio, etc.).While things like asking directions is a typical topic in beginner's textbook, I rather disagree with Leney's giving it so much attention. The lost tourist asking directions in limited Finnish is likely just going to be answered in English, Finnish people being so at ease with talking to foreigns in it. Rather, the challenge for people new to Finland is feeling at ease with a group of native speakers, such as classmates or coworkers, and so starting off with asking directions isn't so efficient, nor is the early emphasis on talking to bank tellers.The CDs are absolutely essential.

Agglutinating languages need much more drill than, say, Spanish or Italian, but the exercises here are few and train the student more to utter stock phrases than to internalize the huge amount of endings that conversational Finnish requires.

Whitney's can be useful, but he introduces grammatical minutae far in advance of their use to the learner and gives an extensive vocabulary for each chapter even when most of it is irrelevant to what is being learned in the chapter.

It is visually attractive--but is that enough?Finnish is a complex language with exacting pronunciation, complex grammar, and an extensive network of internal sound changes that must be explained clearly and completely. The student cannot assimilate these structures without reinforcement from exercises and readings. None of these elements are sufficiently provided in this book.Compare this poverty of resources with the very fine course by Meri Lehtinen (books and recordings published by Indiana University) and with the two second-best runners up, the Foreign Service Institute's Finnish course, also with book and recordings, and &quot;Finnish for Foreigners,&quot; (books and recordings) published in Finland but widely available in the English-speaking world."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Finnish","review":"Terttu Leney's &quot;Finnish: a complete course for beginners&quot; is a good resource for the beginning student or for the traveler who is planning a trip to Finland and wants to know a little bit about the Finnish language and Finnish customs before they get there.Finnish is a difficult language with complicated grammar and special rules of syntax. At times the reader might get a little confused by Leney's presentation of some of these rules. But a patient and persistent reader can either muddle through the grammar or pass it by and instead focus upon learning Finnish expressions.The book's strength is its organization into logical sections (greetings, travel, phone conversations, eating out, the weather etc.) Both a traveler or a student can use the dialogues and vocabulary to gain insight into everyday phrases and events. Likewise the book is packed full of information about Finnish customs and culture. These explanations are integrated into dialogues and vocabularies suited to both student and traveler.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the Finnish language in its practical day to day form, or to the sophisticated traveler who likes to learn about the country and its culture and customs before their trip."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Finnish","review":"Even as a German reader I found this book very helpful and easy to follow.

This was the first tool I used to learn Finnish until I took classes at a university with a major in Finnish Studies. It presents a lot of the rules of Finnish grammar and vocabulary, maybe too much in each chapter. Just take your time with studying. I think if you study about one chapter per week with a small review and then proceed, you should do well. Go at a faster pace if you feel you can. Finnish is a wonderful language once you learn how it fits together. A few good things is that you don't need to memorize genders(no masculine, feminine, neuter genders in Finnish) such as many other languages have. Also there are very few irregular verbs. So the rules are pretty straight forward once you understand them and that will take time and practice. I don't think Finnish is necessarily \\"hard\\", just different from the logic of English and its related languages. For a beginner, I think \\"Finnish For Foreigners\\" is better since lessons are divided into small units each with a new topic instead of many topics grouped into a few chapters. Another text/cassette pack is \\"Mastering Finnish\\", by Borje Vahamaki. Finnish for Foreigners is rather expensive and harder to come by. If you can't purchase it, try out Teach Yourself or Mastering Finnish. Audio cassettes are also a great help in memorization and correct pronunciation.

One example is often deemed enough to explain a pattern and in Finnish that's really not true. For example: an early dialogue in the banking chapter gives you a canned phrase for \`What is the exchange rate of the pound?' but they don't explain the construct and they don't illustrate how you would ask about the exchange rate of the dollar, franc, ruble, etc. You're left to guess about it, and you'll probably make a mistake somewhere when you guess because Finnish words have lots of little quirks when you put endings on them. It's a shame to get one canned phrase instead of a useful, reusable pattern, but that's how this book works.Chapters are by topic, like banking, asking directions, travelling, having a sauna, and so on. This also leads to a neglect of pattern and structure, and you get quite a load of unexplained grammatical features from very early on in the book; the dialogues just don't do enough to illustrate the structures.The exercises are very limited, often of the form \`What does x mean' or 'Which of the following means x.' There are also little games like word finds which are of dubious usefulness.There is a glossary at the back, but it is Finnish-English only.On the plus side: you get a lot of dialogues; the speakers on the audio tapes are clear and free of annoying mannerisms. You will get lots of practice with basic niceties of conversation and the grammar explanations are easy to understand (just not illustrated enough.)If you can find / afford it, go with FSI's Conversational Finnish instead; it's better organized and moves at a much more sensible pace. The FSI graded reader is nice for intermediate syntax and vocabulary, too."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Finnish","review":"This is a useful book which covers a reasonable amount of ground without being overambitious. The main drawback is that the chapters are quite long and lacking in clear focus. There are a few other, minor irritations: the example dialog in Chaper 1 is also *way* too advanced and in fact includes a grammatical feature which is never explained anywhere in the book ! This is very offputting to the beginner. The glossaries for the various dialogs are also inconsistent - some words are defined multiple times throughout the book, some not at all. Overall this is so-so for self-study, but would perform well in a teacher-led environment."},{"Title":"Perl Database Programming","review":"This is the intro best book about Perl and databases out there. The book assumes you know nothing about databases and only the rudiments of Perl. It has lots and lots of examples, and several parts that I find myself coming back to often as a reference.The book starts with a very brief introduction to the basic concepts and jargon of databases (about 35 pages), and then it jumps into the meat of the book, 13 chapters (about 450 pages) that mainly teach by example. That is, when a chapter explains something (whether it's a bit of SQL syntax like &quot;select max(x) from y where...&quot;, or a concept like transactions, or an interface detail like templates or tied hashes), it explains it in terms of how it solves a problem.Then the book illustrates each idea in terms of a real program that does a real task -- like a program for a CGI-based photo database, or a command-line program that searches a database of books, or a Tk-based (GUI) program that searches an address-book database. Each program's source is shown in full, and also with explanation of a few lines a time. Experienced and attentive readers can freely skip a lot of the commentary, but those explanations can come in very handy if you're not very experienced, or if you are reading the chapters out of order (as you might, if you jump in and want to try writing a program like in chapter 10, without reading all of 1-9 first). The Perl code is unassuming, clear, robust, and rigorously secure.The book ends with 40 pages of appendices (plus 30 pages of index). The first of the four appendices is a tutorial on installing Perl, the Perl database modules, MySQL, and a web server -- I found this very helpful for setting up a development environment on my laptop so that I could experiment with database programming. The second appendix is a reference of the most common SQL commands, with examples. The third appendix is a reference of useful MySQL-specific commands, with examples. The last appendix is a reference to DBI commands (the Perl module for talking to databases). I have found all these appendices very worthwhile, and I refer to them quite often.Before I read this book, I had been avoiding using real databases for years, and I instead used flakey substitutes like flat-file &quot;databases&quot;, or simple Unix DBMs. I read this book on and off over the course of a few weeks, and at the end I thought &quot;that's it!? This isn't so hard! What was I avoiding all these years!?&quot;. And I got up and within hours wrote a database-based CGI system that I had been meaning to write for ages. Over the years, I have come to recognize this feeling of &quot;this book makes it look so easy! I REALLY wish I had read it years ago!&quot; as the sign of a great book."},{"Title":"Perl Database Programming","review":"I bought this book to learn some advance database programming specifically with Oracle which the book claims it does cover. However, what I found was a perl mysql programming book that has devoted half its contents to web site development (which I'm not interested in). I think this book should be renamed to &quot;website development using perl and mysql&quot;. If you really just want to learn database programming using perl read &quot;programming DBI&quot;"},{"Title":"Perl Database Programming","review":"I bought this book simply because it had a section on Session Management, so I went straight to that section (chapter 9). When I tried to get the code working, it became obvious that there was something missing, notably an HTML template. No problem I thought - there's probably an addendum on-line. Unfortunately not - a search led to Michalski's home page with nothing more useful than a statement saying it is his intention to get addenda for all his books up online at some point (but no indication as to when). The publishers, Wiley, have all the files from the book available for download, but unfortunately not the missing template.Now I realise the pressure to get books into print in this fast moving field must be intense, but if your willing to let errors slip through then you must take your after sales service very seriously, and get an online addendum up and running when that book hits the shelves. This book has been available for over a year now, come on!I did email Michalski direct 2 weeks ago but so far no response. I expect my email was lost in a torrent of spam.I will persevere and try to work out what the missing html should look like - I guess it could be worse - it could have been the Perl code that was missing - but quite frankly I haven't got time to fill in gaps left by someone else's lack of professionalism - especially when I'm paying for it!Thumbs down to support - I'll be avoiding Michalski and Wiley in future."},{"Title":"Perl Database Programming","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The whole book is like a big piece of source code with line-by-line explaination. If you are like me, knowing perl but not so familiar with it, sometime perl can be hard to decipher. This book solves this by going though a lot of source codes line by line and explain the details. I wish every book on perl can be written this way."},{"Title":"Perl Database Programming","review":"This book will be called Perl and MySQL database programming, the book comment say that this include access to many databases, including Oracle and PostgreSQL, when you read this, you can see that the only database that Brent use is MySQL.

How could king do this to the mother of his kids?!This guy is actually one of Cauffiel's oddest killer's yet.How did he think he could get away with it? How could he have actually ever become a cop?? Also included in this book are some good family photos,including some unintentionally hilarious pictures of killer king himself,obese and bald in a cheap looking plaid suit.What did these women see in this absolute moron?A MUST READ"},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"Eye of the Beholder is thoroughly researched and a very well written true crime novel. Lowell Cauffiel tells of the investigation and prosecution of Brad King for the murder of his wife and TV news anchorwoman, Diane King, in a way that makes you really understand the human failings in the investigation which are made up for only with dogged determination and some wonderful strokes of luck. As a former law enforcment officer and current prosecutor, I found it to be a fair telling of the investigation, warts and all, as well as an accurate portrayal of the interaction between many law enforcement agencies. Proof once again that human beings investigate crimes and do make mistakes; but that mistakes made, if recognized and admitted, can be remedied."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"Lowell Cauffiel has done a tremendous job in detailing the investigation of Diane King's murder. Her husband, Brad King, was the main suspect after the initial interviews and crime scene reconnaissance, but with some police errors and departmental territorialism, the forensic evidence that could have tied Brad to the murder was lost or inadmissible. I felt the frustration of the prosecutors and Diane's family during the year after her murder, particularly after learning so much about Brad and what a very strange person he is. I also appreciated that Diane King was portrayed realistically - with both positive and negative attributes. It was very interesting to read the psychological profiles of Brad King and what behaviorists have written on criminals, and at the end of the book Cauffiel noted his own analysis of the man and the crime. It's a sad story, very well written."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"Caulfiel's look at the sensational murder of Battle Creek, Michigan anchor woman Diane King is extremely detailed and encompasses a wide range of issues. To Caulfiel's credit, he avoids overdramatizing events and putting a distinct spin on the story. This is a pitfall some true crime writers fall into but Caulfiel does not. He also paints a vivid picture of the small town atmosphere of Marshall, Michigan. The comments from King himself are also intriguing.My main complaint with this book is that it is far too long. Much of the more boring mintuae of the investigation is unnecessary and plodding to read. A lot of issues are rehashed several times. Also, very little detail is given about how King's children were faring with her family after the trial. That would have been time better spent.All in all, it's a good effort but could use some paring down."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"This is another of those (in)famous \\"true crime\\" books that are a delight to read despite their subject matter. The research was stupendous but best of all was the ability of the author to create a compelling story from the disparate components. True, this is no FATAL VISION or HELTER SKELTER but it is a very good read. My only complaint is one heard often - too much unimportant detail that detracts from the power of the story. Bradford King was almost obscenely compelling as the \\"average Joe\\" who went over the top and committed the ultimate crime. Good Read."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"I ordered this book after watching a crime show (City Confidential?) that discussed the murder of a popular news broadcaster in a small Midwestern City. I have a friend who was born and raised in that city so I was particularly drawn to the story. Murder is usually puzzling, but I just had to know more about the victim and circumstances surrounding her death. The author did an exemplary job of portraying the characters in the book--particularly the crime victim and the culprit. It sounds like a cliche, but I could not put the book down. I look forward to reading more books by the author."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"This happened in my town a while back. So wanted to read about it.

Murder is never the right way to 'dissolve'the problem."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"This is a very dramatic story, mostly because much of it is made up.Like another reviewer, I was a student of King's at the time all of this took place. There are so many inaccuracies in the book, I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be about King if his face weren't splashed across the cover (the version I read has a family portrait on the front cover).If you are looking for facts, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a decent book to pass the time, this will do the trick."},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"I came across this book very recently. Although the actual events occured over 10 yrs ago, it still interested me.As the author presents it, this seems like a very dramatic, compelling story. Unfortunately, the truth exists and this is not it.

By examining thesetriggers, and then creating a &quot;relapse preventionplan&quot;, the addicted individual canusually find a way to avoid relapse.However, my summary does not do the book justice.I _strongly_ urge everyone who can to pick up thisbook. It is one of the best books I have readabout the subject of relapse prevention"},{"Title":"Staying Sober: A Guide for Relapse Prevention- Based Upon the CENAPS Model of Treatment","review":"Until this book, the technology to treat repeated relapse into alcoholism and drug addiction did not exist at worst, and was haphazard at best. What the authors did was study relapsers and notice patterns of relapse. These patterns could then be codified and used in a program to identify 'triggers' or situation that lent themselves to relapse, and could thus be avoided in the future. In addition, some tools can be developed to help recovering persons deal with unexpected triggers if and when they arose in the future.It is a lot of work, both for the counselor and for the client, but the payoff is long term sobriety."},{"Title":"Staying Sober: A Guide for Relapse Prevention- Based Upon the CENAPS Model of Treatment","review":"This book is just a MUST for anyone with a chronic relapse problem.

It does a good job of illustrating the symptoms of relapse and provides a basic outline of a plan for recovery.

However, it is also very helpful to those who have not relapsed. I have not, and I read this to gain insight BEFORE it happens to me.

For all its merits as an ethnography of women's shelters, which are many, one of the most endearing things about this book is its author. In 1984 Elliot Liebow found out he had terminal cancer. He promptly quit his job at the National Institute of Mental Health and headed for the soup kitchens and shelters of a small city outside of Washington, D.C. Taking notes &quot;out of habit&quot; he gradually compiled his thoughts (and those of his informants) as he got to know the women of these shelters. His participant-observation approach led him to be very involved as an actor in the lives of the women he met, and they too became involved in the writing of their stories. The result is a fascinating book which details the trials of homelessness alongside the joys and sorrows of being human"},{"Title":"Tell Them Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women","review":"With his book, Tell Them Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women, Elliot Liebow has done an excellent job of putting the facts of shelter life together. His research was not done in a far away library with his nose in a book, rather he learned first hand by working in women's shelters and soup kitchens in Washington DC. In his book, he explores the multitude of ways that &quot;the humanity of the women is under constant threat&quot; and gives the reader an in-depth and intensely personal view into the different facets of the lives of homeless women. Liebow continues throughout the book to deliver the facts to the reader in such a way that they reveal the brutal truth of the women's lives without dragging the reader to a place where (s)he is overcome with pity and shame. Instead, Liebow manages to connect the reader to the women, showing their humanity. I wanted to cheer them on, encourage them, defend each of them, from opinionated Betty to retarded Ginger to Grace, a born-again Christian, although these aren't the actual names of the women. This book makes a the reader see homeless women as people and forces the reader to look beyond stereotypes. It gives the women faces and shows their individuality. Tell Them Who I Am also goes into some detail about the different shelters themselves, the ways they are run, and what function they serve. It also mentions such things as Social Services and Medicare, pointing out what they provide and, very importantly, the weaknesses that these services and others have when dealing with the homeless. These weaknesses are evidenced through the multitude of difficulties that the women experienced in dealing with various &quot;helpful&quot; agencies. Probably the most important reason for a person to read Tell Them Who I Am is that one can learn from it. The facts contained within this very well-written book are the facts that could go a long way toward a better understanding of homeless women and what can be done to aid them. The fear that &quot;in all its forms stands out,&quot; can be worn away with some of the understanding can be found in this book."},{"Title":"Tell Them Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women","review":"I have been reading and researching the United States homeless issues for a few months and found this book to be fairly insightful.

This is a very palatable introductory book to the general issues of homelessness in America today."},{"Title":"Tell Them Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women","review":"Tell them who I am was a great read. what better way to share the stories of homeless women than to be right there with them day to day as they face each struggle and try to dig themselves out of the situation they are in.Unless you have been there, you don't really understand. Elliot Liebow does a great job in connecting with each woman and sharing her story, how she feels and the tough choices she must make each day that people who are not homeless, are oblivious to.To gain a better understanding of how some women live, and how you can help people, read this book. It will touch your heart and your soul."},{"Title":"Tell Them Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women","review":"In a world of McMansions, there is homelessness. Liebow is a participant-observer. He had written TALLY'S CORNER at an earlier point.Elliot Liebow tries to make the relationships with the women symmetrical. In his study he ignores mental illness since he is an anthropologist. Three night shelters and a day shelter are portrayed. The names of persons and places are changed.Women come into homelessness because they are poor and powerless. Hard living is the norm. Street living creates problems of bathing, washing, eating, and sleeping sufficiently and safely. There is perennial fatigue and boredom. Protection of belongings and lack of storage creates bag ladies. Health suffers. Treatment of choice is unavailable.Some women are too sick, old, or crazy to work. Others value work over walking all day. Looking for work is a way of holding onto humanity.Shelters replace broken families. Mentally disabled residents have difficulty with their own relatives over money and power. Some residents hit the streets when they fear violence will erupt. Shelter providers fear violent behavior and keep records. Black-listing is common.The women suffer from losses of privacy and dignity. They prefer a shelter Liebow calls The Refuge where few questions are asked. Providers of services to the unsheltered fear creating dependency. History shows that after the Great Depression, the opportunities presented by World War Two emptied out the skid rows.Religious belief is a topic of shelter talk. Women see themselves as equal before God. Belief can invest homelessness with meaning.The women talk about jobs, not careers. Elementary security is a paramount concern. The women are prevented from planning through their sense of powerlessness. They live one day at a time as a coping strategy.Homelessness is rooted in poverty. Unemployment, underemployment, and substandard wages are causes.

Liebow also manages to weave together personal stories from real women with shocking information regarding the homeless, their plight and why they are in it. This weave means that the book is easy to read and connect with while also being incredibly informative. I learned a huge amount by reading this book. I really do think that everyone should read it.

Yet equally impressive in this volume is the translator's ability to so richly present the depth of the No theater in clear, concise introductory essays that preface each play while locating them within a broader historical and literary context. This feature makes the text perfect for casual readers and devoted students alike. Tyler's general introduction to the No provides a solid theoretical background for complete beginners, explaining the foundations of the art, its prevalent symbolism and themes, and text- and performance-related terminology, while the aforementioned play-specific introductions offer perceptive critical analyses that follow and expand upon current Japanese No scholarship. Also worth mentioning in this respect are the footnotes. As readers of Tyler's \\"The Tale of Genji\\" translation will recall, the author supplies a great deal of explanatory notes to the text, both clarifying less-than-obvious intended meanings and pointing out references to other works. Since intertextuality forms such a vital aspect of classical Japanese literature, Tyler's decision to document each allusion proves invaluable for readers who are familiar with Japanese canonical texts or who seek to better appreciate the literary resonance of certain recurrent images and phrases. Furthermore, considering that a few of the No plays featured in this collection are nearly impossible to understand without basic knowledge of their social, religious, or historical background, readers will find themselves most grateful for Tyler's eminently helpful (yet never intrusive) explanations.Of course, as impressive as the scholarship is here, it would mean little if the translations of the selected plays were substandard. Thankfully this is by no means the case. Tyler's renderings of each work compare favorably with the various other translations I've stumbled across, and the language he has chosen is simple yet elegant--doubtless an apt reflection of the No theater itself. As Tyler explains, although No is essentially a performance art and as such must be experienced live to be fully grasped, this certainly does not deprive the texts of their literary value. The poetry of \\"Matsukaze\\" alone is enough to convince one of this fact, and several other plays are equally lyrical and profound in their expression.On a personal note, I have never been fortunate enough to attend an actual performance (which are rather difficult to find outside Japan), and my interest in the No is a product of reading volumes such as this; and yet, in spite of such apparent limitations, I can claim that multiple No plays rank among the greatest literature I have ever studied. Surely Royall Tyler's fine translations and careful attention to detail are in large part responsible for this occurrence. Five stars without hesitation."},{"Title":"Japanese No Dramas (Penguin Classics)","review":"The significance and effect of Noh drama is roughly equivalent to that of the plays of the great tragedians of ancient Greece. Noh combines the spiritual influences of the Buddhist and Shinto religions and the Japanese flair for densely woven, yet elegantly simple, verse in haunting allegories of enlightenment. Every detail, from set construction to the ritual motions of the actors on stage, heightens the poignancy of the plots. While the text of many of the plays are only a few pages long; a performance of a Noh play can last several hours. These plays are not only touching and intensely spiritual, but also provide a valuable resource for westerners who want to understand the roots of Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Japanese No Dramas (Penguin Classics)","review":"Tyler is known as an authority on Japanese Literature and this volume serves an excellent introduction to No drama which is quite philosophical and religious in background. Tyler includes several plays which are interesting from both an academic and asthetic viewpoint. I would like to make the suggestion to readers to look up some of Tyler's academic papers in titles such as &quot;The Noh play Matsukaze as a transformation of Genji Monogatari&quot; in Monumenta Nipponica. You can search in Jstor.com at your university library for his articles by author. His work in academic journals is top-notch."},{"Title":"Japanese No Dramas (Penguin Classics)","review":"In college I picked up a copy of no dramas and started thumbing through. The plays really caught my attention. The plays are mostly short, and have an emotional impact. The funny thing is, in my opinon, even though these plays are ancient an canonized in Japan, to me, they seemed really off the wall and funky. These plays are easy to read and sympathetic. Not what you might be expecting if you have any prejudgements..."},{"Title":"Japanese No Dramas (Penguin Classics)","review":"I appreciate that no plays are supposed to be seen in performance rather than read, and I've never had the opportunity to see one. Still, I enjoyed this book and found it really useful to my understanding of Japanese art. Each play is short and easy to take in, and Tyler's translation is very readable. The explanatory notes provided context and understanding without overwhelming the reader with detail, and the performance directions went some way towards conveying what each play would be like on stage. Some line drawings of typical costumes would have been helpful, as with Tyler's translation of the Tale of Genji, but this is a very minor point. Four stars because I lack the specialist knowledge to make a truly informed judgement here."},{"Title":"Japanese No Dramas (Penguin Classics)","review":"In college I never had the chance to study Japanese No Dramas, and I'm glad that I took the time to purchase this book and go through it.

In WILL TO MURDER, author Gail Feichtinger presents the story of the murders. The book is well written and exhaustively researched, and the result is a thorough and densely layered study of the history of the Congdon family and particularly of two of the main players, Elisabeth's adopted daughter, Marjorie, and her husband of the moment, Roger Caldwell. Without going too deeply into the plot, Marjorie is one of those women who true crime devotees love, a lying, greedy, irresponsible, sociopathic con-woman who refused to deny herself anything she even for a minute wanted, and who routinely spent money that she and Roger didn't have - and I'm not talking an extra 30 cents for a slice of cheese on her Wendy burger - but many hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. Marjorie was above nothing, including stealing from her minor children, but in a twist that will interest anyone reading this, included in Marge's repertoire was arson, at first for profit, but eventually just because she liked setting fires.The back-stories on Marjorie and Roger are extensive and welcome. We learn not only what they did, but about their lives growing up and we get considerable insight into their psyches. This is not a surfacey book, and it is not remotely a fast read.I had some problems reading it. There are so many players in the book that I'd have found it helpful to have a list of the personnel. And while the book is not padded, the police and trial sections are long and tend to drag - a common complaint about true crime. But the biggest issue I had was that I didn't ever really understand the convoluted scheme that was used to effect the murders. Feichtinger regularly refers to various elements of the scheme, but it is never tied together - presented as a whole - and while, for one example much is repeatedly made of when and how Roger Caldwell arrived in Minnesota from Colorado and his subsequent actions, I could never completely get a handle on how it all fit together. This may be due to a lack of careful reading on my part, but it should have been made easier to figure the whole thing out.Still, Feichtinger has produced a hard working and fascinating look at two convoluted though ultimately poorly executed murders. And the detailed examination of the bundle of sleazebag sociopathy that was Marjorie Caldwell and of her hapless husband is very well done. True crime fans will like WILL TO MURDER. Just be prepared to spend some time on it."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"This has to be the most definitive and complete compilation of the facts of the Congdon murders at Glensheen. The authors are to be congratulated on a magnificent volume of work. Truly a Magnum Opus. This book is the ultimate of what the true crime genre should be.

So I grew up hearing whisperings about the gruesome murders. When I toured Glensheen, the tour guides evaded all murder questions. I never really knew the story. My parents bought this book for my birthday, and I after 10 pages I couldn't put it down. It does an excellent job of presenting the facts, but interspersed with great character development, in the form of giving bits of Congdon family history. Engaging and exciting to read. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"Fascinating story. I'm from MN and have toured the Glensheen Mansion many times. I was excited to read this book and am still reading it! Lots of detail, maybe too much detail, but its still an interesting read.On the CON side the type is very small and technically it needs work on typos, paragraphs in the middle of a sentence, unnecessary words etc.If you want an excellent read of a MN crime read \\"Stalking Mary\\"! Its the story of the abduction of a mother and her daughter by Ming Shiue from Roseville, MN."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"Considering that I used to live in the Twin Ports--I lived in Superior, Wisconsin, but the news was mostly from Duluth, Minnesota and surrounding area--this book about the Glensheen murders and events following it was something I just had to read. When a friend of mine asked me what I wanted when I was in the nursing home recently recovering from an accident, I told her I wanted to get \\"Will to Murder\\", so she brought it to me as a gift! I had heard Gail Feichtinger discussing the book with one of the reporters on WCCO-TV out of the Twin Cities earlier this summer, so I just knew I had to read this narrative of one of the most famous murders of the northern Midwest.Although I still wondered about some of the evidence that was found at Glensheen, the discussion of the DNA testing in recent years could have been a sure thing for the prosecution to win the case compared to the faulty evidence that was used in court the first time. It's quite obvious to see how new methods of testing evidence, especially the method of finding DNA on most anything, has turned many cases around. Even if Roger Caldwell didn't do the crime, there were a lot of events that certainly pointed to him. The most glaring scene right after the murders was when all the missing jewelry somehow showed up in Marge Caldwell's possession. How could she have lied so blatantly about her mother's jewelry? I often wondered, as I continued reading this book, how one person could continue to dish up the lies, find more ways to spend money which she didn't have. It just sounded like a spoiled child that never grew up!Since I'm not much of a crime story reader, I sure kept glued to this book since it was about a murder that actually happened right across the Lake (Superior) from us. The history of the family just made it that much more interesting, and the author(s) gave details on the psychological basis for Marge's behavior, too, so that added to the interest of this narrative. Of course, coming from the mindset of a reporter (Feichtinger), one should expect this kind of detail. The appendices gives more detail for the reader--actual photos of the Congdon family, Marge Caldwell Hagen, the Glensheen Mansion, items from the murders of the two women and much more; history of the Congdon family; and other additional information. For anyone that wants to delve into this famous murder of the '70s and more about the ongoing antics of this Marge Caldwell Hagen, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"My husband bought this book for me since I loved touring Glensheen and also I'm a big fan of true crime books.

I had toured the mansion couple times and knew of the story while living here in the Twin Cities.I saw this book for sale and bought it at once. The book is very detailed, stocked up with facts before and after the murders, and very well put together.I first thought it would be a little boring read about Carla and Chester but I did not know how famous and rich they were in Duluth. This book does a good job explaining the eariler life of the Congdon's.Then reading about the murders and after. Man, I didn't know a person could be like that. And she lived in my area in Washington county. Marjorie Congdon Caldwell Hagen really did a lot of \\"bending the truth\\" and getting in trouble. I was suprised they could not get her on some of the facts, which the book later goes through towards the end of the book.I recommend this book for your reading. I didn't know how I would like it but the more I read, the more I was curious on the final ending. I did not know what happened to Roger before the book. It will be interesting to see what ends up with Marjorie and where she will end up.I thought the authors did a good job. I liked some of the photos and even a small family tree to help picture in your head some of the people in the book. At the end there is also a timeline story for you to follow if you wish. The print is smaller then some books but it is packed full of info and the whole story of Marjorie Congdon Caldwell Hagen and how much of a charactor she is."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"Will to Murder Well written cronology of a high-interest local story. Many mysteries still abound. Main suspect still alive, prosecuted suspect relaeased from prison and has died."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"On June 27th, 1977, an intruder broke into the Glensheen Mansion located on Lake Superior in Duluth Minnesota. The only occupants in the large home at the time were the lone heir to the million+ dollar estate, Elisabeth Congdon (83) and her nurse Velma Pietila. The intruder would leave with a basket of jewelry and a few other small items, but not before they murdered the nurse beating her to death with a candlestick, and smothering Elisabeth with a satin pillow.The investigation quickly led in the direction of Elisabeth's adopted daughter Marjorie and her husband Roger. According to Elisabeth's will, upon her death Marjorie would receive 8 million dollars. Three days prior to the murders, Marjorie had authorized a paper stating that once her inheritance came to be, her husband would receive 2.5 million of the given amount. When police investigators turned up where Marjorie and her husband were staying, missing items from the house were found in their possession; which Marjorie claimed were copies of the real jewelry made and given to her perviously by her adopted mother, Elisabeth.50 years earlier Elisabeth Congdon in her early 30&#8242;s having never married, adopted two daughters, Marjorie and Jennifer. Marjorie had always been one looking for the quick fix, expecting everything to be handed to her even long after she had married and moved away. She continuously asked Elisabeth for money for one idea or another, even stooping as low to forge a doctor's letter saying her husband had a serious illness.As the case went on, Roger and Marjorie were both tried for the crimes, Roger was convicted, and a year later Marjorie was acquitted. What follows in the book is a continued investigation into Marjorie's life, her growing up as a Congdon and her continued self-destructive lifestyle that led to even more deaths... none of which she was ever arrested for.The Congdon story is one that is quite close to me literally. The mansion itself is located in Duluth Minnesota, 2 1/2 hours from my home in Brainerd Minnesota. The trial was moved to Brainerd and in July of 1978 the jury found Roger Caldwell (Marjorie's husband) to be guilty of the crimes.At the time all of this was taking place I was 10 years old. It would be 12 years before I would hear about the murders and with my husband's property in Finland Minnesota, find that I drive by the Glensheen Mansion every time I go through Duluth to the cabin. After the first time I toured the mansion with my sons and husband, I wanted to know more about the family and what had happened.There are many books out there about the Glensheen Mansion, the Congdons, and the murders. I have read quite a few but find this one to be the most detailed account of the property, the background, the trial, and the continuing craziness of all the surrounds Marjorie to this very day. There is even later DNA testing that was not available at the time but was found to link both Roger and Marjorie to the crimes and calls into question her acquittal.Yes, this book is true crime but it is much more than that. It is the story of a home that took many years to build, its the story of a family, and of an adoption. It is a piece of Minnesota History.I have probably toured the Mansion 10 times now, mostly because I have friends who want to stop and do the tour that have not been there before. It is always well taken care of, like stepping back into time, the original fixtures remain, pictures on the wall, furnishings... Originally they had the third floor not available for tour (this was the floor that contained Elisabeth's bedroom) but in the last few years they have expanded the tour to include the third floor as well as the attic which contains large rolls of curtains that the family would use to change out the drapes seasonally as well as all their Christmas decorations."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"One of several books of a series involving the murders at the Glensheen Mansion in Duluth, MN.

I grew up in duluth minnesota about 2 miles from the glensheen mansion so i love to read about the murders and the mansion its self. But if you think this book was a good telling of Marjorie Caldwell LeRoy Hagen you'll love Glensheens Daughter. Its all about Marjorie and her life as a basicly money hungry, demanding, women, not to mention crazy (in my opinion at least). It tells about her murdering her last husband Wallace Hagen not only that but all the fires she started in arizona and over all her whole criminal life. It is great book. Even better than Will to Murder. I recomend it to any one who enjoyed Will to Murder."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"I have followed the story for over 30 years now.I do not see Marjorie as \\"greedy\\", as a normal person would be greedy. She gave more to others and to her children, friends, and family than she did to herself. I think she had a \\"spending\\" problem, I see her as probably a bit spoiled by a person who knew nothing about discipling children, and she certainly was raised in a lifestyle that most of us never had, but did she kill her mother? NO, I don't believe she had anything to do with it. Upon Elisabeth's death, there had to be over 100 people that would have benefited.Her husband never once implicated her as an accomplice, even though he certainly could and had a right to, especially after she dumped him while he was in prison. Even after she was acquitted of the crime in her own trial, her husband certainly could have pointed the finger at her at that time, as she could not have been tried again for the same time. Yet, he did not. In fact, he said to his dying day that he didn't kill them either.I am just wondering why the so-called \\"third party\\" was never gone after, and why the case was closed?I think all of Marjorie's problem were a sign of this anger and rage she had inside of her over this money, that she could never seem to get her hands on. Her mother set the precident by giving her money as she needed it, but after the Trustees got control of it, she had to grovel and was humiliated by it. I would have been mad too, if someone was always trying to keep my money from me. What business is it of theirs if I wanted to spend it all in one day! However, there are proper and improper ways of channeling anger of course.A very good read in my opinion, but way too many holes in the story to be able to know who really did what.Much was based on hearsay."},{"Title":"Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings","review":"I do have an interest in the Glensheen murders, but this book was painful to read. It was full of way too many details that didn't add to the book. I didn't need to know what the detective was doing that morning, and lines like &quot;Little did he know that when he got back from his run, his life would change for forever&quot; made me laugh out loud. There were NO margins, the type was very small and hard to read, and it was 400 pages long. It was also very sensationalized. I felt like I was reading a tabloid. Sure, Marge was a nutball, but we don't need every little detail and info from everyone she's ever talked to. Unless you dig reading entire crime reports, don't read this. I only got through half of the book. I was getting so impatient and wanted them to get to the point. There is a handy timeline in the back, so that gives you all the main points.

Most folks around here think the murder was perpetrated by Elisabeth's bizarre adopted daughter dearest, Marjorie Congdon LeRoy Caldwell Hagen, and Marge's then-husband, Roger Caldwell.Nonetheless, Marjorie was acquitted of these murders. And she was never even charged for 2 more murders of which she is almost certainly guilty. The heirs to whom she would forfeit her share of her mother's vast estate &quot;settled&quot; the civil case involving the &quot;slayer statute&quot; [the one that expresses the intent that those who kill their benefactor shalt not benefit.] One can only shake one's head in wonderment and console oneself that although there be imperfect justice on this Earth, certainly Marjorie will answer to a Higher Authority in the Next Life. She has already exhibitted an affinity for Fire in her numerous arsons, for some of which she was actually imprisoned.This book is a collaboration between former Duluth News-Tribune crime reporter Gail Feichtinger, the Duluth Detective Gary Waller, and the St. Louis Co Prosecutor John DeSanto. With 20/20 hindsight, they courageously lead the reader through the morass of investigative and legal procedure and admit to screw-ups along the way. They explore &quot;what ifs,&quot; like DNA testing, which was not developed back in the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; of the 1970's. There are helpful photos and charts and an abbreviated Congdon Family Tree in the back. An Index of all the players would have been nice, but I made my own.Danger, Will Robinson! And all other Readers, at least those from the Region: Do Not Start Reading this rivetting book on a Sunday evening, if you work a Regular Monday - Friday work week. This book is way too addictive.

Elisabeth Congdon - a wealthy, childless woman - adopted Marjorie. Marjorie grew up in a mansion on the shores of Lake Superior in Duluth, Minnesota. She had every advantage. What could go wrong?A lot went wrong. Marjorie is a sociopath and a criminal. She manipulated her three husbands, her seven children, and anyone else unlucky enough to cross her path. She wildly spent millions and constantly badgered her mother for more. In 1977, Elisabeth Congdon was murdered; Marjorie and her husband were the prime suspects.Will to Murder truly is stranger than fiction. The book is difficult to put down because Marjorie ricochets from one sinister plot to the next. Readers will be frightened to learn how often Marjorie has broken the law without penalty.The authors did a great job of researching Marjorie's twisted life. All three authors were heavily involved in the Elisabeth Congdon murder case and each offers personal insight on Marjorie. Readers should try to find the 3rd edition of the book because it contains updates on Marjorie's most-recent crimes.While Will to Murder is good, it is too long. It's 418 pages should have been cut to about 300.

But they were and this case was presented as best as possible, under the circumstances. Just think what cell phone records would have done to help solve this case.In any event, a very absorbing book; it is a long book but not overlong, like some, as this one does not repeat info, there is simply a lot of info to present.No complaints from me on this one and I have been very disappointed by books of late."},{"Title":"Lucy in Disguise (Regency Romance)","review":"This book follows the rules of a Regency without being 'young girl goes to London for her Season and tames the rake.'

But this book was so bad that I had to make a real effort to finish it. Kit meets up with Lucy (who calls herself Luke as she was pretending to be a boy) on the beach on night while smuggling. He was shot and she helped him escape and bind his wound. Diana (who I am guessing will figure in the story with the last brother) is the only interesting person in this draggy story. Nice to see Celia and Kendal again and their baby. But the romance between Lucy and Kit was flat and had no spark. The mystery was flat, too. A good romance has to have wit, romance, spark and an interesting premise. All these were missing from the regency. A romance between Kit and Lucy was forced and did not seem real.

She happens upon a smuggling adventure gone wrong and rescues a horse from drowning and his owner from injury and certain death. Kit is a charming, flirtatious man and Lucy does her best to convince him that she's a boy and Diana is a mute widow.

In fact, Kit considers the masquerade to be the truth, but how to convince Lucy is the difficult part, for she wants nothing to do with him other than his help rescuing Diana.

Christopher is so utterly charming and amusing that I dare one not to fall in love with him. Lucy is a determined, resourceful woman and I admire her for trying to help a girl she barely knows. My biggest problem with this book is that the story ends with lots of loose ends. It doesn't resolve the mystery of the thugs who shot Kit or where Sir Basil Crawley's money came from. The so-called villains only briefly appear, act buffoonish and then exit too quickly and easily. I loved the romance plot and adore Kit and Lucy together. Their witty banter makes me laugh and chapter 13 is my favorite. It is great to know what happened to James and Celia too. This book is a blend of sweet Regency, Traditional Regency and romantic comedy. I recommend it for fans of the comedic variety of Regencies."},{"Title":"Creatures Of The Night (Giant Book of)","review":"Both my six-year-old son and I enjoyed this one. Full of terrific illustrations and cool facts, it covers every thing from familiar nocturnal animals like bats, owls, and raccoons to lesser known moon lovers like red howler monkeys, jerboas, and my son's favorite, amazed fish. Learning that a vampire bat needs to eat half its weight in blood each day just to stay alive and that snakes lick a smelling organ in their mouths to pick up scents is just a sample of the slightly gross but very cool things kids can learn. My son was engrossed by every page. A nice one to share before sending your night creature to bed."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"A powerful group of Yales graduates come close to pulling off a takeover of the U.S. Government.

That will help you identify the major characters and will aid in their personality identification. Has any of the earlier reviewers identified the reason his books have a lag time in their publishing in the States from when they were published in England.Yes there are large number of Deer in the District.

McCarry's writing is as gripping and spine-tingling as ever, and his characters (particularly Zarah Christopher, Julian Hubbard, and John S. McGraw) are delightfully well drawn and believable.

If you like political thrillers, conspiracy novels, and constant suspense you will find this book an absolute delight"},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"Chas. McCarry's \\"Shelley's Heart\\" is driven by the then and now faintly quaint notion that an assassination of a terroristic head of state, ordered by a U.S. president is an objectionable act of murder that should and would be prosecuted by impeachment. Due to be reissued in May this year, \\"Shelley's Heart\\" is unlikely to overcome this fundamental oddity. Its simplistic fictional conflict between righteous conservatism and naive liberalism--it was published in 1995--is unnecessary to be updated--samo, samo. But its plot, involving the fictional second impeachment of a U.S. president, will need a substantial historical revision to account for the now-historical second impeachment of a U.S. president, Bill Clinton, later in the 1990s, after is was published. I might be curious enough to see how McCarry or his editors do it to browse it on the shelf, when it comes out."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"I'm about 150 pages into this mass of turgid prose and it finally occurred to me that the only reason a well-respected friend gave this book to me is that he saw it as a brilliantly crafted parody of this genre of literature. How could it be otherwise?The writing is mannered and pompous; so far not one character is likable - Zarah, who seems to be the heroine, is a cipher, which makes her the least objectionable character so far. The wheels-within-wheels plot, with a conspiracy launched by a society so secret none of its members know one another, is an absurdist's dream. One character is lucky enough to be in the right place and time for every key plot-point, and manages to be the confidant of both rivals for the Presidency.While liberalism is depicted as evil, with cartoon versions of feminists and academics and limousine liberals predictably trotted out, it's peculiar that the opponents of this liberalism seem wan and powerless. 150 pages into it, only two conservative characters have been introduced, and one gets shot in the first couple of pages. Mallory seems to be the only conservative standing, and all he does is sit around waiting for the other side to act. No actual convictions or political positions are articulated on either side - attaining power seems to be the only goal.Each character, even trivial ones, have peculiar and bizarre personal traits, from the main character who despises tables in any shape but round to the ex-wife's new husband, a writer who can only write while on an ocean-bound yacht in \\"total isolation.\\" There's a lawyer with an initial at the end of his name; a chief-of-staff's wife who wears broken glasses and drives an old jalopy; said chief of staff who requires custom-made extra-long skis; a reporter with irritable bowel syndrome; another reporter who likes ground green peppercorns in his vodka, a daughter who's a medium.The world of Washington depicted here is a strangely old-fashioned one, with all the trappings of patriarchal power - there are butlers, gentlemens' homes have libraries, the powerful sit down to drink whiskey together, wear weskits and pince-nez.Popular culture seems not to exist - people quote 19th century literature and listen to Beethoven - even those who pride themselves on their corn-pone populism. Almost everyone seems to be male, white, and Anglo-Saxon - ethnic characters are few and stereotypical. There's a heavy vein of misogyny running through this book, too - the female characters are either bizarre feminazis, shrews, sexpots or - rarely - noble supporters of their men. The male characters' relationships with women characters are fraught with hostility and sexism, like the guy who hated his shrewish wife yet stayed with her 20 years because she was hot in bed, or the lawyer who trash-talks the devoted pair of adherents that tend to him, when he's talking with other men. The author habitually uses the word \\"female\\" as a noun for women - a weird and objectifying usage.But since my friend has great taste in books, and he gave this to me, I can only conclude that it must be a brilliant parody, taking the political thriller genre to its absurdest extreme. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"I love McCarry's books, especially Old Boys and The Miernick Dossier, but I found this one preposterous. The secret left wing society of the title was absurd, and the way new members kept cropping up made the book seem more like cranky gassings than a real, complex thriller.If you prefer your villians Snidely Whiplash with a pink tinge, and your heroes out of the Fox News anchor mold, this is for you. Otherwise, wait until you just need that one more helping of the otherwise excellent McCarry."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"The book is set in the near future, but there has been a lot of change. Hunters are no longer able to hunt, so Washington is overrun with deer. If that's plausable to you, then you might enjoy this dreadful book.McCarry did show some flair for writing. His Speaker of the House, a drunk with a photographic memory who quotes the bible, was a hoot. The lesbian, Slim and Sturdi, were about a multi dimentional as Ren and Stimpy.If McCarry keeps the conspiracy politics out of his writing, he may be an intertesting read. Until then, I suggest that you avoid him."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"Charles McCarry is one of the top writers of espionage, suspense/thriller fiction and most definitely in the same literary league with John LeCarre, Alan Furst, Eric Ambler and Ken Follett. McCarry's nuanced, at times poetic, writing style, his ability to create real, flesh and blood characters who will move you, and his fast-paced, taunt storylines, put him at the top of the list for craftsmanship and inventiveness. Therefore, I do not understand why McCarry's books are out of print and have been for some time. In order to read them I have had to look for used book sellers who have his novels in stock at a reasonable price - not an easy task. However, for anyone who reads this review and becomes motivated to search out \\"Shelly's Heart\\" or any of the author's other suspense thriller, I urge you to follow through. You won't be sorry - I promise.I should note that McCarry worked for the CIA many years ago, during the height of the Cold War, and the air of authenticity that permeates his books makes them all the more fascinating and absolutely riveting. His position as one of the \\"Old Boys,\\" and his knowledge of \\"The Company\\" and the political goings-on in the DC Beltway add tremendously to his most original plots.I was amazed while reading \\"Shelly's Heart\\" that this book was written and published in 1995 because the novel's themes, which might have seemed extremely farfetched ten years ago, are not unbelievable at all today - especially not after the 2000 presidential election and the events of 9/11.The story opens in January 2001, the day before the presidential inauguration. Incumbent President Bedford Forrest Lockwood, a political progressive, (read liberal), learns from his worthy former opponent Franklin Mallory, a staunch conservative, that there is documented evidence of election fraud in California, Michigan and New York which brings into serious question Lockwood's right to assume office. The disputed outcome hangs on a few thousand votes in a single state. Sound familiar? A presidential impeachment is also involved in this riveting thriller, as are terrorism, dirty bombs, Muslim extremists, Washington DC politics and presidential staff machinations, of the shadiest kind, at the highest levels. Throw in lots of dark humor, terrific characters, including a newly appointed obsessive compulsive Supreme Court justice with delusions of grandeur and two androgynous lawyers, lethal beautiful blonde super women types who work for him, and you have the makings of an unputdownable story. Forgot to mention a subplot involving a Yale-based secret society a la Skull and Bones, but more subversive...I think....and a constitutional crisis.I have now read almost all of Charles McCarry's books and cannot recommend them highly enough. I have had to go out of my way, as previously mentioned, to acquire his work but am so glad I did. If you are a fan of John le Carr&eacute;, Alan Furst, Eric Ambler and Ken Follett, you will certainly become a McCarry fan, as are le Carr&eacute;, Furst, Ambler and Follett. They have all read him and praise him to the sky. ENJOY!JANA"},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"I'm on a McCarry roll. This is my 5th book in 7 days I've read of Mr. McCarry's and I can't stop. I didn't love the Mierknik Dossier, but Shelley's Heart is a masterwork that picks up some of the threads of The Better Angels which would be good to read first if you can. I also read some of his later Paul Christopher novels, so it was fascinating to catch up on the Hubbard family and the famous Zarah who plays such an intriguing role in this novel. What can I say? Every detail is amazing -- the political intrigue, the spy games, the Washington insiders, the social scene -- he has such a terrific eye, suspenseful writing style that you simply cannot put these books down. Of the books I've read so far, this was my favorite although I really enjoyed Second Sight and Old Boys too. I read in an interview that Overlook Press will start reissuing all his out of print books (almost all of them are out of print except his new one, Old Boys) this spring, so I can't wait to get my hands on his other books. Run and out find them!"},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"The problem with most novels about Washington is that they are either 1)completely implausible (see FAVORITE SON) or 2)boring to anyone who doesn't actually live here. Charles McCarry's books are the exceptions that prove the rule. SHELLEY'S HEART works equally well as political thriller and incisive satire of late-20th century Washington (the reviewer who found it the work of a rightwing conspiracy clearly didn't get it). His attention to detail is perfect, and his characters are priceless. It would make a great movie, except that Hollywood probably doesn't care for this vision of our nation's capital."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"First, Charles McCarry is truly a great American writer. Evidence his novel &quot;The Last Supper&quot; discussed later. Shelly's Heart was hard to put down and certainly an enjoyable political thriller that explored what could happen in a Constitutional crisis and impeachment situation. I gave Shelly's Heart a 9 only because it is hard for me to imagine any book topping the performance and range of quality of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; that establish Charles as a great American author. Certainly timley, considering current political events, regardless of your political pursuasion. And I didn't think McCarry particularly evidences a particular political bias in his writing either, although he does have some strong feelings about a few things. I am already a McCarry fan having read all seven or eight fiction novels he has written, (except &quot;Bride of the Wilderness&quot;) up to now. I prefer his espionage novels from which this book draws on events and characters. McCarry considers himself an author not of a particular genera, but a general author. He has explored and written in several: espionage (what he truly knows), western/histroical and contemporary political thriller like Shelly's Heart. He is skilled at his writing craft and can be very intellectually profound and deep in his writing. (He was consistantly so in &quot;The Last Supper.&quot;) He also writes with a great range and depth of emotion. His writing flows so well that you become completely and comfortably absorbed in the story and characters. Seldom if ever does anything appear contrived. Just like good fiction and storytelling should be. And it appears to me (having read his other boooks) that McCarry draws on his insiders knowledge as a field case officer in the CIA (his former profession) during the cold war era. McCarry writes from personal knowledge and experience. His fictionalized secret &quot;Society of the Poet&quot;, in the seemy political backdrop of the novel is based on other real secret societies such as the Yale Russel Trust or Skull and Bones. (Anyone who knows about the history of the CIA should know about the &quot;Skull and Bones&quot;.) Perhaps the reviewer who ranted about vast right wing conspiricy theory (to requote Hillary) was just uninformed and iliterate, as history and men are by their natures conspiratorial, witness David Humes classic &quot;History of England&quot;. (Or maybe he is just a paranoid left wing conspiracy nut. So touchy!) But that reviewer does a disservice to readers who might be mislead and persuaded to pass on an opportunity to experience a great American author. The book does bring out the sometimes conspiratorial nature of man in politics and existance and influence of secret societies but makes no real comentary thereon and is just a great story. The book does not tout any right wing conspiracy theories but simply takes an authors liberty to employ a very creative literary fictional device, &quot;The Society of the Poet&quot; i.e, Shelly. It becomes appearent quickly from reading much of McCarry that he is well researched and read, astute, cultured, and articulate. Borrowing on characters from other novels, McCarry illustrates the realities and &quot;sausage making qualities&quot; of the political process and the media. (A reference to the old saying about not wanting to see how it was made, i.e, sausagge, politics or legislation.)It is said that McCarry is considered &quot;the one to read&quot; by American intelligence professionals, and I agree. All McCarry's espionage books have high merit but for a real treat, read &quot;The Last Supper&quot;. (One of, if not THE FINEST espoinage novel I have ever read). Finer American fiction cannot be found. A truly profound and intelectually stimulating book with touches of history of the cold war, philosopy, culture, history, tradecraft, deep development of the main characters, profound observations, keen insight and observations of the human condition through the characterizations, and reflections on the profession of the intelligence professional, as well as being a first class espionage novel. A truly meaningful exploration of political issues and juxtaposed political forces in a backdrop of 1920/1930s Germany then a jump to 1950/1960 cold war, that I think has much relevance to the current political situations and polarizations in America today. There is much insight and history and fictionalized commentary about the intellligence business buried within. Also within, are found clues (only just barely) to the real secret society aluded to in disguise in Shelly's Heart. As far as his espionage novels go, I would recommend you start with his first and read them in order and each will build on the other as you also observe this talented writer evolve. You can make allowance for the first, the Miernik Dossia as a first novel (so we will make some allowances for that, part shoot-'em-up, part very good tradecraft), but from there on out McCarry gets &quot;serious and seriouser.&quot; However you can read Shelly's Heart now, or any time. If the realities of the contemporary political process interest you, this is a great book. If you love the espionage genera, you owe it to yourself to discover Charles McCarry, and especially &quot;The Last Supper&quot; his fourth novel (Go to a used book store, it is worth finding).

Also, the gullibility of the public is assumed, which stretches things a bit (e.g. the fawning over Hammett! Sorry, don't think so!). And the high tech 'stuff' available to the employees (!!) of the principle characters; again, stretches credulity a bit!But having said that, it does bring it all together in some fascinating glimpses into what might be if we let ourselves get into. Wonderful character development, the boys and girls romping through the story (and that's how they're referred to!) along with the presumed-adults, and its a fine tale. I couldn't put it down.Why only four stars? The characters are too superhuman and they do things a bit too easily; sorry, just need some normal human problems to appear. Murphy's Law and all that, traffic jams, flat tires maybe.Highly recommended nonetheless. I'm already on the prowl for the author's other books!"},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"I am a longtime fan of Charles McCarry's spy novels, and have read them all except Shelley's Heart, which I am now in the middle of. The books are very high-level and gripping; I'm only sorry there aren't more of them. For him to come back with Old Boys, after announcing (at the end of the previous book) that the series was over, was quite a feat, and made me go back and reread some of them. The only drawback in reading McCarry, for many people (including myself), is his right-wing politics; he makes a point of mocking \\"liberals\\" and \\"leftists,\\" and the mystique of New England old families and their moral superiority over everyone else runs through his books. But those of us whose politics are different have to put up with this to enjoy the great pleasures of his novels."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"A bombshell of a political thriller, the sequel to McCarry's The Better Angels. A tense and riveting tale of a struggle for presidential power, and the human and political consequences it leaves in its wake. Loading his story with rich, detailed characters, McCarry proves his mastery of the political spellbinder as well as the spy novel. You will be hungry for more!"},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"Shelley's Heart is spectacular. Charles McCarry's many other novels are uniformly excellent, but Shelley's Heart stands out. The suspense builds and I couldn't put the book down, particularly as the \\"good guys\\" (if you're of moderate or conservative political views) finally turned the tables on their conspiring opponents. I except that liberals and Ivy Leaguers won't like the premise of the book, which is that ex-Yale and other prep elite graduates have penetrated all three branches of the government and maintain a secret society dedicated to the victory of Shelleyian ideals.I did have on question based on reading prior Charles McCarry books. Why and how did the Hubbards become bad guys? McCarry definitely has turned on them."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"That question, most famously asked by Howard Baker of Richard Nixon, could apply equally to Charles McCarry. Having begun this book the night before Ken Starr sent those rancid documents to the Hill, I found much of McCarry's novel eerily dead-on, especially in the behind-the-scenes news, legal, extra-legal, congressional and executive office commentaries and viciously funny asides. How could McCarry have foreseen so much of our current national and international troubles in 1993 (assuming it took two years to write and publish) - from fatally flawed presidents to Islamic terrorists? Loved the impeachment section! My only cavils are the &quot;cast of thousands,&quot; many with similar names/plot functions, despite my familiarity with some of the characters from earlier novels, and the identity of the caftan-clad assassin - telegraphed early and prefunctorily wrapped up - oh, all right, I stayed up late to see how the reader would be left - and even later pondering the questions Charlie raised."},{"Title":"Shelley's Heart","review":"Set aside a weekend to read this book, because you won't want to set it aside once you've begun it.This is the conclusion to The Better Angels pitting two Presidents against each other. Former President Mallory is a brilliant, emotionally detached, security obsessed Republican - think Richard Nixon without the five o'clock shadow. President Lockwood, for whom the Presidency was stolen by underlings, is a folksy, born politician, but dumb in the way some smart people are - think Bill Clinton but with principles and a sense of honor.But these two characters play only a supporting role among the most colorful cast of characters ever invented for a Washington novel. Although most of the characters are over the top satiric gems, they are believable enough to pull the reader in. Along the way, the author makes a number of observations about how Washington works, making this required reading for anyone heading to DC.Both this and The Better Angels were written in the early 90's and it's a tribute to the author's foresight as a former CIA officer that among the matters he predicts are: a Presidential impeachment, a sex scandal involving a priapic Democratic President, Muslim terrorists blowing themselves up in crowds, an intervention in the Middle East involving weapons of mass destruction which can't be found, a challenged Presidential election and even a Senate split 50-50 as it was in 2000-2002. Of course, he jumbles all of these elements up to make these events his own.Some of the plot elements are pure satire - a conspiracy of left wing Yalie WASPs - but the author creates real tension and indicates how much is at stake. That the hero of the book is the one that the reader has already voting as the most unlikely to succeed makes this a peculiarly American book, where we don't always respect the best and the brightest (largely because the best and the brightest are often neither) but the people with the stoutest character and the strongest heart.Shelley's Heart is much better than The Better Angels and The Better Angels was one of the best of its kind."},{"Title":"I Rode With Stonewall","review":"I read this book in 1979, and would rate it highly as a good read.However, I was disappointed a few years ago to learn that the entire thing is a fabrication, a string of lies from beginning to end.A lot of men lie about their military service. Apparently Douglas was one of the more flagrant exemplers.Unfortunately, I can't back up what I'm saying. I have no source. I forget where I read it.While re-reading a passage in Shelby Foote's narrative history, I came across the account of Stonewall sitting on the fence, eating the lemon. Douglas is, I believe, the main, if not the only source for the \\"Lemon Legend.\\"I wondered to myself, \\"Now where did I read that Douglas's memoir was an utter fabrication? I'll check the Amazon reviews; surely someone will have debunked this book.\\"So here I am. My only point is, don't believe me or Douglas.Let the Reader Beware.Can anyone shed some light on this?"},{"Title":"I Rode With Stonewall","review":"This book, first published in 1940 - long after Douglas' death - is based on Douglas' war-time journal and personal papers. Douglas began to assemble them into book form several times, but never had them published; his relatives did......What emerges are wonderful portraits of Douglas, Jackson (for whom Douglas was a staff officer) and many other well-known (and not so well-known) soldiers and civilians caught in the Civil War. Douglas is decidedly pro-Jackson, but Douglas also shows us the real Jackson: a man who could be cruel to the extreme and then gentle and kind a few moments later. The book is fill with humorous anecdotes, which make it a &quot;fun read&quot; - I could not put it down. Yet there is an underlying sadness in the book, as one watches Douglas' many friends being killed off, sees the homes of his family and civilian friends burned or otherwise destroyed. Douglas never explicitly states it, but the reader can feel the anguish that Douglas - and many others - experienced....... One thing Douglas did not do was go into great detail about each battle. He reasoned that later historians, with a better overall view of things, would do a much better job. What he does do is &quot;put you there&quot; - whether in battle, in camp, or on some small adventure. This is one fantastic book! Along with the memoirs of Gen. E.P. Alexander, these memoirs are about the best I have ever read. Simply a great book!"},{"Title":"I Rode With Stonewall","review":"\\"I Rode with Stonewall\\" is one of the finest personal narratives of the Civil War, America's most decisive and costly conflict. The author, Henry Kyd Douglas, began writing this memoir soon after the conclusion of the war, but put it aside for more than thirty years while he practiced law and raised a family. At his death, his book about the war had not been edited and it wasn't until a descendent discovered the transcript and found a publisher that it was finally released in 1940, on the even of another great martial struggle. I purchased my first copy on a visit to the Fredericksburg battlefield more than twenty years ago and after reading most of it on a flight back from Washington D.C. to California, left it on the plane and in the days before the Internet, it was hard to secure another. Fortunately, on another tour of Civil War battlefields and museums, I managed to bring a copy back for my library - it's that memorable a book. Henry Kyd Douglas was a native of Maryland and a dashing young officer who served on Stonewall Jackson's staff in the early stages of the Civil War. And, like many other Confederate officers and enlisted men, he was devoted to the stern, brilliant artilleryman. Douglas later had a field command and despite being wounded no less than six times, he survived four years of brutal war. Unfortunately, other young heroes of the Confederacy, friends of Douglas like John Pegram, Sandy Pendleton and John Pelham did not. Douglas was handsome, dashing, brave and outgoing and because of these qualities, he was popular with officers on both sides in the war and a favorite of the Southern belles. His account is peppered with fond encounters, but always chivalrous, he abbreviates the names of the women he flirted with. Although the book is full of death, of lives lost in the ill-fated cause of the Confederacy and the abominable institution of slavery, it also shows that there was an idealistic and romantic side to the war. Even in the service of a bad cause, the terrible conflict between North and South brought out the deeper qualities of the men that served.

The anecdotes are priceless, Douglas' viewpoints are insightful and the picture painted of Stonewall Jackson rings true with everything else I've read about him.

The book holds my interest in spite of its length and technical slant."},{"Title":"Seduction of Place","review":"Joseph Rykwert's new book is perhaps his most radical, although he elaborates on themes that have preoccupied him for more than 4 decades. Never has he so emphatically stated his conviction that the cities we desire can become the cities we have, but only if we take hold of our capacity to effect meaningful reform. Rykwert's position is particularly encouraging and insightful at a time when most of us perceive the built environment as the result of abstract and impersonal economic and political forces seemingly beyond any individual influence. Rykwert's stance is a challenge to architect's, urban designers, planners and other citizens who cannot imagine an alternative between revolution and acquiescence other than surrender to conditions as they are. Such inertia is countered by Rykwert, as are rationalist and quantitative approaches to the city, with affirmation of the city as a fundamental setting of and for human will, dreams, and desire. It follows then, according to Rykwert, that any successful making and re-making of cities depends on a set of rational principles that are flexible enough to accomodate chance, elaboration, and improvisation.

In many cases, those acts were first spontaneous or induced by some external event.Can you \\"create tradition?\\"The most interesting part of this book to me was Rykwert's analysis of Celebration, Florida. This was, of course, Disney's effort to create a brand-new \\"small town\\" from the ground up. He correctly diagnoses the effort as being dominated by profitable real estate development. In fairness, he distinguishes Celebration from a typical suburban development because of its dependency on \\"Olde World\\" design principles.What he foresaw, almost inadvertantly, is the more widespread use of this modality for commercial/residential developments now springing up in revived, older suburban areas. These have been commercially successful and have created the sorts of delightful spaces he describes in his coverage of older urban spaces.It's a good book, albeit a little dogmatic."},{"Title":"Seduction of Place","review":"What's Joseph Rykwert's perspective and what's his view of the city? It's not very easy to peg down. It's not that of &quot;sociologists, traffic experts, and politicians&quot; as he says that he's &quot;always been struck at how little the physical fabric of the city - its touch and smell as well as its sights - occupies their attention&quot;. Maybe he's more inclined to take an economists view and see things as Jane Jacobs does. Then again maybe not. Rykwert says quite plainly that cities do not develop &quot;naturally&quot;. The perspective is definitely not that of a speeding, disinterested motorist. Rykwert refers to the impact of cars as &quot;catastrophic&quot; and says &quot;I am not, nor have I ever been a driver.&quot; Now we're getting somewhere - a supporter of New Urbanism? Not quite. He has this to say about one of those showpiece communities: &quot;the whole business of 'community' at Celebration is about...real estate&quot;. Rykwert is equally critical of a few architects (modernists), certain building designs (government and institutional), a couple of city plans (Brasilia and New Delhi), and some approaches to urbanism (the New Town concept of post WWII Europe).With all that's wrong it's amazing that this book didn't turn out to be a miserable reading experience. That's partly due to Rykwert's writing skill but moreso because of his very obvious love for the city. THE SEDUCTION OF PLACE and affection for city space is obvious. The depths of his thinking about the urban form is manifest and Rykwert offers a synopsis of what's wrong and also what's to love about a city. &quot;My polemic is not against the disordered, even chaotic city but against the anonymous and alienating one.&quot; With this we finally understand what his perspective is. It's that of a person open to experiencing the personality of a city; that of someone at ground level. Our difficulty with coming up with a clear view of the city might be due to the fact that we haven't experienced the city as Rykwert has and it doesn't yet occupy the same space in our hearts and minds. He invites us to begin. &quot;The very condition of openess is what makes our city of conflicts so attractive to its growing crowd of inhabitants. The lack of any coherent, explicit, image may therefore, in our circumstances, be a positive virtue, not a fault at all, or even a problem.&quot;"},{"Title":"Seduction of Place","review":"Joseph Rykwert's new book is perhaps his most radical, although he elaborates on themes that have preoccupied him for more than 4 decades.

Alluring as it sounds, Seduction of Place has nothing to do with place but rather endless facts about architecture and urbanism from two centuries ago. In a nutshell, this book reads like a frustratingly drab encyclopedic entry with 3 pages of photos.You'll get the sense that something is amiss after reading the first 25 pages about the Industrial Revolution. The relevance of urban growth and new manufacturing techniques is clear enough, but describing who invented what and when is hardly helpful in understanding \`place.' Starting from the first chapter, you'll be presented with a dizzying array of minor historical tangents of names, cities, academic/political trends, and suddenly be transported to something new altogether like a discourse on styles. For example the 4th chapter, \\"Lived Space and Virtual Space,\\" covers architectural and urban trends in early Soviet Russia, communist China, then skips to the UN building in New York and finally finishes on Disney Land. There are a few paragraphs about reliance on virtual devices, including facts like: \\"sexual intercourse -for instance- may be achieved over long distances.\\" This is one of many examples of sentences appearing out of nowhere, much like the conclusion to the third chapter which skips from a critique of the box-like World Trade centers to graffiti on empty street walls. If you are interested in modernism's failure at the street level, simply go to Jane Jacobs for a detailed and empirical account of how New York's \\"place\\" eroded.Rykwert rattles off most of the European Utopias and historical interpretations but never goes beyond the surface. Lonely Planet does a better job with Paris, London, Chicago, D.C., Brasilia, and New York. What's so seductive about New York? Beyond a search for a \`heart' (he settles mostly on Rockefeller Plaza), NYC is all about tall buildings creeping North along the island. Paris meanwhile is about preserving the historic core after Haussmann creates the boulevards. Of course Mr. Rykwert has spent much time in both cities, but his writing displays no field-tested opinions about these two \\"places,\\" let alone the question of seduction.Rykwert finally loosens up and sheds the lecturing historian tone during the afterword, giving some personal perspectives on the future of the city. In all honesty, I felt as I though I was reading Rykwert at the introduction and the afterword. In between is just a dry lecture that has nothing to do with the seduction of place. Nothing."},{"Title":"Tomorrow By Design: A Regional Design Process for Sustainability (Wiley Series in Sustainable Design)","review":"This is a great book to read for anyone who is concerned with rampant, poorly planned suburban growth in the United States. Mr. Lewis's 23 Circle Cities plan and his Regional Design Process provide the answer to most of our conservation and environmental problems."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"With one piece of work there is a new \\"heavy hitter\\" upon the sci fi/fantasy scene; and Susanna Clarke is her name. After reading Mievelle's Iron Council, I was skeptical that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell would be deserving of the Hugo Award it had in August of 2005. Needless to say after having finished JS&Mr.N; my always wavering faith in the Hugo Award voters has been restored. JS&Mr.N; is a gripping and entertaining novel with many obvious influences as well as many brilliant original ideas.There are many aspects of this book I particularly enjoyed. Clarke has the exceptional ability to interweave horrific imagery amongst the mundane without creating a sense of \\"hokiness\\". Her world is entirely real and the use of historic events and people was an excellent choice. She really captures the essence of early 19th century Europe which makes the infusion of her stylized magic that much more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed the range and depth of her magical universe. The magic is everything from grandiose (transplanting of cities to other places) to horrific (the re-animating corpses) and everything in between. Its forms are complex and there is an immense history to it (Clarke provides footnotes to many magical references to help build and inform). It's all expertly cultivated and it grows on you through out the novel.Clarke's characterization is another strength of the novel. Strange, Norrell and some of the secondary characters are very human in their flaws and decisions. I commend Clarke for not drawing a straight line between right and wrong. Allegiances will change throughout the book and I found myself liking many of the characters although not always rooting for them.Clarke draws from many of the classic Victorian novels written around the time this story unfolds. She perfectly recreates that hilarious English wit and pompousness. Much of the dialogue reminded me of the witty English banter exchanges between Watson and Holmes in Doyle's classics. The haughtiness of certain characters intermingled with Clarke's sense of absurdity is hard to describe but I laughed out loud more times than I can remember.This book is not without flaws and at times Clark's rawness shows through. The book tends to wander to subplots and anecdotes that might not be necessary. The paperback edition weighs in at 844 pages and it might have benefited from some tighter editing. One example of this is multi page history of a servant character that is rarely mentioned again. Albeit somewhat entertaining, this excerpt is one of a few that should have been cut to add some brevity. Another example is most of the exposition involving the Greysteels which was entirely unnecessary and came way too late. The characters hardly served any purpose and were altogether uninteresting. The plotting is slow and enduring as the characters and mythology is what drives the first half of this book. I actually considered this an asset but others might be bored by the seemingly endless exposition. The first third of the book slowly and subtly introduces us to magic and to the relationship between the title characters. If you are looking for frantic page turning plotting a la The Da Vinci Code, then perhaps this is not your cup of tea.In the end these are minor complaints in light of what a major accomplishment this book is. Many are calling JS&Mr.N; the \\"adult Harry Potter\\". I actually agree with this statement for various reasons. The subject matter has obvious similarities with a complex historical background. There could definitely (and hopefully) be numerous sequels. The book is extremely addicting and I tore right through it in about 10 days. And finally I think it has appeal to both adults and youngsters. While not as simplistic or dominated by child characters as Harry Potter, I see no reason why this book couldn't be absorbed by junior high age kids and up. There are some horrifying images but this book is entirely appropriate for anyone old enough to get through it. There is absolutely no sex, drugs, or swearing of any kind. There is some mild violence but honestly this book could be marketed and edited in a way to make is fall under the same \\"juvenile fiction\\" that Harry Potter is officially categorized as. I would recommend this book to any reader of any age that likes the Harry Potter series or isn't intimidated by the book's size.Bottom Line: Clarke won the coveted Hugo in her first attempt. A feat certainly not accomplished in the last 25 years if ever. I eagerly await her next offering....."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I really respect the uniqueness of this book. You can compare it to Harry Potter or War and Peace or probably a lot of other things, but really Clarke has her own style and wit. She's not afraid to show it, even though some of her choices aren't obviously the right ones. Norrell, for example, is a difficult character to pull off. He's often annoying, petty, unkind and self-centered. And yet he's not just those things. He also reveals himself in surprisingly positive ways at times. So to some extent it's hard to know if you like him or not. But it's not hard to know that as a reader you're enjoying experiencing his story, and maybe staying curious as to how he'll react to things. Johnathan Strange is a bit easier to get along with, but he still provides many unique moments. For example, when he resurrects the Portuguese war prisoners so he can interrogate them, but then afterwards finds he doesn't know how to send them back to death. The images of the dead pestering him in the particular way they do is funny and clever. Feels a little like Latin Magic-realism, but it's got Clarke's own flavor to it.The fusion of history and fantasy is very well done, and some of the images of magic are startling and memorable. The fleets of boats made out of water, for example, are so vividly beautiful to imagine. I'm glad the author put the image in my head.I don't agree with some readers who've said that \\"every sentence is important\\" and \\"not a word should be missed\\", etc. This is a long book, a sort of kitchen sink of a book with its footnotes and polite, gentile conversation. There are a lot of things that could be cut and pruned out of this. What's wonderful about it (as is the case with Neal Stephensons novels) is that you just don't mind. Clarke is a talented writer who I was happy to spend time with, who somehow has storytelling gifts that make me willing to move at a gradual pace. It's a great book to come home to day after day. In this world of short attention spans and commercials screaming for attention... Well, a novel like this is a quiet joy. I hope to find more like it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The plot of _Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell_ has already been summarized, so I won't outline it again.I have read quite a lot of 18th- and early 19th-century literature--and history. I was struck by how well Ms. Clarke reproduces the period's literary style. And by how well she understands its social culture and the personalities that culture developed. There's real depth here--she's not just throwing in a few period spellings for faux atmosphere. And then she adds the twist of a truly otherworldly magic.The book completely engrossed me all the way through. I think that some people who complained about the length don't understand the tradition Clarke is working in, which is that of the 18th-century picaresque novel. Such novels are long. They are driven by the different adventures the characters have, not solely by one plot whose end goal must be reached as efficiently as possible. That's a modern concept, and it's not poor writing to adhere to an earlier literary model. Clarke's footnotes are short stories in themselves and perfectly delightful.I've heard another volume is on the way. I hope it's just as long--but I also hope Clarke writes it faster than the first novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is my first review to give on any book I have ever read. I have read many books along this subject line of magic; from Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, The Shannara Series, yet it would be wrong to compare jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell to any of these. All of theses books have thier own merrit. In JS though, it has a Charles Dickens feel to it, while still being readable. The magic that is performed is not too over the top, yet has just enough fantasy to make the magic different from other books of magic. The good thing about the use of magic in this book is that it is not overly used, which I find to be a good thing.The way Clarke is able to include a history of magic with English history is quite amazing. All places and events, and even some of the characters are taken straight from history. What makes this good is that there are really no alterations of Enghish hisotry in Clarkes' version. To see how the maddness of King George was attributed, to the battle of Waterloo. All of these events have just enough historical fact to make you beleive that magic did in fact exist in England.One of the most important points that I wish to make about this book is the character development. Some books (but not the ones I mentioned above) have little in regards to character development. Yet Clarke spends time with each character, unitl each character becomes real. I will not give anything away, but there will be a time when you will hate some of the characters, but then go back to liking them again.On a final note I must implore you to stick with the book. Some parts of the book do seem to drag on, and you might not want to finish reading. Some reviewers have stated that they finished reading after 200 pages. Just read it. If you spent the money on the book, or at least taking the time to read it, you owe it yourself to finish the book. You will not be disapointed. I will not go as far to say this is now my favorite book, but I have no problem of including it with the Harry Potters, Lord of the Rings, or the Shannara's."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's my belief that many people picked this book up hoping for a page-turner in the vein of the Potter stories. But that's just not what Clarke has in mind.The tone of it is very proper, filled with affectations of language that are not just there to further the plot. It's a stylistic choice that fits with the vision we have (accurate or not) of how people spoke and wrote in pre-Renaissance salons of higher-class England. This demands a little patience from the reader, sure, but the reward is the opportunity to indulge in delectable sentences and lovely desciptive prose.Unlike the Potter books, Strange isn't written for adolescents. This is almost like Tolkien (though nowhere near as ponderous), with an author inventing a deeper world, a pseudo-history if you will, complete with footnotes.Like Tolkien, the rich imagination of the thing is its most compelling virtue, and the ultimate reward for a slower-paced story. Once the book grabs you, it becomes quite easy to believe you're not reading fiction at all, but a factual account of real events long since passed. The tone of the writing contributes to that; since there's nothing \\"modern\\" about the phrasing and the pacing, it serves to immerse you that much deeper in the world of the story.At any rate, if you're open-minded about it, this book should appeal to fans of Dickens just as greatly as it should fascinate fans of Alan Moore or hell...even J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this book and highly recommend it, but don't have much to add to the other positive reviews. I just thought I would jump on here to recommend that if you're a Kindle user, skip the ebook and go old-fashioned paper on this one. The extensive footnotes are a royal pain to navigate on the Kindle; they are all at the end of the book, and you have to bookmark and search your way around every time you want to read one, which is often (several times per chapter). It was so frustrating and cumbersome to read the footnotes on the Kindle that it really detracted from the otherwise great pleasure of reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is not a criticism of the story, which I enjoyed. This is an admonishment to Amazon on their pathetically poor effort at transferring this book to the Kindle format. Transfer errors are so common that hardly a page does not go by in which you as the reader are not yanked out of the flow of the story as you try to worry out what the original text was. It is as if someone was paid to cut the pages from the book, scan them into a computer, remove all of the white-space, and leave the computer to its best efforts to guess at the original words. Well fine if that is the only way to establish an electronic copy of the book, but I can think of no good reason why they did not employ a proofreader to correct the very numerous and obvious mistakes.Shame on you Amazon. This is NOT the quality of product that I was expecting when I purchased my Kindle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Many books are to be read, some are to be studied, and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is of this last kind...Magnificent and original.\\"-- Washington PostAnd that is what I did - lived in it for a few weeks. I am usually a fast reader, especially when it comes to fantasy, but this book was meant to be lived in for a time. It is not a typical modern fantasy novel, but is as literary as it is fantastical. It draws of the influence of the Romantics like Austen as much as it does classic fantasy writers like McDonald and Tolkien. It is a book full of side stories, minor characters, a fantastic magical literary history told through footnotes, and a plot that builds slowly but deliberately upon itself.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is an epic tale of the re-birth of magic in nineteenth-century England. Amidst familiar elements of setting (such as the Napoleonic wars) one is presented with a world where magic actually worked. Or did until the habit became to study about magic rather than to actually do magic. Two magicians - very different in character- who, as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, attempt to bring practical magic back to England. A rambling exploration of their attempts and the consequences thereof comprise the extent of the book.The magic in play is not some disneyfied nursery appropriate version, but this is a fairy-tale that remembers that fairies are dangerous and magic holds its own perils. It is the divergent responses of the two magicians to the unveiling of the danger that most intrigued me. Norrell chose to hide it - to suppress any mention of Fairy so as to protect the common people by letting any recollection of Fairy just fade away. He essentially bans books, forcefully prevents the publication of information he disagrees with, lies about the power of Fairy, and ridicules those who believe in it. By controlling knowledge he hopes to protect the people from the danger - and retain all magical power for himself. Strange wants to embrace knowledge and crosses the lines of sanity in his quest to do so. He pays dearly for his knowledge, but still chooses to discover what he can so as to be equipped for his job. He wants magic to be in the hands of the people - accessible to all - allowing all people the power to protect themselves.I kept having this book recommended to me as something that a person involved in religion would find interesting. The parallels between the debates in the world of magic and those of the church are interesting. Besides the amusing critique of those who merely talk about and study magic/religion and don't actually practice it, I found the whole idea of the control of knowledge relevant. People in power can often control ideas. Even with the advent of widespread communication, it is those with the most money and therefore audience who hold the power. What then becomes most important - truth or power? Will they twist the facts or lie in order to serve a greater good? In the church, will ideas and knowledge be suppressed if they get people asking the wrong sorts of questions? Is it more important to keep people ignorant within the safe confines of a particular doctrine than it is to earnestly seek truth? I've seen Norrell's power plays in the church as knowledge and the right to ask questions is suppressed. I find myself as more of a Strangeite who will pursue ideas no matter where they lead, no matter what it might cost. And I support that for all people. To blindly trust in a voice just because it has authority/power seems wrong because I don't know how I might be being manipulated. I want to be a truth seeker.Many reviewers commented on the near absence of the church in this book. I found it refreshing to not have to read another book lamenting how the church persecuted magic, but I think the symbol or idea of the church existed in her structure of magic. The magic here seems to contain the debates, structures, and realms of religion, philosophy, and academia combined. It is an alternate world that speaks to the issues in our own. Its questions can be our questions if we care to scratch the surface of the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It took me a few pages to get into the story, as the author takes you gingerly into the reality she has created for the readers, which is so close to mundane that you suspect that the story is just a mundane story about magic, until a few chapters later you find yourself burning the midnight oil. She describes the characters to sound, once again, quite normal, and a few words down the line you realize that the same characters are no more mundane than when a military general confides in you that the government is poisoning body fluids through tap water or some such quiet madness. She is witty, humorous, and makes imagination beautiful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I didn't expect to like this book. I picked it up purely because I had nothing to read, and it was long enough to last me a couple of days. Boy was I surprised. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell was an unexpected delight for me to read.Imagine if Jane Austen wrote about fairies and magicians and you've got the tone down. Now take everything you know about England and throw it out the window.England in Jonathan Strange...ect. has been re-vamped in a much different place from the one we know. The time is around the turn of the 19th century, and the past of the country is greatly wound up with the Raven King, a man who rules northern England for hundreds of years, and has now disappeared. Magic is pretty much gone from the land. Magicians are gentlemen who talk about magic (actually practicing it would be beneath them.) But then, to everyone's great surprise, emerges Mr. Norrell, a magician who can actually do magic. He takes society by storm when he brings a young woman back from the dead (thanks to an unknown, very bad barging with a fairy), and becomes one of the main reasons the British navy hasn't been overrun by Napoleon.Then, Jonathan Strange shows up. Another gentleman, who also practices real magic, he becomes the pupil of Mr. Norrell. Magic is disputed and two great magical minds fight against a background of evil fairies, great kings, and the spirit of magic in England.This book is not for those who need action every minute. It's more charming than anything, and the plot is slow but steady. I found myself enthralled by about page 300, even though the real action of the book doesn't take place until much later. But this book is a real old fashioned story teller's story. It's a story for those people who want to guess ahead of time the answers to the mysteries, and be surprised when the real answer is something even weirder then even they guessed. It's a story for readers of long books, and most of all for people with patience. If you can love the writing of this book, even though the story can sometimes be slow, I promise you'll miss it when you finish it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I originally spotted this book while at a bookstore with my daughter. With almost 800 pages, a font size I found to be smaller then the norm, and subject matter that didn't seem as flashy as other books, I decided to take a shot and started reading it. I was very pleasantly surprised by the flow and interest this novel created. This book is not a &quot;quick read&quot; or a &quot;sprint&quot;... this is a &quot;marathon.&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in England over the 10 years from 1806-7 to 1817 and I am now becoming a fan of historical thanks to Susanna Clarke. The end does indeed justify the means in this story and although there may be some slow convoluted it gradually makes sense as the pages progress. I highly recommend this to people who don't mind investing the time in a book and are already a fan or have interest in trying some historical fiction mixed with a bit of magic. Note - Don't expect Harry Potterish plot and action."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is a bit intimidating at first sight, but it is well worth it. From page one, I was captivated by the modern day use of old English by the author. She gives the reader the feeling of being in a Dickens novel, but adds the magic and excitement of Rowling. The book is filled with dark humor and keeps you turning pages as fast as you can. I loved it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Ms. Clarke should be proud.The author refuses to be hurried. It takes some committment, getting into the novel. It took me about fifty pages. By then, I was in for the ride, and no turning back.Clarke paints a grand picture of early nineteenth century England. Besides being an unusual and original fantasy work, it is an historical novel of the first order.Some complaints -- I found myself losing track of people every so often, particularly once I was half way through. This is to be expected -- by page 400, other authors are winding down. Ms. Clarke was just gearing up.Second, sometimes the transition from Norrell and Strange to Stephen Black and the silver-haired gentleman seemed unnecessary. It was as though Ms. Clarke wished them not to be forgotten.But it was delightful reading, all in all. There was depth and complexity, much more than one usually expects from a new novelist.I give it four stars because she has to go higher with her next work. Highly recommended. I read a library copy, but will be purchasing my own for my collection -- eBay, here I come for a signed copy?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book was great. I admit that it started off a bit slow and I almost stopped reading it because I thought it quite boring. It starts off by giving you alot of background information and stuff you need to know to understand the book. Some people are disappointed because they arent immediately immersed in a world filled with magic. In all actuality the book starts off saying all magic is gone from England. But after you get started reading and you are introduced to Mr. Norrel and his first feat of magic things get a lot more interesting. You cant compare this book to Harry Potter....you could call it Harry Potter for adults, but you cant say it was a bad book because it was nothing like Harry Potter. Harry Potter puts you in a place that doesnt exist though there is reference to the outside world. This book blends magic into history in a way that almost makes you want to believe thats really the way it happened. In my mind this book is a lot more realistic than Harry Potter and makes you think. Its a kind of fantasy book that gives you a break from the normal magic filled totally unrealistic fantasy. Its really hard to explain whats so intriguing in this book....but if you read it and dont try to compare every little thing in it to a different book that you think was \\"better\\" you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"700+ pages, and I couldn't put it down. The book was so unwieldy that I actually thought about buying a recliner just so I could read it in comfort! In the end, I sat in my home office chair and propped my feet on top of the computer, and that seemed to do for a while.If you love Jane Austen novels or even films based on Jane Austen's works (e.g., Sense & Sensibility, Emma) and you love fantasy novels, you will probably love this book. Virtually the only resemblance to Harry Potter is that it's based in England and it describes magicians. It's a dark comedy of manners set in the early 1800s. It made me laugh out loud a number of times, often with surprise, because the humor is dry and subtle and it tends to pop out in unexpected places. Susanna Clarke also populates the book with famous historical figures such as Napoleon, Lord Byron, and Duke Wellington. The world she creates is captivating and even after 700 pages, I didn't want to leave it.A brilliant accomplishment. If there's any justice in the world, it will become a literature classic in time, and not just within the fantasy genre. I hope she writes more books..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This has been hyped so hard and so long by so many that I was looking forward to reading this book and was happy to get the Kindle edition on sale. I love historical fiction set in this period and enjoy works written at this time. Alternate history with magic works are a favorite of mine and I've read others set in this time period and enjoyed them greatly.One of the reviewers here says that if you find the jokes funny in the first chapter you will enjoy this. I did not find that to be true. There are some genuinely funny lines but they aren't enough to save this.The thing is, those other books had characters that I liked, or at least were amused by, and enjoyed getting to know. I'm up to chapter 13 (which is 13% in) and most of the characters are variously unpleasant, petty, strident, shallow, ignorant, arrogant, greedy, and pedantic. There have only been two characters that I felt any spark of interest in and they appear relatively briefly and haven't been seen in a long time at this point. I haven't even \\"met\\" the other main character, Jonathan Strange, yet and I've kept plodding on for the last couple of chapters waiting for him to appear and hoping that his appearance would change the tone of the book but I can't take it anymore.The pacing is glacial. I don't mind a slow meandering plot if I'm meandering along with people I care about but I'm finding it a challenge just to suspend disbelief enough to believe that they are people and not marionettes that the author is forcing to dance for her own amusement. Which, of course it's true that all fictional characters ARE an author's puppets but I really do prefer that the strings not be so very visible.I stalled out nearly two weeks ago and every time I try to start back up I get maybe another few paragraphs in before having to fight the urge to throw down the book, which with a Kindle is no longer an option. I will do the electronic version though and delete it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I relish books with alternative history themes, settings in the 19th century, and touches of magic. This book contains all of those, yet I did not enjoy it at all. I found it ponderous and dull and the characters thoroughly unengaging. I was quite disappointed in it, and I don't believe I will read any of this author's work again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's first novel is an instant classic in the prodigious historical fantasy genre. While reading this novel, I thought I had missed my history lesson on early 19th century England. I didn't know that the British Army used magicians to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo. Did you? This wonderful book documents the return of British magic from 1806 through 1817. Like magic, the book at 782 pages actually seemed much shorter than it was.I was reminded of Charles Dickens while reading this book. The first reason is the use of archaic spelling, such as \\" surprize \\" for surprise, \\" shew \\" for show, and \\" chuse \\" for choose. The second reason is the evocative character names, such as Mr. Honeyfoot, Lord Sidmouth, Mr. Segundus, and Miss Wintertowne. The third reason is the constant return of theoretical magician Vinculus to the story when I thought the author was finished with him. That reminded me of Orlick from Dickens's Great Expectations.I enjoyed Clarke's use of hundreds of footnotes which gave the story the air of a real history. The pell-mell manner that some authors use footnotes is avoided using crisp and verified direction. The only downside was that their small type often made my eyes strain and water.The story itself begins with Mr. Norrell, England's self-proclaimed and only practical magician, deciding to bring magic back to England. This makes the theoretical magicians, who believe that actual magic died out years ago, resign, except for Mr. Segundus and the rogue Vinculus. Mr. Norrell moves to London with his servant, John Childermass ( see what I mean about the names ). From there, Mr. Norrell becomes popular with the Lords and Gentlemen of London. The wife of one of his benefactors, Sir Walter Pole, dies unexpectedly, and Sir Walter asks Mr. Norrell to resurrect her. To assist him, Mr. Norrell conjures up a fairy- the pernicious gentleman with thistle-down hair in the bright green jacket. They succeed; but, the evil fairy refuses to go back to Faerie land and puts an enchantment on Mrs. Pole and Sir Walter's servant, Stephen Black.Eventually, Mr. Norrell takes on a pupil, Jonathan Strange, but holds back information from his vast library, not wanting his pupil to better him. Mr. Strange becomes very successful and helps the war effort against France with his powerful magic. He comes back from the war a hero, which leads to a nasty break-up with Mr. Norrell. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair then enchants Mrs. Strange, and Jonathan Strange now thinks she is dead.Not wanting to divulge the ending. I'll stop here. The last two hundred or so pages are full of magical conflicts between Mr. Norrell, Strange, the enchantees ( I made that word up ), and the odious gentleman with the thistle-down hair. Wow, what a book. This is the best novel that I have read this year. There is no follow up yet, but one is in the works."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a graduate student, I found the patient rhythm of this book very relaxing. I figured I'd try to finish it before completing the degree (so I was in no hurry). After finishing it, I found myself flipping the book open to random sections spending a delightful hour reading. Happy the author that can make such stories! Ms Clarke seems to have a never-ending well of stories, proven by the lengthy footnotes that end up being marvelous stories of themselves. Though I am now quite familiar with the book, I continue to be amazed whenever I spend some time with it. An incredible work of art.This book is in a class of its own. Not only worth the read, but quite worth a second and third reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What an incredible book - one of the best Christmas presents I've ever received! The hardback is huge and heavy, so I have recently purchased the Kindle edition which means that I can take it with me wherever I go. It's a fantastical story about magic and magicians in the early 1800's. It is elegant, intelligent and witty, and I can't put it down. I chuckle to myself often at the author's skill in inserting humour when I'm not expecting it, and although I'm reading the book avidly, I also dread finishing it. I do know, however, that I will enjoy reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is not a book to blaze through, but meander along with -- consider it a glass of a fine red wine, deep with tannins, consumed in slow, savoring sips rather than a shot of jack, tossed heedlessly back. A friend considers it a \\"winter read,\\" with the ideal setting being an enveloping couch alongside a crackling fire. I made the mistake of reading this in the summer. After the excited reviews of my friends (\\"you must read it!\\", \\"such great writing!\\"), I was eager to become enveloped into the story -- I was expecting a page-turner, something riveting and catching my excitement. I was looking for a book I would talk about for months to come. This is not one of these books.\\"Jonathan Strange..\\" is a slow-paced tome akin to that of \\"of Human Bondage\\" and \\"War and Peace\\" in both size and excitement. The storyline plods along (barely) and it was not until page 700 that I found myself actually excited to continue reading (or perhaps I was just unwilling to have wasted 700 pages of reading and was optimistic of a delightful ending). At page 300, I began polling friends to see if the book was worth continuing.The highlight of \\"Jonathan Strange\\" is the writing. I compare it to Oscar Wilde in society wit, as well as description (although Clarke, thankfully, does not suffer her readers with 100-word descriptions of objects or weather), and Jane Austin. The characters engage in witty repartee that is a delight to read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke, the author, and Rosenberg, the illustrator, have between them created a world of many more layers than those to which readers are usually treated in the last few decades. As has been pointed out by others, the depth and richness of detail keep the book from being a casual read, but it amply repays the reader who enjoys fantasy with a historical flavor. In a way, it's like Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian in a clever \\"what if\\" mode."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Hard to describe the weirdness and poetic magic of this book. It seems very long and tedious. Many little details and characters are developed slowly. However, the magic is funny, mysterious and very poetic. The magic and magicians are more subtle than many other such books. Some of the magic is large in scale and even funny, but I really loved how spell casting was related to the power of the earth or the water or the trees. I also liked how the plot lines eventually converge and you get a sense that it was all pre-determined.The bad guy is very strange, very crazy, and also sorta funny. The revenge scene, where the bad guy finally gets it, its simply amazing. I got the sense that many things, seemingly by chance, came together in one incredible moment of power and destiny. I had to re-read those pages a few times it was so beautiful. Not many people have the ability to write like that.The book is a combination of Tolkien, Alice in Wonderland, Charles Dickens, and maybe a little bit of Harry Potter.Toss in some revisionist history as well. :DRead it slowly, a little at a time. This is not candy, its a 5 course meal.-Randy"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"One of the great things about this book is how deliberate it paces itself. The first few hundred pages are doled out with a Jane Austen slowness where Mr. Norrell is the one practical magician in a nation full of theoretical magicians who are forced into retirement by his tricks. Without much rush, the book depicts his life in London as he is trying to create a place for new magicians. Full of footnotes and hints of a deeper and darker picture, this is a book that establishes its strength well before the fairies show up to start wrecking everything.Plenty of reviewers have praised this book before me, but I must say that what I loved most about this book is how it depicts fairies as genuinely scary beings, not because they are evil; only because they have a very complex moral system that does not agree with the humanity around them - so forcing people to come to an enchanted castle to dance is not considered kidnapping so much as a favor.WHen the book picks up in the last 300 pages, you will find yourself reading it without pause in hopes that you finish it soon.This is a great book that should be on everyone's favorite fantasy list."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Considering it took me nearly four months to finish this expansive novel, it would be hard not to review it. It's not that I'm a slow reader. It is rather that this book covers so many characters' lives over nearly ten years worth of time, that I was constantly putting this book down and forgetting about it. That being said, this is one of the best novels I've read in a very long time. It certainly holds a place in my top-ten favorite fantasy novels.Clarke's success at creating a believable fantasy world is admirable, and it is probably the reason for the expansive nature of the book. After reading it, I can certainly see how much of the excess could have been cut to make a quirky, fun fantasy novel; however, if that were so, I do not think I would have adored this book as much as I did. Clarke's prose attempts to force the reader to believe the story is true. She weaves in actually historic events and characters amid her product of fiction.The main storyline centers around the title characters. Gilbert Norrell is a scholarly magician attempting to bring English magic back to the world. In doing so, he attempts to help the English army fight against the French. Norrell is crafted to be a dull character, who is counterbalanced by the young, handsome, and altogether enthusiastic Jonathan Strange, who eventually becomes Norrell's pupil. Their views on English magic differ in many ways, but they mainly disagree on the use of Fairie magic. Norrell finds it dangerous and unethical in modern society--a viewpoint solidified by Norrell's own summoning of a Fairie to save a knight's wife from death. This act eventually becomes the main conflict of the novel, as the Fairie begins to run amok unbeknown to the protagonists, until his antics begin to cause major problems in the life of Jonathan Strange, causing Strange to resort to a mad form of magic in order to save the lives of several loved ones.Although I loved reading this book, and have kept my synopsis purposely vague so as not to spoil anything, there are several qualms I have with it. My main problem, and probably the same problem others have, is that Clarke attempts to show realism by incorporating footnote upon footnote about everything from the history of English magic to fables used to teach magical concepts. There are several chapters that are short in content, but extensive in footnote information. Several footnotes even take up a few pages of space. Even though these notes do succeed in lending an air of authority, there is an incongruity presented since the book is, in fact, fiction. This style might hold up if Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell read like a non-fiction text, but aside from the footnotes, it does not. Also, I found quite a few footnotes to be completely useless in furthering the story. For example, the fairy Norrell summons to aid him enchants several people, and prevents them from telling others of their torment. Whenever they attempt to cry out for help, they instead rattle off a non-nonsensical story, which is usually (tediously) told in full in footnote form. I found myself reading through these stories as fast as possible so as not to distract me from the text. The first story was humorous, but after that I was bored, especially when one came up near the climax of the story.My other qualm is the fact that the ending of the novel is an open-ended one. It almost seems as if Clarke was leaving room for a sequel. While I enjoyed the ending, and would welcome a sequel, it also went against the realism Clarke attempts to create. Throughout the entirety of the novel, she presents the story to us in a manner that makes the reader believe the story is fully documented in the annals of magical literature; however, when we arrive at the ending, we find there is more of the story to tell, which is slightly unnerving considering the devotion one must have to finishing this tome. Because of this, if I were to read the novel again, I would probably skip most, if not all of the footnotes (though some are critical to understanding future events in the novel, so I wouldn't recommend it to first-time readers)Despite its faults, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is enormously impressive considering it is the first novel of Susanna Clarke. Since reading this, she has convinced me to read anything else she publishes concerning the magic history of England. I highly recommend it to seasoned fantasy veterans, and those with only a slight interest. I tend to think of myself as a part of the latter group, and I still adored this story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First, a word of caution-- this book will eat days of your life. You'll never get those days back, but you'll be hard-pressed to find days more enjoyed with a book. You'll read the 800-900 some odd pages and at the end you'll look about you on the bed or the chair and hope that a sequel has somehow fallen out and awaits your eager attention. I won't go into plot summary or the like, but I will say that all of these characters will become real to you and you will devour every little footnote for the added dimension they bring to the book and the history they flesh out.I hope you'll pick this up, and if you hate it, well, chances are I hate books you love."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First things first: this is a daunting book. It's long and wordy and loaded with footnotes. But once I managed to screw up my courage and really dive into it, I wasn't even a little bit disappointed.Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell takes place in England in the early 19th century. We see familiar historical figures (Lord Wellington figures prominently, as do Lord Byron and King George III), but we learn little by little that the history of this England is quite unlike the history that we know. The country used to be awash with magic, but now the only people who style themselves \\"magicians\\" would more accurately be thought of as magical historians. That is, of course, until the emergence of Mr Norrell and his protege Jonathan Strange.I don't want to describe too much more of the plot, because for such a long book, the plot is surprisingly straightforward and simple. The joy of the book is in the writing, the details, and the intricate world created by Susanna Clarke. The style of writing reminds me of Dickens or Austen, but loaded with wondrous (and not-so-wondrous) magic, and peppered with footnotes that help fill out the fictional history of English Magic.In short, the book was a delight. Setting the book in almost, but not quite, familiar terrain is a great way to make the reader feel simultaneously comfortable and uncomfortable, and her characters are as well-drawn as her world is detailed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is thick, and will be hard for some people to get into. There's one main story, but there's a lot of side-stories, and this may annoy some readers. If you don't like that kind of narration, don't read this. It took me a while to get into it, but once I got to a certain point, I found it interesting and more coherent, and it then became really easy for me to continue as I was genuinely enjoying myself. My point is, if you find yourself put off at first, have some patience and stick to it, you may find it very well worth your effort as I did.It was fun to read about an alternate version of history (early 19th c) where magic is real. There's also a few fun spelling quirks here (surprize for surprise, chuse instead of choose) so this story has more of an authentic feel to it, as if it really was written during the early 1800's."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Wonderfully imaginative, expertly crafted, full of mind-boggling detail, I am thoroughly enjoying this book though my wrist is getting sore from holding it aloft. This tale of English Magic during the napoleonic wars is not for the feint of heart, by which I mean those without patience for gobs and gobs of glorious faux-historical detail. The footnotes are eye-killers, to be sure, but worth the strain. If you love immersing yourself in a well-crafted universe where anything is possible, you will probably love this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book had me at the first page. Although I am not a fan of \\"fantasy\\" as such, this combination of history, fiction, magic, and humor was a delight - even the footnotes. The characters are wonderfully developed and became my friends. I miss them now that I have finished the book. I hope we see what happens next."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The novel was given to me as a Christmas gift and I could not put it down. Although the book seems daunting at first glance, it was a relatively fast read. Unexpected turns and twists kept me wanting more and I was disappointed when I finally finished the novel. This book is not for the novice reader who gets easily put off by the amount of pages. Close attention to detail and a wonderful gift for the avid reader."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Precious few books can take you for a ride like this one. Make no mistake, this work is well over one thousand pages--considering the myriad tiny footnotes that add so much to the depth of the narrative. It was an enjoyable read from start to finish; that is certainly the highest compliment that I can give.The book defies categorization. It is neither a history nor a fantasy, not a mystery nor any of the myriad categories that books are thrown into these days. The elegance of the book is apparent from its perfectly accurate title. This is indeed, a novel. A long narrative with a plot unfolded by the thoughts and actions of its characters. I found the characters to be fascinating--Norell with his endless collection of books, Strange with his innate confidence in his own abilities and Childermass somewhere in the middle. It is the story of two approaches to the restoration of a body of knowledge--Norell relies on books and is hesitant to try new things while Strange is anxious to use his own nascent talents without regard for written warnings. The twist is, of course, that the seemingly more cautious Norell is indeed the more reckless of the characters.More could be said about the story but to know too much about the book before reading it would detract from the pleasure of discovery that this book provides. It is so very, very rare to encounter so original a work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Wow what a crazy, amazing and intreguing book. I can see how people might be put off by this book. It can be slow in parts (though it does pick up) and it's not a crazy page turner you have to finish now type book. But on the other hand I agree with the critics (which are quoted on the back of the book) that \\"it's an instant classic\\"- Kirkus review; and that \\"many books are to beread, some are to be studied and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Noreell is one of the last kind.\\"- Washington Post. The book is extremely well written and I think should be added to English Literature classes.It is definitely unlike anything else I've ever read, the plot is fantastic and original, the chracters are amusing and the footnotes are a blast. I'm also very glad they didn't americanize the spelling of certain words. A++ One of my favorite books ever. You MUST read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a great book, a worthy follow-on for those burned out on Harry Potter-style magic. Set in 1800s England, Clarke employees the usage and spelling of the period (shew instead of show, sopha instead of sofa), but the bad Kindle translation just about ruins this fine read, making some lines of text so confusing it is impossible to untangle the intentional spelling from the hamfisted data entry.Buy the book, but avoid the Kindle ed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's debut novel is epic in scope, meticulous in its attention to detail and also maddeningly long. Set in an alternative Regency England where magic, not science, is the dominant paradigm, this is a story of friendship, power and bitter rivalry. The fictitious tale of Strange and Norrell is cleverly interwoven with actual events and visited by a number of historical personages, which serves to make it all the more convincing. I particularly liked the quasi-Arthurian mythos of the Raven King. Despite its length and the all but glacial speed of the plot, I'm glad I picked this up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke is the type of writer who chooses to write an essay when only one word answer was asked of her, I applaude her for the rich and deep history that she created for the characters in this novel, but it was too much.When trying to read this book i constantly found myself re-reading the same passages over and over again. The book would move from slow and dragging, to vastly entertaining. I wanted to finish reading this book, but in the end the only was i could was by listening to the the audio commentary.Many times with a novel i find myself dissapointed when reaching the end, wanting the story to continue. However with the novel i was dissapointed with how Ms. Clark managed to take such an interesting story and characters and then proceed to kill me with boredom.I appreciated the work and time that Ms. Clarke took in creating the characters with footnotes refering to fictional works of magic, but if you really must insist on reading this book, i suggest you save yourself the heartache and get the audiobook."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I finished reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell two nights ago. I will admit that the first hundred or so pages seemed so boring that I put the book aside for about two weeks thinking, ugh, how disappointing. But when I picked it up again, I found there were many nights when I read in bed till the wee hours of the morning, I found this story so engaging. The characters are so well rounded out, the different chains of the story connect so well, it is a wonderful read. When I came to the final few chapters, I honestly cried, these characters had gone through so much! And the conclusion truly wrapped up the story, there was nothing left hanging. I have read all the availale Harry Potter books and Lemony Snicket stories, and I felt considerably disappointed that those stories had a lot of \\"filler\\" that didn't improve the tales. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a truly adult read, and I recommend it to everybody!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book reminds me more of the longer Tolstoy novels than anything eles in its scope, emphasis on character development, subtle engaging plot over mindless action plot, and the beauty of the language. However, like Tolstoy, I think that you either love or hate it depending on your personal reading interests/style. I loved it - hence the rating. This book is NOT for people who prefer THRILLERS however."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Others in this forum have described the content of this wonderful novel, so instead, I'll just give my gushing reaction to what I read. I LOVED this book! I consumed all 800 pages in less than a week between work and sleeping; devouring it with the same singular passion Strange shows when studying magic. And when I finished it a few days ago, I was sad! I felt as though I'd left dear friends behind with no idea when I might see them again -- if ever. For a moment I toyed with re-reading the book ;-) Oh, I envy anyone who has not yet read it. It's one of those experiences that restore your faith in not only good storytelling, but the use of the English language. Susanna Clarke has created a thoroughly realized world (an alternate reality to ours) which, like Tolkien, has its own history, conventions, and legends, and not far into the book, you genuinely start to wonder: \\"Was there really a Raven King in England?\\" When I was a kid, I read voraciously. My favorite books were tales of historical reality tinged with fantasy like Narnia and Lord of the Rings, as well as the collected folk and fairy tales and legends of other countries. The closest I've come to finding similar books as an adult have been the Potter and Pullman novels. But this book outshines them both. This novel rewards the reader with not only a top notch story that grabs and holds your attention from start to finish, and vivid characters, each one; down to the smallest role fully realized -- but some of the best writing I've seen in ages. Harry Potter is a good yarn, but few would describe Rowling's writing as \\"literary.\\" Clarke's is. So much so, in fact, that when one takes a break from the novel, one may find one's thoughts and speech flowing in the book's narrative style. Now let me add my $.02 about the footnotes. I can see where they might annoy some readers or seem a bit twee. I found them charming. Not only for what they added to the story - and the way in which they added it - but because many of them are wonderful TOTALLY FAKE legends in their own right. And they're so well realized that, again, you wonder if those tales are really knocking around Great Britian somewhere. Does the book require patience? I suppose. Today's attention spans being what they are, many may not find a novel like this to their taste. But if you loved Dickens and Austin and their ilk, and you enjoy a hint of fantasy in your world, I guarantee you will love this book. I borrowed my copy from the library, but I want to own it and intend to buy it as soon as I finish this note. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I had much the same problems other readers had, getting past the first 100 pages.

This book is excellent on tape for the people who can't get past the first 100 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"My 12-year old son and I are reading this book together. We read a few chapters every night. He is a sophisticated reader, with a wide palette, having recently finished all of the Hitchhiker's Guide novels as well as Memoirs of a Geisha. We are thoroughly enjoying this novel. We discuss the nuances of the characters, speculate as to what various clues and foreshadowing could mean, and absolutely marvel at the breadth of Ms. Clarke's imagination. We read every word of every footnote and chuckle at the witty, dry humor. He is picking up a lot of European history as well. Since we are both of mixed race West Indian heritage, the subplot of the former slave Stephen King has been of particular interest. My son has never had the opportunity to read anything regarding the status of non-whites in largely white historical writing that exists today. A recent episode of \\"Regency House Party\\" on PBS (set in the same time period as \\"Strange & Norrell\\") also addressed this same subject. This was a show my son would never have otherwise been caught dead watching, but his interest was sparked due to the connection to the book. Kudos to Ms. Clarke, she could hardly have written a better book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was looking forward to this book, but after reading it, I don't get what all the fuss is over it - it's okay. While Clarke does an admirable job of writing in an archaic style (she's very good at it, don't get me wrong), it gets old. The book was fine - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either. Wait for it to come out on paperback."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Don't listen to anyone that tells you this book is \\"too long\\". It's a marvel. A marvel. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are two characters that will stamp themselves upon your memory permanently, and the world that Susanna Clarke creates is unrivaled in any fantastic fiction of the last fifty years. She spent ten years writing this book and it shows, from the meticulous footnotes to the vibrancy of every supporting character. If you haven't met Vinculus, or Stephen Black, or the merrily terrifying Gentleman with the Thistle-down hair, you are missing out. No one has thought up anyone like the Raven King, and no one has ever so successfully melded history and historical fiction with fantasy.Like I said, a marvel. Ignore every bad review you see here. That this book could be rated a mere three and a half stars and other books filled with hackneyed drivel rated higher, is only a testament to how eager most readers are for digestible pablum.

I wouldn't give all of them five stars.Now, the reason I gave Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke five stars anyway is that it managed to take everything I normally wouldn't touch with a barge pole, and made it into a damn good story.To those of you who don't know me, here are some fun facts about me. I:1) Hate long books (no attention span anyone?)2) Hate tedious descriptions (never finished LOTR)3) Was bored even by the film versions of all things Jane Austen4) Can't think of anything I find less interesting than history.This book:1) is 1040 pages long, an amount about three times bigger than my usual pain threshold.2) is filled up with so many descriptions and explanations, they had to put some of it into footnotes. The footnotes probably comprise a larger word count than the actual story (lies, lies, but there's a LOT)3) is apparently very inspired by Jane Austen, thematically (somewhat) and in style. Maybe I should start reading Jane Austen.4) reads like a history book at times. Again, the footnotes (!).But I loved everything about it. When you're reading it, provided you like it of course, it WILL be the best feeling ever when you find out that you're not even half-way into the book - a lot can happen before the end, and it WILL. In fact, it only gets better (but then again, the first couple of chapters are sort of boring, if you're anything like me.*)And believe it or not, I read every single bloody footnote. It's important for the world-building as well as the overall mood of the story, a factor that I personally value highly. Along with the writing style, it helps create that exact and very fitting atmosphere. Perfect book to read on a rainy day in Autumn by the way - wouldn't achieve the same effect on a sunny day.Sure, there were some of the more descriptive passages that I most likely wouldn't be able to recall ever having read. I can imagine my eyes sort of blurring at the time. And then I probably got distracted by a squirrel. But, but, but, when (and there will definitely be a when) I reread the book, I will take the time to read it all. And given the awesomeness of the book in general, I can't see why I wouldn't enjoy all the little details. Never thought I'd say that.So that was essentially what I didn't like about the book (and it turns out I liked it anyway! Win). But oh, there are so many things about this book that were absolutely amazing to begin with. The characters are well-developed (some more than others), they have their own motivations and personalities, and best of all, NONE are extreme in their alignments. Selfish? Sure. But not evil for evil's sake or good for good(nes)s' sake. I find that more sympathetic in characters than anything. In fact, I think the characters are probably the part of this book that made me like it the most. A character-driven book.But the plot is obviously pretty important, too. There are all these little subplots and somehow they intertwine in the strangest of ways. Most of my favourite books have somewhat complex plots - not too convoluted, but in a way that's believable in the 'willing suspension of disbelief' kind of way. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell happens to have this kind of plot as well as be one of my favourite books. What a coincidence!A thing that bothered me a bit was the ending, though. Not that I minded it. I just really wanted more I guess (also some parts were kind of unresolved. You know what I'm talking about if you've read the book). Good thing Susanna Clarke is working on a sequel! (source: good ol' Wikipedia)All in all, this book was on all accounts, a great book. Magical, one might say (*snigger*). Not in the 'you're a wizard Harry' or the 'one ring to rule them all' kind of way, but in a mystical, 'ye olde-fashioned' kind of way. And I think I actually prefer that.So if you, for instance, happened to have stumbled upon this book on a library shelf or on the internet, and you read the cover or the description of the book, and you thought it sounded like the worst or just the most boring book ever, please give it a shot anyway. And by shot, I mean read it ALL. Near the end (aka the last couple of hundreds of pages) it really picks up the pace and the intensity and you will not regret it. That is, if you're anything like me...* Totally worth it though. Oh look, I can make footnotes too!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's achievement in this, her first book, is quite remarkable: not only in this maiden effort does she master the diction and style we would sooner associate with Jane Austen and W. M. Thackeray (the two most famous chroniclers of the Regency setting of her novel), but she also creates an entire alternate fantasy history for England that presumes both a practical and theoretical tradition for magicians stretching all the way back to the first King Henry. What's more, the book becomes something of a page-turner after the first few chapters (more on those below), with long sequences that effectively evoke genuine suspense, horror, and pathos. And she is an absolutely marvelous scene-painter, particularly when it comes to the description of the magic her central characters effect (both for parlor tricks and for practical purposes). This is the sort of book in which you can pleasurably get lost for quite a few evenings: it's its own little world. To be able to do this with a first novel is extraordinary, and mirrors the achievement of Clarke's own hero Jonathan Strange.With this in mind, it is important to point out too (as Mr. Norrell himself would) that a noviate is always apt to make errors, and Clarke, like Strange, does commit quite a number. The opening chapters move very slowly, though things pick up by the early chapter in York Minster (where Mr. Norrell first works his magic), and even further in the chapter entitled \\"Brest\\" (where Mr. Norrell first works it for practical purposes). Quite a bit of editing might have helped Clarke sharpen some of the novel's longeurs considerably, and there are some characters that don't seem to go much of anywhere, and not all the there are any number of loose ends at the end of the book (some of which are clearly intentional, but several others which just seem forgotten after they've been dropped). Nonetheless, I would happily read any other fiction by this writer, and hope (as she's promised) she returns to this world of her own making in her subsequent novels. There's so much here, including not only an alternate history for England but also Wellington, Byron, Lord Liverpool, Napoleon and (best of all) George III in all his kingly madness, that it's hard to be patient for her next full-length effort.I would have awarded this a full five stars (even with my few exceptions to Clarke's novice's errors) had Tor Paperbacks issued this in a less miserably inconvenient format. Be aware that this novel is much too long to fit coveniently in a mass-market paperback form, and that the type is particularly hard to read. They should have issued it in three trade paperback volumes, as did the novel's British publisher, Bloomsbury Books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have recommended many books and said that is was great once you get past the first couple of capters, but it is very rare to say to someone that you loved a book, if you can just get through the first 300 pages. This is that book. I devoured the last 500 pages of this book, despite slogging through the first 300. I encourage anyone to give it a shot because the character developement and the story are superb and well thought out. The only reason it is not getting five stars is because it was so hard to get into during the first 39 chapters."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The author can easily bring you to England, Spain or Fairy with her vivid descriptions, wonderful use of the time's language and most extraordinary ability to put into words what the characters feel. At times scary, magical, loving, exciting, murderous, fantastic and ever so real. A truly original story that is colored with proper British history.This story had me enchanted 99.99% of the time. The last few books I have read have all had disappointing endings. Maybe it is the books or I might be in a funk..... I am sure it is I that is off. I saw the foreshadowing; after all, it was prophesized, but I didn't enjoy seeing it fulfilled. This one sad event keeps me from giving this six stars. To shame Miss Susanna Clark. The next work you author, strive to make me happy at the conclusion.I plan on recommending this work to most everyone. If I am to be saddened, so shall they. I do hope that Miss Clark is busy working on her next piece to make me happy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I picked this book up for only a few dollars, and I didn't really expect a ton from it. I read a lot of sci-fi, but not much \\"fantasy,\\" so this was a new experience for me.In short, this book is fantastic. It has a very unique charm that most books do not. First, it's written to resemble writings from the Victorian period, a bit odd at first, but it grows on you. Secondly, Ms. Clarke sets up a very intricate, rich and complex mythology for her England. As it is set during the Napoleonic wars, the historical context offers a very clever way to incorporate her new myths into the world of Mr Norrell and Mr. Strange.The characters are very well fleshed out, as is the plot. Which takes me to my next point. As the world of the book is so rich, it takes a while for the author to get into the story. I completely appreciated it, however, as the complex universe that she built was very interesting and grandiouse - much like Herbert w/ Dune. So, just like the title of this review, once you get through the first 350 pages, the book is brilliant. It's fun, interesting, exciting and dramatic. A must read - if you're patient!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I did enjoy the half of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell that I read, but I just got too darn tired to continue. I am happy to read big, bad, heavy books that will conk me in the head every time I try to read in bed. I quite enjoy English works that take a long time to build up to little or nothing if the journey is good. I freely admit I loved the historical style, complete with footnotes, in Jonathan Strange. It seemed like everything that I would want in a book, history, magic, written for grownups! But it was just too much reading with nothing going on to take. I have to agree with other reviewers, it is a personal style thing. Perhaps at another time in my life I will come back to it, but for now I'm okay with not knowing how it all ends up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Even for you speedreaders, this one is going to take a while. Susanna Clarke's debut novel is a tremendous success. After reading it, I find it unbelievable that this is her first. She is good. Real good.If you like fantasy, and you like it in the British style, I doubt there is any better book out there. The characters are wonderful and the story itself is at times funny, charming, sad, and downright scary.So why not five stars? This book is longer than the Nile River and is sometimes slower than a three-legged mule. Sometimes Clarke feels she needs to expand on a thought and you'll find numerous footnotes throughout the story. These footnotes are teeny weeny and sometimes covers multiple pages. If they were normal font, you could tack on another 50 pages at least to this book. And sometimes the book just doesn't seem to be going anywhere, especially in the beginning. It's like a bio of these two magicians.Several times I could only read one chapter at a time, because it was so slow. But it does eventually pick up, so hang in there. It truly is a beautiful book, and though it's a behemoth, it deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Think before you invest your time in this one.This book has moments of undeniable charm, clever ideas, and wonderful use of language. There were many times where I found myself truly immersed in a parallel world where English magic and English manners coexisted. Unfortunately, these moments were all too often mere islands in a sea of prose. Now, I don't consider lack of action to be a fatal flaw. However, with so little plot, character became critical, and here is where the book finally failed for me. While the characters are indeed carefully and fully drawn, I found them unsympathetic. I found myself over halfway through (essentially having finished a novel's-worth of fiction) with little actual attachment to any of the book's main or even peripheral characters.Potential readers should ask themselves if they are ready for a book where the critics who PRAISE it write as follows:(all quotes from 5-star reviews)\\"as you might imagine there isn't a lot of magic going on, at least not for the first few hundred pages\\"\\"Longer than it seems according to the page count\\"\\"leisurely is probably too fast-paced a description\\"\\"If it doesn't draw you along, keep trying. If it still doesn't, try skimming footnotes, skimming pages, dipping in now and then to keep up on plot and catch one of those well-crafted lines\\"If those sound like descriptions of books you like, you will be in heaven here. Others, like me, would have been well advised to try some serious skimming, as its proponents recommend."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you are into magic this is a fun book to read, I liked the use of contrasting characters for Strange and Norrell. Overall the story was put together very well and was not overly long. The very english style was a new and interesting read for me and I rather liked the setting of the story. I even learned a few new words in this story. I await the next book, unfortunately I read this one in a very short period of time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's easiest to describe this novel as \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" and that's an apt comparison but slightly misses the point. It's a much richer exploration of magic than Harry Potter, weaving in the English social dynamics of Jane Austen and the irony and atmosphere of Dickens. That being said, like Austen and Dickens it does require an enormous investment of TIME to read this nearly 900 page doorstop of a novel. Unlike another recent doorstopper novel of 19th century England, \\"The Crimson Petal and the White,\\" Ms. Clarke's novel does not let you down at the end. My only minor quibble is that the novel could have used a bit more slashing by a judicious editor's pen, but it's a very minor quibble indeed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Wow...look at the size of this book! I love fat books so it wasn't really intimidating, but I did not know what to expect. At first it took some time getting used to the archaic style of writing Susanna Clarke favors, but it quickly became clear that it was necessary to establish the somewhat dark and mysterious atmosphere rampant throughout the novel. It certainly is an intense book, but utterly enjoyable. At first the footnotes were a little disconcerting, but quickly became a part of the story. After a while I began to look forward to the footnotes, as they seemed to be \\"proof\\" that there really was a history of magic! Interesting also the illustrations sprinkled throughout the book, something that is rarely found these days.All in all, an utterly engrossing work of fiction! Thanks to Susanna Clarke's first novel (can you believe it?) I burned the midnight oil many times in the last couple of weeks.I am looking forward to reading more fiction by this author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What I find interesting, after reading most of the reviews below, is that most of the people who hated (or were disappointed by) this book quit reading after a few hundred pages. Normally I'd consider that an adequate test of a book's worth, too. And in fact I did almost quit reading after 300 pages -- but I'm so glad I didn't. If I had, I would have thought it was clever, moderately interesting, but way too slow and meandering, with unappealing characters. But by page 600, I was staying up too late and being late for work, always wanting to read a little bit more. And the ending actually made me cry, that's how much I cared about the characters. (This is not a spoiler -- I cry at both happy and sad endings.) My recommendation to anyone who's contemplating quitting is: If you like this book at all, if you think it has any redeeming qualities whatsoever, hang in there. You'll be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is certainly a long read, but really worth it. It showcases the talent of the writer in every sense. I'm an actor and in between jobs I spend a lot of time on the beach reading. The tremendous skill of the writer is shown in every page in her prose, narrative, plot, and characters.This book which people are comparing to the potter series, is a wonderful escapade that provides wondrous skills. I'm so glad I picked this up after reading about it in Canyon News (Star gazing) pick of the week, here in Hollywood. Its a novel to enjoy and admire and will keep the reader simply captivated. It takes the reader through the magical lands of England,and the magician raven king. I never review books, but felt compelled to recommend it, and wouldn't waste my time reviewing it, unless it was really superb."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I had greatly looked forward to the publication of this book. The early reviews made it sound like just the sort of work I would like. And the rave from one of my favorite authors (Palliser, author of \\"The Quincunx) further whetted my appetite.I read and read and read before I finally gave up. I just don't see anything here worthy of merit. The characters are wooden and the plot all but non-existent.I would say that Ms. Clarke is a British Anne Rice--not a compliment in my book. Certainly she is no Rowling.Obviously many readers were greatly attracted to this book. I'm just not one of them. And whatever an amateur's opinion is worth, that's mine."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am an avid reader, but I usually find modern literature to be narrow, boring, and narcissistic. I love Jonathan Strange. This is one of the best books I've read by a modern writer. It has joined my top three books of all time: David Copperfield, Foucault's Pendulum, and Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.The book was intriguing, atmospheric, haunting. I found the characters interesting, the plot engaging, and the book to be truly imaginative (something that can rarely be said of adult literature anymore). I love a long book, I like to stay a while with a story- this book ended too soon and I can't wait until Susanna Clarke writes another one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Honestly-- this is a book that makes you want to become a writer. I could not put it down. Loved every single moment with this book. I didn't even let a footnote pass without reading it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I absolutely love this book. It's my second favorite fantasy novel after The Hobbit.Susanna Clarke's magical history of England is detailed and interesting, and she reveals it at a perfect pace over the course of the book.

I'm really looking forward to more books by her in the future."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It might be worth the money if you really need something to start a fire with.

The last third of the book is fairly good, but still not as good as all the gushing seems to indicate. It is a rock solidly mediocre book. The whole section about the war with France is dull. Clarke's writing style is fine, and maybe that is what captures some people's imaginations. If you want extraordinary fantasy, read China Mieville or Philip Pullman"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book about magicians and the reemergence of magic, is really more about England's uppercrust society, and class structure in early 18th century England. Gentleman and ladies know their place, as, of course, do all servants. Leisure and prejudice are fully in force, and we get a _very_ full reading of how things might have been back in cheery ol' England. In fact, the book might be most impressive in how closely it meets expectations about how a gentleman's novel might have been written back in those days.But then again, that's precisely the problem! This is the 21st century, and we now have more immediate needs from a novel, i.e., that it have something happen more than once every 50 pages or so. And that the characters have more emotion than the stereotype of the 18th century British upper class. Too much is dry and detailed and dull. The key is that this novel is just way too long; half the 800 pages would have fit the story much better (and would have been so easy to achieve, with so much material present that could have easily been removed; Clarke goes off on tangents on nearly every page).Strange and Norrel is a melancholy, grey and somber read about how the history of the British Isles might have been written if magic was real. Occasionally we find some real humor (I laughed out loud about 4 times, so once every 200 pages or so), in a classic 18th century English sense. The book keeps seeming like it will get somewhere, and the prose is both easy to read and detailed. If you like long, slow reads, about characters having a weird mix of historical accuracy and fantasy (but devoid of serious emotion) perhaps this book's for you. Keep in mind that the book is historical fantasy, not historical fiction. For me, in this context (ok, in any context), it was just way too long...."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book started out in a promising manner with an interesting story line as magic comes back to England, a young woman is brought back from the dead, people flit back and forth between the world of magic and reality. From there, however, the book degenerates into a long, drawn-out description of war between England and France using magic to do battle. The story becomes tedious and boring. While attempting to follow the plot through never-ending detail, eventually, I gave up and stopped reading about midway though. It was no Harry Potter!!! (But great if you have insomnia and are looking for something to put you to sleep.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I read this when it was first published.

Now I'd be glad to sell mine for $10 bucks and take the loss gracefully.Star"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't normally read British authors (aside from G.M. Fraser) for a whole slew of extremely valid reasons. However, my wife's book club (most appropriately called the Big Readers Book Club) had this item on the list for November and I decided to play along. It's always a bit of toot toot to read the silly books they choose (last month it was some insipid tripe by their old favorite Jeffrey Eugenides) and make snide comments from both ends while sipping barley wine or (in this case) winter warmer.In any case, this book looked more promising than the normal Big (and I do mean BIG) Readers Book Club fare based on the historical aspect and magic (Hoppy loooooves doing magic tricks). Unfortunately, I was to be disappointed once again. This is a big book (something like 800 pages) and as is often the case with such things, is in serious need of an editor. I foolishly expected some good characters and development (based on size), but was instead treated to shallowness (something I'm surrounded by at work, so I do recognize it) and longwinded paragraphs full of misssspelllings. I don't like that. And I didn't like all the footnotes. Fraser does this and as much as I enjoy his novels (they are very good), I don't like the footnotes. As for Johnny Strangelove, I liked some of the happenings on page 137, but not much else. I can't recommend this. Even for Book Clubs. I had no fun. None. I did get some good sleep though. After the winter warmer. Sorry. Sleepy. HHD."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book has a great premise and, perhaps, great promise. Unfortunately, it fails to develop the former and never delivers on the latter. There is action and there is character development, but the action is so slow and so wrapped in seemingly endless descriptive passages that the characters seem to be frozen figures from a video game with processor lag. I read the whole thing hoping for a change of pace (I was stuck on an airplane), but by the end of the third chapter I just did not care what happened to these muddle-headed muggles with their pseudo-Victorian sensibilities and their utter lack of any spark. I left the book on the plane."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"ive read dozens of reviews for this book. the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place. they are all FALSE! this book is BORING. i dont see ANY reason to compare this book to the harry potter series. other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman, they're not even in the same category. ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count, and this was the worst by far. the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to \\"make it rain\\" or \\"make the statues talk\\". if your looking for a good fantasy novel, try R.A. Salvatore or Weis & Hickman. this just isnt worth the time. i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an AMAZING book this is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish. for some reason, i just wanted to know how it ended. i normally read about 2 books a week...this one took me over a month to finish. its just so boring, i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair. if you want real fantasy, try something else. please."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm at page 300, and I struggled to get there. I will put it down for a bit before resuming. The problem is that one of our main characters, Mr. Norrell, is a dud! I don't care the least about him. And the prose, while good, is rambling. This book was in severe need of some editing. On these pages, I've seem some readers compare it to Jane Austen. Don't compare this style to that of Jane Austen. Jane Austen is witty, and her characters have depth and life. The characters in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are mostly flat.With that said, there are some subplots that intrigue me; however, it takes so long to resume those stories that I get bored until she picks up the interesting twists again. All in all, I see a lackluster main character, and a style that kills a potentially interesting story in mundane details."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The story is interesting once you dig it out from under mountains of extraneous words. This book needs an editor who can cut out 500 pages. If this is what wins hugo awards these days, I'll stay away from award winning books. Give me Jim Butcher any day."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After reading so many sparkling reviews on this book, I just had to go out and see what all the hype was about. This is certainly a decent book, and it has great idea behind it, but... This book is one of the most unnecessarily long books I've ever read--next to my failed attempt to finish Lord of the Rings.Set during the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteenth century, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell describes how the English might have fought with the use of magic. This book can be catagorized as historical fiction fantasy, but that doesn't quite cut it. Contemporary as this book is, it's written is the over-the-top, and often wordy style of the nineteenth century (think the Scarlet Letter and Wuthering Heights). If you're not into run-on sentence after run-on sentence, (not to mention EXTENSIVE footnotes on the history of Clarke's alternate nineteenth century), you might not like this book.As for length, this book tops 800 pages and is divided into three sections: Mr Norrell, Jonathan Strange, and John Uskglass. The story, however, really doesn't pick up until John Uskglass--which is, in my opinion, where the book should have started. Susanna Clarke said that the novel took her about ten years to finish and, after slogging my way through it, I believe her!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I think it's pretty obvious from other reviews this is a love/hate book. There are things about it that will either charm you or make you want to throw it against the wall. First, of course, is the Regency speake, which I think easily snows a lot of people, and for those folks transforms what would otherwise be a mediocre fantasy doorstop into an instant classic. The extra-e'd language and a sense of class distinctions are really the only things this book has in common with Austen, in spite of the many comparisons between the two. People forget that she was writing in her contemporary langage, so it's natural and flows in her novels, rather than being twee and forced as it often is here. (People also forget that Jane is laugh-out-loud funny, which this book ain't--yes, I understand it's dry wit, but this is the Sahara.)Second are the footnotes--either this will strike you as clever, and creating a multi-faceted universe, or as too clever for it's own good and an overly-precious desperately attention-seeking device. As someone who has to read a lot of legal and scholarly papers, the novelty factor for me was zero and the annoyance factor was through the roof.I also think the folks that credit her for creating fully realized characters might have had a different edition of this book. Some of the characters do get nearly ridiculous amounts of backstory, but the major female characters are basically long-suffering, lovely ciphers waiting to be saved, and Stephen Black is easy-goingly tolerant and protective of a society that enslaves his family (and only treats him a little better) to a degree that borders on \\"Gone With the Wind\\" absurdity.That's not a total criticism, since I think her heart's in the right place--she's Trying To Make A Point in some way with treating those characters in that way, even if I'm not entirely sure what that point is. While she's English 1A obvious about the fact she's going somewhere, she's also really obtuse about where exactly she's going. One one level it's refreshing to credit the reader with the ability to think, but it's not handled in a truly satisfactory way.Neverthless, the book isn't a total wash--it's really more like 2.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't have half-steps. When Lady C-- is not Trying Too Harde to force the olde language, she's capable of luminously beautiful writing. There's definitely potential lurking--if she can find an editor that isn't an overindulgent old buddy I'd be willing to give her next effort a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"One of the WORST books I have ever read. It was pure \\"boreture\\" (bore+toreture = boreture)...the footnote ploy was hugely irritating, and unbelievably distracting. The plot was a rip-off of the film, \\"The Prestige\\" (battling magicians), the Hell-Raiser franchise (magic box), The PageMaster (people as books, or books as people)...a very cheaply derivative work. If this is a sample of Ms. Clark's book, then she needs to stop writing. I vow to will run like hell from anything she has written and will ever write. I can not believe the inexplicably \\"good\\" reviews that this book garnered; the only thing I can think of is that the reviewers actually did not read the book, but praised it, regardless, so as not to appear dumb and run the risk of getting ostracized by other reviewers.It took me two months to finish this book because I kept falling asleep. To put it in perspective, I normally finish a book every 2-3 days.Boring! Do not waste your money. If you are that curious to see for yourself, borrow it if your library is cursed to enough to have this steaming mass of dreck on its shelves."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"...then this book is for you. I can't believe I wasted hours of my life on a book where nothing happens. A friend gave me this book as a christmas present and I felt obligated to read it; mistake on my part. This book is so long and full of so much nothingness. Bottom line is this book is crap."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Ok book its only missing three thingsPlotCharacter developmentDialog that goes anywhereI really wanted to like this book I heard so many positive things about it but I have a rule if nothing happens of interest in the first 100 pages I take the book back to library. The only reason the book is getting three stars instead of two is that the footnotes were interesting and they unlike the main plot actually contributed something to the story. I would have liked to read a book about the solely about the Raven King.Overall-Too long and I don't know what it was with the characters the author meant the dialog to be funny but every single character in the book just ended up sounding smug. I could never get past that part."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I fell for all the positive hype and purchased this book expecting greatness. I was sadly disappointed. The characters were not that interesting really and the plot tended to drag, very heavily at times. An adult Harry Potter this is not nor is it a \\"fantasy\\" novel as most would expect. I plodded through the whole thing, determined to find what everyone liked about this book. I guess I missed it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"That's the easiest way to describe this massive tome by first-time novelist Susanna Clarke. And it is massive, coming in at just under 800 pages.The plot is far too complex to go into here, and it has been done by other reviewers before me. But this novel has all the ingredients of a Dickens story - a noble hero (although I will admit that Clarke's definition of \\"noble\\" is somewhat at odds with Mr Dickens'), a damsel of pure heart in thrall to a man of evil (here there are actually two such ladies, and owing to the subject matter the evil does not reside in a man), and interesting supporting characters whose names describe their personalities to a T.Reviews that I have read of this book, by both professional reviewers and others, have described this book as an adult \\"Harry Potter\\". It is nothing of the kind. In fact, although the general subject of both this book and JK Rowling's series are the same, to compare these two is to compare apples and oranges.That is not to say, however, that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is a bad book. Far from it, but you should be prepared to read it from a completely different viewpoint than you would a \\"Harry Potter\\" novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Patience is a virtue and it pays off in the end with this novel. Much like the charachter Drawlight I was getting rather anxious about whether Mr. Norrell would ever perform magic or if this book would just be an unending ciruit of overly hyped parties with the uppercrust of 1810 in attendance. Around page 200 events unfolded that proved this book worth the effort. And the story actually became a \\"stay up late to see what is going to happen next\\" during the last 200 pages. Mr. Norrel is boring, overly cautious, and reclusive- not your normal hero. Jonathan Strange is daring, charasmatic, and sometimes oblivious to events around him. You respect what both men bring to the rebirth of English magic in the end. A sequel would be embraced- perhaps \\"Strange and Norrell escape from the unending darkness\\"? Or \\"The Fall of the Nameless slave\\" or \\"Vinculus: the New Book\\"...."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke has written an incredible story that combines fantasy fiction with what feels like 19th century literature. Fans of either genre should very much enjoy this book.One of the best things about \\"Strange\\" is that the author took her time in unraveling the tale for her readers. Sure, the basic story could have been covered in 250 pages, and many authors would have chosen to do so. But at best, that could have only produced a book that was good. Readers of such an abbreviated version would not have realized it, but they would have been short-changed. Instead, Clarke wanted to emerse readers in 19th century life and magic. She included rich details that give the reader a flavor for both the time period and the individuality of each character. The reader has time to savor the book and really become engrossed in it. That is what turned an interesting idea into an astounding achievement."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There is such a seamless blend of history and magical fantasy that it is hard to tell where real English history leaves off and an imaginary history of magic takes over. Strange and Norrell carry on their business alongside the Duke of Wellington and poet Lord Byron. Clarke tells the story with wit and polish. She sets a realistic tone with meticulous detail on societal structure and mannerisms of Jane Austen's time. Her use of quaint phrasing and such spelling as &quot;chuse&quot; for &quot;choose&quot; and &quot;shew&quot; for &quot;show&quot;, as well as use of fictitious footnotes on folklore and the history of magic, add to the realism. Yes, this is a long novel. But that effectively pulls the reader into a world where Parliament and magic, history and enchantment, and gentlemen and faeries work side-by-side. The book is so full of well-articulated imagery and magical surprises that the story line speeds along. Forget comparisons of this novel to Harry Potter. I recommend it as a refreshingly unique read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book based on some of the early reviews and I am having a hard time getting through it. It is slow, with not very much life to it. It is fantasy, but it is not very 'fantastic'. It might be a little too historically accurate for my, bogging down in the details instead of concentrating on plot-worthy events. The footnotes are fairly numerous and distracting. I am not sure if I will finish the book, similar to several other reviewers here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first time, I managed about 200 pages before giving up. For me, the footnotes were the best part -- the people and events described in the footnotes were more interesting than the story.I didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't particularly like or dislike any of them, and I wouldn't have cared to meet them. I can imagine that they lived and the events happened, but it was like there was a curtain between us. I was never pulled into the story, and had no trouble putting the book down.As a historical, the writing was competent and often witty. As fantasy, particularly today's fantasy, the plot lacked mystery, intrigue, and tension.This is the first time I've reviewed a book that I didn't finish, and I feel a bit guilty about that, but the book has been getting a lot of hype, and readers should be aware that the book isn't universally appreciated.***Edited to add that I did finish the book. Sometimes an attitude adjustment is all that's needed. With this book, it helped when I decided to abandon what I wanted and go with what Clarke wrote."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If it hadn't been for my strong determination to finish everything I start, I would have put this book down weeks ago. The first four hundred pages were soooooooo slow. I used to avoid the book, try to hide it somewhere and forget it, but this determination told me that I had to finish and know if it was worth the time. Having finished it last night I can say that it's a \\"good book\\". That's all I'd give it. Ask me in a month and I won't remember the plot nevermind the intricacies-- not exactly the stamp of a great novel. The last two hundred pages gripped me, I couldn't wait to turn the page, but did I really have to wade through 600 pages to get there? This book should have been edited to half its size... less is sometimes more. I wish someone had told Susanna Clarke that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Just a look at several different reviews and you get the idea - people either love that book or are bored to death. I honestly tried - and reached about half through before I decided that life was too short to spend it on this volume.There is no plot - really, there isn't. The so called \\"well developed characters\\" are indeed, well developed - at the very beginning, but after that they simply do not change that much. Nothing happens for pages and pages. I do admit that the language is beautiful and text-wise it is good work.But \\"Lord of the Rings\\" keeps you in its magic spell when you read it, or \\"Big Fish\\" or \\"Time Enough For Love\\" or LeGuin's EarthSea books. They all have magic. This one doesn't - even though it is written about it. I simply did not want to meet any of the characters again and for me that's enough reason not to finish the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am the kind of reader who begins one book, then puts it down and takes up another, and another, until I find one that I absolutely must finish reading. Sadly JS&MN is not that book. I have been reading it since September of last year and am only halfway through. It is rare when this happens. The premise of the book is wonderful, but the execution of the story is done with such a slow pace and dry writing style that I find myself putting it down after a few pages. Frustrating! Susanna Clarke is a talented author, there is no doubt about that, but I despair of ever being able to get to the last page of this disappointingly dull novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Not knowing Clarke's background it's hard to assume the authority to say this but at least from a reader's perspective she has entered the genre entirely unfettered by any preconceived notions of what fantasy novels should look like. Perhaps her fresh perspective is exactly what we needed. Strange & Norrell is neither one of the host of Harry Potter imitations, nor a Tolkien imitation, nor a New-Wave/hard-SF/Space-opera offering, nor (thankfully) some enormous world-building cycle in imitation of Robert Jordan. Her book is a burst of creativity and light on the fantasy genre and is completely : a re-creation of the 19th century novel dealing not so much with a system of magic but a system of British Thought. It is the sort of considered literature that will introduce many, many readers to the potential of fantasy literature who might otherwise have consigned it to a ghettoof exploitation and imitative vehicles. We believe that Clarke--along with Neal Stephenson operating from the science-fiction side--may have legitimized a path for other writers to explore speculative elements in their historical works where they have otherwise avoided. In fact, to understand how thoroughly Clarke has crossed genre lines, this is the current list from Barnes and Noble of \\"People who bought this book also bought:\\"The Shadow of the Wind Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, Lucia Graves (Translator), Read by Jonathan DavisGilead Marilynne RobinsonThe Plot Against America Philip RothI Am Charlotte Simmons Tom WolfeSkinny Dip Carl HiaasenNot a fantasy book among them! Compare that with another popular and well-respected female author in Laura Resnick (In Legend Born, The White Dragon, and The Destroyer Goddess) who has all fantasy recommendations:Goddess of the Ice Realm David DrakeThe Grand Crusade Michael A. StackpoleThe King Betrayed Deborah ChesterThe Assassin's Edge Juliet E. McKennaImpossible Odds: A Chronicle of the King's Blades Dave DuncanFool's Fate (Tawny Man Series: Book 3) Robin HobbGoddess of the Ice Realm David DrakeWe don't point this out to cast aspersions on Resnick but rather acknowledge how insulated so many well-considered fantasy authors are and what a leap it is for Susanna Clarke to bring other readers inside.WHO SHOULD READ:There are two peculiar but vast audiences that will deeply appreciate this book: those readers who enjoyed Harry Potter from JK Rowlings (but were looking for something a bit more \\"mature\\" or \\"literary\\") and those readers who enjoyed Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. One of the themes that appears to be operating in Hogwarts is the relationship between master and apprentice but it is a here fully developed and in full flower in Strange and Norrell. Stephenson's interweaving of science-fiction in to historical non-fiction--something we didn't think could possibly be equaled--is done exceptionally well by Clarke with the insertion of her magicians in to the times of the Napoleonic wars. It is a novel that carefully examines the clash of generations within the bright trappings of English humor, Victorian phrasing, and magic. It's a tremendous example of what can be accomplished with some literary talent and the courage to unfetter an imagination. Really a fine, fine effort that we can recommend to almost anyone with the stamina to tackle an 800 page book.WHO SHOULD PASS:As in many good works of literature, there is a lack of what we would call action. There is no open conflict in the sense of combat (though one duel). There is a lack of any inking of sexuality from any character. While it is easy to toss this sort of advice out, these lacks echo curiously in a book about conflict, about matrimonial love, and contains large sections actually within the battlegrounds of a war. The entire book, in some sense, is a purely intellectual enterprise--filled with purely intellectual delights. A good foil for Clarke is Stephen Pressfield's historical novels of Greece (The Gates of Fire, The Tides of War, The Last of the Amazons, and The Virtues of War). In Pressfield, we have books that are substantially about violence, conflict, and sex that are intellectual in nature but visceral in its theme. Clarke is precisely the opposite: her books are about the intellect and it is in this realm that she rewards--and rewards greatly! Readers should understand this entering her books and not be dismayed when her characters flatten at the point where one might expect a bit of adrenaline to begin coursing. In all other respects, however, this is a fabulous book.[...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is wonderfully imaginative, unusual and beautifully crafted. It's a little classic 19th century novel and a lot of fantasy rolled into one. The way Ms. Clarke describes her alternate, magical 19th century England is highly entertaining. The writing is well-balanced, both suspenseful and lighthearted. Jonathan Strange is a very compelling character, and Mr. Norrell fascinating in his own, cranky way, as well. The tension between the two title characters builds the drama as the story continues to a thrilling conclusion."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The only way I could \\"read\\" it was during my commute.It is not for everyone, (see comments by D. Miller), who clearly knows nothing about English literature - this is for people who enjoy reading without rushing to the end. Clarke is a masterful genius with her descriptions, satire, the alternate history is hilarious. It all flows for Clarke with subtlety, the characters are lively, the British are portrayed with so much humor, as are the French. It is a fine piece of literature, and it you can't appreciate the richness of the language, you need to go back to reading Harlequin novel (talking to you, D. Miller).Highly recommended for true literature buffs."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of those novels you find once in a lifetime. It is completely different from anything you might have read about magicians before. Don't expect magical battles or a lot of action though. What is different here is the psychology of the magicians and the way in which some history is retold. A quick description could be: \\"kind of Harry Potter for adults who love Jane Austin and 19th Century novels\\". I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a blend of fantasy and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":".. between two 19th Century magicians.As others have commented .. this is not a typical fantasy novel. It has a 19th century (Dickensy) feel to the writing style. It reads like a series of short stories strung together by an underlying relationship between Norrell and his pupil, Strange.Unlike your typical fantasy novel, there is little roller-coaster ride here. The stories hold your interest well, but there are few places where I felt the need to continue reading, because I could not put the book down. The main characters are well drawn. The situations well described. Unusual terms are explained with planty of footnotes throughout. Some of the footnotes themselves are almost complete stories. Reading the longer footnotes is effectively reading a story, within a story, within a story.I'm not going to describe the storyline/plot, you can find that elsewhere.Why only 4*s?- some of the magic that is described, particularly during Strange's adventures in the Napoleonic wars, is just too far-fetched. With their powers, Strange and Norrell could have defeated the French purely between themselves.- I never figured out who the man with the thistle-down hair was. I understand he was the current faerie king, but got no historical background to the character (unless he was John Uskglass, and I missed it)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"One of the best novels I've read in the past ten years.

I havent read any review mentioning the dark humor that it's found in this amazing work. It's here and there but the humor is all around. The plot it's everywhere so you will need to have a little patience to connect all the dots, but for me that only made the experience even more fun.I really hope to read in the near future more adventures of the last two English Magicians alive.Thanks Mrs. Clarke for a great read.Cheers"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"_Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell_ is a riveting book about two English magicians who, in an England where magic occurred in years past but not in their time, decided to bring magic back to England again. Mr. Norrell is a picture of a scholar who has studied for years and years in order to insure that he is the only magical expert alive in England. Jonathan Strange is a man who tries to learn about magic under the tutelage of Mr. Norrell, but then allows his natural aptitude for magic to guide him instead when Mr. Norrell keeps back some of his magical knowledge. The two magicians also disagree about how the Raven King, the founder of English magic and ruler of various faerie realms, should be discussed in terms of modern magic.This book was amazing. The characters were intriguing and I thought it was really nice to read a fantasy book meant for adults instead of the young adult stuff I've been reading lately. The dark element of the book was well done, and the malevolence of some faeries and a bit of dark magic was portrayed in the novel. One of my favorite moments is when the Raven King finally does show up in England; the author builds up to the moment and the character perfectly, and the depiction of the Raven King was perfect.It is a long book, but it is worth it. I will probably read it again sooner or later."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Rich in detail, and refreshingly different.

A must-read for anyone who enjoys deep characters and well thought out plots."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a friend after having read it myself. It is a fun story. My friend is an avid reader of multiple genres and she loved it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first part of the book took a long time to get me involved, but because it had been recommended by someone I respect, I stuck with it. Once the plot got interesting, the characters began to be increasingly frustrating, to the point that I almost stopped reading. Again, I stuck with it-this time, not only because of my friend's recommendation, but because the plot had captured me enough that I really had to find out what was going to happen. The last 100 pages were extremely satisfying, and made clear the author's reasons for the seemingly incomprehensible and inconsistent behavior of the characters. It was intriguing, sad, strange and finally made sense."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There was a distinct point where I began to love this novel. I couldn't say exactly where in the 1024-page count it was, but I think it was when I realized that the history of English magical legend and mythology was entirely fabricated by author Susanna Clarke. That history is so rich and hints so well at further richness that I almost couldn't be convinced that it was an invention of Clarke. This version of England is almost as detailed as Tolkien's Middle Earth, without being bogged down in a faux-recapitulation of that history. The elements of Clarke's world's history are revealed only as becomes necessary to the plot.And the plot -- what a plot it is. For a while it revolves around a small group of seemingly insignificant people, and even the events around them appear largely unimportant. The backdrop of the Napoleanic Wars distracts the reader from the slow burn that's happening right in front of his nose. Something terrible is happening in the land of Faerie, and its effects are beginning to leak into Victorian England.My only real complaint is the low quality of the illustrations. They are suitably gothic, but feel like studies for more complete drawings. An inked finish would have been more appropriate."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is easily one of my all time favorites. The writing is superb.

Now, you don't particularly connect with the characters, as the tone of the writing is one that puts you ever at arms length from them, but you're always interested in what comes next. The book feels very similar to Gaiman and Pratchett's &#34;Good Omens&#34; in tone.While plunging into this world (with its masses of _seemingly_ random footnotes that build into a life all their own), be warned that you're making an investment.One that pays off!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Read 3/4's of the book before I just gave up. Nothing had happened of note 3/4's of the way into the book. It had been advertised as a Jane Austin period fantasy with wizards.

Lots of mind numbing dialog."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I LOVED this book, but I can understand why some people wouldn't. People nowadays just don't have the stamina to read long books. This may sound cynical, but one of the reasons why Harry Potter is so popular is because it is written on a children's level.

However, with all the comparisons to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings floating around, I was reminded more of a completely different book as I read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell... The Count of Monte Cristo stood out to me more than any other novel. The details of 19th-century high-society were vivid and engaging.Although this is a book concerning magic, this is a book ABOUT people. The quote at the beginning of Jonathan Strange's segment speaks worlds: \\"A magician might [kill a man with magic], but a gentleman never could.\\" This book is more about the relationships between the various characters, as all books SHOULD be.In all honesty, the book is rather slow up until the introduction of Jonathan Strange. That is a fairly unavoidable consequence of having a central character (Mr. Norrell) being a pretty boring person. The segments featuring The Man with the Thistle-Down Hair provide some relief, but in all honesty I was pretty eagerly waiting for the book to \\"pick up\\". I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book was a delight. I admit, it was a little heavy going. The thickness of the book itself was imposing, and on opening it, I found that the language was rather more ancient than I thought it might be. However, once you get past the 19th century novel model, it's a wonderful book. The stray into the land of fairy was vivid in both colour and detail. The explanations of things like the despair and melancholy were overpowering and you really end up buying into the world that Clarke creates.I loved it so much, I even named one of my own characters (Mrs Etherington-Strange) after Jonathan Strange. I adore the fact that magic starts off as just a boring activity for boring people and becomes something much darker and more practical.I have since bought the audio book and listened to all 34 (or more... I'm not certain) hours of it numerous times. It was a wonderful companion while in hospital and I treasure my copy.Why then did I mark it down to four stars? I simply didn't like the ending.

Four page footnotes, a few black and white illustrations, small font, and an incredible number of pages. However, I gave this book five stars for a reason. If you're looking for a light read, it might not be what you need, but light-hearted is a better word. This is a fantasy novel of a different kind. It is not for children, but it is not too stale for any age as long as they can sit down to read it. The characters are amusing and likable (or easy to dislike, if that is what they are intended for), and the humor is subtle, ironic and witty. I don't bring myself to read on a non-stop basis, and I certainly don't read books of this volume, but I was intrigued in the first chapters, so I pressed on. It was worth it. The first few chapters are a bit slow, I suppose, but the writing style carries you through.Also, I suggest you read the footnotes.

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrellby Susanna Clarke is a fictional book about magicians set in 1800s England.English magicians, once world renowned, are stagnant in the 1800s and have lost their ability to perform magic. However, the reclusive Mr. Norrell of Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire has been collecting old and forgotten English magic books.Raising a woman from the dead, Mr. Norrell soon finds himself at the service of the government fighting the French. Everything turns on its head when the handsome and charming Jonathan Strange, a rival magician, appears. Strange makes a name for himself during a campaign with Lord Wellington. However it is soon obvious that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell's idea of what exactly \\"magic\\" is or ought to be are very different.I usually don't read books about magic, but when Neil Gaiman, one of my favorite authors, recommended Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke, which was on sale for the day, I grabbed it up immediately.The novel surprised me. It was excellent, funny and imaginative yet not crossing into the land of unpronounceable names, fantastic creatures and geography so convoluted my simple mind cannot process it.As in any interesting book, this one also has layers which allow the reader to think about and explore. Jealousy, friendship, envy, love, arrogance and, of course, redemption are all touched upon by this most interesting book.The way Ms. Clarke has recreated England was, to me, one of the highlights of the book. In a style reminiscent of Mr. Gaiman she describes, with wit and clarity, seedy parlors, streets, buildings and houses both of rich and poor. The characterization of people within the story is brilliant, often funny and able to create an image.\\"The walls of the parlour were ornamented with cheap engravings -- portraits of famous criminals of the last century who had all been hanged and portraits of the King's dissolute sons who had not been hanged yet.\\"\\"[N]ot been hanged yet\\" - don't you love that?The story is told by an anonymous narrator who is writing a history book about Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, complete with footnotes and annotations. The footnotes were some of my favorite parts of the book even though they add very little to the story, however they bring the book to a whole new level and add several dimensions to it. Full of historical references, stories and brief characterizations these footnotes are a delight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am not going to say much more since am doing it on the kindle. (very slow at it) but that should tell you something."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What a fun fantasy. I thoroughly enjoyed Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Clarke continues her world of faires and magic in her other stories as if in the same setting, literally, as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Strange is an alternate history novel set in 19th-century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars. It has a fascinating premise: that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. The novel explores the nature of \\"Englishness\\" and the boundary between reason and madness. It has been alternately described as a fantasy novel, and a historical novel.Clarke spent more than ten years writing the novel which draws on various English Romantic literary traditions, part Jane Austen, part Charles Dickens, part Gothic. And she infuses the entire narrative with a very droll, English dry wit which as page 100 becomes page 200, then 300, the 400, then 500 ... tends to wear out its welcome.I REALLY wanted to like this book, but found myself dreading to keep reading. NOTHING HAPPENS! The first 300 pages of the novel could have easily been discarded since those pages did absolutely nothing to advance the plot. The story doesn't just dawdle, it creaks like a stone statue with rheumatism. And Rule #1 is: Be entertaining.The fact that the book has been almost universally lauded says more about those reviewers bias than the quality of this book. Group think is not always a good thing. Some reviewers rhapsodize about the rich language and clever literary homages, while others call it daring and imaginative. They forgot to mention it was BORING!Not Recommended, unless you're one of the university-centric snobs who worship at the altar of 19th century English fiction, still buying into the canard that it is infinitely superior than modern fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is the magical creation of Susanna Clarke. It is the story of the return of magic to England some 200 years ago. It takes place in a time when magic was no longer practiced in England, but still studied by many. Mr. Norrell, a practical magician, decides that he shall return magic to England, but has no idea how out of control a little magic can get when he takes on a task that proves to be bigger than him.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is by no means a page turner, at least not until the last 200 or so pages. The Washington Post describes it by saying that \\"Many books are to be read, some are to be studied, and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks.\\" This is one that applies to all of the above categories. However, what keeps the reader reading is a interesting, constantly evolving story line and a sense of magic in Susanna Clarke's words. Her writing is exquisite and is captivating in itself.As I first started this book, I was a little disappointed. I thought that the story was too slow and that it wasn't driving enough. The book is broken up into three parts. The first two parts of the book are spent setting up the tale, introducing us to the many delightful if not woeful characters, and setting a magical tone. When part three of the book kicks in, it turns into a page turner. When I got to part three, I appreciated the time she took in parts one and two setting the tale up. In part three of this book, you can literally feel the magic coming off of the pages. It's wonderful!As you read the pages of this book, you feel like you are in fact reading history. The book is complete with very informative footnotes, and I found myself often forgetting that this was a work of fiction. She even incorporates Lord Byron into the book, a wonderful surprise. While he doesn't play a main character, he shows how capable Clarke is of spinning a convincing tale.This book is like reading a cross between Jane Austen and Neil Gaiman. Certainly a book of fantasy, yet so realistic at the same time...an oxymoron if you will, and I mean that in the best way possible. Susanna Clarke won the Hugo award for this novel in 2005 and I can think of no one more deserving. Quite impressive for her first novel. Truly a fascinating read. I can't wait to start digging into my signed, first edition copy of The Ladies of Grace Aldieu, Clarke's second publication, a collection of short stories that is beautifully illustrated."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It took me a very long time to read this book. I would've stopped reading it a while ago, but I wanted to see what all the hype was. Is it this chapter? No. Maybe it will be in the next one. Nope. The last 1/8 of the book held some dramatic tension I guess, but when Strange and Norrell meet again, they become friends. No magic fight. No human fight. No argument. 750 pages of building of the differences in views and opinions of these two magicians and at the end when you think there will be some kind of resolution to all of the long, long, long build up there is nothing. I felt drained after finishing this book, wishing I had never started it. So if you're looking for a very heavy paperweight, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Magick is a topic close to my heart and several of my friends and I discussed this book. It still gets mentioned often. To do magick or to study it as an arcance topic - that's the question here. I adore great big fat books. I like to live in their worlds for awhile. And I will put this book up with the best being currently written. As good as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy; and maybe a bit better. Please Susanna Clarke write more and write fast. I'm a geezer and don't want to miss out on your vision."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Strange & Norrell is a compulsive read, and there are many fine things about it - notably the incredibly extensive back-history which Clarke creates (mostly through footnotes) to describe the history of magic in England. It is also an often funny book - i.e. when Strange tells his wife and brother-in-law that he has decided to become a magician because he met a man under a hedge who told him that he should.BUT - the book eventually disappointed me. There is not really any plot in the book. The crumbs of a plot are there, and the potential for a powerful and climatic battle between Strange & Norrell vs. an evil faerie is present, and is much anticipated, but this battle never happens, nor does any real climax occur. A climax is kind of side-stepped and though \\"good\\" more or less wins, this does not happen in a very satisfying way.Would I recommend the book? Yes, I would, if you're willing to be lost in a highly intriguing historical / fantasy novel for a few weeks, and don't anticipate being bothered by the lack of a plot or a climax."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a wonderful, wonderful novel. It is written in an older tone, and probably isn't for everyone, but this streaks above anything published recently in the genre. Closer to the Gormenghast Series than Tolkien, and even better than Peake's masterpiece in my opinion (more likeable characters for a start).A must buy, though I advise reading a couple of pages first to see if you like the older writing style (in Australia it isn't wrapped in plastic)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book has entranced me within the first 100 pages! I have no idea why people would complain about this book. The writing style is excellent, the footnotes add great commentary to the story and character development is detailed when it should be without going overboard. No, it's not Harry Potter, and thats a good thing too!One book you shouldn't miss if you enjoy the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have a Ph.D. in English Literature, and have spent the greater portion of my life reading novels and writing about them. I enjoy a good fantasy novel, and bought into the \\"buzz\\" surrouding JS.Luckily, I grabbed a copy from the library, and didn't purchase it.It boils down to this:1) JS fails as a standard pot-boiler fantasy/adventure novel. That's fine. So does, for example, Mervyn Peake's \\"Ghormenghast.\\" It's not necessary for every novel to grip you by the lapels and drag you on a wild ride.2) JS fails as a literary work of art. That's ok, so do lots of fun and interesting novels. So does the \\"Harry Potter\\" series.3) JS fails as a historical novel. The \\"period\\" evoked is done so in an amateurish way; in some ways, it's not even up to Regency romance novel standards. But that's ok, not every book manages this trick very well.4) JS fails regards structure: it's not just a shaggy dog, it's a dog that's never been within 10 miles of a scissor. But that's ok, sometimes lack of structure opens up interesting narrative possibilities.5) JS fails to be interesting stylistically. The prose is very straightward and dull. This is pretty bad, but can be overlooked.6) JS isn't that funny. Very unfunny, actually. This is a serious strike against it.It's ok if a novel lacks 1 or 2 of the above. 3 or 4 is not so great. Sadly, JS lacks all 6.To sum, JS simply fails to qualify as a good or interesting or even mildly gripping novel.Take, for example, the very few and awkward uses of \\"archaic\\" words sprinlked through the text. Or old spellings, such as \\"surprise\\" rendered \\"surprize\\". That's fine, in moderation, or when done well. But honestly, Susanna Clark uses the word \\"surprize\\" on almost every page. I'm not kidding you. Go back and read the first 100 pages of the novel. Count the number of \\"surprizes\\" that stick up and poke you in the eye. It's an astonishingly amateurish display.I'm amazed that anyone's charmed by the \\"footnote\\" ploy. It's a very old trick at this point (entire novels have been written consisting of nothing more than a footnote in a footnote in a footnote, etc. Refer also to Nabokov's 'Pale Fire' for another take on it.) I found the footnotes:1) Not interesting or funny enough to warrant their inclusion,2) Not adding to the plot, mystery, sense of wonder, etc. of the overall novel.3) Irritating after a while.For those people comparing Susanna Clarke to any of the great writers of old, Austin or Eliot or whomever -- it's balderdash. Dickens infuses more life into a character in one page than Clarke manages in 700. There are more out-loud laughs in a paragraph of Austin than a chapter by Clarke. There is no emotional connection betwen the characters, between the reader and the characters -- nothing. It's empty.Once the loud buzz dies down, I think people will end up shoving this book off the nightstand and into a box, soon to be shuffled off to the attic or garage.I'm sorry to put it in these terms. I came to the novel with great hopes and expectations and plenty of good will. I now regret the time I've wasted reading it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's debut novel begins promisingly, but by about page 500 the book is starting to bog down beneath its own weight. The footnotes have by now worn on the reader's patience (they're either needlessly discursive or else pointless in their obviousness), and the dead-end plot lines are mounting (cf. the backstory of Jeremy and Strange's father, the old lady with the cats, and whatever happened to Lady Pole and Sir Walter?) After nearly 800 pages, one would think that Clarke could reward her readers (who have by now forgiven her meanderings and heavyhandedness) with some resolution. No. There is no resolution and the ending is far too 'cinematic' (and I mean that in the worst way possible). The possibility of a regrettable sequel is left wide open (though I won't bother reading it)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To all my fellow adult Harry Potter lovers and those who have enjoyed science fiction and fantasy for many years - I, like you, was all set to love this book. I had read a review of it prior to its release, and an interview with the author. I snapped it up the first time I was in the book store and settled down to read it. I am not at all daunted by the 800 page length, either. However, sad to say, folks, that I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as I thought I would. I never liked the Mr. Norrell character - there was nothing sympathetic about him for me to care about, so the first 100 pages or more, which were all about him, were very slow for me. I enjoyed the Jonathan Strange character quite a bit more, but his adventures were interspersed with frustrating moments with Mr. Norell. I usually read every single word of a book, but I found myself skipping paragraphs after about page 400 or so. The magic in the book was fairly enjoyable, but somehow, as much as the author tried to make the magic real, it just didn't connect for me the way other books about magic have for me. Sorry, folks, this one missed its mark as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What this book lacks in imagination and verve, it tries to make up for with footnotes and breathless, \\"Victorian\\" sounding prose.It doesn't work.Several of the characters spend a lot of time under some form of enchantment, but the enchantment itself is rather dull, and mainly consists of the characters being forced to dance when they really don't feel like dancing. This \\"enchantment,\\" and that term merits scare quotes, leaves the charaters listless in their daily lives. They are just sort of tired and bored, which is likely how you will feel when you are reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If either of these writers are among your favorites, read this book. If both are, you will recognize this as the first candidate for the greatest fantasy novel of the 21st Century.What an act of courage to write a 1000-page first novel, investing a lifetime's energy without knowing if it will be rewarded.It was rewarded. This is a masterpiece. If she never writes again, her place in literature is assured. But I surely hope she does."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was caught up in the world of this wonderful book, and enjoyed the sojourn immensely.

After reading the book I do not see the comparison except that both authors are excellent and write about magic. I really enjoyed reading this book. The language is beautiful and the characters are fun and humourously believable.The plot is a little slow the first 100 pages or so but stay with it and you will be rewarded with a fun, twisting plot that keeps you guessing. Also the footnotes make the book!!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am really suspicious of professional reviewers now. This thing received so many absolutely glowing reviews I was stunned how dull this 3 pound tomb was. Take for example Neil Gaiman's review on the dust jacket that claimed the book was the best piece of fantasy fiction in the last 70 years. Normally I recoil when I see something proclaimed as the best in the world, you know like that pizza place down the street (every towns got one) that has 'best pizza in the city' or whatever. It never is, in fact it's usually horrible. And this book is no exception to the rule. To be honest, I've had better luck finding good books through the Amazon review system as there is usually a good mix of good and bad. I read through both until I stumble across someone that sounds reasonable and with a pov like mine, then I'll take their advice. With this book though, I relied on professionals. They suck.I will preface my critique by saying that I read fiction to be entertained, stimulated, and engaged. I do not read fiction for any other reason. As such, I don't read books like Canterbury Tales or Ulysses as I'm pretty sure it would be too much like work. Don't get me wrong, I like challenging (some would say boring) works, but I can only justify spending that kind of effort on nonfiction works. Fiction for me is supposed to be entertaining.So back to this work...First it's length is wholly unjustified. It is almost 800 pages and it could easily have been reduced to 1/8 that size without losing anything. Apparently she modeled he style on people like Dickens and Austen. Well, I don't know about Austen, but Dickens got paid by the word, so his works are incredibly padded and is a bad role model for authors, imo. Interminable descriptions of things that have little to no bearing on the story, boring characters that serve no purpose, rambling subplots, etc etc are all hallmarks of the $/word author, and that's how Clarke writes.The whole book is pleasant and genteel. Again, this probably comes down to some-kind of attempt at imitation of some 19th century writers. But from the 19th century books I've read, the authors could still produce tension and emotion, Clarke does not. Everything that happens in the book is written in such a way as to imbue it with as much impact as easy listening radio. Oh, somebody got shot? Pip pip, tally ho, thats ok. Another aspect of this style is the complete absence of tension or suspense. The plot has gone through some-kind of niceness filter that makes it as much fun as listening to the queen.Next up: the characters. The characters in this book are stiff 2 dimensionally non-developing caricatures of people. There is nothing to like or identify with any of them. I didn't want to spend one more second with any of them by the time the book ended. And their motivations are almost always inexplicable. It's not only the crazy ones that make no sense.Finally, the ending. First there is a giant plot hole involving the rules of magic as they operate in Clarke's world, and the big curse Thistlehead places on a couple of people. I wont say anymore in case I spoil things. But that aside, this is one of those books that doesn't satisfy. The ending is like the rest of the book, pointless, dull, and unsatisfying.So anyway, if you like hugely overwritten books with stiff cardboard characters with zero development and boring suspense-less plots but with really good PR, this is your book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This review refers to the mass market paperback edition. Unless less you have a really good reading light and very good eyesight, please look at another edition. Didn't buy from Amazon, so will have to take back to the store and see if I can exchange.

I usually do not enjoy fantasy and find that I become bored when reading it. For example, I have not even attempted the Harry Potter books because I feared I would not enjoy them.I picked up this book because of the wonderful reviews, the size (I LOVE long books), and the author's writing style.Susanna Clarke has a beautiful gift for writing. She is obviously very educated (a ton of research went into this book)and has wonderful descriptive abilities. She can also be quite humorous.Unfortunately, the book did not move quickly enough to maintain my interest. I kept putting it down and reaching for something else and kept forcing myself to go back to it. In the end I gave up.Again the author seems quite talented so it may just be that the subject matter was not a good match"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Disclaimer: I haven't finished the book, so take the following with a grain of salt, please -- even I do -- but I am far past the usual fifty pages I give a novel before I put it down. I'm reading out of a sense of obligation.Quite honestly, I find this book so dull. Over a hundred pages into the thing and I still don't feel any connection to the characters or even to the storyline; Mr. Norrell is regrettably like Niles on \\"Frasier\\" without the exaggerated humor and the situations are so plodding that even when the \\"magic\\" happens (e.g., speaking statues, ghost ships), it's not worth the wait.I don't mind waiting in general and I have more than the average person's appreciation of a story slowly told; I'm reading Austen's _Emma_ and enjoying the liveliness and characterization so much more and I'm the only person I know who ever bothered tackling the unabridged version of Richardson's _Clarissa_, but this story has baffled me. It's amazing how someone can take what could potentially be a wonderful idea and sap all the interest out of it by weighing it down with meaningless pedantry (the footnotes and \\"scholarship\\" -- I find them mildly annoying in real books about real subjects and even more so when they're about a fictional scholarly discipline that never existed).Honestly, I wish I liked this book, and by all rights, I should. I got it as a gift and knowing me, I can see why the person thought I'd really enjoy it. Anyone want it? You pay postage. ;-)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Many of the reviews of this book have noted how faithfully it recreates the literary ambiance of Regency or early Victorian novels. As far as I am concerned, that is the besetting flaw of this book--it is endlessly discursive. I freely admit that books of this nature were required reading for university English literature coourses, and being forced to read them may have poisoned my view of ALL novels in the genre, whether originals or, as here, deliberate copies. Nevertheless, I must say that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" reminds me of nothing so much as a cross between \\"The Hobbit\\" and either \\"Silas Marner\\" or one of Anthony Trollope's more lugubrious novels."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As I was getting to the reviews here I noticed that the editorial review above used the expression \\"Sophisticated, witty...\\".Sophisticated and witty are two things that this book definitely isn't.

In the sense of \\"funny\\" used when talking about daytime TV, maybe it is.Perhaps the book is an outstanding example of the Fantasy genre, I would't know.

I could have watched reality TV that sparked more interest and pathos.At that point my friend calls, and says, \\"Oh, it picks up at the 300 page mark.\\"Right. I shouldn't have to trudge though 300 pages for a book to get entertaining. The editor of this novel should have been fired."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"No doubt this review will be bracketed by a pair of laudatory reviews. Since you can scroll down to another review for the plot I will just say the following;Ms. Clarke's writing style IS reminiscent of Dickens. Does anyone else remember that Dickens stretched his stuff out, as much as he could get away with, because he was paid by the word? Also while working your way through Dickens you were supposed to be absorbing some sort of moral lesson, something which is conspicuously absent from this novel.As for comparisons to Jane Austen, Austen's works are actually funny (the reader actually enjoys all that dialog in Emma). Ms. Clarke's work is occasionaly mildly amusing (at best, sometimes, in the footnotes, maybe).There is no concrete \\"good guy\\" in this novel which makes it difficult to care about the characters in the novel, except those stolen by John Uskland (and you hardly ever see those people).Also people talk about the \\"Victorian\\" feel of this novel, but something is really missing here. To the Victorians religion and the Church were a natural part of life. However in this novel the Church (of England in this case) is barely noticeable. For example, in Jane Austen's writings clergymen are always popping up. Admittedly if magic existed and the Church were powerless against it, the Church would cease to exist, but in those circumstances Mr. Norrell would have had no York Cathedral to work wonders in.For Regency and Victorian fiction you would do far better to read Georgette Heyer's books (she has written many period romances) or Connie Willis' \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog.\\"This book is too hard to follow and too hard to get interested in."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't know why people here say they hated the footnotes as much as they did.

What I do mind is a book that is so tediously slow and disjointed and lacking in much of a plot, let alone a plot that has any internal consistency or drive to it, that you have to force yourself to read a bit more in the hopes that it is going to get better, a task that becomes harder and harder as you get hundreds of pages into the chore only to find yourself caring less and less about the characters or what happens next. While it may be true that Susanna Clarke has an interesting voice and the premise has promise, what is set forth is more like a series of notes of potentially interesting people and scenes that simply do not hang together. Plot elements are introduced only to languish for scores of pages at a time and reintroduced in ways that make no sense within the confines of the story line. Nothing is credible in terms of motivation or reaction, so you just force yourself to slog along noticing the cute, pretty words here and there and realizing that an editor or a writers group or someone might have suggested that the multitude of potentially interesting things in the book might make a good story with some editing and some semblance of pace and some discipline in the writing. . .but then you realize you just don't care.

It doesn't get much better.But then the story died off for a while in lieu of miles and miles of information to shove into my brain.It didn't really pick up again until Johnathan began visiting the faerie world and opened a pathway for the mischeivious elf that steals souls away. That's how I interpreted it, at least. It made things interesting.The problem was that after all that, there was no real plot to the book.

Its still an England based book, but its somewhat more advanced, in the sense that the magicians are older. All in all it was a good book. Strange wasn't presented until the second part of the book and I guess since his name is in the title I was expecting him to be presented sooner - so it kind of threw me off gaurd. The suspense towards the middle of the book was exciting, and I liked it alot because I wasn't able to guess the outcome. I hate it when you already (pretty much) know what's going to happen in a book. Anyways, it was a good book, I would highly recommend it (especially if you liked the Harry Potter books).

I found that I couldn't place it in any genre other than just fiction, because it is not your ordinary novel. The ending ties up all sorts of loose ends, in a way. It does leave an opening for a seqel, which I think would be interesting, but I don't think any sequel could match the majesty of this novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This fantasy novel had some good moments including some charming characters and witty prose. The first fifty pages had me enthralled and excited to snuggle down with an engaging read. The concept of reviving the magical arts in England could have been quite enchanting. However, it soon became a meandering odyssey without momentum making it an actual chore to read. It is unnecessarily long-winded and never really achieves anything. The numerous footnotes were annoying and further served to destroy the momentum. If it is important put it in the story. But I don't think this author really knew what was important to the story and just added everything they thought of. A great disappointment."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A society of magicians meets each month in 1806, in York, England. They can't actually work magic, but they study the history of the practice. When newcomer John Segundus joins the group, he asks a nave yet pertinent question: Why is magic no longer practiced in England? The query throws the club into an uproar. Although they don't actually know the answer, the irate members respond defensively, asking Segundus why magicians must practice magic when it is their duty to study it.One magician, Honeyfoot, sides with Segundus. The two seek out and visit a magician named Norrell, who is a stranger to the group. Visiting Norrell is a mysterious experience full of happenings the two men can't explain to the York group. But one message strikes home: Mr. Norrell can actually PRACTICE magic.The group challenges Mr. Norrell, who strikes a bargain with them. He will prove he can practice magic or never again call himself a magician. But in return, they must do the same. All the magicians but Segundus sign the agreement. When Mr. Norrell (from the comfort of his own home) causes all the cathedral statues to come alive, he and Segundus become the only magicians left in Yorkshire.Mr. Norrell moves to London in his quest to bring magic back to England. Segundus has written a letter to the London newspapers describing Mr. Norrell's amazing feat of magic. London society welcomes Mr. Norrell, but when he offers his assistance in the war efforts with France, he is rebuffed and told that magic is not respectable. That opinion is reversed, however, when Mr. Norrell raises a government official's fianc&eacute;e from the dead. The British ministers immediately begin to argue over which of Britain's dead leaders Mr. Norrell should resurrect...until Mr. Norrell mentions the phrase \\"condition of the body.\\" Oh, dear. On to Plan B!Meanwhile, a young man named Jonathan Strange meets a street sorcerer who prophesies that Strange will be one of the two great magicians of England. On a whim (and mostly to impress the woman he hopes to marry), he announces his intention to study magic. Easygoing Strange becomes persnickety Norrell's pupil. An evil force is about. Norrell bargains with it, but it is Strange whose personal life is most affected.When Strange joins the troops on the battlefield to lend a magical hand, the commanding officer, Lord Wellington, asks hopefully, \\"Can a magician kill a man by magic?\\" Strange replies, \\"I suppose a magician might...but a gentleman never could.\\" Yet he assists the war effort in many sometimes droll and sometimes nightmarish ways.Fans of Dickens and Austen will dive headfirst into this book, but I must confess that I found the beginning a long, hard slog. It is a hefty, dense and heavily footnoted text, and I initially found the authorial voice to be intrusive and annoying. However, somewhere before the 100-page mark, I fell happily in love with the story and greedily devoured the remainder. (Readers who stumble in the early chapters should consider forging ahead; I guarantee it's worth the effort.)This is an amazingly detailed, ornate tapestry of a saga with shimmering moments of wry humor, threaded through with true tragedy. It is fantasy and historical fiction realistically combined and worth pondering, and sure to become a classic. I admitted that it was a slow read for me at the very beginning; after the middle, I dawdled for a different reason. I simply could not bear to see the end of the story approaching. There is a magician alive and well in England today --- Susanna Clarke, author of JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL. Long may she continue to enchant her readers!--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I agree with some of the other comments - this one REALLY needed editing. I have to say, when it's good, it's really, really good, but there were several times I almost gave up, it was so dull and plodding (the Venice part - Oh, my God, I was almost asleep during it!). I actually did stop reading it for a while, but I set myself a quest this year - 52 books read in a year, and I vowed to finish this one as one of the 52. So, I succeeded, but sometimes it was such a struggle! However, when Clarke is \\"on\\" she is very gifted and I very much enjoyed parts of the book. I found her writing style a little silly sometimes; other times it didn't bother me so much. I'd call this a cross between Harry Potter and Dickens, with the strengths and weaknesses of both. I've read all the Potter books and find them very enjoyable, and I've always loved Dickens, so I figured I'd like this book. Can't win them all, but like I said, it does have moments if you hang in there and maybe skim some of it. It's not for everyone, but then most imaginative books aren't. I definitely give Clarke points for originality, though, and look forward to seeing other work from her."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Wonderful character development and atmosphere. Every page is a literary feast. Best book to come out in the last few years."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"**POSSIBLE SLIGHT SPOILER**\\"If in the first act you have hung a pistol [shotgun] on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.\\" A.P. ChekhovJS & Mr. N. kept me going through many long, foggy commutes--I listened to it as an unabridged audiobook when it first came out, and really didn't mind the length, but I still remember feeling bereft at the ending, and not because I was sorry that it ended. The writing is lovely, lyrical and can be quite humorous, the world-building intriguing, the characters diverse and Dickensian, but I'm sorry to say that there are too many plot-holes big enough to sail a man 'o war through. Seemingly important characters are introduced, then never seen again, really important characters are abandoned to their unfortunate fates without explanation, and much wandering and wondering go on and on and on and in the end it comes down to a sort of magical Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.Because of the premise, and the beautiful writing, I truly believe that this could have been a great and classic novel, beloved for generations, if only Ms. Clarke had understood the simple rules of cause and effect, that foreshadowing must be followed through (see Chekhov's shotgun quote) there must be resolution for important relationships and events and key characters need full-bodied development. Otherwise it seems to be just an exercise in authorial self-amusement, luring and ultimately cheating the reader, no matter how good the writing.Obviously, the premise and writing are rich enough to have satisfied many readers, as evidenced by the many, many reviews, but at the end of the day, I felt as if I had been the victim of a literary bait and switch. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a big book, asking for a long commitment of time and a mental investment. It seems only fair to warn unwary readers of what they might be getting into."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed the voice of the book through the first 60 pages, and was further tantalized by a story set in a vibrant and Sherlockian era, Ms. Clarke suddenly took a bizarre turn and started in about some minor character's impulse to help Mr. Norrell redecorate his house. Immediately following that debacle were long, drawn-out bits of exposition (disguised as dialog) that did absolutely zip to further what started as a promising plot. The author tripped and staggered into things that seemed to have nothing to do with what had been presented up front. A great conflict is established in about the first 30 pages or so, a conflict that could have staggering ramifications, but nothing of substantive story value materialized to infuse the narrative and make me want to keep reading.The other thing I found distracting and annoying were all of the footnotes inserted throughout the text. This wasn't supposed to be a textbook, it was supposed to be a fantasy novel. I didn't feel like \\"studying\\" all of the back history. While I think this was done in a vain attempt to be \\"artsy\\" I blame the editors for not excising such nonsense out of the novel--or at least insisting it end up in the back of the book (or better yet, the author's website) to be referenced at the reader's leisure. And I feel while the prose was fresh and quite readable, the author clearly didn't stop to ask in the first 100 pages or so whether she really had a story worth asking readers to journey with her for 1000 pages. This comes at no great surprise since directionless bloat seems to be the norm in the large majority of this generation's fantasy works.Great potential but poorly executed such that I could not finish it, and I cannot in good conscience give more than 1 star to any book I couldn't finish."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first 100 or so pages were excellent. After that, it was tedious at best. Much time is devoted to major charachters like Mr. Segundus, who then tend to vanish entirely for several hundred pages.The book could have used a brutal editor to cut it down to a fraction of its current size, and it would have been far more readable. Its a pity, because the core of a really fantastic saga is clearly there. But it gets buried under piles of mush."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke is a first rate wordsmith and social satirist, and in this book creates a lavishly textured alternative vision of 19th century England - a place where magic is very much real and alive. The highlight of this novel for me was the witty dialogue and the way the characters were presented as infinitely fallible, yet somehow likeable at the same time. I found myself laughing out loud often, and was taken in by the wintry landscapes and somber mood against which the satirical writing is juxtaposed.Having said that, I must say I did find the novel to be rather slow moving, and found myself unable to sustain reading sessions for long periods of time. I think this is partly because the very thing that makes the characters funny and enjoyable, their quirky shallowness, eventually suffuses the entire novel with a sense of shallowness. It's as if one can't enter the world of any particular character and share in their sadness or passions. The characters inhabit a world in which very bad things happen yet are stoically accepted - it's as if the characters themselves are magical apparitions devoid of real human emotions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a doorstopper of a book, coming in at over 780 pages and weighing several pounds! It takes quite an effort to hold it up or prop it up to read, but the effort is well worth it. The first time author has presented an early 19th century England that had once been divided north and south into two different kingdoms, the northern half ruled by the Raven King, a human/fairy magician. We are introduced to two magicians whose task it becomes to restore magic to England, since the magic has basically been forgotten. There are amusing side trips into Wellington's Peninsula campaign, and a new view of how the Allies won the battle of Waterloo. This is also a book that covers, in a light-hearted way, the social classes and the differences between them. It's somewhat of a comedy of manners in part, and also a mystery and a search for something elusive. Despite the length and the size of the book, reading it from cover to cover was not a chore, because the author keeps the reader continually interested in finding out what was going to happen next. This is a very good book, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The positive points of this novel have been well described in previous reviews. It is well conceived and well executed, representing a different and compelling picture of magic that I recognized from my childhood fantasies and fairy tales. It's beautifully descriptive, and I didn't mind the slow-developing pace, because the path is pleasant enough, and it's always clear that it is actually going somewhere.The reason I am only giving it 3 stars, however, is because after finishing I felt frustrated and disappointed by the lack of substantive human connections (\\"connexions\\") in its relationships. Each of the characters is well-realized and distinct, but they seem to operate in separate spheres of motivation and emotion. I mean, they interact, but there is a definite lack of emotional drama in the interaction. I know this is part of the novel's style (a certain aristocratic detachment), but I felt the lack of inter-human emotion, especially in the resolution of the book's climax, to be totally false. Maybe I'm a simpleton to require \\"heart\\" when there's so much other great stuff going on, but the few glimpses we get of Norrell's emotional connection to Strange and the friendship between Lady Pole and Arabella Strange were for me too-brief respites from the solitary English moor that is the emotional landscape of this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To those who continue to write that the book is \\"boring\\"...well, you're not listening to us.Do *not* read this book unless you love the Brontes, Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackery, etc.Do *not* read this book merely because you love fantasy.Read this because you love English literature. It is beautifully written with absolutely wonderful characterization, and I expect it to win many awards. I could quibble about a few minor issues, but any flaws are more than made up for by the excellent writing and realistic world.You need patience to read this, and you need a deep love of reading.

It's actually better! Think Jane Austen on magic and you've pretty much got it. I also found it strange that someone said they couldn't relate to the characters--that they were cold. Not only did the characters seem real, but so did the world that Ms.Clarke created for them. I'd give this book three thumbs up (magic, you know--I can always conjure up another thumb if needed.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I saw that the hype has lasted and got this book for my kindle without previewing it. The idea is great- if I were at a party and some one described it to me I would say \\"This has to be a book! Write this book please!\\" Unfortunately, the execution is terrible. I've since seen that it has been called Dickensian- as if his books were slow paced slogs filled with unfunny jokes and boring, clueless, passive characters. What I think is going on here is that the writer believes she is being Austenian- that her feeble attempts at wit and breaking the fourth wall are like Jane Austen's addresses to her reader. They are not. I read about 20 pages, saw which was the wind was blowing (or not blowing, nothing much happens) and decided to skim the book until the plot kicked in because it is by a first time author. I skimmed quite a bit- the plot does NOT kick in. I never thought a book with a fantasy/ magical premise could be so incredibly boring. How do you make reading about magic as dull as reading about loading a dishwasher? I almost wonder if the premise of this book came from a different mind than the one who wrote it up- the writing is so pretentious, so cautious, so ponderous, SO BAD. Spare yourself and read a Diana Wynne Jones book instead. Any DWJ book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I only read about half of this book which still came out to 400 pages. The story drags along worse than any other book I have read. I was confused by all the praise. Perhaps the readers who liked it are more history rather than fantasy readers. It dragged along and even when magic did occur it was described in such a mater of fact manner that it had no impact. The Characters really had no major redeeming characters and after one of the characters had a loved one die clearly by magic they did nothing about it.The part of the book that had so much to work with regarding the Napoleonic Wars could have been so exciting but was another event to be ticked off in the chapters.If you are used to more fast paced or even remotely exciting fiction DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. If you like stories that are well researched alternative histories where the characters are secondary to the setting you might like this book.

The story is a bit of Harry Potter for grownups, about two Englishmen in the early 19th century, learned in magic and acting on the world-stage of London and the Napoleonic European continent. The other venue is the land of faerie, with enchantments not at all charming, and with many evocations of England's great magician-king of long ago, John Uskglass. The work is long (and perhaps would be a bit tiresome to read), but holds up well as a tale beguilingly told, over many sessions, by the magnificant reader, Simon Prebble."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Ah, what a delightful doorstop of a book. It's over 1,000 pages, and still I didn't want the story to end. And speaking of endings, Susanna Clarke pulls off a consummate ending to a story into which she threaded numerous strands. She wraps them up just right, in a way I didn't foresee but which, to my hindsight, is perfect.But enough about the ending -- no spoilers in this review, I promise!The story takes place in Regency England and revolves around two English magicians, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, and their activities during and immediately following the Napoleonic Wars. At the beginning of the story, magic has become, in people's minds, a theoretical construct only, and a dusty group of theoretical magicians meet periodically in Northern England to discuss it. Perish the thought that anybody actually practice magic. That would be downright ungentlemanly.But a new member of the society has other ideas, and pretty soon, he discovers that there remains one practicing magician in England: Mr. Norrell. Though Mr. Norrell practices magic instead of only talking about it, he's conservative in what kind of magic he'll practice -- nothing too wild or woolly -- and he jealously guards his knowledge until a talented upstart, Jonathan Strange, becomes his pupil. And even then, though he admires Strange's talent and enjoys Strange's friendship, Mr. Norrell continues to withhold significant areas of magical knowledge from him, telling himself Strange doesn't need to practice those kinds of magic, nor does anyone.Mr. Norrell breaks with his conservatism once, however, and performs a type of fairy magic to raise from the dead the wife of Walter Pole, a prominent politician, to curry Pole's favor. Then the trouble starts: a malicious fairy, \\"the gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\" who is never named, places under enchantment not only Lady Pole but also Walter Pole's head servant, Stephen Black, and ultimately Jonathan Strange's wife, Arabella, as well.And enchantment by the gentleman with the thistle-down hair, by the way, is not fun. It starts out somewhat that way for the adventurous spirit, but it becomes a sort of death-in-life for the enchanted. The more time spent in faerie the darker and more dismal and tedious grows the stay. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair is a fairy king but he's a neglectful one, and his brugh, which he disguises as a run-down castle, is surrounded by the bones of the people he has killed for sport over the ages.Mr. Norrell's goal has been to \\"return magic to England\\", though paradoxically he wants to control most of the knowledge and practice himself, and he also wants to keep under wraps, as much as he can, the magic performed and inspired by John Uskglass, a powerful magician-King from centuries past whose knowledge has largely been lost. When the brave and resolute Strange discovers some of the Raven King's magic and begins performing it himself, Mr. Norrell strongly disapproves, creating a rift between England's only two practicing magicians.Strange and Norrell hold it together long enough to help Wellington defeat Napoleon, but compared to the gentleman with the thistle-down hair, Napoleon was a piker. Can they put aside their differences to defeat the malicious fairy?To say this book is magical would be gross understatement. It's an enthralling combination of mind-blowing fantasy and tongue-in-cheek fun-poking at the manners of the day. Delightful, dry humor is woven throughout, and its sheer imaginative power rivals the works of Tolkien."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is not too long, even with it's 800 some pages: in fact it just might be the total opposite of that general idea. For people looking for an instantaneous plot with immediate storytelling, then this is not for you. This book is purely about reading and enjoying it without any rush; it's not about getting to the end as fast as possible. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell took me weeks to finish, coming from someone who read the largest Harry Potter book in a day. But to read this book is to savor it without worrying about how many pages have been read so far, or how far from the ending you are.The footnotes were more than enjoyable, as each one was needed, not to further the plot, but to enhance and enrich the overall setting and to make the time era and world much more believable. What Susanna Clarke did was write the history of this alternate England and give it to us in her footnotes. The short folk tales, which she included in addition to the text, were like little gems that were found in such a labyrinth. Placing all those extra bits and pieces of information directly into the text would have been nothing more than a long, boring info-dump that we, as the reader, would have to sludge through. Instead, every time a little footnote appeared, I would jump on it with vigor.The characters were beautifully crafted as well as a truly real setting. Each person was a dear friend before the story had its end. And even when I finally reached the end, I did not want to finish the story, but wanted it to extend beyond those few 800 pages, for even with that length, the story was not long enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Everyone else has said all that can be said. Suffice to say this is a really thumping good read. Yes, it's oh so long. There are times you're going to want to skip ahead. Yes, it is very weird at times. But overall it's extremely COOL. I read it a year ago and it stays with me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In spite of the other reviewers that didn't like this book, I enjoyed it a lot. It COULD have been better with some editing, (I wonder how much was edited out!)but all in all, it was well-written, and a great plot. It's hard to find well-written books. I would recommend this book for patient readers who enjoy a well-crafted book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As far as first novels goes, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is an amazing work. Clarke tells a story of alternate history and English magic during the Napoleonic wars.The book itself took ten years to write, and the craftsmanship shows through.Set during the reign of King George, we meet a group of theoretical magicians (those that study magic but are unable to practice it), who discover the existence of an actual magician, Mr Norrell. They challenge him to display his power, and if so, they will cease to be magicians in any sense.He does, and all those who agreed (all the York Magicians but one John Segundus) cease referring to themselves as magicians.When asked to perform a resurrection, however, Norrell relies on powers beyond his own, asking a boon of a fairy, a gentleman with thistle-down hair, who makes an ill bargain in order to bring the woman back from the dead.Jonathan Strange, the other capable magician apprentices himself to Norrell after the two encounter a strange street magician who utters an ominous prophecy. And that's just the first part.The novel takes the reader on a journey, through the Faerie realm, and across Europe during the war. It's written in a voice evoking that era, and is complete with the feelings of the age, including misogynistic writing (even though the author herself is female).Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is a great read, but a challenging one at that. The illustrations illuminate the passages as much as the extensive footnotes referencing works both factual and false.If you are a fan of modern English Fantasy, you might find yourself enjoying Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. If Clarke had more work in publication, she might rival favorite authors like Moorcock and Gaiman for top spot."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is now one of my favorite books of all time but let me preface that with saying that I didn't even think I'd finish it while I was trudging through the first 400 -- yes 400! -- pages. Not that they were so bad. They were witty and eloquent in that long-winded British kind of way. But where was this story going? Character after character was introduced until I could scarcely keep track of why Stephen Black the butler and this \\"man with thistle down hair\\" and Jonathan Segundus and many others were even in the book at all. \\"Just get on with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell already,\\" I began saying to my book.And then something happened. Somewhere around P. 400 -- yes 400 -- these random characters that had been methodically built up independently suddenly began to collide in a way that made me realize Clarke herself is a magician as mighty as the ones she writes about. How delightful to watch a puzzle that you have been dumbfounded by come together piece by piece. I read the second 400 pages in two days and was sad to see the book end. It's a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first four pages of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, (at least in my edition, the 2005 paperback) is a list of praise and quotes from reviews as to the quality of this novel. Coming across this, and the size of the book, is extremely daunting to a reader, and the prospect of watching to see if a novel comes to the level of quality so proclaimed is a challenge in and of itself.Susanne Clarke has fashioned a masterpiece of English literature, one that throws back to a Victorian style, rich in prose and story, and is easily one of the greatest works of fantasy literature that I have ever read, rivaling some of the great classics of the genre, from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a complicated, extraordinary and exceptional work, and I am very pleased to have read.The story is one that is complicated and fascinating. It begins in 1806, and tells the tale of two magicians who come forward in England with the intent to return English magic to a nation that has long been without it. Mr. Norrell is the first to come forward, and begins to bring magic back into the world. He is shortly thereafter joined by a fellow magician under his tutorage, Jonathan Strange, and they begin to study and practice their new craft. Thus begins a tale of friendship, rivalries, prophecy and history. Some of the greatest themes of literature are present here, but the story plays out in a truly original manner. There is the story of the differences between the master and apprentice, and within that context we see a number of themes; old verses new, tradition verses innovation.This story takes place during the Napoleonic wars, which play an integral part of the direction of the characters. Interwoven throughout the story are well known figures: King George II, Lord Wellington, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, Lord Byron, and others, which give this story a rich historical context that borders on alternative history, but in a manner that far surpasses other known authors of the genre, such as Harry Turtledove, but in a way that far surpasses his works. Indeed, Clarke seems to pay as much attention to detail as J.R.R. Tolkien in his own works, with precise and detailed language to describe the events of the story.The story takes place throughout England and continental Europe, and feels like it. From the dialogue to the characters and to the descriptions, it is a quintessential product of England, and draws upon its long history and literature. Oftentimes, I would find myself reading and feeling much like I was back in the country, something that I have longed for much lately. I know of a number of the locations in the book, as well as a good deal of the history of this time, and Clarke's novel falls well within the context of the time and history here.This book is a very complicated one, and having finished it only a short while ago, I am still processing all that has happened. It is written far differently from most other books - much as in the style of Jane Austin, from what I've read and it takes some time to get used to. Indeed, I read this book in two parts - I had started reading it almost a year or two ago, and put it aside to read something more accessible. Returning to it just a little while ago, I found that once I got into the story and characters, the pages flew by. But beyond the normal story here is a book that is rich with story. Throughout the pages there are footnotes of references to the author's world, giving the readers insights into the surrounding history that helps to shape this story. A number of these footnotes could be an entire story within themselves, and Clarke has singlehandedly created her own mythology that not only stands well on its own, but is so detailed that one could almost mistake it for a mythological history in and of itself.This book is a stunning debut of a new author. Looking back over the first couple of pages of praise that has been bestowed upon this book, I can see why it has been rated so highly by reviewers and fellow authors of the genre, and I am thrilled to say that this novel lives up to all expectations. Clarke has brought forth a complicated, yet intriguing, read to the fantasy genre, one that is most likely destined to become a classic, and one that, despite its real world historical contexts, is highly original, innovative and entertaining, one that I am sure to return to, and highly recommend to all fans of the genre, or a good read in general.(Originally posted on my blog)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First off, while this is a great book, it is not an easy summer read. There are footnotes galore that must be read in order to understand the story, but to me that is part of the books appeal. This book completely immerses you into its world and the level of work Susanna Clarke did on it is amazing. The story is fascinating though I will admit there are a few spots it drags a bit. But the different story lines intersect beautifully and again the detail - especially the clever use of footnotes - makes this a must read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I gave the book 3 stars for being extremely well written, but found the book's dark overtone too much for my taste."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The Good:The prose is excellent, as you would expect from such a highly lauded work. Clarke was clearly trying to make the setting more realistic by emulating classic authors such as Dickens and Austen, authors on whom we rely to summon up the nineteenth century for us. Thus, her novel seems almost as real as history. Which is great. The use of footnotes to provide background information is unusual in a novel, but it came across as charming.The Gentleman with the Thistle Down Hair was an enigmatic and interesting villain. He popped up quite a lot, but still it was never really clear what he was all about, or why he acted so strangely. Presumably, his erratic behavior was related to his being a faerie. His ideas of proper behavior and general morality were refreshingly alien, and creatively done.The Not-So-Good:The overarching plot is about the relationship and competition between Norrell and Strange. But I never really cared about it, and it seemed like a rigged fight anyway. Strange was far more sympathetic than Norrell, and more talented, and it seemed like just a matter of time before he got the better of his former master.Moreover, the novel is too long. It sags under its own weight. Clarke seems content to allow too many chapters to reveal exactly one fact to the reader. For example, one chapter reveals that Lady Pole hates Mr. Norrell (at least, in my reading, that was the only relevant information in that chapter). Couldn't that have been worked into another chapter, for the sake of expediency?For the full review, head over to [...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm inclined to admit, I seldom finish any fictional work, apart from \\"the classics,\\" aside from this one.You see, my bend is more toward the non-fiction. What interests me is natural medicine, metaphysics, quantum physics, aesthetics, psychology, etc.So I MUST say, this little piece was a serendipitous treasure, melding reason, knowing and beauty. A courtship between what I loved in fiction and lined-up with what I groped for in research. And it came without necessarily seeking it.Should you read it-- and if you are at all like me, you should-- pay attention to the two protagonists. One accumulates all and exercises little in action, a \\"heady\\" fellow; and the other practices all, groping for head knowledge. The dichotomy is brilliant, and each facet is part of a whole truth; not unlike our own."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Since the departure of The Raven King from England magic has become quite defunct in practice. In fact there are no longer anymore magicians left in the country, or at least not until the appearance of Mr. Norrell. Bent on returning English magic to its former glory in the public eye Mr. Norrell astounds everyone with his magical acts. Soon another magician, Jonathan Strange, appears on the scene and though their differences instantly set them apart Strange becomes Norrell's pupil. Together they set out to reestablish magic in England; beset the perils of wicked faeries, public conjecture and above all each other.Susanna Clarke's first novel flows effortlessly into an epic fantasy to rival Tolkien and Rowling; yet she writes with all the superior lyricism and social wit which Jane Austen possessed. For any reader of fantasy who also happens to be a fan of Austen this novel is a dream come true! Clarke is a brilliant new writer with a flair for writing rarely seen in contemporary authors.Personally, I enjoyed this book immensely! Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is my favorite book of the year thus far. Clarke's characters were not the usual heroic figures without fault; each possessed his or own idiosyncrasies and flaws which severed to animate them as believable people. Mr. Norrell is a sad little old man who fears everything but nothing so much as that his power and influence over English magic might be diminished. Jonathan Strange on the other hand is a charming, courageous, tolerably handsome young man who is excessively arrogant.Whenever the plot seemed to lag I was still continuously amused by Clarke's flourish for language and poetical passages. I have seen many reviews which criticized Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell for being so long and full of detail and yet after 1000 pages I am dying to read more! Clarke's gothic world of magic, wicked faeries, mysterious kings, and great magicians has bewitched me and I can scarcely bare to leave it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Absolutely, unequivocally, one of my favorite books of all time, if not THE favorite. The world the author weaves is believable, poignant, witty and magical. The book is so layered, and the characterization great. It really reads like a cross between Jane Austen, Tolstoy, Wilkie Collins and Harry Potter, if such a thing were possible. If you love one or two of these authors, you'll LOVE this! It's not at all dense and hard to read, as some reviewers have suggested. Sure, it's not Dan Brown, but neither is it War and Peace. A page-turner...classifiable as adventure or suspense. The ending was so gripping I was pretty much skimming things to find out what happened!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"For those of you who prefer your books time-tested for quality, I believe this book to be worthy of reading again and again; it is my hope that our contemporary readers will, in time, elevate Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell to the level of a classic. Suzanna Clarke crafts a tale that is designed for those who have an attention span for literature of the 19th century, but rather with a cunning imagination that is tangibly surreal. I can only apologize for the quality of my own writing...I am a far superior painter who has read and listened to this book six times over the past 3 years and I have not exhausted my delight in her word choice, the development of her characters, and her bizarre use of pineapples.

We wonder if the writer will ever be able to create anything so marvelous again. We surely hope so.kyela,the silver elves"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"meant for the bold, those with a keen mind and wit will appreciate this read. patience yes, but for those that it's meant for this will not be an issue. are you up to the challenge?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In a blurb on the back cover, Neil Gaiman calls \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell'' the \\"finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last seventy years.'' And I am certain he's right -- though I haven't read much of the genre. This book is hard to beat. The writing is a sheer delight. Ms. Clarke is having such a good time with her inventions and her characters that you practically have no choice but to enjoy yourself too. I particularly enjoyed her ruminations upon cats. And I loved many of the individual sentences, including this one: \\"The King said nothing, but he tapped his nose and looked very sly.'' Mr. Norrell is one of the best-drawn characters I've encountered in literature. He is a formidable scholar and magician who is vain, myopic, frightened, reprehensible, childlike and yet somehow sympathetic. Some real-life figures - Lord Byron, the Duke of Wellington, King George III - enliven the story as well. I had a funny sensation as I read along. Nearly every book or movie or TV show about magic that I can remember builds part of the plot around the idea that the hero must overcome everyone else's disbelief. For some reason, it was a relief to find a story in which the magic is simply accepted as fact. I must find a quibble, and here it is: I was a bit confused by the ending, and I lost track of one of the novel's villains; I'm still not sure what happened to him. At first I was a bit intimidated by the sheer physical size of the novel; it's a load to carry around in a backpack or briefcase. And I worried I might be put off by a somewhat old-fashioned writing style and a bunch of footnotes. I needn't have worried. The footnotes are charming, and Ms. Clarke's style is, well, enchanting. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell'' is great fun - a deeply funny, satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First, let me say, this book will require patience and quite a bit of time in order to make your way through it. Not that it's not enjoyable, but simply put, it is long.Susanna Clark does a lovely job of using the preexisting mythic character of the Raven King to create a central mythology that the book revolves around.The setting of the book is England around the time of the Napoleonic wars. The difference is that magic actually exists, though it has subsided into something that scholars study, rather than a practicable, practical art. The book begins with the \\"discovery\\" of Mr. Norrell---reclusive, socially inept, secretive, and consequently, the one man in England who is able to apply magic to real life. Later, Jonathan Strange discovers he has a knack for magic, and under the tutelage of Mr. Norrell, rapidly develops his gift, much to the dismay of Norrell, who studied for years to accomplish as much. The book chronicles their rivalry, Jonathan's love and loss, and the final event that seeks to drive a great and ancient evil out of the world.I also listened to the audio version of the book, which is beautifully performed and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Right about the time this novel takes place, the Romantic Era is getting started. At the turn of the 19th century there is a heavy backlash against civilization on many fronts with Rousseau and Novalis as two of the primary generals. JS&Mr.N; takes place right at the birth of this amazing movement, but is written modern, i.e., with the presumption that all humans are petty fools, or evil, petty fools leading sad but mildly laughable yet ultimately meaningless lives. That's the bitter taste of this novel, despite the cute Austen-ish language.I still give it five stars simply because S. Clarke is so skilled with her absurdity and meaninglessness. Just when you thought Western cultural exhaustion couldn't be repackaged any better than it has already been packaged 100,000 times, here comes Clarke to dazzle us once more. That is to say, if you've seen \\"Waiting for Godot,\\" and after half of the play is through it dawns on you that YOU are the fool waiting for Godot, then you'll appreciate Clarke's skill at getting you to turn the some 800 pages of a book that relentlessly denegrates our human race as represented in the quaint retroactive nostalgia of early 19th century Britain. But it's not only the humans that get the full modernist cold shower. JS&Mr.N; also weaves in a very modern, all but dystopian cyber-punkish version of the Northern Euro fairy mythology. Clarke's fairies are all but demons from Hell--the sort Swedenborg described so morbidly and chillingly.I do agree with many of the other readers that this book is not for everyone. Either you buy into frumpy, eccentric English ways, or they put you off. If you're a sucker for the Rule Britannia vibe (as most of the American intelligensia has been since the War of 1812), you'll definitely love this book... But as you can tell from my lines I have a love-hate relationship with JS&Mr.N...;."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Let me say first of all that this is one of the only books I've thoroughly enoyed written in the last sixty years by a female author. If you like whimsical historical fiction with a fantasy twist, than this book is absolutely for you. It chronicles the rise of English magic at the start of the nineteenth century through the eyes of two practicing magicians, two theoretical magicians and a faerie. Hard to put down once you get past the first hundred pages, and sad when it finally ends.Four of five stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book made me feel like a kid again. It's like the Scholastic mysteries you used to read after school, only this one is for adults. It recreates the feel of a novel from the 19th century, and has evocative illustrations throughout.The book is the saga of a well-read \\"practical\\" (practicing) magician vs. the speculations of academic magicians (those who study but do not practice). Later, the practicing magician takes on a brilliant but unstable apprentice who goes on to surpass his training, applying instinct and insight to resurrect heroic-age English magic. Along the way, the master magician and his pupil must face the growing menace posed by an ancient fairy who was summoned by one of the master magician's earlier spells.Imagine C.S. Lewis and Ludwig Wittgenstein as magicians...The length may seem a bit daunting to some, but I found this to be a pleasurable fireside read for some cold autumn nights. I will watch for Ms. Clarke's future works."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a fantastic book. I purchased it many months ago, but I have not finished it as of yet. I find Clarke's writing style most accessible and engaging. Her character descriptions and pace of the plot are also superbly done.My one, tiny, microscopic criticism are the footnotes. While interesting, after I'm finished reading them, I find that I need to begin the chapter again to stay on track with the story.Simply a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I can't think of any other writer since Dickens who's managed to enter so thoroughly a world like this one, in which in throwaway lines minor characters lose plum jobs in governmental agencies whose purpose everyone long since has forgotten and major characters so laughably are naive, hopeful, and terrible judges of their acquaintances. In this rich, nuanced novel, Ms. Clarke has created a fantasy utterly believable and endearing.If it's a slow read, that's only because each word illuminates another aspect of the gingerbread of this novel; it's slow in the way the very best books are slow.A wonderful book I can't praise nearly highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A friend put this book in my hands and said: \\"One of the best books I've ever read. I was sad when it was over.\\" Having been the victim of bad advice, I felt a deep sense of skepticism. That skepticism was misplaced.Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell tells a character-driven story that has been seamlessly intertwined with British history. A desire for a renaissance of magic drives the title characters of the story. Clarke's eye for human foibles, eccentricities, and surprising nobleness help her create a large cast of interesting, complex, and-most importantly-believable characters.Clarke employs a number of creative strategies in this work. The most significant of these is her use of footnotes. Yes, we typically associate footnotes with dusty fragments of information found in a variety of scholarly journals. Clarke, though, uses these well-written pieces to give further insight into the characters and to give deep roots of believability to her novel of the fantastic.Though 800 pages in length, the smooth pacing of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell allows for quick reading. I highly recommend it. Not only did it bring me joy as I read it, but I find that my thoughts keep traveling back to the characters and events of this well crafted tale."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"this was great, starts out slow...but if you want a book you'll forward to coming home to this is it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm always hesitant to make a commitment to a fiction book with 782 pages. Indeed, I passed this title over several times due to its length, but when I finally bought it and read it, I could not put it down, often staying up late into the night!Others have summarized the plot, but it has to do with two magicians who want to bring magic back to England after centuries of disuse. Each has a strategy toward accomplishing this, but both ultimately have to come to terms with an early 19th century version of the \\"Law of Unintended Consequences\\". Beside the two title characters, the book is populated by a variety of additional characters who all contribute to the story in their own way.Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange is an impressive d&eacute;but for Susanna Clarke. She has constructed a unique book by combining elements of British history, 19th Century literary style, and magic. (In this respect, she improves upon the great JRR Tolkien or the slightly less-great CS Lewis, whose worlds were wholly based on fantasy and/or allegory and which are of course written in a more contemporary style.)And let's not even consider comparisons with JK Rowling's works, with their rat-a-tat-tat plots, cutesy characters, and simple-minded moral absolutism (good and evil are very clearly telegraphed and differentiated, with no grey areas inbetween). Having read a number of those books in the past, I can scarcely recall anything that was in them now; I don't think I'll ever say that about MN&JS.; If you are however one of those who considers the Harry Potter series a \`great read' and examples of great literature, then you probably will not enjoy MN&JS.;I note many readers seem put off by the meandering descriptions and slow character development, and the ambiguous and not always honourable motivations of the main characters. Evidently they've read little 19th Century English literature. For me the meanderings and asides were a big part of the charm of this book, as were the period spellings, idioms and turns of phrase. Finally, I found the attention to historical accuracy within the context of the magical world quite appealing - clearly a lot of research went into putting the two together.Reading this book was like taking a long lazy ride on a picturesque river on a beautiful summer day. Sure, you could have got to the end a lot faster by cutting out a lot of the journey, but why would you want to when the trip there is so interesting and enjoyable?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Let me start my saying it's rare that I love a book enough to give it five stars. I consider myself a \\"picky\\" reader; and it's rare that I'll find a book and find no faults with it. But I could find no faults with this one; I loved it from start to finish. I've seen several negative reviews on here from readers disappointed that it's not like Harry Potter (GOD FORBID!). No, this book isn't like Harry Potter. If you're looking for a light fantasy read (as much as I love Harry Potter--and I do--I still consider it \\"light\\" reading, as opposed to real literature), then Jonathan Strange isn't for you. This book blends fantasy (fairies, magic, etc.) with historical fiction (Engand in the 1880s), and does an excellent job doing so. A fun, wonderful read! I will be eagerly awaiting Susanna Clarke's next novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The novel Jonathon Strange & Mr. Norrell is five-star fantasy in every way. The magic is original, not a re-work of another author's ideas. The characters' personalities are drawn in great detail and the fine details contribute greatly to their behavior throughout the novel. The characters both consistently act within their personalities and continue to reveal themselves through their actions. And the plot is so complex, the reader really doesn't anticipate the upcoming twists - they are always a surprise.This is fantasy without dragons and without a young man on a quest (unless, perhaps, the 30-something Strange can be considered so). Two magicians, one a recognized master, one an apprentice, collaborate to restore practical magic to England. The one's reclusiveness and the other's open-mindedness cause a rift as they pursue a common goal, and perhaps a common enemy. And the open ending is not a resolution so much as a door to what the reader can only hope is a sequel as surprising as the original."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It is England in the early 1800s as she has always been: the Empire that dominates the globe, full of scoundrels, snobs, and...well, magic. Susanna Clarke tweaks history by adding a magical past to England at its zenith: centuries back, magic and magical ability were commonplace; scholars of magic could move cities, create roads to nowhere, summon faerie servants to do their bidding, and leave the human world to reign over kingdoms on the other side of Hell. In Strange and Norrell's England, however, the rise of the Empire has also witnessed the devolution of practical Magic. It seems that only one man - the reclusive, wealthy, and vain Mr. Norrell - retains the ability to do real magic, an ability that he demonstrates by making all the statues in Yorkminster Cathedral come alive momentarily.Norrell resents the idea of other magicians; he buys up every magical book in every library in England, and makes himself valuable to the English government by conjuring up invading fleets of British ships made solely out of rain, to threaten the French fleet. His drive to become the sole magician in England leads him to take a terrible risk, unleashing a wicked fairy, known only as \\"the man with the thistledown hair\\" on London. Then, a new magician appears on the scene: the heroic, even romantic Jonathan Strange. Where Norrell is a sullen recluse, Strange is an affable fellow devoted to his wife. Where Norrell uses his magic for personal gain, Strange wants magic to save England. He even accompanies the Duke of Wellington on campaigns against Napoleon, saving Brussels from French invasion by temporarily depositing it in (it appears) the plains of Nebraska. Eventually the rivalry between Norrell and Strange puts Strange's wife at terrible risk; Strange goes near mad in his attempts to save her. At the end, he succeeds, but Strange and Norrell's fates are permanently linked together in a way promising for those wanting a sequel.This book has been mismarketed as an adult Harry Potter. It is more closely related to Jane Austen or perhaps Charles Dickens. First, because its author Clarke is, stylistically, an exquisite mimic of the tone of its times: Clarke's narrator has some of Austen's wit and powers of observation about Society, as well as some of Dickens' ability to put her full creative genius into the smallest scenes and characters (everybody in this book is terrifically interesting). Some reviewers (most notably the Times' Janet Maslin) objected to the book's length (it runs about 800 pages), but to my mind its length is completely consistent with its era and the charms of its story (it even has some footnotes, which are interesting in their own right). Who, after all, would have wished David Copperfield or Sense and Sensibility to \\"get to the point\\"? I would have been disappointed to have it end a moment sooner. It is not meant to be the book version of an \`action' picture, as the Harry Potter series, for all its charms, seems in comparison.Clarke adds to these strengths of style and character a plot that, for all its length, is quite gripping. I predict it will matter a great deal to you how and why Arabella Strange escapes her peril. People who prefer pure fantasy to historic fiction may not love this book as much as I did. But, if you like books that give a deliciously authentic sense of an era, and books that are full of interesting twists and turns, you will find a unique combination of them here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am not going to bore you with a description of the book.

I highly recommend this quirky, lovely book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm fairly young, I came across the Potter series about two years ago (or more precisely had it shoved under my nose). After finishing the fourth installment I considered myself Rowling's No. 1 fan. Since then I have made more than one fan site, have taken trips to other cities just to meet the author, and have convinced myself that I'd like to kinda be one -- an author that is.But then I'm not here to promote Potter.I found Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell after reading a article that mentioned a book like Potter, only for adults. I believed this. Bought the book and realized I had been sorely decieved. Like many others I believe there could not be two less comparable books.In a literary sense they hold nothing in common (and don't be fooled into thinking their writing styler is similar, you get that style with British fantasy), and yet for all their lack of similarity they do have one rather similar significancy:They both work magic. Horribly enchanting magic. The rush of adrenalin, of bitter-sweet excitment...when reading Susanna Clarke's book I wanted time to stop, to stay burning in that moment. (And all of this at the risk of sounding both cliche and melo-dramatic!)I did, really.But of course it didn't.I finished the book a time-flying 16 minutes later. Put it away on my shelf between my UK and US editions of Harry Potter...All the while reaching the conclusion that I have not read crueler books then JK Rowling's and Susanna Clarke's first novel(s)....I'm sorry I've realized that what I am writing here isn't nearly as much a review, as it is a 14 year old's rambling. But I've heard enough debates between whether Jonathan Strange fits the shoe as a classic or if it's simply a hype with too much Austen and Gaiman for it's own good. And they all forget what makes a book what it is -- the magic. The timeless hours that slip unconsciously by as pages flutter by, one at a time.I will never forget Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, and I couldn't care less if the hype dies down and everyone else decides that it was simply that, a hype -- something to be forgotten.Fine. Let it be forgotten.I'll remember it.Today. Tomorrow. 40 years from now.I'll remember it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I suppose it is appropriate that when one reads a novel having to do with magic, then one must come under some sort of spell. To my weary mind the book gave the very distinct illusion that it was never going to end. Of course, being a rational human being, it took no great effort to dispel this illusion: one can lift the book with one hand; one can open the book and see that it is 780 pages; one can see oneself physically turning the pages--slowly, to be sure--while reading it. Perhaps therefore it is not the actual reading of the novel which creates this illusion, it is instead the dreary contemplation of picking it up again after lifting one's head up in the morning, and knowing it to be the meandering, simple-minded, illogical, trite batch of nonsense that it is.The premise is that \\"magic\\" has somehow disappeared from England for the last several hundred years. It is now 1806 and although there are a group of scholarly types who study it, there is nobody around to practice it. Except for Mr. Norrell, who shows up, does so, and to everyone's astonishment. He becomes famous. He is then followed by Jonathan Strange, who becomes his pupil for a while before they have a falling-out. Eventually a lot of strange and dire things occur, and the two must reluctantly combine forces to summon the famous Raven King--who began the practice of English magic in the 12th century--in order to defeat a mean-spirited faerie that Norrell foolishly summoned early on.It's a pretty interesting premise, but the execution of it is almost mind-numbingly dull. To begin with, the characters are very thin, transparent almost, if you will forgive me the indulgent allusion. We are led to believe after about 150 pages that Mr. Norrell is a fussy, selfish and fearful old man. Except that, well, up to then, nothing he does or says makes this apparent. In fact, after his first daring magical trick, he is quite arrogant. The Strange character is another bit of legerdemain. We are told, more than half way through the novel, that despite a plot-wise significant, personal tragedy, \\"he spoke in the same ironic, superficial tone.\\" This was also a bit of a revelation, especially since he never spoke in an ironic, \\"superficial\\" tone to begin with. And what pray tell is a superficial tone anyway?The tale is told in a documentary fashion, as if it were a history, and with helpful notations contained throughout. The notations are usually short fairy tales, placed strategically to illuminate some comment contained in the narrative. For example, Norrell will refer to a spell used in the year 1436 or something, and the notation will give its \\"history\\": Mary Smith, a 14 year old goatherd, after following a stray off the dirt path, saw a bright object which she picked up, and which turned out to be . . . and so on. These little stories are vaguely interesting, but unfortunately, stall what is a frustratingly meandering plot to begin with.Meandering because it is already loaded with meaningless, endless, useless details. Nobody simply meets somebody, they must meet, \\"secretly in a little graveyard upon a hillside not far from Castrejon.\\" There is subplot after subplot with full descriptions of some character and his wife and her wig and their library and the history of their library--only to have them disappear completely several pages later. There is a chapter which begins by telling us how Norrell arranges to have a weekly journal published. There are letters written by the two protagonists. There is an entire chapter devoted to an article Strange wrote in a major publication. There is even a lengthy discussion having to do with Strange working on his book. This would be boring even if it were real. Do we really want or need to know about the fictional history of magic? Okay, yes, there is lots of magic performed. Some is even imaginative, but mostly, not really--Grimm or Aesop this isn't--and only rarely does it advance the plot. Think about it. How, really, does the recitation of some magical trick advance anything once it ends?But that's not the worst of this. What is truly grating is that the events here do not make sense even in the fantastic world of the author's creation. Look, we're willing to suspend our disbelief, but please, construct your world with some boundaries. The Faerie obtains his first victim because of a bargain made with a foolish human magician. His second victim is obtained simply by whisking him away. But the third he must obtain by tricking humanity into thinking she is dead. Which is it? And what is to prevent him from doing this to anyone or everyone?The magicians begin practicing magic--and remember, no men had done so for 200 years--with incredible ease. There are no failures, no experiments, no mistakes. It comes as easy as anything, and it seems there is nothing they can't do. They raise the dead, move mountains and streams, change the weather, create roads in the wilderness. Mr. Strange moves the entire city of Brussells to the American West! This is oh so clever, but dramatic tension is surely sacrificed when the author can snap her fingers and let her characters do just about anything.Admittedly, one's interest picks up towards the end as the two magicians begin their final conflict with the evil faerie, but again, the path is cluttered with irrelevancies, and the denouement is, predictably, contrived.What's ironic is that this, a fiction about magic, isn't really magical at all. True magic occurs when an author creates believable, recognizable characters, makes their situations interesting to us, and perhaps causes a smile of wonder to cross our face on occasion. Regrettably, nothing remotely like that is conjured here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"[I only left a rating because I was forced to, it refers to the poor quality of the ebook, not the content of the story]I like the book so far as I have read it but I have to point out that the translation to the Kindle was not done well.

Not a great reading experience, especially since the book was so long--trying to find my place on my iPhone turned into an exercise in futility. I quit reading about a quarter of the way through and went to the end. The last chapters are as slow as the first. Give me Harry Potter any day.

I looked forward to reading it, as it had been described as Harry Potter for grownups. Additionally, the reviews on the book jacket compare it favorably to both JRR Tolkien and Jane Austen. I found that the first half tells a good tale with style, but the second half was very disappointing, seeming to be inconsistent, confusing, and unsatisfying. I had to force myself through the last hundreds of pages. Some passages from the book are wonderful, so there is no question of the author's writing talent, but I felt the plot collapsed. While the comparisons to illustrious authors are quite flattering to author Susanna Clarke, I really couldn't see the connection at all, and rather think Austen and Tolkien would be offended.The coherent part of the story involves two magicians who become famous for using magic to bolster the British war efforts. After 500 pages Strange realizes that his real opponent is not Bonaparte but a wicked fairie who has spirited away his wife. At this point the story loses its continuity and purpose: the war plot evaporates, Strange and his wife are never reunited, and though the reader is aware that the fairie poses a threat to England, neither magician ever appreciates this or confronts it. In short, all the strands of the complicated plot that are developed in the first half of the book remain unresolved through the final 300 pages: The characters that are developed in such painstaking detail are either abandoned or left struggling. The obstacles they struggled against have not been overcome or they have been replaced with new challenges. The objects that have been the goal of exhaustive searches remain lost or fail to be recognized for what they are. And the powerful spells they have tried to master have unexplained results that they do not understand and cannot solve.I am reluctant to be so critical of such a huge quantity of work that took 10 years to write, but the story left me bewildered and disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Rounding up to 5 stars because this book takes a lot of flak from people who just aren't the right readers for the book.Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is the story of two magicians in early 19th century England.... an alternate England, readers quickly discover, where magic is widely accepted (if no longer practiced) as a part of life. The strengths of this book lie primarily in the character development, the author's excellent recreation of early-19th-century-style prose, and the superbly drawn backdrop and atmosphere behind it all: from fashionable London social gatherings to the bleak northern England landscape where the heart of English magic seems to lie.If the above paragraph doesn't constitute much of a recommendation in your mind--in particular, if you're distressed that I did not say anything about a fast-paced plot or action scenes--then you should not read this book.I was immediately drawn in by the first scene of this book: a rather humorous account of a meeting of the Learned Society of York Magicians, none of whom have ever done any magic; within a couple of pages I understood why Clarke is often compared to Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. The characters come instantly to life, even the ones who aren't very likeable. The relationship between the title characters is the focus of this novel, and it's so complicated and human and believable that I couldn't help but keep reading.The prose is great and does an excellent job of maintaining the sense of immersion in the time period. Most historical fiction authors make no attempt to use period language--nor should they--but Clarke can pull it off and it's brilliant. I love her subtle wit, and the footnotes are excellent. Normally I'm not a big fan of footnotes, but the way Clarke uses them, to give us background information, flesh out side-stories and cite to fictitious works of magic, adds so much to the story.And of course, the alternate-history worldbuilding is excellently done. Clarke does a great job re-imagining how England would be with magic as part of its makeup; quite similar to the real England in many respects, but the deviations are well woven into the setting and learning more about how it all fit together kept me reading. And as I mentioned before, the atmosphere and scene-setting are excellent.I will still voice a few gripes. Some of the secondary characters did not seem quite as well-developed as they could be given the amount of page time they got; I suppose it's their English reserve getting in the way, but I didn't feel that I knew characters like Childermass or Lascelles very well at all. The scenes with Stephen Black--although he's a great character--became repetitive. And especially for a female author, I found Clarke's female characters a bit passive. They have personality, but when a man and a woman wind up in the same unpleasant situation for most of the book, he manages to carry on as normal while she does little but sulk. For a decade. Come on, have some strength of character, please.At any rate, I highly recommend this book, but to a specific subset of the population: only if you're happy to read a long, slow-paced book for the characterization, setting and prose. Read the Amazon excerpt before you buy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is definitely one of my new favorites. It is set in England in the 1800s, but in an England where magic has been prevalent throughout its history, but at present dormant. Enter Gilbert Norrell-a very learned magician who learned his craft from buying up all the available books on magic in the land. He is very content to be the world's only practicing magician. But then Jonathan Strange appears. He is drawn to magic, and then to Mr. Norrell who has become the epicenter of English magic. The two are quite a pair of opposites, but their shared love of learning and magic unite them. They begin to aid England in the Napoleonic wars with their skills and are perceived as England's heroes. But a rather foolish pact That Mr. Norrell made with a Fairy will come back to bite both of them. Despite their differences they will need each other to fix things and fulfill a prophecy to bring English magic back to its former strength.What a great book. Even though it is over 800 pages it was engaging from start to finish. Some parts read like a book right out of Jane Austen's era, but with a twist of magic thrown in for spice. The footnotes that explain references to ancient magical history are also very engaging. This is a wonderful and unique undertaking, and I count Clarke among some of my favorite novelists. I look forward to reading more from this wonderful author.About the Author:Susanna Clarke is a British author. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is her debut novel, which is a Hugo Award-winning alternate history. Clarke began Jonathan Strange in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time while editing cookbooks for Simon and Schuster. For the next decade, she published short stories from the Strange universe, but it was not until 2003 that Bloomsbury bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a bestseller. Two years later, she published a collection of her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of nineteenth-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses on the relationship of two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.If you find this interesting, also check out: Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. Both are excellent novels that really paint the entire history of the magical world around the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a very unique and entertaining book. It is seven hundred and something pages long, but I never lost interest in it, and I actually didn't want it to end. The author has a dry sense of humor and is very creative and talented.

This one was fantastic.Initially I couldn't tell if I should give credit to the author, Susanna Clarke, or to the narrator, Simon Prebble, and I eventually decided they deserve equal credit. (I did go on to read -in printed book format- Clarke's The Ladies of Grace Adieu, and that was really good as well, so it wasn't just Prebble's reading.)Specifically, here are some highlights of Prebble's reading:1) He reads all the footnotes but manages to make them not disrupt the flow of the story.2) Each character's voice is unique, and he pulls off the women's voices without sounding corny.3) He performs the different accents (London, northern English/Yorkshire etc.)4) The intonations, the inflections, the timing as he reads the sentences are perfect -- he seems to understand and convey Clarke's meaning rather than calling attention to his own acting. Believe me, not all audio book narrators do this.PS To anyone not sure they will like the book because of the subject matter, it's much less similar to Neil Gaiman and more like The Lord of the Rings. I usually enjoy historical fiction, and the sci-fi/fantasy elements in this story did not take themselves overly seriously -- there is a wry self-depreciation throughout that reminded me of A.A. Milne."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'll keep this brief because many people have said it better than I could. However, I LOVED this book! Some say the beginning was difficult to get through, but I loved it from the first word. It's a brilliant blend of many of my favorite genres, and not only is it astoundingly detailed and well realized, but amazingly original. I know that it is long, but it went by quickly for me because I couldn't put it down, and I've actually read it three times now and it is as fresh and interesting on each read. I'm not saying this book is for everyone, but if you like Jane Austen and fantasy, at least give this a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've sat and wondered for a good time about this very strange novel, and really there is nothing like it that I can reasonably compare it to. Though I admire Ms Rowling, I find the comparison made of her and Ms Clarke slightly disappointing. Harry Potter is imaginative; but \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" redefines the imagination. In Rowling's books readers are possibly awestruck; in Ms Clarke's novel I cannot help but feel, all at once, horrified, enchanted, outraged and ecstatic. Perhaps the comparison meant merely that, what Potter did for children, Clarke shall do for grown-ups. I find this, too, highly misleading, however.A friend of mine once told me that he found Ms Clarke's book enjoyable but \\"...terribly odd,\\" and then admitted that he only read it because \\"Neil Gaiman spoke so highly of it.\\" The book certainly is very odd, as he said, but I found it (after reading it) better than anything Mr Gaiman has offered the world. Ms Clarke talks about Lewis' \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" as the book that got her interested in the idea of magicians, and, though its inspiration is distinguishable, her magicians, her magic, is something much more remarkable. This novel stretches to the original definition of a novel: i.e., it is both unique and commonplace. This novel, it will be argued by the modern day critic, seems anything but \\"commonplace\\" - but that is the glory and wonder of Ms Clarke. She makes Magic so real that one believes it to be as true as anything else. The statues may speak at York; yet they are most remarkable strictly because they are statues. Fairies may seem unearthly; but it is only because in eight-hundred or so pages, our author proves the Earth so unearthly. The Magic, like all good Magic, merely \\"awakens\\" - it revives what really IS magical in our seemingly humdrum world. We are all under an enchantment; it takes a spell equally strong, a dose of reality equally bombastic, to shake us from our bewitchment, our slumber. Like Mr Honeyfoot, we all are very perturbed about there being no Magic left in the world, and we demand (some in an uproar) why this is the case. Ms Clarke proves that there is such a thing as Magic; for she herself is quite a practical magician, in the only way all true writers prove themselves to be."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Logic only gives man what he needs...Magic gives him what he wants.\\" ~Tom RobbinsThis book is difficult to rate. At times I loved it, and at other times I just wanted it to end. This book has taken longer for me to read than any other book in recent memory(of course it didnt help that my wife and I watched all four seasons of Lost during my regular reading hours for the first month). I like to try to read approx. 30 books a year and this book is likely to keep me from my goal this year. This urgency may have made me more frustrated with the pace of the book than usual.I was really looking forward to the book originally. I thought the concept sounded pretty intriguing - magic coming back in early 19th century England via Strange and Norrell. I like the way the author writes, she definitely has a way with words; however, I just felt it fell flat. It didn't really hold my attention very well. Just when it started to get good, it would start what I felt was another boring section. It definitely isn't meant to be a fast paced book, which is alright by me; however, it just felt like the plot wasn't going anywhere for the first 2/3rds of the book. I liked the last third of the book for the most part; however, it wasn't enough to make up for the first part. Reviews on Amazon kept me going but I just didn't feel it lived up to my high expectations."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you need to decide quickly if you will like this book I offer the following advice: Flip through the pages and look at the pictures.You will notice that many of the pictures are of scenes that take place indoors. Not only that, but there really isn't much going on in these pictures.Expect lots of eccentric characters, sophisticated dialogue, scenic descriptions (without being flowery), but at the same time don't expect the plot to make leaps and bounds and raise question after question. If you're going to read it, I suggest pacing yourself.In a nutshell, you have two magicians. Mr. Norrell, who hordes all books of magic and loves to talk and read about the subject. Then there's Strange, who is more interested in practicing it.Straight away you can see how the two are going to conflict with each other.Both are trying to bring Magic back to England.To add to this concoction, the Napoleonic Wars are taking place (it was these parts I found the most exciting) and later in the book you even stumble across the mad King and Lord Byron.The magic is interesting, but not of the sword and sorcery variety. (The parts where Strange moves entire objects/places are absolutely hilarious though).The fairies aren't what I was expecting either. I was actually reminded of the faun in Pan's Labyrinth--comes across as nice, but apparently has another agenda.The blend of history and fantasy is pulled off very well, to include footnotes that honestly don't add much, other than to give you the feeling that you're reading a non-fiction account of magic in 1800's England.All this being said, I can easily see how this won the Hugo award, but it's not for everybody.There is a part in this book where the author describes a carriage ride being bumpy despite it having iron springs (a high-quality carriage for those days, I presume). Such is this book, it has lots of components that are high-quality, but the road (plot) it rides on is not always smooth. But it is fun to look out the window and take in the sights (the characters, history and attention to detail)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It seems like a lot of the reviewers foolishly bought this book expecting \\"Harry Potter for adults\\". It's expected that they were sorely disappointed, because that's not the aim of this book at all. Just because a book is about magicians doesn't make it Harry Potter, folks. J.K. Rowling's writing is modern and highly accessible to anybody, whereas this novel was explicitly written in a style to emulate 19th century fiction. The written voice is very much of that period, and if you don't have the reading skill to navigate the laborious but poetic nature of such writing with all its 1800s British nuance, it's likely you will get frustrated trying to read this novel.However, if you have no trouble with this sort of writing, you may well love this book as I did. Clarke imbues this novel with no small amount of subtle, lighthearted wit and irony. The real novelty comes in the way she has crafted such a cohesive narrative out of the unintuitive pairing of 19th century British society (such as one might find in Jane Austen) and magical fantasy. You wouldn't think it would work, but it does.If one were to argue that the book starts off slow, I might find a little room to agree...however, once the book reaches the second act and begins to concentrate on Strange rather than Norrell, that's when it really starts to take off, and by the third act everything begins to come to a head in a dramatic way. So many different subplots are interwoven with one another but it's all tied up very neatly at the end. Although the door is left open at the end for a followup to the story, I think the way it ends is perfect and I'm not sure what a sequel would really contribute.In summary: If you have a taste for more classical literary style and for fantasy, you'll find this book a good read. If you're looking for Jonathan Strange & Mr. Potter, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" has been referred to as \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" The story is set in England in the early 1800s, where two very different men are trying to revive practical magic. There's bookish Mr. Norrell and the younger, more affable Jonathan Strange: two very different men who have similar goals, but approach them in very distinctive ways.Author Susanna Clarke is a very gifted writer. The style of this book is very unique, and Clarke manages to seamlessly blend elements of fantasy, mythology, and a good old-fashioned comedy of manners into one giant novel. However, \\"giant\\" is the key word here. I'm not one to shy away from lengthy books, but I had a very hard time getting into this one. Although extremely well-written, \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is also incredibly dense and difficult to get through. The pacing of the novel is ungodly slow, especially during the first two-thirds of the book. Clarke constantly shuffles back and forth between hundreds of characters (many of whom aren't all that significant) and often goes off on random tangents that detract from the main core of the story. The book is also full of numerous false footnotes, which are obviously intended to enhance the story, but I found them to be very annoying.Don't get me wrong here: this is an amazing book, and it's unlike anything I've ever read before. The basic storyline is fascinating, but Clarke failed to hold my attention for long periods of time (until the very end of the book, where the pacing finally picks up a bit). If you are like me and prefer largely plot-driven novels, you'll probably have a tough time with this one. I hear the book is being made into a movie, and this is one of those rare occasions where I'll probably enjoy the film more than the novel. But, to each their own."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Let me state upfront that I am intriged by magic and faerie worlds - the kind found in medieval ballads, legends and folklore - but am no fan of modern fantasy novels. Their wonderfully illustrated covers are most enticing, but alas I never get past the dustjucket blurbs - which lead me to the sad conclusion that most novels in this genre are just plain hokey - silly & contrived & totally unconvincing. OK, I confess I find it hard to suspend disbelief & my tastes are literary, but I want to be enchanted!! I crave a good read!! That is why I am so deligthed to have stumbled upon Susanna Clarke. This is my kind of fabulation! This is my kind of writer! I found J.S & Mr N engrossing & thoroughly entertaining. What we have here is a subtle literary pistache I think - a highly imaginative comedy of manners perhaps, certainly well researched and full of ideas that draw from the deep well of English literary tradition.

But one man, Mr Norrell, is intent on returning magic to England, defeating the troublesome Napoleon, and proving that magic might serve the country. Norrell insists that the returned magic avoid any connection to fairies, and he takes special care to heap scorn on the reputed father of all magic in England, John Uskglass. Only once does he violate his rules, calling up a fairy to return the dead fiancee of the Prime Minister.Mr Norrell claims to wish magic to return to England, but he goes out of his way to make that difficult. The only way to learn magic is through books, but Norrell has gathered every book he can find and hides them from anyone. He sends his (semi-magical) servant through England exposing fraud. Still, when a second true magician appears, Mr Norrell cannot help his fascination and insists that the newcomer, Jonathan Strange, become his student. Of course, he doesn't go so far as to share his most important books with his student.Strange is initially content with the arrangement, but his experience in the military convinces him that Mr Norrell has taken a wrong path--that English magic is inseparable from John Uskglass. The two magicians quarrel and sever their relationship.In the meantime, the fairy Mr Norrell relied upon to raise the dead fiancee takes an interest in the minister's black servant, and in Strange's wife whom, he eventually kidnaps into his perpetual but grim world of Lost Hope and continual parties celebrating cruelty and death. Strange didn't pay much attention to his wife while she was present, but with her absent and thought dead, he seeks madness.JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL is a strange, but powerful novel. For much of the book, there really isn't a plot line. Rather, Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange wander around England and the world discussing magic and working strange magics (Strange occasionally moves cities for the convenience of Wellington's army). Author Susanna Clarke takes the reader off into long digressions with Steven Black, the servant who captivates the fairy, Norrell's servant (who is possibly the most intriguing character in the story), and Mr. Seguntus, an academic magician who did not give up his studies after Norrell broke up the Magician Society of York.STRANGE is a literary work, with not a few parallels to English literature of the 18th century (long digressions, author notes to the reader, an omniscient point of view). Still, Clarke uses these devices rather than being limited by them, keeping the reader captivated.This is a massive work--close to 900 pages in the hardback version--and requires an investment in time to read. But the book definitely provides a high return on this investment. I recommend JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL highly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Ok, everyone has their tastes... their favorite medium, their favorite authors, their favorite styles, etc. but the people who gave this book one or two stars should have their own favorites severely scrutinized.

I was only disappointed by the fact that I hadn't discovered a new (to me) author with a half dozen other books I could pick up immediately. Ms. Clarke and her J.

I found it in a pile of books my aunt gave to me and it seemed an appropriate read after I finished Peter Carey's \\"Jack Maggs.\\" I didn't even bother reading the synopsis until I had pushed through the first couple of chapters. Like others who had less kind things to say about this book, I found it boring at the beginning and hard to get through.Looking back now, I wonder if anyone realizes that the section about the boring and stodgy Mr. Norrell SHOULD be boring and stodgy? Likewise, I found Jonathan Strange's section more light and humorous, and the last section takes on its character's creepy, mysterious personality.The magical events promised to me in the synopsis spurred me on. I was intrigued to at least push through and see what happened with the girl he raised from the dead. By the time I did make it to Lady Pole's story, I was hooked.Anyone who has read the works of Neil Gaiman will at least feel a tinge of familiarity when the book finally does enter the world of Faerie. The footnotes are just an added bonus. Through them, Ms. Clarke creates an alternate England for us with it's own history in magic and stories of talking mermaid statues and stolen babies.*Personal Opinion Time: Don't compare this book to Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a nice book, but pales shamefully in the light of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. They're really not similar at all.All in all, I have to say that I would be hard pressed to find a book that appeals more to my sense of the fantastic and my need for a solid story.

Then I found myself dreading getting to the end. Every word, even the footnotes, leads to something even more fantastic than the last.

Not only does Susanna Clarke successfully create a sense of place in her novel, she creates a sense of place that is real and unreal, subject to wonder and enchantment, humor and terror. The characterizations in the book are fantastic; the wit is pervasive. The footnotes to events reinforce the depth of the story, weaving a mythology throughout the novel. The last third of the novel turns dark, very dark indeed, and I found that soon I was possessed by a sense of dread as events unfolded.For all of the length of \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" I felt that the novel ended too soon: such is the world that Susanna Clarke created.

But when Mr. Norrell weakens in the presence of the huge temptation to do something unsafe in order to further his reputation as a great magician, he unleashes an evil fairy. This exposes England to a multitude of magical problems that Norrell and Strange must endeavor to rectify.Upon reading this novel, the reader enters a very real and delightful world of magic and fantasy. Susanna Clarke expertly makes the fantastic seem very real. And her tome is written in a wordy Victorian style that reminds me of the styles of Hawthorne and Poe, making it even more delightful and classic and authentically nineteenth century story-telling. The hardcover edition even contains old-style sketches that make it more unique and enjoyable. The superfluous footnotes even reflect this time period, however some may find them overwhelming and tedious. Sadly, many people may not enjoy these classic details as much as I, and will, undoubtedly, find themselves growing bored because of these things. But in spite of all these Victorian flourishes, this has all the characteristics of a great novel: well-defined characters who demand our compassion, picturesque settings, and loads of excitement.

I'm struggling to classify it, which was perhaps the aim of the author. It reads something like a Jane Austen and Neil Gaiman collaborative rewrite of Midsummer Night's Dream set during the Napoleonic Wars, but with more (theoretical) magicians. Nope, that's still not it.It starts as a rather curiously written (with footnotes!) tale about theoretical magicians in York. My initial attraction to the book was just how much fun it was to read the prose (and the footnotes). By the time I had finished, I felt like applauding the author for not only writing an epic (historical) fantasy, but managing to do so in such an original manner.I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes Austen and Gaiman, or historical fantasy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is now one of my favorite books of all time but let me preface that with saying that I didn't even think I'd finish it while I was trudging through the first 400 -- yes 400! -- pages.

Too bad the Kindle edition doesn't live up to the paper version."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a surprising hybrid of two genres: the historical fiction novel & the magical fantasy. Susanna Clarke, the first time author of the book, hits on a winning combination with this story, as her sales and reviews already testify. Because the two component genres contain some of my favorite stories (Aubrey/Maturin, Captain Alatriste & Harry Potter, LOTR), I quickly ordered it and moved it to the top of my reading list. This is what I thought:The novel is long and contains many meandering side-stories that are loosely related to the main issue: the friendship of England's first magicians in many years, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as well as the tests to that friendship that threaten to destroy it. So when you begin reading, do not expect a straightforward and traditional storyline- this is not Harry Potter, and it is not Jack Aubrey & Stephen Maturin. You will find a variety of interesting and entertaining anecdotes and tales that all serve to flesh out the quasi-historical world of England during the Napoleonic Wars. To top this off, the book is flush with footnotes, a great many of which actually distract from what you reading, but provide meaningful background to the story and its characters. Once I had completed the story, I almost felt that the book itself read like its many footnotes: interesting, funny, and not completely pertinent; but good nonetheless.When you read Clarke's story, you will be introduced to a world very similar to our own, where magic, once common place, is the stuff of legend. In to this Mr. Norrell is thrust, a be speckled and ill-tempered old scholar who has deliberately and meticulously acquired nearly every book \`of' magic and \`about' magic in the Kingdom. Mr. Norrell, who at times seems to prefer the study of magic to its actual practice, decides that he is the man to bring magic back to England in the service of the crown, in order to defeat Napoleon. This glorious re-introduction leads to Mr. Norrell finding an apt pupil the one Jonathan Strange, and soon the two of them are changing the face of Europe (quite literally in some cases) with their skills. Unfortunately a wide variety of circumstances, events and characters (including a capricious fairy) threatens to tear apart their association, and perhaps all of English magic.All in all, a good read, but a long one; you'll want to see what happens next. . ."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"We started the audiobook on a long trip. I was immediately hooked. My wife, however, immediately went to sleep and asked me how I could listen to something so dull. Later on, even she perked up at several parts. As I listened to the rest on long commutes, she asked me for plot updates every day, though she never had the energy to finish it for herself.Simon Prebble is an amazing reader, and his interpretation is equal parts fairy tale wonder, Masterpiece Theatre, and very dry college professor (reminded me of classic John Cleese). Characters were real, clear and precise. Although many have said reading the footnotes was a chore, he integrated these amazingly well and they added just the right accent to the story, without being overly distracting. There is plenty of humor mixed in the dry places, and I think I would have missed this if reading, rather than listening.I have never read (or listened to) anything like it. The academic, historical style certainly isn't for everybody, and I can see how some pure fantasy, pure history, or pure fairy tale fans might object, because it doesn't really fit into any category very neatly, so it's hard to know what to expect when you first start it. I think this is also reason for the polarity in the reviews. If you read John Grisham, or Harry Potter, you know what you're going to get. With this one, it's a mystery until you try it.So, I thought it was well worth a listen. In the interest of equal time, maybe I can talk my wife into writing a rebuttal."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BOOK. But it is really hard to get into. It took me about 200 pages to just get interested, and at that point I was more determined to finish than actually WANTED to finish....until I got to about page 300. The first 300 weren't horrible, but it was slightly drawn out, and i reluctantly say boring b/c it doesnt accurately represent the rest of the book. If you are willing to put in the time you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I could not put this book down, and was extremely satisfied when I had finished."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a fantasy novel about two magicians (and a nasty thistle-downed-haired fairy) written in the form of a true historical novel, complete with footnotes to clarify the text and/or \\"refer\\" the reader to other sources. It is, if it is your taste, a wonderfully droll and imaginative book. I say, if it meets your taste because a complaint could be made that, when those moments of magic-making appear in the \\"history\\" they too are done with the writer's option of simply stating an historical fact. Some readers might like the writing at these points to \\"soar\\" a bit more than it does with wonder and imagery as the writing would surely do in other more traditional types of fantasy. For instance, when J. Strange brings some corpses to life (to question them) the scene is (to make a pun) almost lifeless, as it would be in a true historical novel. Still that complaint aside, the book is thoroughly readable, very entertaining, and the many pages go by rather swiftly. Oh, one more thing, the type font on the paperback is small and it might be wiser for some to avoid the mass market paperback and obtain another version."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book has a mixture of alternate history, fantasy, romance, and action all rolled into one book. The characters are well developed, and the author has done a wonderful job recreating the battle against Napolean using magic as the main source of defense. I highly recommend this creative & very original novel...it is unlike anything I have read before."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is, without question, a wonderful book. However, I would not reccomend it to you if you are impatient, easily bored/distracted, or looking for an exciting adventure novel. Speaking bluntly, the first 200 pages are really, really boring. I opened the book expecting something like a more sophisticated, 19th century version of Harry Potter, and instead got treated to the tale of a stuffy old magician (who, at the beginning of the story, hardly does any magic at all) trying to make peace with London society.But if your attention span can handle the novel's plodding beginnings, you will be greatly rewarded. This story just keeps getting better and better as it goes along; the plot thickens, new conflicts and characters emerge, and by the last 100 pages, I found that I couldn't put the book down. The author gives us a tantalizing and wholly realistic glimpse into a place that is both a world of historical past and a world of complete fantasy. It left me wanting more, as any good novel should. Overall, I reccomend this book highly to anyone who wants to read it. Believe me, it's well worth reading it in the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Reading not for the faint-of-heart, only due to the lengths at which Susanna Clarke goes to create the historical accuracy and feel for her book. It's long, don't get me wrong, and it feels as though the first several hundred pages are nothing more than character development, but once you allow yourself to be absorbed into the story and become part of it, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In the world of fiction today there are two notable types of writing style. Neither one lesser than the other: The Stacatto, a fast and furious read. Think of Koonz, Brown, Grisham. A perfected modern craft in line with readers modern appetite. J Strange...is not of this ilk. A modern throwback to detailed prosaic writing...but in a modern tone.J Joyce this is not. But embodies a modern style that is simply rich beyond expectations. I for one have to applaud Ms. Clarke for her superb attention to detail and a very well crafted story. The story is simply wonderful and I like to think of it as Harry Potter for adults.Reader, this is not a quick stacatto. We are trained for blasting through texts in our ultra expedient lifestyle. But please, do youself a favor and absorb the diligent world Ms. Clarke has crafted. Read the footnotes (yes there are footnotes) and they are rich, rich, rich.Ms. Clarke, I am eagerly awaiting the sequel. Knowing how much work you put into this novel, I pray I am alive for its release."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The over 3oo,ooo word count is daunting, to say the least. Its pretty good, though. It had these amusing little footnotes throughout the story. Thumbs-up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susannah Clarke has achieved a triumph with this book. Being a person who loves to read just about all things British, especially Tolkien and Beowulf, I was interested in this book because it looked like a new sort of fantasy from the land of the best fantasy writers. Well, it proved to be worth the 20 bucks I spent on it. It is a remarkable cross between the satire of Dickens and Austen and the mythology created by Tolkien and Beowulf. The incorporation of historical characters such as Napoleon, Byron, and the Duke of Wellington enrich an already loaded story with humorous depictions of most of the higher class of Britain. I just hope we'll soon have a sequel that reveals more about John Uskglass and who he truly was. Keep writing, Susannah. Books need an original voice like yours to come along to keep the power of the written word going."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that it's hard to know what to say about it. It's not a page-turner or a fast book, but the writing and atmosphere were so wonderful that it was hard to settle with reading anything else when finished since other books seemed clunkily-done in comparison. It could have been longer and I would have happily kept reading, I hope she writes another."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I received this book as a gift from my mother-on-law for Christmas. I had never heard of it and had no expectations of it, and so I was very pleasantly surprised when I ended up loving it!If you want plot-plot-plot, action-action-action, this is not the book for you. It really is a lot like a Jane Austen book except that many of the characters do magic. The narrative meanders quite a bit and the footnote side trips were probably my favorite parts.I enjoyed the fact that it was quite long, so I didn't have to rush to the end to 'find out what happens.' The ending is a bit dissatisfying, but is a good fit for the book. I loved it, but I can see that it may not appeal to the tastes of many who like fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to most people out there. Despite being a large book (about 800 pages) it is not esoteric and is completely readable (ignoring the time commitment required). The book is very clever and humourous, it integrates real history into a fantastical new history. Suprisingly enough the book is also realistic, not in the subject matter, but in its treatment of characters. It is hard to doubt existence of a Mr.Norrell who hoards all the magic and books that he finds in an attempt to restrict the magic available to any Englishman's hands.The book is about two magicians who manage to bring magic back to England after a 200 year absence. There is Mr.Norrell a cranky old man who wants to be the only magician in England and Jonathan Strange, the younger more likable magician who manages to convince Mr.Norrell to take him on as a pupil. The book deals with a misguided fairy, a nameless black servant, and several charming women who unfortunatly catch the attention of a certain magical being. Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell progress through their learning of magic and provide their magical services to England.The only reason that I didn't rate this book as five stars is that as I was reading I was dissappointed to find that the cleverness and humor (the most enjoyable aspects) died off in the last quarter of the book. They were replaced with quite a bit of well written suspense. In all its a very good book, extremely well written, and definatly worth the time that it takes to read its 800 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I really enjoy reading so the length of this book didnt really concern me. However, I can imagine it would for some. Also, I enjoy English/British humor and storytelling and this is chock-full of references to all things British and jokes aplenty. Ms. Clarke has a winner with this wonderful book, I was engrossed from the first page! Her writing style had me biting my nails in suspence while her dry wit had me laughing. This was a very good investment of my time.I was initially worried because a friend had tried reading this and quit after 200 pages, which from other reviews seems to be the case with many. However, she enjoys fast action and drama of John Grisham novels, which this is not. This is a slow burner, I believe it's meant to be savored, not gulped. Give this book some time. Don't try to read it all in a week."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The book is long but that isn't the problem; the problem is that it feels long. I have to confess i gave up after about 100 pages, but that shouldn't be an objection to a review - after all, does anybody blame you if you stop eating an unappetizing meal?The book: fake Victorian style - appealing at first ('finely wrought', a certain elegance of style) but then tiresome. PS - if I want Victorian style, I'll read one of the Victorians. After all, they lived it, and that shows.The plot - some kind of alternate history of England including magic. It took so long to get off the ground that it drove me slightly batty. I would've given up earlier if not for the desire to finish what I started.In short, I think the lavish praise for this book is just the punditocracy (the journalistic and literary establishment) reacting to the frills of style and the appearance of sophistication."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"No one has mentioned! the major flaw! in the book so here goes! Every freekin character! speaks in breathless! rushes so that I can\`t concentrate on anything! other than the next exclaimation! It seems like every sentence starts with the word, \\"Oh\\", followed by \\" ! \\".\\"OH! I think you should, Mr. Strange!\\"\\"Oh! said Lascelles.\\"\\"Oh! said Drawlight...\\"\\"Oh, that!\\" said Strange\\"Oh!\\" cried Drawlight.All this just on page 224 and 225. Tried plodding thru 800 pages of this dreck!!!! Great reviews, I\`ll give you that, but just so you\`re warned Ms. Clarke\`s writing is dour and relentless!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I just loved this book. It is in my top two and I will probably read it again which I rarely do. The story was really good and the characters were excellent. This author will go far. I can hardly wait for her next novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There are a couple storylines going on in this book and they are not equally compelling. I found most of the parts of the book dealing with Mr. Norrell quickly became tedious and almost put the book down at the beginning, but the events with Jonathan Strange are interesting enough to keep you reading, especially the enchanted imprisonment of his wife and other characters. The author obviously has a wonderful imagination, and it's an impressive ambitious story. Overall the book is a worthwhile read, but be prepared for large chunks of tedium that could easily have been pared down without taking from the storyline."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Be patient the first 150 pages. Those pages are necessary to set the book. Do not skip the footnotes. They are stories within a story, quite enjoyable. I enjoyed reading and listening the cd."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I concur with most reviewers that Susanna Clarke's debut alt-history novel is ingenious and witty, fantastical and humorous. Imagine if Lewis Carrol, Oscar Wilde, and JK Rowling had all written a novel together--that about sums up Jonathan Strange"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"When I was a kid my favorite books my parents read to me were always by Roald Dahl. There was something dark and unsettling in the books, and the worlds these stories took place in seemed so real that you might accidentally fall into them yourself if you awoke during the witching hour.Ive always been interested to find more books that could match this atmosphere, but everything fell short in the end. Then this book came along and it really has captured all of my hopes and more. The characters are complex, their voices are real, the history of this world is rich - I only wish I could see for myself Norrel's library and read some of those books myself.Some minor bothers - I found four typos, and why did the Darkness spell remain after the faeries death, and who was that man Strange saw on the King's Roads? And I thought some of the magic was too easy - you shouldn't be able to move cities with such little effort. But Mrs. Clarke has proven herself to be a well-read theoretical magician so I think I will just take her word for it.As the pages go by the only worry is that this story cannot possibly resolve everything. And of course it doesn't. But it does tie together well, and succeeds in telling an important chapter in these two magician's life. But now I am left without any more to read to find out what happened before and after this story. She said that her next book will take place in the same universe, and I might wish that this book take less than 10 years to write, but then it might not have contained every thing that made this one the best book I have ever read.Thankfully I didn't have to outbid Childermass when purchasing this book. And luckily I was able to finish it before Norrel tried to make it disappear."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book due to the fantastic articles written in the New York Times Book Review, Entertainment Weekly, etc. While this book has incredible detail and constructs an elaborate world, I had to force myself to stay with the plot and continue reading.As a former graduate student, I am used to books that are intricate, scholarly and somewhat dry. Around 500 pages in, however, I gave up on this one. Perhaps, I might return someday to find out what happens. But at the moment, I prefer to spend my time reading something more engaging."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After reading some of the reviews about this novel, I understand that there are people who love it for the writing style and supposed wit. I myself believe that a book on the best seller list should, at the very least, hold some entertainment value for almost everyone. After fighting my way through 300 pages of this cure for insomnia, I cannot for the life of me, understand what makes this book so wonderful. It is page after page after page of the most tedious, uninteresting drabble, occasionally interupted by a rare burst of actual excitement and innovative storyline.. The bursts are too few and far between. Maybe a degree in English lit would make this 10 lb. sedative more appealing, but I for one was greatly disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I made myself finish this book. It was tedious and horribly boring, all 800 pages. I would have much rather read a book about the footnotes because they were much more interesting. This book has about as much magic in it as a chopped onion does. Now I know why it took her ten years to write it; she kept getting bored and forgetting to write more. Why are all these pseudo authors recommending other books in almost all of these reviews? There is a special section for that and it's not in the review box. Yes this book is terrible but using the review area to plug for other books is disrespectful, and not helpful at all to people who are looking for a book review not an advertisement."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Help my english, and still very fun. Even though long, don't seem long. I now will read it again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I agree with the other reviewer - the writer is technically gifted so she deserves at least one star. After all it is her first attempt. But I forced myself to finish this book and lost all patience with her in doing so. The only character for whom I felt even the vaguest of stirrings of empathy was Stephen Black. The book lacked warmth. And she was allowed to be totally self-indulgent with the footnotes, which really grated on my nerves. This is a total shame. This same story could be told well. It simply isn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Another succesful marketing of a LONG novel that really is just ok. It never gets where it wants to go, or I guess I should say that it never took me there. Sort of the DHALGREN of the fantasy/magic genre. But wait this just won the HUGO award for best Science Fiction novel of the year. What?? Science Fiction?? Hey, if HARRY POTTER can win the HUGO then why not this. Hugo Gernsback is spinning in his grave! Some day maybe a science fiction novel will win the HUGO again - but I doubt it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This topic of magic is obviously popular these days from the success of Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter. Afterall its fun, vastly entertaining and when done well full of wonder. The genre is great and i hope it continues.This book is about magic, many spells are cast, but thats it. The writing is tedious, the characters are flat, and the whole narrative stops and starts leaving the reader and the characters hanging. The story has real promise and perhaps a good editor could have streamlined it into something more fluid, but that never happened, possibly because this first time author is a full time editor herself. She obviously dispelled with that part of the process. To say this is on par with Tolkien or Austen is grossly unjust. And to say it was well researched is also shameful. Dont buy into these footnotes. If they were important for the fiction then they should have been woven into the narrative or at least used cleverly and sparingly like Borges.I finished the book, i think out of respect for the tree this massive book was printed on. If you feel compelled to read it get it used. Save a tree."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you liked Harry Potter don't read this book. Over 200 pages into the book and they are still yakking and haven't done anything much to speak about. I did not even finish this book since is was soooo boring."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First, I have to say that I only got through 50 pages of the book. It was slow going from a plot point of view. Also, my 63 year old eyes had GREAT difficulty with the small print. I'm sure it was done to keep down the size of the book - it's over 1000 pages in paperback as it is - but it is very difficult to read. In addition to the small print, the pages are quite faint, making it even more difficult. Perhaps if the plot had been worth it, I might have persevered, but..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Seeing that the book won a Hugo, I was excited to read it. Unfortunately, the cover would be the only time I would be excited over the course of 1000 pages. The prose of the book is very relaxing-- the read really is faster than you'd expect. It's a thousand pages but reads like 500, this is due to the smooth, conversational nature of the writing. The book has a very good nack for the \\"proper Brit\\" of the 1800s. Unfortunately that's all the book has. And the book is hurt by what it doesn't have-- conflict and tension. I don't need action scenes to enjoy a book, but I do need to care, and over the course of the book you're given no reason to care. The \\"villian\\" is hardly villanous, and he has his own plot which doesn't actually meet up with Norrell and Strange till the last 100 pages or so, and even then there is no real fight, just a lot of talking, and not even arguing. The conflict between Strange and Norrell is similarly underwhelming. At some point in time the book becomes Strange's book, no conflict, no sense that Strange's magic is actually \\"perilous\\" the author just forgets about Norrell. Over the course of a thousand pages these simple problems are magnified. There is no pay-off, no tension, no suspense, no real reason to read. The book is uncompelling and below average. It reads smoothly and takes itself very seriously so it gets rated highly. It's nothing new in the book world. If you're looking for a nice fantasy fix, I'd look somewhere else, to Jim Butcher, or to Laurell K Hamilton."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The premise of this book is quite good. However, the writing style is undeniably British. None of the main characters are particularly sympathetic, nor are motivations well explored. Some of the smaller characters are interesting and sympathetic, but my favorite of them just vanished in the middle of the book with no explanation whatsoever. Even the ones that don't per se vanish, like Lord Byron, appear to be randomly thrown in to provide a bit of color to the incredibly dull protagonists and don't seem to really advance the storyline. I read it all the way through because I couldn't believe that a book with the reviews that this one is getting wouldn't get better, but it didn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This review is not so much for the novel itself, which I enjoy greatly. Simon Prebble's reading is very entertaining and adds to the flavor and atmosphere of the story. I especially liked how he enhanced the personalities of Vinculous and the Gentleman with the Thistle-down Hair.HOWEVER, I have a couple of issues with the quality of the CD and packaging.This is a long book and therefore has lots of disks. The external box contains five or six internal CD booklets, each of which holds several individual CDs. The spines of each of these booklets are completely undifferentiated from one another. There is no way to know which of these booklets has the specific disk you want other than flipping through each of them. The outer box is proving to be flimsy as well. After only one listening, the outer box is already starting to tear and the tabs that close the box on either end don't seem to want to stay closed anymore.Here is my biggest beef with the audio version. There appears to be no thought as to the audio layout. Most disks do not end at the end of a chapter. The reading abruptly stops mid-chapter with no notice. There is no musical interlude to let the listener know the CD has ended; the reading is simply cut off and my disk player switches to another disk.I greatly enjoy the story and highly recommend it. This audio version, while entertaining, is poorly designed and constructed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Starnge and Mr. Norell is one of the few books I would rate 'classy'. I bought it after hearing that it was \\"Harry Potter\\" for adults. Thats as inaccurate as anyone could be abut the book. If you want to read something like Harry Potter then this is not the book. Its a book which has a lot of magic but the drama, the language , the style are what makes it a good book. This book is for you if are looking for a good book and not if you just want a 'magic book' (I guess we will have to wait for Rowling to get a 'good magic book')"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is all a good book should be: beautifully written, intelligent, fun, impossible to put down. It is not really that similar to Harry Potter (which I also enjoyed), it's more similar to victorian british literature, crossed with historical fiction, with some magic thrown in. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I never finished this book. It was just too dull. Mr. Norrell is a thoroughly unpleasant character and it's a full 100 pages before the somewhat more interesting and likeable Jonathan Strange shows up. But by then the damage was done and I simply couldn't get into the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm not going to leave an elaborate review as I'm still reading but so far this book is very engaging. Humor is dry, but amusing. Book reads increadibly well and for those that like magic, 19th cent. England, British humor, the book is an enjoyable one. I plan on keeping it on the bookshelf for when my kids are old enough to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Ms. Clarke is a tremendous writer who can conjur up humor in any situation via her perfect use of words and language. I find myself smiling several times each page although there are very few true humourous scenes in the book. Rarely do I enjoy a book largely because of the writing (e.g. John Irving), usually modern authors are way over the top, but Ms. Clarke never takes herself or her characters too seriously and the book speeds along, even at 800 or so pages. My only regret is that we may have to wait another 10 years for more books from Ms. Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I let this book sit on my bookshelf for about two years before I finally read it. I'm ashamed to admit that I was somewhat turned off by its immense size -- I kept thinking of how the act of holding the book while reading was going to activate my carpal tunnel, and I wished I could have divided it into four smaller volumes just for ease of holding.My physical ailments aside, I'm so glad I finally decided to start this book, because I just loved it. I loved the formal dialogue and gentle pacing, and I sort of found it jarring when I'd finish reading for the evening, and have to return to the \\"real world\\". I enjoyed getting lost in old England. I also loved the footnotes, which were full of fun stories or just entertaining information. The dry humour was unexpected and appreciated.If there'd been a sequel, I would have immediately run out and purchased it when I finished reading. As it was, the book I read after this seemed so thin and shallow and disappointing. It was like eating an Oreo after having a slice of chocolate ganache cake."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is largely a dual biography of the two named characters, English magicians of the Napoleonic period who are at various times rivals, friends, and enemies. Their story is told against a fictional history of England in which Northern England was ruled for centuries by John Uskglass, the Raven King, a great magician who ruled kingdoms both in England and Faerie. Uskglass inspired generations of English magicians, and details and anecdotes of these are found both in the text and the whimsical footnotes.English magic in this book has an impressive history, but by the era of Mr Norrell all English students of magic have for around 250 years been just that - students with knowledge of theoretical and historical magic, but no ability to cast the meanest spell. Norrell changes that when he makes the statues of York Cathedral speak and becomes the first true English magician of the modern era. He remains the only one until the young son of a minor landowner, Jonathan Strange, discovers his own remarkable talents.Norrell and Strange are very different men and magicians. Norrell is obsessed with dominating magic, and tries to drive any potential rivals away, not reassured by the fact that his own abilities are so superior as to render any true rivalry impossible. His skill is fueled by his unparalleled library of magical literature. With limited access to Norrell's great library, even after becoming his student, Strange is forced to rely more on his creativity and imagination.The story is told in a style deliberately reminiscent of the British novels of the era - for reasons I can't quite explain, it seems especially suggestive of Thackeray. Like a real Victorian novel it is long, and occasionally the plot moves more slowly than in most modern fantasies, but the skillful writing and striking characters more than make up for any pacing difficulties.It's a pleasure, and entirely too rare, to find a really original fantasy which owes no debt - absolutely none - to Tolkien's rings, wizards, and hobbits. In that sense, this book reminds me of some of John Crowley's work, but is, I think, much more successful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke literally creates a fascinating alternate universe to 19th century England. Her work reads like a thorough study of the time written in the prose of the period. This is, in fact, its primary downfall. The language is so rich (with purposeful alternate spellings and a host of footnotes) that it reads like an over the top dessert. The mind almost drowns in the words of this book. As for plot, it is a rather singular study of two \\"magicians\\" and their impact on the government of England and families of the elite in whose circles they navigate.At more than 700 pages, the book is not for the light reader. There are complexities which are revealed that may be lost on anyone without a smattering of understanding of English culture or history. The madness of King George, Wellington's view on the Napoleanic war and the class system in England are all touched upon in Clarke's work. This is in addition to a created mythology surrounding northern English folktales and lore.Ms. Clarke's work is slow. It unwinds much as real life might, with periods of little activity and not much plot development. Many of her critical characeters exist in only the barest sketch of detail, while several ancilliary persons are well fleshed out and detailed. I found this inconsistency frustrating as I frequently wanted to know more about some individuals and found myself invested in lesser characters. The two characters who most struck me for their portrayals were Jonathan Strange, the upstart magician, and a servant, Stephen Black. It was the latter character who evoked the greatest symapthy and connection (or connexxion - as Ms. Clarke woud write it). Black's struggle between duty and desire was both relevant and real. I commend Ms. Clarke for capturing this so well in her text.If you are prepared for a deep and detailed work which will likely lead one to further read about the period - by all means take up this book. However, be warned - there are few shallow spots upon which to rest."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have recently finished listening to this book on CD and everytime I put it on I was transported to old England. I had attempted to read this book a couple of times but would get a little bored so I decided to listen. The narrator sounds a lot like Anthony Hopkins and does such a good job of telling this story with hundreds of characters, voices, and footnotes you'd think you'd get lost. But it is an amazing story! Give it a listen!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In 1806, while England is under attack by Napoleon and English magic has been dead for centuries, theoretical magical scholars discover a single practical magician: Mr. Norrell, whose debut makes statues sing and disbands the society of theoretical magicians. Soon, a second practical magician introduces himself to Norrell: his name is Jonathan Strange. Strange studies under Norrell, and together they begin to restore magic to England. However, the two men disagree on all points--none more so than the role of John Uskglass, the Raven King, the last and perhaps most influential magician in England. Their magical growth, partnership, struggles, and competing views on the Raven King make up this book which defies genres: part fantasy, part noir, part history text (complete with footnotes), part satire, Clarke has an incredibly unique writing style and creates a book that is lengthy, filled with magic and antiheros, and exists entirely and unapologetically within its own reality. Strange & Norrell is a lengthy, slow read, but undeniably well plotted and written. If for no other reason, I recommend it for being one of the most unique books I have ever read.The greatest drawback to this book is its size. Admittedly, it is only 800 pages, which is long but not unreasonable. However, the printed book is gigantic, especially the hardcover edition. The mass of this text makes it seem all the longer, as does the unusual writing style, which is meandering and has footnotes that can sometimes take up pages in and of themselves. All of these factors make up a book which is a long, slow read. I never became enraptured, and until the last 100 pages never felt anxious to sit down and read large chunks of text in one sitting. I'm a fast reader, but this book still took me two weeks.However, as a part of the writing style, this lengthy, slow storytelling appears to be intentional and is part of the book's overall style. As for the style: I've never read anything like it. The characters are almost universally antiheros, the writing is dry and regards the characters and events with a removed, wry eye, and the book includes footnotes that explain, in the tradition of academic writing, details and stories that are mentioned in passing in the text. All of this makes absolutely no reference to our world--that is, our own history. The style is distinctive, unapologetic, and both darkly humorous and, on some levels, meaningful and realistic.The plot meanders from war to learning to old magic, the book reads slowly, the characters are as painfully irritating as they are lovable, and there has never been a book like this. Illustrated in black and white, the book also reads like it is in black and white: stylized, unique, intentional, and at the same time irreverently meaningful. The style is the highlight and creative force of the text. I don't know if this is a book for all readers, but I do recommend it. Pick it up, read the first chapter, and see if Clarke's unusual world and unique style appeals to you. If it does, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I finished rereading this book today after the first time a few years ago, and I must say that I'm even more impressed now than I was after the first read.This book, more than others, I think, will be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing. Set in an alternate Britain, it follows the revival of magic propelled by the fussy Mr. Norrell and the bold Jonathan Strange. The plot is perhaps the most original thing I've read in a long, long time, weaving real history with the convincing tale of magic's rebirth.Clarke is a master of words. Her humor is dry and impeccable, reminding me of Rowling and Austen (perhaps a British thing?). Every chapter had something that made me smile, if not laugh out loud. Her characterization, which is aided quite a bit by her humor, is remarkable as well. I came to be just as agitated at Mr. Norrell as many of the secondary characters were, and I enjoyed reading about her villain, a malicious and pretty hysterical fairy, more than anything else in the book.I admit, despite all that, many will be turned off by this book. At times the book really feels like it isn't going anywhere, though, for me, Clarke's writing alone made up for any lulls in the plot. Her sense of humor probably isn't for everyone. But hopefully, you'll get as wrapped up as I did in this history-that-never-happened, enchanted until the last page which will leave you begging for more."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A marvelous work, a Harry Potter saga for adults (not that adults cannot enjoy Harry Potter, as I do very much, but it is a bit much for the typical 12 year old). Rich in description and plot and wonderful footnotes that are worth the price of the book all by themselves!This is no breezy read, both long and complex - something to soak in for a couple hours at a time in a comfortable chair."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've never reviewed a book on Amazon, but this book compels me to do so. It was unlike anything I've ever read. Part historical fiction, part fantasy. It had humor, great characterization and the story was well paced and interesting. I'm an avid reader and actually prefer longer books, but usually by the end I'm ready for it to end. Not so with this book. I dragged the last 50 pages out so it wouldn't be over. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's interesting to read the comments here. JS&MN; absolutely blew me away. I didn't want it to end. I can't wait for the sequel. And I really can't wait for the movie (s). So I'm surprised to find that not everyone loved it, and in fact, some people utterly hated it so much that they gave up after a couple hundred pages.The most common complaints if I have it right: too slow and boring, Mr. Norrell and Jonathan Strange not likeable and/or traditionally heroic, Mr. Strange takes forever to appear, feats of magic presented as commonplace, story aimless, pointless, meandering, too many secondary characters of little or seemingly no consequence, Jane Austen-ish, Dickensian prose not appropriate. In short: a stuffy, dull, pretentious, overlong slog.Even many of those who liked or loved the book seem to concede that it takes a while to get moving. Personally, I found Volume 1, focusing on Mr. Norrell's efforts to responsibly re-introduce magic to England, to be gripping and Susanna Clarke's careful, considered construction of her awesomely imagined, alternative England to be a strength, not a weakness. The premise is irresistible. Magic exists in Victorian England, but no one practices it anymore except miserly, Scrooge-like Mr. Norrell, who has hoarded virtually all of the important books of magic in existence. The reader knows things cannot go on like this forever, that Norrell is tempting fate and headed for a fall. Naturally, there will be others who will threaten his prized collection of books and challenge his supremacy as the sole practicioner of English magic, and we can guess, based on the title, that his chief nemesis will be none other than Jonathan Strange. This understanding creates great tension and expectation in the reader. Who is Jonathan Strange? Where is he? When will he arrive? How will Mr. Norrell react? Strange, before he ever physically appears, haunts the first volume and Mr. Norrell like some mythological figure, and Clarke teases out this tension masterfully.Did I like Mr. Norrell? No. His actions often infuriated me. But he is not all bad. He sincerely wants to legitimize English magic and his repressed passion for this cause, is, ironically, contagious. The reader roots for him to loosen his grip on his monopoly, share his wisdom. He is a fascinatingly selfish, spiteful character in the tradition of Ebenezer Scrooge - his own worst enemy - and Clarke writes him in such a way that, despite his faults, one holds out hope for his redemption.Strange is even more complex. Thankfully, he isn't impossibly handsome or darkly mysterious (at least not at first). He's actually rather average, if just a little bit \\"off.\\" He starts out as a gentleman, respectable, with an \\"ironic smile,\\" someone who better fits polite society's image of a practicing magician than Mr. Norrell. Despite their many differences they share one important thing in common - they are both ordinary men grappling with extraordinary forces that they deceive themselves they can ever fully understand on their own.Too cluttered with secondary characters? Who? Drawlight, Lascelles, Childermasss, Vinculus, Arabella, Lady Pole, Lord Wellington, and even the King of England? All of them play some vital role in moving the story forward or fleshing out the general atmosphere, and Clarke brings each of these characters to life with great humor, compassion, and at times, a devilish, or fairie-ish, sense of mischief. (One pictures Clarke biting her lip to keep from grinning as she pens Drawlight in particular.) Part of the fun in reading the novel is in envisioning which actors will play these great character parts in the film.Like many of the best novels, JS&MN; boasts a subplot that could easily stand by itself - the tragicomic coupling of the cheerfully amoral fairie The Gentleman With The Thistledown Hair and the proud, put-upon black servant Stephen Black, held captive under the fiendish, if well-meaning Gentleman's enchantment. The Gentleman has the potential to be a breakout character much like Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. Someone on IMDB suggested Jude Law. I could see that.Clarke's depiction of magic, to me, was refreshing, authentic, and completely believable. Her decisions are impeccable. She's never groping or going on autopilot like the writers of standard fantasy. Her choices always seem inspired, organic, original. In so many fantasy books, magic is everywhere and therefore familiar. Here, at least in the first volume, it is rare and, as a result, exhilarating. Clarke is a visually inventive writer and her imagination is so rich that in the process of writing a great novel she has also written what should make a major motion picture. The imagery of the third volume, where magic is now exploding all over England, is staggering.JS&MN; has been criticized for trying to be too many things: Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Patrick O'Brian during the battle scenes, JK Rowling, JRR Tolkien. It doesn't try to be many things, it is many things. As all great novels should be. It's not labeling itself, and I think that's why some hardcore fantasy fans are left cold. It's a safe bet that most fantasy fans are not into the works or writing style of Jane Austen. JS&MN; may not be a work of genius, and it may not be the greatest English novel of the past 70 years as Neil Gaimen has claimed. (Who has read all of the English novels of the last 70 years?) But it is great storytelling, a brilliant expansion of The Sorcerer's Apprentice idea. And Susanna Clarke is one hell of a sorcerer.Another contributr here remarked \\"Brilliant but not for everyone.\\" What brilliant is?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Recommended by a grad school literature professor, this book became a favorite before I had read even a hundred pages. Not merely a story but a universe of perpetually astonishing sophistication, complexity, and authenticity. I can only wonder how long Ms. Clarke must have inhabited this universe, plot points and characters weaving themselves in reveries at leisurely afternoon teas. I'd love for her write one of the peripheral books of magic (apparently fully realized in her mind) that play such an active role in the story... perhaps Lanchester's \\"Language of Birds\\"?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I got it as a birthday gift. In recent times with two children, it has been almost impossible for me to read anything serious, but I ended up reading this 1000-odd page book within a week! Set in the beginning of the 19th century, it starts off full of the atmosphere of old England (York) - where gentlemen were what they ought to be ;-) and there was a \\"propah\\", unhurried way of doing things.After Harry Potter (which also I loved, especially the first and last books) I wondered whether there could be anything \\"new\\" in a magic/fantasy type novel - I was quite wrong! This book is quite different in its dealing with magic and writing style, and has its own brand of \\"magical\\" atmosphere.The author's evocative descriptions of \\"the Other Lands\\" - or magical neighbouring lands of England, takes the reader into those lands. While reading it, I felt transported to York, and London and Faerie (land where Fairies live), and the land of \\"Lost hope\\", and Venice, and any place the characters chose to go. Skillfully interwoven with magic is the practical use of magic: unlike in Harry Potter, where the magicians live in a world of their own and rarely mix with \\"muggles\\", here, magicians are just normal human beings who have chosen to study magic and practice it as a career. Just like someone trains to be a doctor, or wild-life warden, or whatever!The writing style is not only evocative, but also direct and simple. There are some quaint spellings like \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\" and \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" - but these only add to the old world character of the novel. Characters are drawn well and stay consistent throughout their \\"life\\".I particularly loved:- the concept of magically recovering the \\"essence\\" of a person long dead, from the legacy they left behind.- the build-up for the Raven King, and how his magic uses everything in nature (stones, river, trees..).- the concept of the King's roads leading naturally between England and Faerie, and entering such a road via a mirror.I will say no more of the story, read for yourself!The only negative about the novel contents, I thought was the rather long foot notes (some of which cover 3/4's of the page)! Another minor negative was the small print size - not the sort of \\"easy read\\" typeset I am used to nowadays!It has its share of war descriptions, quiet but potent violence, and death - so not recommended if you are particularly affected by such stuff.Apart from that, I would say it is definitely worth owning / gifting. Quite a classic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's novel transgresses the boundaries of Victorian literary fiction, fantasy, and the historical novel. As a fan of some of the Victorians myself, I found Clarke's imitation of their writing style and novelistic structure to be quite precise. Her concerns with the human soul, with survival after death, and with the struggle of good and evil within a human being are both modern and typical of the 19th century.The reader slowly walks into a world that is partly familiar and partly quite bizarre. It's the English drawing-room, calling-card era, with the overlay of magic, an art that is allegedly long forgotten. Clarke's mock-scholarly footnotes are charming.However, the book takes just a bit too long to get started and to invite the reader in."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After wandering all the King's Roads, being shewn Every Possible Magic Phenomena No Matter How Tiny, and just when my eyelids were starting to close like flames being extinguished from a gaslamp, I finally cast a spell for myself of *Courage & Muster (*\\"Courage & Muster\\" appeared in the 1135 publication of Lawrence Musseltree's The Reckoning of Things to Come) to give myself the strength to carry on. When one finally reaches the Tower of Immpenetrable Darkness the story does actually pick up and I truly did enjoy the ending. Even if it was a long, long, long journey."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't think this book can be called an adult Harry Potter. There is nothing similar except for the fact that they are both fantasies.The author created really good characters with their own quirks and ambitions. In some chapters, it is so fun to watch them interact. The author also sets up a tantalizing mystery that draws the reader in. After reading page after page, the book doesn't go anywhere! I felt so cheated that the author made me waste my time waiting for something to be revealed.This book is well written with great characters, but I can't take the slow pace for 800 pages! There is no payoff for the effort it takes to finish the book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Based on the standard of 5 stars = classic, 4 stars = excellent, 3 stars = good, 2 stars = fair, and 1 star = poor, this book gets 2 stars.The period detail, description and world-building is quite excellent, but the novel is plagued by slow pacing, a meandering plot, and flat and unsympathetic characters.If you require deep character development and/or a gripping storyline this is probably not for you. In this book, the prose and the world building are the stars. For some, that will be enough. I wanted to care more than I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I had great hopes for this book, as it dealt with magic and the supernatural, but as I read this I kept hoping there was a point to everything. The book just kept on and on. I have been more engrossed with other books of similar length, with the wish that they would not end. Not with this book, I couldn't wait for the book to end, but it just never did. Even when I got to the end, I kept asking, what was the point?, Why did it take sooooo long to get to the end???? I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am a great sci-fi magic fan, but there are many more interesting books out there than this. Huge disappointment!!!! Her short stories, 'The Ladies of Grace Adieu' is better. Not sooooo long winded. A big disappointment for a lover of fantasy and sci-fi."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I read reviews on this book and couldn't wait for paperback so I bought the hardcover full price - mistake. I am AMAZED at how many people actually liked this book. It was full of promise, the premise was good and yes, it was creative. But it was so painful to get through from begining to end. The characters were flat and did not come alive for me at all. It lacked emotion and was detached and cold. I couldn't wait for it to end so that I could start something else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of the finer fantasy novels to appear in recent decades. With a mature sense of humor and keen literary style, if avoids both the pomposity of contemporary high fantasy, and silliness of contemporary humourous fantasy. For the first time in many years, we have a truly beautiful fantasy novel to add to our bookshelves. Clarke adds comical and sometimes extensive footnotes that give a mock-scholarly feel as well as relieve tension (but you'll notice they appear less often near the climax). Her treatment of magic is subtle and tasteful, and her characters lifelike but interesting. Is it too long? No. If you think so, go buy yourself an attention span or a cheap Piers Anthony story and leave this serious, beautiful, and mysterious novel to the grown-ups."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Great book -- Clarke weaves a story in the style of Jane Austen but makes magic the centerpiece. She has you wondering whether magic really has been an area of academic concern for centuries!It may sound goofy (considering the ample amount of pages), but I would have liked another 300 pages! The end came too soon!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you enjoy the writing of Jane Austen or Henry Fielding you will enjoy this book. Wry, engaging, full of thoroughly interesting characters, and English from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If Dickens had ever written fantasy, he might have produced a work like this. Clarke's style owes a great deal to Dickens, including her way of giving little background stories on the various characters - Jonathan Strange's manservant Jeremy Johns, for example. She is happy to provide footnotes of reference to the reader, of the history of magic and the life of the mysterious John Uskglass, also known as the Raven King, a human abducted by fairies as a child who returned as an adult to rule the North of England for 300 years.The names invoke Dickens as well; where Dickens gave us such names as Chuzzlewit, Pecksniff, Trotwood, Nickleby, and Headstone, Clarke delights with Greysteel, Sixsmith, Drawlight, Godbless, Childremass, and more.Unlike all other modern writers I've read, Clarke doesn't put modern-day people into 19th-century settings. Her characters ARE of the 19th century, with customs and ways of thinking intact. Even the spellings are accurate - \\"chuse\\", \\"surprize\\", \\"any thing\\", and a few I didn't know, such as \\"headach\\". Her language is perfect; her characters don't have a trace of the modern era about them.As with other readers, I didn't want to read this book too quickly, even though I was dying to know what came next. It's simply too good to rush through, and Clarke's language is so eloquent that it must be savored.I can only assume that Clarke has read all of the works of Dickens; the truth about Vinculus echoes one of the themes in Dickens' novel \\"Barnaby Rudge\\". It's rather like viewing a familiar landscape, one seen many times before, through the eyes of another. Dickens, too, used Venice as a backdrop (in \\"Little Dorrit\\"); Clarke's London is the same as his.This may well be the best modern novel I've ever read. More, please!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"For those seeking a long engrossing book which is entertaining as well as being challenging to the intellect, I heartily recommend Susannah Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell. Yes, it is very long--a positive aspect for me, as it puts off the chore of finding another book--and it uses a style of language which some may find vexingly archaic. I LOVED it! Give me vexingly archaic any day, so long as it is flawlessly executed, which this is. A lively cast of characters, amusing anecdotes, and much vivid historical detail is only part of the charm--in addition, the author brings us a dark and Byronic--Lord Byron is actually a character in the novel--world within a world: the magical world of the Raven King. Not only engrossing but enchanting!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Mr. Norrell has kept to his library for years studying and practicing magic until he is invited to become a member of a magicians' society in York. When Mr. Norrell shows his power he reveals himself to be England's first practical magician in hundreds of years and sets out to be his country's savior from Napolean. Everything goes according to plan until he makes a deal with an otherworldly gentleman only called \\"the gentleman with thistledown hair\\" who sets in motion a magical plot that could bring down the monarchy. Another wrinkle in his plan happens when he takes on a flashy young gentleman, called Jonathan Strange, as his apprentice whom he loves dearly but can't control.Susanna Clarke's \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is an amusing, but way too long, romp through an alternate history of the Napoleonic Wars and English fairy and magical lore. The characters are vivid, the story is compelling, and the depth of background in her alternate history is breathtaking. The problem is that she crammed too much in. Footnotes on backstory and amusing anecdotes about fairy lore are helpful in understanding up to a point, but after 500 pages I thought she was just trying to cram in things the editor would normally have cut out of the text of the story itself. A couple of times I just got tired and put the book away. This is why I give it a three instead of a four.Having said that this book is definitely worth reading. You just have to have a lot of patience. The last 200 hundred pages flew right by."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Strange & Norrell is a surprisingly good and enjoyable fantasy book. It's not your typical fantasy with elves & hobbits and the like, but rather a history of England in the early 1800s with two competing magician personalities. Jonathan Strange is outgoing and experimental, whereas his mentor, Mr. Norrell is cautious and conservative with his magic. There are numerous subplots and extensive footnotes, the book reads almost like a history ( I mean this as a compliment.)The book is quite long, but very readable and never tiresome. Despite all of the characters, one is able to keep them all straight as we zip between different settings. The beginning of the novel concentrates on Norrell's introduction of magic and it's limited uses against Napoleon. Later, a rival magician and Norrell's apprentice, Jonathan Strange goes to Spain and uses magic in a more unconventional fashion battling Napoleon's army.The two inevitably have a falling out and more magic consumes the novel in the last third of the book. Despite it's length, I really enjoyed the book and found no tedium whatsoever. Fantasy is usually not my cup of tea, but this is not your typical fantasy novel, in some respects it's in a class of its own"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norris resurrects the genre of Victorian romantic horror once dominated by books such as Frankenstein or the Picture of Dorian Grey. Clarke manages to create a world that is dark and moody where people cross the boundaries of British social strata and enter into the fantastic.The book is written with Jane Austin sensibilities annotated with scholarly anecdotes footnoted throughout. Magic becomes a philosophical exercise presented like the 19th century musing's on scientific discovery. Clarke's use of language completes the mood and adds a richness not often seen in modern literary works. Don't expect quick and hasty prose or MTV generation descriptions. This work is close to 800 extremely well crafted pages. Don't expect Harry Potter either."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you're considering reading this, DO!

Set in a historical period in which Britain was in constant peril, this book shows life in the trenches, in the country, and in the city. More then just describing the settings of each, the crucial element is the interaction between the people and the magical persons.I personally enjoyed the level of corruption which kept bubbling to the surface as almost everyone tries to take advantage.The only donside is the length.

As others have said, I agree that it is very easy to put the book down before Mr. Strange is introduced as the story seems to drag a bit up to that point. However, once the interplay between the two magicians begins, it is a very compelling story, in my opinion.

I was continually struck by the sheer power of her prose and her flawless recreation of the written and spoken language of the time. To sustain such a voice through hundreds of pages is in itself a great feat. However, Clarke also invokes an imposing and stunning world of English history and magic that is completely convincing and detailed in it's vision (the footnotes are incredible). Besides it's a truly gripping story.I keep reading reviews that compare it to the Harry Potter series, but the work is so utterly different that comparing the two is like comparing a go-cart to a Farrarri, it just shouldn't be done.

Clarke does a fantastic job creating a tradition of magic--largely via footnotes--in England intertwined with the history of the country. I did some background checks to try and figure out who was real and who was fictional. Through their adventures Strange and Norrell encounter Sir Walter Scott, Lord Wellington, and Lord Byron to name but a few. At close to 800 pages with a very small font, this is a book you really have to commit to spending some time with. But, it is time well spent and the story and characters will stay with you for a long time. This has been called by more than one reviewer \\"Hogwarts (or H.P.) for adults\\". One reviewer commented that it fails because it does not have the clear delineation of good and evil present in H.P. or other fantasy literature. This I feel is one of the book's strengths: it overcomes one this simplistic weakness of good characters vs. bad characters seemingly inherent in much genre fiction . Like Le Carre's genre-busting novel _The Spy Who Came In From the Cold_, JS&MN paints the world (magical and otherwise) as a morally complex place where good and bad exist in the same people. This is just one aspect of the novel. There is so much more here. Currently at number three on the NYTBS list, this novel deserves all the critical and commercial success that has been poured upon it. I do not think it is too much to say that this novel will be read for years."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This novel has brilliant passages but is insufferable. The book weaves together three narrative strands: a magical fantasy that runs about 250 pages; a romantic ode to English Literature embedded within an English period piece, about 300 pages; and a detailed bedding of footnotes and fully fleshed back stories, which occupy the remainder of this 782 page colossus. The narrative is buried under the depredations of the artsy and self-indulgent writing of the first-time author.The overall story of the only two magicians in Napoleonic England is actually somewhat interesting, even amid the irritating and uneven weaving of these disparate narrative tracks. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell struggle to restore magic without understanding their power, the world of faery, and the moral challenges that power brings. The result should be a tragedy and a riveting tale.Instead, stylistic conceits get in the way of the story. As the book nears an end, and the reader wishes to engage with Jonathan Strange's struggles to fight an adversary and rescue his wife, we get strained homage to English Literature rather than story. We get Strange's letters, or the story shifts to the viewpoint of a Doctor, a latecomer to the long book. We get Lord Byron. In fact, we the reader get anything except direct narrative. It becomes clear that the author has learned a great many writing tricks from reading Jane Austen and others, and wishes to include each of these stylistic conceits somewhere in this one book.As a reader, the urge to stop reading is powerful, the lost narrative threads become more and more difficult to pick up, the story recedes behind the authorial over-writing, and the reader stops giving a damn about Norrell, Strange, wives, Byron, and even, incredibly, about magic. What starts as a must read and a possible work of fantastical art, dims into the tedious. A more incisive telling would be shorter, better, and more worthy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The pseudo-scholarly, pseudo-gossipy tone of the book is wonderfully captured in this description of Lord Byron, offered by magician Strange: \\"I found his lordship at his pretty villa upon the shores of the lake. He was not alone. There was another poet called Shelley, Mrs. Shelley and another young woman-a girl really-who called herself Mrs. Clairmont and whose relationship to the two men I did not understand. If you know, do not tell me. Also present was an odd young man who talked nonsense the entire time-a Mr. Polidori.\\"Almost 680 pages of the 780 odd page book proceeds in such a fashion: all is a leisurely tour through the Victorian world, rendered scholarly by carefully attributed (fictional) quotes and a plethora of content footnotes (also fake). The topic is magic, real magic, and the interactions of the title characters with the world of Faerie. Norrell and Strange have brought real magic back to England, pursuing spell-casting and casting aside the generations of \\"theoretical magicians,\\" who preceded them - men who never cast a magic spell but devoted themselves to scholarly debates over the attributes of past magicians and their works.One of Norrell's first spells, as a side effect, establishes contact with the world of Faerie and its reigning king, a creature who has a curious sense of morality and a very limited understanding of human desires and human behavior. After we have spent several hundred pages chuckling at this gentleman from the other world, including his amazing interaction with the insane King George III, it occurs to us that he is quite dangerous. He is not malicious, but his moral code is incompatible with our concern for human health, life and safety. The last hundred pages give us all the dramatic tension deliberately left out of the earlier pages, as Strange (and finally Norrell) must conduct a magic battle with this king, a battle for which they are, to be honest, rather ill-equipped.The plot, again, is merely a plot, a necessary element in the construction of a novel. The point is the satire: directed at scholarly habits and all who have ever deemed themselves scholars; directed at the Victorian world; directed, very likely, at modern witches. Susanna Clarke incorporates enough information on folklore and real Magic into her piece to convince me that she knows quite well who she is poking fun at-and to leave me wishing I knew exactly who might be her targets. She treats us all as she treats Byron and the unfortunate Mrs. Clairmont, and I, for one, found it great fun to be on the receiving end of her veiled barbs."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Do not believe the pathetic reviewers who have come before me saying they couldn't care about the characters. What book were they reading? Are they so used to \\"villains\\" and \\"heroes\\" that they can't care about interesting but flawed characters? The novelist Ms. Clarke is most like in my opinion is Thackeray. She views her characters from a slight distance, highlighting all their hypcrisies and flaws, but lovingly. I have read a great many novels in the last few years that attempt to reproduce the 18th or early 19th century in tone as well as in setting, and this is the FIRST one I thought successful. If you like Fielding, Austen and Thackeray, you'll love this book. If you like whipping through bestsellers you pick up at your local Target, don't insult this book by trying to read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a fine piece of literature by newcomer Susanna Clarke.It's difficult to break new ground in the tired genre of fantasy, where a comparison to Tolkien often seems more a marketing ploy to attract readership than a tribute to style or story. However, after reading the first couple of pages of Strange & Norrell, I was hooked. Nearly 800 pages later, when I closed the cover for the last time, I was gratified and satisfied.Immense in scope (10 years in the writing), the backdrop of Strange & Norrell is 19th century England, the story a sort of alternate reality in which two practical magicians (as opposed to those who only read about magic) endeavor to bring back magic to England. Not only is Clarke's style refreshing, her tale is original, and she relates it engagingly. The two title characters are rather stuffy Englishmen, but Clarke contrasts them nicely, and the reader will often root first for one and then the other as the plot unfolds, like a labyrinth filled with dead ends, traps, portcullises and a variety of surprises. All of the secondary and tertiary characters are colorful and, as in theatre where there are no small roles merely small actors, none are superficial to the story. Yet for all of Clarke's storytelling talent there was something that kept me from fully identifying with either of the protagonists. I never seemed fully able to immerse myself in the story; I seemed only able to watch events unfold from outside the confines of the tale. It is for this reason alone that I was unable to award five stars to Strange & Norrell.Although some readers may find Clarke's use of old English trying (shew instead of show, etc.), I found the technique lent a flavor of authenticity to her tale. Ms. Clarke's narrative is nearly flawless, teeming with evocative descriptions spanning from the macabre (the stone statue that several hundred years previously had witnessed the murder of a young girl and was suddenly gifted with the power of speech so that it might scream out its anguish is akin to something Poe might've written) to humorous, ranging from deadpan to hilarious. The description of an unshaven doughy-faced man - \\"He had shaved himself with no very high degree of skill and here and there on his white face two or three coarse black hairs appeared - rather as if a family of flies had drowned in the milk before the cheese was made and their legs were poking out of it\\" - had me chuckling, while several exchanges between Stephen and the gentlemen with the thistledown hair - \\"Burnt, sir! I hope no one was hurt!\\" \\"Well, some people were. The strong, young men were able to run out of the conflagration in time, but the older, enfeebled members of the family, the women and infants were all burnt to death\\" - had me laughing aloud.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a wonderful first novel, and Susanna Clarke is to be applauded. Oh yes, and comparisons to Tolkien and Rowling are unfounded - in the future perhaps it will be Susanna Clarke with whom many aspiring fantasy writers will be compared."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Lets make two things clear right away. This book does what it does brilliantly. What it does is not typical of genre fiction, and certainly not any sort of Harry potter-esque story.This is a story of characters, of in-depth quirky people interacting and plotting and joking and doing all the things that people who don't live in Middle Earth or go to Hogwarts actually do. This is a story of setting, fo an alternate Britain brilliantly realized. This is a story of magic, both the scholarly kind and a deeper, wild fey kind. It is a story of high society and all its foibles. It is a story of myth and history and how they interact. It is all of these things, and it is brilliant. Norrell and Strange are stunningly well realized, but so are the supporting characters, from cynical servant Childermass to the delightfully terrifying Gentleman with the Thistledown hair, to real history figures Duke of Wellington and lor Byron. The setting is fascinating, and the magic never fails to feel enchanting and mysterious. Points in this book made me laugh out loud, and others made me shiver with the sheer strangeness of it all.It is not a story driven by a plot. It is not a page turner. It is not action packed. You do not race from page to page, eager to unravel the mystery which will build to a grand showdown between good and evil. The last 100 pages are gripping, but almost entirely devoid of battle. There are plot twists and mysteries, but they do not drive the story, nor are they the main focus of most of the book.Thats what this is. if you buy this book expecting Harry Potter with bigger words, you will be disappointed. if you read the first chapter and think \\"this is boring, when does the action start\\", you will be disappointed.if, however, you take pleasure from characters and setting as brilliantly realized as they can possibly be, and don't mind 4 page interludes about a scholarly dispute over some magical occurence, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm still undecided. I loved the plot -A group of wannabee magicians finds someone who can actually cast spells - despite their beliefs that magic is long dead. Consequently, they can no longer even research magic as stipulated in the wager. After that the book meanders aimlessly for 500 pages...I didn't love this aspect quite as much...There is no reason that this book needed to be 750+ pages for the rather anti-climactic (but satisfying) ending. One wonders if she is taking a page from the Robert Jordan School of bad writing. (Which is good writing - just too many needless descriptions) Anyhow, I did find the footnotes quite a good concept. It was fun to read little blurbs about the etiology of a phrase or the background of a location. I guarantee this idea will appear in future fantasy works.A lot of people liked this book but I was fairly indifferent. When I read gargantuan tomes I expect them to be as good as G.R.R. Martin or even and Early R. Jordan. Otherwise aren't we just wasting paper?Relic113"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you approach this book thinking it will be an easy read, as in Rowling's excellent stories, you will be disappointed, as several of the reviewers here attest. However, if you enjoy reading novels similar in style to Dickens and Trollope, you will be enthralled by the detail, humor, and complex plot of this story. It is true that Clarke over uses footnotes, and sometimes I felt I was reading a treatise on the Napoleonic Wars; however, the footnotes also add to the details of the story and provide an in-depth look at the topics relevant to the story line, and the writing style Clarke uses duplicates the typical writing styles of 19th century England. Also, this book does not present the typical Tolkien motifs of sorcery, as in the 3 m's (myth, magic, medievalism) that many of us have become accustomed to in this genre. There is also not a blatant quest, as in Tolkien or Rowling's stories.If you want to read a detailed, rather slow moving, but invigorating story, I recommend this book. I would not recommend this book for young adults."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This was one of the most maddening books I've ever read. Clarke possesses some very real talent, often sucking me in for pages at a time. At times it read as a satire, but one that pays as much homage to the genre as it does snarky scorn. There are moments of exceptional wittiness and sheer brilliance. Unfortunately, there are also interludes to nowhere, stock characters drawn from failed early Corman-Nicholson collaborations, and pointless meandering. I want to like this book much more than I did and I'm a bit in awe, but ultimately, it felt like it was three times longer than it was. For me, the biggest failing was that in over 700 pages, we couldn't get the characters to get any further than two dimensions. They just weren't interesting enough to spend that much time with. The side bars, footnotes, even some of the meanderings were actually quite enjoyable. It's the central story and characters that utlimately didn't work for me.I give it one star for audicity, one star for percolating brilliance, and one star in recognition of the amazing research."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was excited to get this book, since I have arthritis and reading the hard copy just doesn't work for me. But there are extensive footnotes, and those are not accessible on my Kindle Touch. (Yes, I did check with customer service about this, and other Kindles may be able to access them.) I have no idea how important those footnotes are to the story, since the hard copy is out for me. But at the very least it should be stated somewhere that Kindle Touch owners are buying an incomplete copy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Widely regarded as one of the best works of the modern fantasy canon, JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL was a book I've been meaning to read for a while. And while every one of these 1000 or so pages is evidence of literary brilliance, it wasn't something I was fully emotionally invested in. Still, though, I'm glad I finally read it.At the turn of the 19th century, it seems like no magic remains in England. But then a practicing magician named Mr. Norrell turns England upside-down when he performs the first bit of magic in England in several centuries, and immediately shoots his way up the social ladder. Norrell wants to use magic to do England good, but he's particular about how to regulate magic--which is why the sudden appearance of a second English magician, the charismatic Jonathan Strange, rocks Norrell to his core.Whereas Norrell's squirrelly looks and socially awkward demeanor are a disappointment as the face of magic, Strange's carriage and behavior earn him the goodwill of a fair number of Englishmen. Yet even as tensions between Norrell and Strange continue to develop, a long-simmering magic plot to take over England keeps threatening to come to light.Susanna Clarke takes the subgenre \\"Regency fantasy\\" to a whole new level with her superb command of that time period's language. Think Austen with a heavy dose of magical elements: not only was the language reminiscent of Regency England times, but Austen's almost insidious portrayal of ridiculous people had a heavy showing in JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL. While Strange and Norrell are arguably the main characters of the eponymous novel, we readers don't really LIKE them the way we usually do protagonists, because most of them are not good people: Norrell in particular manipulate nearly everyone out of fear of a loss of influence, meanwhile letting his even-less-appealing \\"friends\\" manipulate him in turn. All the unsavory characters in the book make Jonathan Strange look very good indeed, but he's no real \\"wounded hero,\\" just another self-centered guy who does not give enough consideration to others in his life.That, I guess, is what ultimately disappointed me about this book: it doesn't break any conventions or tread new ground in terms of genre or sociohistorical issues. Clarke crafts an alternate, magician-focused history for England, but, with the exception of head-scratchingly long footnotes showing just how in-depth Clarke has got with her alternate history creativity, JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL didn't blow me out of the water with originality in its fantasy genre.Additionally--and this may just be me--I found it a bit off-putting how small a role women played in the novel. For a book written by a female author, I had expected a bit more subversion of historical attitudes toward the role of males vs. females in society; yes, the book doesn't attempt to focus on the inequality and tensions between different parties, but I was surprised that the book didn't take such a step with potentially strong and interesting female characters such as Arabella Strange and Mrs. Pole. No, at the end of the day, things and people seemed to be pretty much what they had been before the book started, which results in reader's confusion along the lines of, \\"I just spent three weeks reading 1000 pages...and did anything significant really happen?\\" Hrmph.So, in some ways, reading JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL was for me like reading a classic that the \\"great authorities of literature\\" say is a must-read but on a personal level was a slog to get through. While I certainly appreciated Clarke's Austenian writing style, I closed the book realizing that 500 pages could've been cut out and I would have thought nothing was amiss."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a story of two wizards, lets call them Steve Jobs and Mr Gates, who take completely different points of view on the venerable discipline of computing -- or as the author refers to it quaintly: magic.At first, Mr Gates is all about building an empire with himself at the center. He runs around the country buying up all of the intellectual property and shutting down all potential competitors.Then along comes this upstart Steve, with a completely different and open perspective. Steve thinks that everyone should be able to own their own magical devices and practice magical applications in their homes. Steve's style of magic is irreverent and yet, approachable. Mr Gates says that Steve is up to no good. As the author sums it up, Mr Gates is the fearful one and Steve is the arrogant one.Most of the book deals with these two wizards and their evolving relationship from competitors to colleagues; and also the effects that their quarrels have on their environment. Hard drives are reformatted, core memories are infected with viruses, and more and more elaborate firewalls are erected. Meanwhile the two heroes debate the efficacy of VonNeumann's merge-sort algorithm against the Comb sort designed by Wlodzimierz Dobosiewicz.Unfortunately the book never really develops into a conflict strong enough to engage the reader in its resolution. There should have been a major magical battle, but the author completely fails to realize the opportunity. The villain of the story is an Anonymous uber-hacker who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, and basically steals and murders his way through the story without ever drawing the attention of either of the Most Powerful Magicians of their time. Alas."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It had me hooked from the very beginning but as I went on in the book I found some characters and chapters completely useless to the main plot of the novel. Nonetheless I finished the book and was glad of it. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I finished \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" and I'm not sure how I feel about it. On one hand, Clarke creates an impressive world. She uses footnotes to create a history within the story. For me it was one of the most enjoyable parts of the book. The ending for the most of the characters was great. In fact, the conclusion for all the characters aside from Strange and Norrell were creative and interesting.The reason I feel conflicted is that after having read this 800+ page book, I don't know why Strange and Norrell had to be the main characters. Clarke easily could have shorted this book by several hundred pages by simply reducing their stories. In the end large part of their lives such as Strange's work with the army didn't matter to the story. Norrell wasn't particularly interesting and basically disapears during Strange's section. He's mentioned here and there, or maybe a short chapter will focus on him. The way their stories ended was a let down.If this book were 400-500 pages and if it made Strange and Norrell just another set of characters I would definitely recommend it. I would probably read it again. However 800 pages with large sections I was bored with...I will say the gentlemen with the thistle hair character is probably one of my favorite literary characters. He was simply amazing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you are planning to read this book, you have to get through 100 pgs of not that interesting annoyingly english plot set-up. I almost gave up when I went on Amazon and read all these wonderful reviews. I stuck it out and became hooked. It turned out to be a great book and I'm happy I read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book had a lot to live up to when I read it because I had heard such wonderful things about it. It is just as good as everyone says and is delightful to read! Clarke really is the next big thing. It is witty, suspenseful, thought provoking, and unbelievably fantastic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Reading the story of the revival of English magic, I fell in love with the romance of magic welling up to the surface of a world that thought it safely forgotten. Clarke spins a seamless blend of a novel of manners and the chaotic world of faerie. The characters are rich and complex, equal to the ambiguities of their actions.A book for people who luxuriate in turns of phrase and vivid detail, \\"Strange\\" avoids the \\"re-do Tolkien for the 9128th time\\" trap. Clarke has her own voice, and it is strong.To top it all off, from reading other reviews, it appears that this book irritates both the snobs and the attention deprived--a sure sign of a book written by someone who loves to read, for people who love to read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Like other viewers, I was more than a bit underwhelmed a good third into this book, but I kept reading, and then I didn't want it to end. I just read the last 300 pages in one evening/morning. Fabulous book. But you have to actually read it before you rate it . . ."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Tremendous, both in size and in quality!This book does come with a bit of caveat emptor - if you don't like fussy, British comedies of manners, you probably won't like this. It's almost entirely unlike 'Harry Potter'. If books were beverages, this would be a fine, aged Bordeaux, and 'Harry Potter' would be a Coca-Cola. Nothing wrong with either drink - some people hate wine, some people drink Pepsi - it's just a matter of knowing your tastes. I'd also say it took about 150 pages for me to start really enjoying Clarke's writing, which is a pretty daunting investment.But once I started liking it.... I nearly swoon when I think of how it affected me. The characters are neatly and precisely drawn, yet they jump off the page as flawed, thoughtful, complex human beings. I was particularly impressed with what Clarke did with Mr. Norrell. His failings seem innocuous at the beginning, but you can see how they become much more serious in different contexts. It's very difficult to write good characters in fantasy or sci-fi books, because so much writing must be dedicated to setting the imaginary scene. This is hands down the best job I've ever seen in magical fiction.The footnotes are just fascinating. It's like walking into an orchid hothouse - you're knocked off your feet by the lushness of your surroundings, and you want to absorb every last detail, even though you know it's impossible. Clarke is funny, suspenseful, piercing, lyrical, didactic, and gosh, I could go on forever.Clarke has also imagined some really brilliant acts of magic. They are very subtle - in one case, a magician replaces a mundane object with its reflection in a mirror - and you're left gasping at how simultaneously clever and lovely the descriptions are.Just for the record, no, I don't know Susanna Clarke. I absolutely adored this book. By the end, I would happily have read another 800 pages if I could have. I devoutly hope it doesn't take her another ten years to write the sequel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Unfortunately I do not have time to write a lengthy review, but I just had to give this book 5 stars. Like another reviewer said, if you are expecting action, look elsewhere. If you are interested in the pubescent development of Potter & Co. and are expecting to glean further knowledge from this narrative, you will come away dissappointed. Think of it this way: would you be interested in a heavily character-driven novel in which some of the main delights come from the psychology of the characters, the beauty of the writing, and the social complexities that result from the characters' actions in attempting to revive the practical aspects of an occupation that has been relegated to academia for hundreds of years, all set in England in the 1800s? I would say that that, plus magic, is what you should expect. That being said, it is superb. It is magnificent. It is so good that after 850 pages you don't want it to end because you know that your next book won't be as good. I highly recommend it, but approach it with maturity, not infantile glee. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Can a magician kill a man by magic?\\" Lord Wellington asked Strange.Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. \\"I suppose a magician might,\\" he admitted, \\"but a gentleman never could.\\"These past two-plus months, I've had the extreme pleasure of reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: A Novel. It's the first novel for author Susanna Clarke. It had been on my to-read-list since July...and was a gift to me from my fiancee.Such a well-crafted book deserves a well-crafted review. I can only hope I am up to the task.Years ago, when I was in high school, I greatly enjoyed the works of the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, Wilkie Collins, and--most of all--Charles Dickens. Their writings captured for me the essence of English life, and the English country, in these authors' times. This was accomplished through the style and language of their writing, the use of small settings and every-day social functions within their stories, and proper, detailed characterization. Pacing the story was key, especially to Dickens, who wrote serialized novels, and needed to keep folks coming back, chapter after chapter.Susanna Clarke has captured these things well in JS&MN.; The language harkens back to Austen, and also is speckled with local or country colloquialisms, and older style spellings from time to time, such as \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\". The pace of the plot is slow at first, only building towards a crescendo as the novel nears its ending. Instead, the emphasis at the start really is to put all of the elements of the story in place, one by one, so that they are readily, and credibly, used when needed. The settings used in the story are as one would expect for a novel set primarily in England during the period of the Napoleonic Wars: country homes, parlours, upper-crust London homes, libraries, the English countryside, and even the battlefield. They are described as one intimately familiar with them would describe them: detailed, but not overly so.At the same time, this is a tale of magic. More properly, this is the story of the return of English magic to England. In many ways, English magic is its own character within the story. In the Middle Ages, magic was prevalent within England, especially after the \\"Raven King\\" brought his army out of Faerie and conquered northern England, holding it for three centuries until he, one day, vanished. Following his departure, magic slowly faded from use within England. At the start of the Napoleonic Wars, magic was the stuff of legends only, and magicians were only \\"theoretical\\", scholarly, upper-crust types who could not actually practice their art.And that brings us to the start of the tale. Mr. Norrell, one of those scholarly types, has the ability to practice his art, and decides it is his calling to restore magic to England. After performing his first public act of magic, he travels from York to London, hoping that the news of his magic will interest the government. He does not mesh well with London society, initially, and it is not until after he brings a young bride back from the dead, that the members of the government, as well as London society, truly take notice. How he manages this act of magic has grave consequences for many, if not all, of the major characters in the story.Norrell is a self-contradictory character. He wishes to bring back English magic, but he wants to lead a quiet life, and he doesn't seem to want any other magicians to be \\"on the scene\\". Norrell startles himself, and us, when he takes on an apprentice, a man by the name of Jonathan Strange. Strange and Norrell do not necessarily have characters which mesh well together. Where Norrell is quiet, cautious, and bookish, Strange is dashing and adnventurous, and carries out his magic as much by intuition as by book-learning. After Strange helps out with the defeat of Napoleon in Spain, and again at Waterloo, an inevitable break occurs between the two. It is this break, their differing views on magic, and the consequences of the revival-from-dead act which propells the story together towards its foretold conclusion (for there was also a prophecy): the restoration of magic to England.The pacing of the story is slow, and deliberate, at the start, as characters and settings are introduced. And it is not just the characters of Norrell and Strange which are covered in great detail. Other major characters include Norrell's aide Childermass, Strange's wife Arabella, the revived Lady Pole and her husband and their Negro butler, and a nameless fairy, amongst others. Historical characters play roles, including Lord Wellington, Byron, and even the mad King of England. Each of these characters gets the attention required to provide substance and depth to their descriptions. Once all of the elements are in place, the storyline slowly accelerates towards the final confrontations, and the inevitable.This all makes for a long story. Patience you must have, because the payoff is there. The ending of the story is not what I expected, but it felt truly natural, and it was truly breath-taking.This tale of magic is certainly not in the style of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. It is brilliantly different. For those looking for a completely new magical experience, combined with some true skill in word-smithing, I heartily invite you to read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I did end up liking this book. It is very clever. But, it was very slow to begin with. It really didn't get fasinating until I was halfway through -- which is 350 pages. The second half of the book is a whole lot better than the first. It isn't an adult Harry Potter. The only thing it shares with the Potter books is magic and England. Other than that it is quite unlike J.K. Rowlings' books. I am planning on reading it a second time to get all of what I missed the first time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First of all, a warning - please try not to read the synopsis on the back cover of the novel. It gives far too much away for serious readers who like to discover a book a page at a time and not have the synopsis spoon fed to them in 2 minutes !Having said that, Susanna Clarke's much hyped debut novel, still delivers the goods, even if you have had some of the fun of discovery stolen from you because of that back cover synopsis.Very rarely have I come across a writer who can comfortably convey humour through serious prose set in some very serious situations. To be honest, the only other writer who comes to mind is... J.R.R Tolkien, who was able to lighten the mood with the antics of Merry and Pippin or with descriptions of Treebeard and the Ents. Similarly, Ms. Clarke seamlessly takes the reader through the some pretty dark territory and when you least expect it, introduces a segment or sometimes just a phrase, that brings a smile to the readers' lips.Broadly speaking, the book is set during the Napoleanic Wars in the 19th century in a world where magic exists, but for various reasons has faded into disuse over the past couple of centuries. Into this setting arrive the two title characters with ever-improving feats of magic, thereby capturing the imagination of England and Europe.However, as the two magicians start exploring increasingly intricate magical spells, they unwittingly expose themselves, their loved ones and perhaps all of England to the mercy of darker forces.In addition to the sheer quality of Ms. Clarke's writing, she uses footnotes as a very engaging device to give the reader additional details and back stories on various characters and incidents. These footnotes sometimes occupy more of the page than the main story !The different plot threads are skillfully woven together to bring the reader to an interesting and satisfying conclusion. As I have said, I am left hoping that she will either write a sequel or will stick to the fantasy genre.Great stuff !"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Wow, this is a first attempt by the author...and wow. This book is fantastic. For those who enjoy the slower style, remeniscent of Ann Radcliff and Lord Dunsany, this book is a treat. The plot is complicated and intricate but the length of the book prevents you from getting lost, and surely not bored. In the beginning, Mr. Norrell demonstrates the forgotten art of Practical Magic, and forces all the Theoretical Magicians to give up their occupations. He then decides to single handedly return magic to England. Eventually he meets Mr Strange who has all the natural talent and none of the resources, and Mr Norrell takes him on as a pupil. While these things are happening, a faerie is working his own terrible will against the two magicians. There is a war going on now, and Mr Strange is sent by the English government to assist. As his powers grow, he becomes more obsessed with the foundation of magic, and faerie. If i were to give a more precise summary, it would take several pages, so if you enjoy wonderfully realized characters, white-knuckle excitment, well-researched historical fiction, with a dose of fantasy, please buy this book. The only thing that will dissapoint you is that it isn't longer."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I agree with most of the reviews written above mine, except the one that said it was \\"tedious.\\" Slow going need not equal tedious.

I hear Simon Pebbles doing a BRILLIANT job of articulating the voices of the dozens of characters, and when I get a tad lost in the plot threads, I can refer to the text. This is a book to own, to read every year, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, to savor.....and, actually, I think the historical background and daily social lives of the early nineteenth century ARE detailed enough to make it qualify as \\"historical fiction.\\" It is a wonderfully elaborate world Ms. Clarke has articulated, and I'm beside myself with joy for having discovered it for myself."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is not a book you are going to be able to knock off in a weekend. It starts off slowly (we do not get to either of the title characters for quite a while), and it takes a while to get adjusted to the quasi-textbook style of writing. However, I would heartily recommend all readers to persevere, for when all is said and done, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a remarkable novel. Many reviewers have compared it favorably to Tolkien, and appropriately so, as the book creates a complex, detailed world inhabited by magical creatures. It is the depth of characterization and setting that makes Clarke's book so special; you finish reading this book half-convinced that the magical England she describes either did exist, or should. Clarke does not let an opportunity to digress slip by without being taken advantage of; the numerous footnotes (tedious to some, but heartily enjoyed by me) contain entire fables that could stand on their own as solid short stories. The impressive length of the book allows Clarke to flesh out fully even allegedly \\"minor\\" characters, and the subplot involving the hilarious efforts of the gentleman with the thistle-down hair (whose name we never discover in the 800 pages of the book) to make Stephen, a Black servant, the new King of England--much to Stephen's dismay--could stand as a worthy novel on its own.The only criticism I have of the book is that the occasional archaic spellings (e.g., \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\") seemed grating and overly self-conscious. Clarke's beautifully precise syntax and phrasing are sufficient in themselves to convey the atmosphere of 19th century England, and given that she (wisely) did not choose to adopt archaic spellings consistently, the few examples she did come across as being arbitrary and somewhat pretentious.Bottom line: This is not a book that grabs you from the opening pages. If you read primarily fluffy page-turners like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or Grisham novels, you may not have the patience to immerse yourself in the tremendously appealing and complex land and characters that Clarke has created. But you should try, because the journey is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I really did want to like this book. I enjoy fantasy books and don't shy away from a long book (this one is 782 pages). Though there were some fun, imaginative parts to this book I found it much too long for what it delivered.An often-mentioned character for whom the last third of the book is named, The Raven King, appears on only about 3-4 pages in the entire book. After I understood the aspirations and human faults of the two main characters I began getting excited about the coming of the Raven King, but his appearance is brief and his character woefully ndeveloped. It was the Raven King, rather than those who populated the pages of this book, that I longed to learn more about. In a sense, the book was an appetizer...and the entree never arrived! In the end I wound up feeling manipulated. This is the author's first book, and I couldn't help feeling that I just spent money, and time, indulging in what ammounted to a marketing campaign for what is bound to become a series."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The gist of the story can be gleaned from the bookjacket, the wonder of the book cannot. Ms. Clarke has created a new world for us to enjoy if we only take the time.But, don't read this expecting Harry Potter, it is not, but it is just as good. Don't expect Jane Austen, yes, it has the flavor of the period, but, again, it is not, but it is just as good.To properly savor this book, allow the time. I once rushed through a book of this size in two nights, but this one needs more care. I took eight days to read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and that, even, was too fast.So....read slowly, and savor the words of this world. Take your time with the footnotes; while they are not required, they make the book ever so much better. And, if you find from time to time, as did I, that the book suddenly seems a bit tedious, make a cup of tea. Then, come back and read ten more pages, and you will once again be entranced.I work in a library, and I would recommend this book to almost every reader I know.I recommend this to any reader who will take the time to enjoy this world. This is an entrancing book. I hope you will read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The story is gripping, of mythical scope and beautifully written - I cannot recommend it strongly enough.Mr Strange and Mr Norrell, the eponymous (anti?)heroes are the two great magicians of their age (the early 1800s). They are drawn together by common-talent, but driven apart by differing aims and personalities into a fearsome rivalry. Norrell is self-serving, vain and insecure; Strange is bold charismatic and iconoclastic. The book is set in an alternative version of the past, peopled with figures like Wellington, the wars in Spain and other late Georgian-era facts in a very heady and convincing mix. Through the actions of the two magicians England and the Kingdom of Faerie are brought into violent conflict. If this all sounds very fantasy and like a children's book - it's not. The writing is sophisticated, gritty and humorous. The characters are visceral and the tension and drama of the story masterfully handled. It is an immensely well-crafted book that heralds the arrival of a very original and imaginative literary writer. Just wonderful!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was very anxious to read this book that I had heard was meant to be oddly fascinating and curious and intelligent...however, although the author is obviously quite keen on discourse and perhaps history and tries for an interesting yarn, this story lacks any real aspect of great storytelling. I found myself pushing and pushing myself through the book at all stages. It is very much a long-winded work and, once you're half way through, you know you're INVESTED so heavily that you are unable to drop it before reaching the glory of the story ending. But when the outcome is sadly lacking, you'll find yourself suffering great pangs of remorse for having wasted your precious time. I think what happened here is that the author had a great first draft on her hands but the thing was so bloody long she couldn't bear to take a crack at re-writing it to make it great."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a novel of England during Napoleonic Wars in an alternate universe where magic, though not common anymore, has previously been a regular part of life. Magic historians still flourish, but practicing magicians had not been seen for hundreds of years until Mr. Norrell demonstrates his ability.Mr. Norrell feels his job is to bring practical magic back to England, but only by himself-he has sought out and crushed the attempts of any other magician in England. Things continue on in this way, with Mr. Norrell as London's favorite novelty and the Government's chief war weapon, until Jonathan Strange arrives on the scene showing that he, too, can practice magic. To everyone's surprise, Mr. Norrell takes him as his pupil.The rest of the novel is too complex to explain, but involves fairies, war, rivalries, madness and, of course, magic, as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell unknowingly fulfill a prophecy and bring practical magic back to England.The best part about this book is the mythology that Ms. Clarke has created. There are footnotes that relate to books and magicians and history that make up this alternate universe. This was an excellent addition and I applaud Ms. Clarke for this background work.The style of the novel, however, is it's downfall. Ms. Clarke has written it in the language and style of a 19th century novel, which (while delightful to one like me who enjoys Austen and Radcliff and the like) can make it very hard going. I actually started reading it two times before I succeeding in getting past the first few chapters. As it is such a slow read, I was apt to set it down and forget about it for days.While actually reading it, though, I was fascinated. The story is very deep and intricate; it is obvious that Ms. Clarke has put tremendous effort in its crafting. Despite my enjoyment of it, though, my dissatisfaction with the ending and it's general slowness makes me rate it lower than it probably deserves. I certainly can not give it a universal referral and am surprised that so many people have managed to read and review it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've spent several days listening to the unabridged audio version of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell. Initially, I was delighted by the world described in this novel: a cool pre-Victorian world where magic is the province of scholarly magicians and where fairies and humans co-exist. I liked the Eccentric Mr. Norell and the young upstart, Jon Strange. But over time, I grew bored with the contrived conflict between the magicians, the endless tedious footnotes and the snarkiness of Norell vs. Strange, neither of whom I ended up liking by the end of the book. (These two male leads remind me of a couple of immature schoolboys rather than the adults they were supposed to be).While I stuck it through to the end to find out what happened in the Norrel vs. Strange conflict, I found the ending to anticlimactic and not very satisfying. Overall, I would've liked this novel more if I had been able to empathize with Strange and Norell.3 Stars for an average read which could've been better if I'd actually LIKED Norrel and Strange."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The plot: Mr Norrell is fixated on getting a monopoly on magic. His goal is to convince others not to study magic, in case they actually learn to do magic, and to buy up all books about magic so that he is the only magician around. Oh yes and he is a real magician. Jonathan Strange is an aimless bachelor who takes up magic to impress a girl. Jonathan has a natural aptitude for magic, while Mr Norrell is very rational and bookish even though he is a very powerful wizard. Their paths cross when Mr Norrell agrees to tutor Jonathan. But remember, Mr Norrell is dedicated to being top dog. Obviously he will take Jonathan down a notch when the time comes.Much much more happens all through the story - hence the long long reviews here. Subplots run in and out of the world of fairy and through military politics in England. It is easy to follow as you read but a lot happens.This is a bestseller that someone might care to read in a few years - in other words it is well written and entertaining not just coincidentally the next big thing.. I recommend reading this and think that it would appeal to almost anyone. Almost any chapter can stand alone as a separate short story. If you want to be cautious then read the first chapter to get a taste of the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Thhe story of two magicians easily transports the most skeptical reader into the misty world of English magic in all its mystery, glory, trickery, and power. Clarke returns magic so seamlessly back into English life, weaving into historical narratives with such ease, that it is impossible not to believe. The book is filled with tension which reaches incredible levels towards the end. Sometimes your suspicions are correct but sometimes Clarke takes an unexpected turn, only to turn back and keep you guessing at the final outcome...which should have been inevitable but gets forgotten in the excitement. The style of writing, and useful footnotes, construct a magical but not suffocatingly detailed world. This book is thriller, mystery, fantasy, adult Harry Potter, Dickens, and Austen all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"An interesting read! (mostly)This in not your everyday fantasy adventure. In fact, those of you expecting something akin to George Martin's \\"Ice and Fire\\" series or Steven Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" novels will probably be disappointed. This is a fictional story dealing with the reemergence of magic (after centuries of absence) in England of the early 1800s. The first part of this novel is ponderously slow in its development, but if you persevere you will be rewarded with a thrilling tale and an excellent ending.Well written, great character development, an intriguing plot and a superb ending make this book a definite winner. However Clarke's greatest writing asset is her use of descriptive prose: i.e. to convey the subtle textures of a landscape; to chill us with the eeriness of a dusky, poorly lit room etc. She has the ability to transport the reader to the place she is describing, and to me, this is the writing quality that separates the great writers from the merely good.All in all, the book is so well written that, when I look back, I can forgive the rather tedious pace of the first third of the book; in fact, in retrospect, the slow plot development seemed to mesh perfectly with the era of England portrayed in this novel. There was a slower pace of life, a quiet civility with an air of standoffishness that separated the \\"gentile\\" class from the lowly servants and working class of the time, and all this added to the realism of the over story. Recommended! 4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This jet black tome has been hanging around the place a fair while; a friend of ours lent me it about a year ago but despite Amazon's best efforts to convince me that it would be right up my alley given my predilection for Terry Pratchett, Joss Whedon and Jasper Fforde, I never got round to starting it. Only when I ran out of reading material in English did I embark on the intimidating 800 odd pages. And then I never looked back.Set in the early 19th Century, it's about the return of magic to England after a long absence. This magic is wrought by the two central characters, Norrell- a fussy, bookish egotist and his relatively normal apprentice, Jonathon Strange. The book starts with gentlemen questioning a world where we can only read about theoretical magic, where \`magicians' can study spells but are unable to perform any. Practical magician Norrell soon steps in and performs some impressive feats. Shortly after, Strange becomes his adept apprentice and before long both titular mages are in the government's employ helping the English battle Napoleon's armies and gaining ever greater powers. That would be an entertaining enough plot, but JS & Mr N also contains elements of history, mystery and social comedy.I hold that it would be quite remiss not to mention the narrative style and period detail shewed to the reader. Indeed, this is probably the closest I will ever come to reading Jane Austen. One word is never used when ten will do and if there's an archaic irregular verb then it is boldly inserted. I often stopt to reread a sentence that contained words I'd mentally underlined in wavy red pen; However there's no denying that it adds to the Georgian atmosphere and sense of otherworldliness.I read aloud the first couple of chapters to Sita and she could not be doing with it all. Judging by other critiques of the book, it's not to everyone's taste. To enjoy this book you have to be willing to suspend your disbelief, enjoy tales of magic and care about people who do, frankly, sound incredibly pompous and English. Still that's not too hard to get over, surely? The multiple plot threads will keep you spellbound and I personally can't wait to hear about their further adventures."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To be honest, it took me forever to finish \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" At the same time that I enjoyed reading it, I found myself putting it down for weeks at a time. The book is so dense in its ideas and characterizations that a little simply went a long way. Don't get me wrong: I found Clarke's writing superb and her imagination on par with J.K. Rowling's (and for me that's saying a lot); but I kept losing patience with the book as a whole. It went on and on and didn't seem to be going anywhere. Finally, having read the last half on an extended vacation, I have to say that this is, all things considered, an extraordinary novel. All great works of literature introduce us to characters we come to care a great deal about, characters who transcend the page and become as real to us as ourselves; and they make us either see our own world in new ways or introduce us to worlds we couldn't possibly imagine. \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" works remarkably well on all counts. Norell, Strange, Childermass et al. are all beautifully realized characters, and the world Clarke has them inhabit is both familiar and extraordinarily, delightfully new. As long as you don't let the length of the book deter you, and you can give in to the richness of its wonders, you'll be in for a helluva ride. Trust me -- and Clarke: all the disparate, seemingly unrelated strands come together in the poignant, bittersweet finale."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a startlingly original fantasy. No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. It does get tedious at times, and the finale gets a bit stretched out, but the positive far outweighs the negative. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best books I have read. I was a little disappointed by the ending, but the many pages it took to get to that point were absolutely delightful and well worth it. Clarke weaves mystery, adventure, humour, romance, suspense, and magic together in a most superior way. I found myself rereading many passages in awe of her writing style. I highly recommend anyone read this book, as there is something in it for lovers of all genres. Once you start Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, you will not be satisfied until you have reached the very end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It took me weeks to listen to all 26 discs, but every moment was delicious! It probably helped that I had read about 1/3 of the book before having to return it to a friend. The footnotes--delightful gems that they are--do interrupt the narrative flow, so I imagine it might be difficult for the first-time listener to take it all in. It requires concentration to take in the wonderful details and to appreciate Simon Prebble's masterly reading.At times I of despaired of finishing, but now that it's over, I'm ready to start over from the beginning. Its depth, complexity, and imagination remind me of the intense pleasure I get from reading \\"War and Peace,\\" \\"Bleak House,\\" or any novel of Jane Austen's.Don't bother with this book unless you are prepared to give yourself to it entirely while you are reading or listening. But if you do, you will enjoy it \\"more than anything in the world.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I quite agree with other reviews : this book should not be picked up if you want fast-paced, non-stop action. Ditto if you are looking for the second coming of Harry Potter. This book is a whole different story. I loved the descriptions, the long character developments, the use of old English and the not-so-clear bad versus good war.It is a long book. I read it in a week and a half which, for me anyway, is a long time to read any novel. But I did enjoy every moment, actually slowing to reread some paragraphs. It's not a \\"on the edge of your seat\\" kind of book but you do want to know what is coming around the corner. I also enjoyed the other characters, other then Mr Norrell & Mr Strange. It's rare in books that you want to know what happens to other, lesser charcaters just as much, if not more so, as you do the main ones.As a first novel, this is hard to beat. As a novel, the research involved must have been incredible! Hats off to Ms Clarke!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" offers a fresh look at magic and sorcery, elevating the dark arts from the margins and placing them front and center. This bold scheme pays off for author Susanna Clarke, allowing her plenty of room to blend history and fiction in a manner that is convincing and entertaining. Anchored by many, many pithy footnotes, the book's version of the history of English magic become believable and compelling, much live H.P. Lovecraft's Miskatonic University and environs begin to take on a life of their own.The characters at the heart of the book, Mr. Norrell, a bookish, boorish loner, and Jonathan Strange, a brooding, brilliant romantic, are opposites bound together by their singular skills at wielding and interpreting magic. A host of supporting characters, some historical transplants and other fictional archetypes, populate the sprawling tale and numerous subplots. Indeed, two of these, John Childermass and Stephen Black are the most vital, engaging characters in the novel, and arguably they upstage the main characters much like Flay and Swelter do for a time in the first two Gormenghast novels. Could one or both take center stage in an encore?Ms. Clarke chooses her words carefully, employing her poetic license fully in using a hybrid dialect to add another level of verisimilitude to the story. Admittedly, sometimes this literary device is a bit grating, but anyone who makes it past the first few chapters likely won't mind.I have one point of contention, not with Ms. Clarke, per se, but with reviewers and critics who mistakenly categorize this novel as fantasy. It's not. The fantasy novel has a distinct set of characteristics, and other than magic being an everyday sort of occurrence, \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" has little in common with the initial forays into fantasy by William Morris or the form's finest expression in Professor J.R.R. Tolkien's works."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I just finished reading \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,\\" which is a huge doorstop of a book. Sporting a black cover and numbering more than 700 pages, it looks awfully forbidding, especially to someone who doesn't relish the idea of taking weeks to read a book.My advice: do it. There hasn't been a book since last year's \\"Pattern Recognition\\" By William Gibson that has been so totally absorbing for me. Author Susanna Clarke creates an entire world in those 700-some pages. And like all great fantasy writers, her magical world follows rules of its own that are oddly similar to, but not quite the same as, those of our real one. Or is her world the real one? By the time you finish reading, you might begin to wonder.As one who spend a week and a half inhabiting the universe of magicians Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, I was simply swept away by the exhilarting language, the lovingly created characters and the deliberately old-fashioned spellings. The book is designed to look as if it has been published in the early 19th century, and it's written with an omnisicient narrator who, curiously, seems like a character on his/her own. There even are a few instances in which the narrator says \\"I did such and such,\\" but we never find out who \\"I\\" is. The style, although touted as similar to Jane Austen in the jacket blurbs, is more like Thackeray with its wry humor and tongue-in-cheek view of English society.But it's the main characters who command the attention, and you are unlikely to meet figures who are as fascinating as the two magicians, Strange and Norell. And when I say magicians, I'm not speaking of the pull-the-rabbit-out-of the-hat variety. These are the real deals: magicians who can turn the rain into a vision of a British ship of the line or transport whole towns at will. Crazy? Maybe so, but you have to willingly submit to Clarke's logic for the drama to unfold. In this world, magic is real.The plot turns on an odd falling out between the two magicians and the mysterious disappearance of Strange's beloved wife, Arabella. There are tangles with fairies, trips to enchanted netherworlds, and a prolonged section in Venice, in which Strange flirts with madness to have his wife returned to him.It's all beautifully crafted, right down to the fake footnotes referencing phony books. The result is a book that almost makes you believe that the Duke of Wellington employed a magician to help him win the Napoleonic Wars.\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a beautiful trip to a world the reader is sorry to leave, Much in the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien and Neil Gaiman, this book just vibrates with a life of its own."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't think I can add much more to what has already been noted by other reviewers for this book (there are so many reviews), but I did want to add another 5-star rating to its credit.This isn't a \\"hold on to the seat of your pants\\" kind of book, but is instead a very intelligent and thoughtful novel that focuses on an imaginative, inventive, and magical alter-England. It does require patience to read because of the sheer enormity of the novel, but the rich descriptions and characters build up the story in well-developed layers, making it a sincere pleasure to read.I sincerely hope that Ms. Clarke continues to explore her writing potential--because with this as her first offering, I can't wait to see what else she has to offer in future!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"...and I'm grateful for this (by the way I love the HP books).\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is an outstanding GOOD book. And it is really a book, not a screen-play as many modern books use to be.The story is witty and unique. The writing style of Mrs.Clarke remembers me in a postive way of the Austen and Bronte novels!And it is, thanks heaven, no fantasy stuff at all. For me as a German it seems to be a funny, creepy and intriguing mix of historical research, dark british humour and social novel.I simply love it.The only thing I wondered was how Bloomsbury could release it as only one book? It would have made a great trilogy. Such a fat book as a debut novel was maybe a little bit too much bravery of the publisher.Anyway. Five stars are justifiable."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I confess to a predilection for fiction written about 19th century or late 18th century England. (See my reviewer page.) This is not to say that I am a fan of novels written *during* that period, but I enjoy good novels written *about* that period, and there is a great difference. One of the more absorbing aspects of the former is that, from the perspective of the 21st and late 20th centuries, one can clearly see the sense of propriety which dictated so much of English social behavior and which seems to have been lost in American culture. And of course there are other attractions.I am also a fan of science fiction, fantasy, alternate world fiction, call it what you will, and, although I have not written reviews about much of it, I have been reading it for fifty years. Ms. Clarke's novel combines the best of both genres.She constructs a wonderful tale of everyday British affairs during the time toward the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the rise of the British Romantic Poets (feh!), etc. with the extraordinary inclusion of two practicing magicians (a profession unknown to Britain since its demise several centuries before), who have dramatically opposed personalities. The way in which their stories unfold and articulate with the historic period are seamless, and I must add, wonderfully wrought.Ms Clarke's sense of humor is prevalent throughout the book, and, as in the British manner, understated. Here is just one wonderful example: Jonathan Strange, the more likeable of the two magicians, has been touring with Wellington in pursuit of French armies across Spain.In a footnote, Ms. Clarke writes, \\"Owing to a mistake in Wellington's maps of Spain the city of Pamplona was not exactly where the British had supposed it to be. Wellington was deeply disappointed when, after the army had marched twenty miles in one day, they did not reach Pamplona which was discovered to be ten miles further north. After swift discussion of the problem it was found to be more convenient to have Mr. Strange move the city, rather than change all the maps.\\"[Several years and several pages later] \\"The Duke of York remarked that King Ferdinand of Spain had sent a letter to the Prince Regent complaining that many parts of his kingdom had been rendered entirely unrecognizable by the English magician and demanding that Mr. Strange return and restore the country to its original form.\\"\\"\`Oh, said the Duke of Wellington, not much interested, \`they are still complaining about that, are they?'\\"Q.E.D.Another feature of the book which may not have been mentioned (I do not read others' reviews before writing my own) is that the book has a dozen or so wonderful full-page illustrations. My favorite one is opposite page 151.One word of WARNING: This is not fast food. If you do not enjoy the consumption of an excellent meal in good surroundings, ingested leisurely and perhaps accompanied by fine conversation, pass this literary meal by: you will neither enjoy this work nor be able to recommend it to others. Stick to McNovels: they'll fill you up without your having to pay the least attention to what you are consuming. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is for connoisseurs.Finally, being to a degree familiar (see the book Postcards of Nursing) with the differences between excellent and merely adequate portraits, I must state that the photograph of the author which appears on the back flap of the book, is itself magical. I realize that the author's picture is not a good reason to purchase or reject a book, but as it is so seldom remarked upon, and as this one is so good, I did want to mention it, in case, while browsing the book in stores, you might have the opportunity to regard it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To say this book is about magic would be inaccurate, or even to say that it is what we know as a fantasy novel. It's not Harry Potter for grownups- it's something hugely more complex and more valuable. It's a work of art that makes you think and makes you feel. This book is ultimately about people; the way they deal with their own problems and the way they relate to others.The story is deliciously written, with wry humor and convincing period dialogue and mannerisms- it quite reminds me of something like Jane Austen, and yet manages to stay gripping and moves plenty fast. The plot very quickly takes on disturbingly dark tones, and remains tightly woven and intriguing right up through the wistful conclusion.Be warned, however, that this book is not for the faint of heart, with a hefty spine and some pretty serious literary wading involved. Clarke adds the charming touch of many extended (sometimes VERY extended) \\"historical\\" footnotes, which I found entertaining, but some might find irritating. If you're not already of a literary persuasion, I have a feeling you would get sick of this book very quickly.In case you couldn't tell, I'm a huge fan of this book. I'm currently in high school, so for years I've been searching for things in the realm of Young Adult Fantasy that have enough depth to keep me interested; I was overjoyed to find a book that had that depth and a whole lot more."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This novel is so many things - All of them wonderful and wonderfully executed by Ms Clarke - that it's hard to know where to begin or end in a review.

It's also so very, very English and droll, that it can be seen, in the agglomeration of all its contradictory characters, as a take on England and the English Character.The book's literary ancestors are obvious: Tolkien, Dickens, Susan Cooper-and, I should say, the \\"High Romantic\\" poets of the Early Nineteenth Century in general. Clarke is a master of setting out verbal tableaux in masterful, lush prose, at capturing shades of light and dark---I was reminded of Shelley's \\"Ode to the West Wind\\" many a time.She is also the master of droll English understatement. As an example: \\"Early in November 1814 Mr Norell was honoured by a visit from some very noble gentlemen - an earl, a duke and two baronets - who came, they said, to speak to him upon a matter of the utmost delicacy and were so discreet themselves that half an hour after they had begun talking Mr Norell was still entirely ignorant of what they wished him to do.\\"It is a book that, if you are of a....hm.....poetic or \\"magical\\" temperament, will cast its spell on you from the first to last page. You shall be transported to scenes such as: \\"On a day in late December when storm clouds made Alpine landscapes in the sky above London, when the wind played such havoc in the heavens that the city was one moment plunged in gloom and in the next illuminated by sunlight......\\"These are the things that make the book truly great. The plot is also very well executed. But if you're in search of the Harry Potter sort of thing, then you, like the society patricians at the soirees asking for some \\"magic\\" acts to be performed for their diversion, had best look elsewhere.The magic in this book is the sort that makes you look at the tree limbs in relief against an evening sky with a chill wind picking up and get a sense that there might be something more to things than you can quite make out.My apologies to John Donne for stealing this review's title."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First off I think the tag line, 'Harry Potter for grown-ups', I've seen attached to this book is misleading. The only similarities between the two is England and the word magician. I only say this because people who pick this up expecting the quick and accessible world of Hogwarts are in for a shock.A better reference point would be, 'Charles Dickens with magic.'The book is long and dense, with many footnotes and a deliberately paced plot. However, I was never the least bit bored, and found myself thoroughly engrossed with these characters, and what happens to them. The plot in a nutshell revolves around two magicians, Mr Norrell, and his student Jonathan Strange. Coming at the world of magic from two very different views, an incident happens towards the beginning of the novel that shapes the course of the entire story and both the mens lives.There are a multitude of subplots that while reading I had no idea how they related directly to the main thrust of the story, but by the end she does a marvelous job of weaving them all together.The book definitely requires some patience, but the payoff is so worth it. After nearly eight hundred pages I felt completely satisfied with the ending. And that says alot. Time well spent ."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I love the Harry Potter series. This is NOTHING like Harry Potter. It's also nothing like Lord of the Rings, or any other fantasy wizards and magic novel. It's more like a Jane Austen novel, if Jane Austen had a couple of the gentleman who also just happened to practice magic. You will either love this book or hate it. There seems to be no middle ground. Read the first few pages (since Amazon lets you do this). If you like her style of writing, which mimics the novels written in the early 1800's, then you will enjoy this book. If you don't like the style of writing, then it's not for you. This book is not a page turner to see what happens next. It's one where you savor the way the words are put together. Personally, I find this book very funny, but you must realize that the humor is very dry and very low key. I also love the footnotes. Some are fake references to books other characters in the novel have written. Some are short stories in themselves. All of them fall in the exact place where it is convenient to read them. Again, you will either love this affectation or not. I grew up in England, and all my school chums and I believed in Fairies, so I find that aspect of the story interesting, too."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a blogger I read occasionally, and way before I caught wind of all of the hype that would have turned me off immediately. I am so pleased that I did.Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, is a delightful book, the footnotes never fail to interest and tended to keep me reading, even when the book became tedious in spots. While I never really liked either of the main characters, I was delighted by the character of Stephen, and how his longing for an identity, separate from his slave past was woven so seamlessly into the plot. The ending left me wanting to know more, and hoping that this will not be the last we here from Susanna Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a very literate fantasy with many interesting characters. As noted in some other reviews, the very detailed description of exactly how magic is accomplished is likely not for everyone. The volume certainly could have been edited by hundreds of pages without losing much; still many people enjoy the lengthy descriptions more than I.Although some have criticized the extensive footnotes, I felt they gave me an option to read an abridged or full version. I sometimes read them, and sometimes skipped them.My biggest problem with the book is the ending. Without spoiling the ending for the reader, I can say that the ending fails to use the characters well, and the handling of the denouement is inexplicable. If you read the book, you will inevitably read it to the end. I challenge you to stop at the end of chapter 67, and make up your own ending. Then finish the book and ask which ending you prefer, the one you imagined or the author's. I think you will like the one you imagined better."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"i am amazed at the reviews this book has been able to garner, as it is, unfortunately, way too long and simply does not deliver. excited by glowing reviews in newspapers and magazines i thought that finally a story about magic had come along that could in fact live up to tolkien et al. but it is so far off, it's not even funny. i waded through the whole thickness of this book, witnessing good ideas flipped at me and discarded without development, images pulled out of a sack and quickly stuffed away again, and all the while i hoped that finally the sinister evildoers would show their face for the epic battle that surely had to come after all those pages. alas, the book simply ends, leaving this reader frustrated and disbelieving. is this the same book we are talking about? i felt strung along and somehow tricked into reading something that is just utterly boring. i could not really get myself to sympathize with the characters, and what was the big build up about the raven king about? where was he? he came and went in about a second, and that's it.although i do admire anybody who can write and actually finish a book of that length and even get it published, i cannot recommend this book to anybody interested in a good, exciting read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"&#65279;Clarke's first book is an amazing work on several accounts. The writing is elegant and masterful. She follows the tradition and style of some of the great English writers of the 19th century-making this reader think in particular of Jane Austen or George Eliot.The plot is full of interesting turns, while the adept characterization and accounts of daily living maintain interest during lulls in action. The area of particular mastery is the psychological tone of the novel. It creates a mood that is cheerful and wholesome-and at moments eerie. All in all a wonderful read. I now regret reading it so quickly, sad that the experience is over."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"recommend doing. The reader, Simon Prebble, was superb. The story is fascinating although I'm not much of a war history fan, so I could have done without the middle section. But it did serve to define Strange and further differentiate him from Norrell. Overall, I found the book fascinating; sometimes funny, and sometimes sad. I do know I'm very glad to have \\"read\\" it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I cannot remember the book that I enjoyed mre than this one in quite a long time. You would think that I was recommended this book or that I have read something about it, somwhere, but the fact that I haven't makes me wonder, and feed my hunger for exploration and \\"thirst for knowledge\\". To know that there exist such jewels as this one, and that I haven't discovered them yet, keeps me standing...and wanting....And now, after some exaggaretion (one should emberk upon it every now and then) I should cool down and state my oppinion in more peacfull manner which is not so aggressive as the one stated above. :)As I have said, I stumbled upon this book in local book club/cafe and not knowing what to expect, I laid my hands on it and took her (the book) home. Not much of a blurb (there goes the tought in my hand) - \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups\\", as I might have mentioned somwhere I am not a fan of Harry Potter so this wasn't any kind of recommendation to me. How wrong was the blurb.Quite some time Aago I read \\"Les Miserables\\" by Victor Hugo, and the feeling I had was much like the feeling that I head whils reading this book. Sence of loss, and almost beautifull sorrow. Towards whom and what I cannot say, but I can say that the words filled me with warmth, with ecstasy, with hatred in one word with emotions. Thing that don't happen very often since I was trained to look upon the work of an art in a more (or less) objective way. Poor old me.Jonathan Starnge & Mr Norrel is a book that stands side by side with greatest novel of rmanticism (not of romance) but don't you expect bildungsroman now, cause it is not. From Napoleon to Lord Byron Susanna Clarke presents her characters with such a loving grace that you must feel for them, you can almost hear and smell her world how lifelike it is. She didn't lose herself in endless narative which bores to death, every word is well placed and this is one of those books that are simply too short and you feel at loss when they are over.Eternal struggle for knowledge, stupidity of humanity, elite vs common, Emipristic versus scientific, questions that will remain open even as the post-modern discourse of rediscovering identity of oneself starts to dominate prose.I strongly recommend this one, and with it Umberto Eco's \\"The Name of The Rose\\". Read them both and enjoy, and think, and cry, and be human (or humane) in the noblest form that you can manage."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Overall, an entertaining read - but I agree with previous comments that it will not be to everybody's taste. There's a good dollop of Henry Fielding in there, with the 18th century novel's speed and pace at the outset, and whilst Clarke undoubtedly needs a lengthy space to set our her vision of 19th century wizardry, the final 200-400 pages sag and could have done with more judicious editing. Plus the change in tone here and in particular in the final pages wasn't 100% convincing. However, this is a book that sweeps you up in its world and carries you along: definitely a good example of the willing suspension of disbelief. And some of the minor characters are fantastically good value (Lord Wellington for one)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Not only could this book give readers a concussion if it fell on them while they drifted off to sleep, (heavy, huge hardback edition), but at times it could quite possibly be the cause of the sleepiness. Still, big and unwieldy as it is, the book is worth a look.Susanna Clarke's book, heralded by some critics, is, in my humble opinion, a strange combination of wonderful prose and monotonous blandness, interspersed with a dribblingling of truly inspired and magical moments. The search for those moments is what kept me determined to finish this lengthy undertaking. But in the end, and though the writer indeed deserves praise for weaving a story of this verbal magnitude together, there just weren't enough of those magical moments to allow me to feel satisfied.In the end, what comes to mind is that reading this book was a bit like reading one of those textbooks that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell spent so much of their time with. Just add the dust."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am not even sure how to begin describing this book.It is very imaginative, creative, and beautifully written. The story is set in an alternative version of England, a magical England, during the Regency. It's written very much in the style of Jane Austen (there's even a part where a character says, \\"I take no leave of you!\\" just like Lady Catherine said to Lizzy in Pride & Prejudice), with a few archaic spellings thrown in (shew for show and chuse for choose).Here's an example of the beautiful writing: \\"She did not rise at the entrance, nor make any sign that she had noticed them at all. But perhaps she did not hear them. For, though the room was silent, the silence of half a hundred cats is a peculiar thing, like fifty individual silences all piled one on top of another.\\"The book is full of fake footnotes citing imaginary English references on magic and fairies. These footnotes are funny and entertaining, once you get past the idea that something in tiny type at the bottom of the page is going to be dull. You get lots of stories and things about magicians of old, especially one mysterious guy, the Raven King.When the story opens, English magic is all but dead, and though it is studied by \\"theoretical magicians,\\" no one can actually do magic. But then this one guy who lives in the country in Yorkshire, a fussy little man named Mr Norrell, comes along saying that he can do magic, and makes a display, and then eventually contrives to get all the theoretical magicians to stop calling themselves magicians or having anything else to do with magic.Mr Norrell establishes himself in London and tries to get the attention of some important people so that he can do some magic on behalf of England in the war against Napoleon. Eventually he succeeds, though the spell he uses to get the attention of an important person, Sir Walter Pole, ends up causing all kinds of trouble.Another magician enters the scene: Jonathan Strange, who becomes a magician sort of by accident. He's young, headstrong, and much more like one would imagine a magician should be than Mr Norrell. Mr Norrell agrees to take him on as a pupil. These two gentlemen represent two very different approaches to magic, and perhaps they were supposed to be similarly sympathetic, but they weren't. Mr. Norrell was so miserly with his books and so close-mouthed about magic that it was hard to like him. Far into the book, you understand his motivations a little better, but it's a little too late. Jonathan Strange was much more likeable.There are some other stories going on here as well - the butler, Stephen Black; the strange gentleman with silver hair; Mr Drawlight and Mr Lascelles, the socialites that Mr Norrell has taken up with; a street-magician named Vinculus; John Segundus the kind theoretical magician; and Mr Norrell's man of business, Childermass.The intertwining stories were beautifully told and nicely woven around each other, and once it found its pace (the first hundred or so pages were slow going) it was very, very engaging. There's nothing like this book out there. I've heard people call it \\"Harry Potter for grownups\\" but it's not that at all. It's its very own thing.But. I was a little bit disappointed in the end. After creating these vivid characters and their wonderful stories and dropping intriguing little clues all over the place, it kind of petered out. Maybe I just didn't like the way some things turned out, and maybe (because I got so wildly curious that I read too fast) I missed some things that would have made the ending seem better to me upon a slower reading. And I will reread this book, armed with knowledge of the ending, and see if that makes the ending better.It seemed like Ms. Clarke should have gone through her manuscript one more time looking for a few things that could be enhanced or explained more at the end (you didn't miss anything until then, because you just assumed it would be explained later). I think maybe the manuscript got too long (it is almost 800 pages) and she just wanted to be finished with it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke is a good writer but a poor storyteller. This book is far too long and poorly paced. It gets off to a very slow start with a group of 'theoretical' magicians natting on about nothing and it takes 75 pages before something interesting happens. Then, right after something interesting happens (inanimate objects talking), it goes right back to being boring for a while while Ms. Clarke indulges herself in pointless subplots and endless character studies. This pattern of a moment of excitement followed by long periods of boredom repeats itself endlessly throughout the book.Did I mention the footnotes? They appear on every page so the author can relate the history of magic in England - after a while they just get annoying because most of them are silly and they also fail to advance the plot.After examining every minor character in excruciating detail book the ends abruptly. How does Lady Pole exact her revenge on Mr. Norrell for selling her as a slave to the bad fairy? What is the signifigance of Drawlight turning into a tree after being murdered? Why is the Raven King, the most interesting character by far, stuck with nothing more than a lame cameo? What are the words of the new book written on Vinculus' body?Pages and pages of trivia and she leaves you hanging at the end. Annoying. I'm just thankful I borrowed the book from the library instead of wasting money on it.I fear there is a sequel in the works. If so, count me out. There are far more accessible books out there, with better editing, to read. Only read \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" if you have a lot of spare time to fill."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange & Norrell\\" is a strange novel indeed, but arrestingly so, one of the qualities of a masterpiece. The book even looks strange, with its lengthy footnotes, quaint typesetting, and antiquated spellings (\`stopt' instead of \`stopped,' or \`chuses' instead of \`chooses') all meant to evoke the bygone era Susanna Clarke is writing about: early 19th century England.Strange & Norrell re-imagines English history as the history of English magic. (Harry Potter by way of Jane Austen gives you some idea). The events of the novel begin sometime around 1806, a time when English magic had been relegated to dull history books and practiced only by \\"theoretical magicians,\\" members of gentlemen's clubs who are really just dry and dusty academics. No one actually does magic anymore.Enter Gilbert Norrell, a small, elderly gentleman with a nervous disposition who claims that \\"I myself am quite a tolerable practical magician.\\" Norrell's attempt to revive English magic involves establishing himself as its foremost practitioner, and eliminating all potential rivals to the title of \\"Greatest Magician of the Age.\\"Enter Jonathan Strange: a young man of independent means who almost literally stumbles upon magic as his vocation. He is Norrell's opposite: impulsive, courageous, sociable, and anxious to try new things. Strange comes to discover that magic can be learned not just from books, but from Nature herself: the trees, the stones, the sky, the rivers (talk about \`books in the babbling brooks') just as Romantic artists, poets, and musicians were around the same time enamored of the idea that Nature is the fountain of inspiration.Over the course of 800 pages, Clarke charts the growing enmity between Strange & Norrell, as well as detouring to several subplots, one of which includes a blood-chilling villain: a powerful faerie with the evocative descriptor of \\"The Man with the Thistle-down hair.\\" Amusing cameos are also made by King George III, the Duke of Wellington, Lord Byron, and a whole host of English figures from the Napoleonic era. Strange's encounters with Wellington in Spain and Byron in Venice are calculated to delight any and all Anglophiles.Indeed, the novel entire is a love song to England--or perhaps a melancholy ballad. This is not William Blake's \\"green & pleasant lands,\\" an idyll of the rolling hills, verdant countryside, and quaint cottage manners (though these welcome features do appear from time-to-time). In an encounter between Strange and the wicked faerie, for example, \\"the wood no longer struck Strange as a welcoming place. It appeared to him now as it had at first--sinister, unknowable, unEnglish.\\"Hamlet's line, \\"There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in our philosophy,\\" could have serve as an appropriate epigraph to this story. The unpredictability of Susanna Clarke's world--the eerie sense that a mirror could become a door or a dark forest suddenly spring up in the middle of a city street--owes something to G.K. Chesterton's wild-and-woolly \\"The Man Who Was Thursday,\\" a book Clarke has cited as an influence. As the story progresses, one begins to feel like a disoriented visitor to the \\"kingdom behind the mirror\\" that Strange describes: \\"I wish I could give you an idea of its grandeur! Of its size and complexity! Of the great stone halls that lead off in every direction ... I saw staircases that rose up so high I could not see the top of them, and others that descended into utter blackness.\\"Though Clarke's pacing is deliberate, she holds the reader's attention with her meticulous craftsmanship, characteristically British wit, and the generosity of her visionary imagination. A single one of her footnotes contains more humor, style, and creativity than most fiction released nowadays. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is a sumptuous medieval tapestry of a story--a tapestry that doubles as a magic carpet--gilded with lavish detail, colorful characters, exotic places, and finely-wrought decorative flourishes. \\"Author as magician\\" clich&eacute;s are as applicable to the prodigiously talented Ms Clarke as they are to her sister sorceress, JK Rowling. Prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was very excited to read this book -- I had heard many rave reviews of it, and I was intrigued by the premise. Also, I love a good long book I can sink my teeth into. Sadly, this was not the book for me.It is clearly very well researched, and I did enjoy it, for the first 200 pages or so. I started off really liking the footnotes, which maybe don't add to the story so much as make bibliophiles like me feel cool for reading them. At some point, though, I got tired of them and simply stopped reading them.There were parts of the book I really liked. I particularly enjoyed reading about Stephen Black's interactions with the Fairie who would never take no for an answer. I enjoyed almost all of their scenes together -- the Fairie wants to give Stephen Black the world, and Black, sighing, continuously tries to give it all back. What a great dynamic.In the end, however, there is just too much going on in this book. I was constantly confused by secondary (and tertiary) characters. I never really felt for either Jonathan Strange or Mr. Norrell (good or bad), and that's what destroyed this book for me. I felt much more for Stephen Black than I ever did for either of the magicians, who really felt flat to me. Now, Black is a significant character, but he is one of many, and finally, my interest in his story doesn't make up for my lack of interest in the rest of it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First, I agree w/ all the rave reviews, and yes, the book is long but well worth the effort. Though 26 disks, I highly recommend the audio version because the reading by Simon Prebble is fabulous in bringing to life the characters, particularly those of Wellington and the gentleman w/ the thistle down hair."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The best book I've ever read. No kidding, this is it.You do have to comit to reading it, because the first 150-200 pages are not fast paced and you may find your self bored, but the time invested in these pages will be more then worth it.You will love and hate characters. You will worry about the characters. You will get to the end of this monster book and not believe it's over though you've just read over 800 pages.If Susanna Clarke writes any thing else I will buy it and I will gladly and freely say that she is one of the most talented story tellers I've come across ever."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The plot of this long book is not easily reduced to a digest form-let's just say that two men who can do magic and have come to it by very different roads try to re-introduce magic to England in the early nineteenth century. The basic story is interesting but the subtext is more so. If magic is so powerful why did it die out in the world? Is there more to it and is the power of magic always good or even usually good? These questions are suitably, for a novel, addressed within the confines of the story and there is no resort to parenthetical preaching by the author.Of course \\"magic\\" may be viewed as a placeholder for any type of power wielded by a few over the lives of the many- especially something like science. This analogy is nearly made evident in the plot line by the upswell of journals devoted to magic after the two magicians become well known; by the scholarly manner in which Mr. Norrell goes about learning and applying magic and by the author's use of footnotes.There is no final answer to the moral question of good vs. evil inherent in magic (or science) but the types of issues that any one person might use to make their own decision are examined (we are guided by the earnest enthusiasm, conventional morality and good intentions of Jonthan Strange which are woefully inadequate to address such questions as:is it right to directly kill other men in war, in a fashion against which they have no defense, to support your own side; is providing your side an advantage in war that results in the death of many of the other side moral; would raising the dead be morally acceptable?) Clearly these are the types of questions that were raised in the use of the atomic bomb in WWII and in cloning and other cutting edge science.Interestingly, the end of the book might be a reprise of the beginning (and this is left a little indefinite) with a group of feckless magicians manque sitting around talking about magic but not doing any. Has it died out again? Have Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell decided it best to withdraw from the world and take magic with them (certainly they come to realize that the moral issues raised transcend their power to answer.) Have ordinary men decided that, in fact, ignorance is preferable to knowledge since the risk exceeds the perceived benefit?A reader can enjoy the story alone but the temptation to look under the surface at the author's purpose is nearly irresistible and if one does the entire story is a more work than one might expect from a novel. This can result in reader fatigue in a book this long."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I cannot possibly understand how this book can garner even one poor review. One of my top three favorite books, this book certainly is not one to turn to for conventional gripping action, obvious definition of good and evil, or even a writing fashion typical to our time. But rather than leaving something to be desired because of this, the book exceeds the quality of any other materials that are in these days being published. It does this with beautifully crafted characters (that mesh together perfectly), engaging and humorous dialogue, ethical dilemmas and curious analysis of the definition of \\"good/evil\\", a general elegance, and a fantastically organized history of all its own. Suffice it to say, I LOVE this book. Stimulating and gripping like no other book I have ever read, through beautiful words and scenarios that transcend themselves in order to create something great, this novel grabs the reader, gives them material to identify with and CARE about, and takes them on more twists and turns than they ever could have conceived possible.If you like words, reading, and fiction, you should be set for one of the best reading experiences of your life, no matter the length. To ask that the book be reduced for an easy, quick experience is to ask Mozart to remove a few notes here and there from any of his works. To reduce its length would only, regrettably, reduce the impact and the grandeur of the novel as an experience. And this is not, as it is, a reading experience to be missed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"People calling this Harry Potter just don't read much. I'll not spend much time defending that point. It's not worth it. But, this book is NOT Harry Potter.What it is, however, is a really well-crafted work by a brilliant author. Clarke uses her upbringing, her education, and a boatload of research to flawlessly recreate a conversationally-toned novel that depicts an early 1800s England rife with delightfully rich interactions between colourful characters in a well-painted landscape.The book makes magic important, but not silly. It makes magicians pompous, but not without sticking barbs into their personal hot air balloons. There isn't that candyland sense of magic as depicted in the schoolkid set's hottest fictional property.The chapters read well, and you'll find enough to keep you turning along. The title characters are perhaps the most fleshed out, but I'll accept that. It's appropriate for the style Clarke is mimicking through her narrative. And stories? The book is rife with stories.If you read The Amulet of Samarkand, by Stroud, you'll have a better chance of catching the flavor intended here. In fact, the books go well together. One is for younger readers, but definitely more developed than the early Rowling books. But it would bookend really well with the fiction brought forth by Clarke.Great read, and worth it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book sat like a brick on my shelf for weeks without attracting much interest, until one rainy day when I started reading and couldn't stop. I'm just sorry it had to end. A great mix of wit, storytelling and some geninuely magical writing.Sure, it's a bit slow in parts and any kind of military exploit is tough going for this reader. But every time I let myself be lulled to less than full attention, Clarke brought me back with something extraordinary, like the episode in Venice with the decayed socialite who in her old age can speak only cat or the ships made out of rain.And don't neglect the footnotes despite their tiny typeface--there's a poem about the Raven King in a note early on that ranks among the most moving and lyrical pieces of writing I've encountered in years. A real masterpiece--I'm just sorry I can't read it for the first time again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Sometimes a book is published that seems to be exactly the type you will enjoy, but turns out to be a disappointment. An excellent example of such a book is Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke. This book details how magic is revived by two magicians in England in 1806. It is an alternate history. What the book does well is provide a rich literature for British magic in footnotes, create believable historical characters, and engage the reader to the end. The book falls short though in ending badly, in creating unsympathetic (arguably stupid) characters, and giving the female characters no personality or agency.If the book had had an ending to suit its length it would make up for much, but instead the ending seems patched on. After 782 pages I expect to feel that my reading time was well spent. It is apparent from the fact that \\"darkness\\" covers the world at the novel's end that Clarke intends to write a sequel, but why would I read a sequel to a book if the plot can not not be brought to some kind of conclusion in so many pages? One problem many books seem to have is being too long. I think this is a problem of the author not knowing how to end the novel and not doing enough revision. If something could be told in fewer pages then it probably should be.A second problem with the book is the unsympathetic and boring characters. Neither magician is sympathetic. Jonathan Strange is particularly unpleasant, pompous and self-important. Granted this could be said to be true to the literary form of the British novel, but the plot would be more interesting if the main characters are likeable.Second, I must object to the comparisons of this book with those by Jane Austen (review). The characters in Austen's novels have personality - both the female and the male characters. In this book the female characters are dull and uninteresting. That the women are boring characters is quite surprising since Jonathan Strange's wife, Arabella Strange, plays a significant role in the book. The issue is the total lack of agency that she has. She has no particular skills or intelligence. When she \\"dies\\" her husband finds another young woman to marry, though their marriage is forestalled when Arabella revives. The message of the book seems to be that women are replaceable, but necessary. That is why it is unfair to compare this to Austen. Though Austen's characters had limited agency they did manage to accomplish things, in the private realm. Clarke's female characters are singularly unaccomplished.The fundamental problem with the book is the concept - making an alternate history of a magical Britain and creating it to be as dull as an actual history. The magic has been taken out of magic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Rave and hype is a blade that cuts two ways. It will boost the popularity of any product (or person), but it may also leave people with a faint sense of disappointment, when reality doesn't meet expectations. And that is probably one of the reasons why I am not entirely happy with this novel.It is easy for me to see that I am mostly alone in not being swept off my feet by 'Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell'. It is not that I dislike it at all. I find the story delightful, if somewhat slow. The comparisons to the novels of Jane Austen are apt in the way that Susanna Clarke uses a dry and witty sense of humour to convey her sly observations of human behaviour. The plot is convincing and completely logic within the framework of another, magical England, the overall construction is admirable, and things come to a satisfying end.So what is missing? Perhaps I find the novel clever rather than charming, intriguing rather than engaging. And, most importantly, I find it difficult to like any of the two main characters very much. Mr. Norrell is a miser, a nervous, edgy little man. Jonathan Strange grows on you, but still I miss the kind of feeling that would allow me to really care what happens to him.I will still recommend the book to those who have the patience and time to get involved and will enjoy the cleverness and humour. But I will be careful not to hype it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a wonderful, wonderful book, but you must be prepared to devote some time to its almost 800 pages. While not being overly heavy, the novel is neither a quick and easy read. Susanna Clarke is a wonderful novelist and the story is fascinating, complex and amazingly detailed. (Much of the detail comes in the form of footnotes, where Clarke describes many little stories of magic, fairies and other such fantastic tales). Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is the story of those two men, the last two, the only two magicians in England in the early nineteenth century. The novel follows their story and the story of magic in England at that time. At times, I warn you, the novel moves rather slowly. The ending, however, is quite compelling, well-constructed and ultimately satisfying. Clarke has created a fantastic world, a parallel universe in which the practice of magic is as much a vocation as the law or the church. The story is wonderful, but, what is special for me was the fabulous characters. So many of them are so richly drawn and they grow and develop over time. Characters like these are a rarity and make this novel such an undeniable pleasure to read. Clarke tells the story with much, much subtle humor, along the lines of Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian. As I said before, this is a long book, but well worth every page. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Since so many readers have written so many great reviews I will try to keep mine succinct and to the point:I'm one of those readers who craves a book that will draw me in and engage me the way books did when I was first beginning to read: a book that will take its time with me, and will offer more and more depth with each successive reading. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is that book.Ms. Clarke's writing style reminded me of some of the best (and sadly forgotten) writers of tales of the weird and fantastic from the 20th century: J.S. Sheridan Le Fanu, M.R. James, E.F. Benson, even Mervyn Peake (though much more accessible than the Titus Groan trilogy). Clarke writes with deft, subtle irony and wit, as well as moments of hypnotic strangeness and quiet passion. She assumes that her reader is intelligent, as well as open to something more than the current trend of contemporary confessional narrative. (Don't get me wrong, I loved the Kite Runner, Life of Pi, The Lovely Bones, Middlesex), but, like many of you out there, I enjoy a range of books with one thing in common-- they open up a part of my mind that was formerly uncharted, they show me a window to a place I would never have known existed otherwise. The world of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is vast, ancient and so firmly entrenched in real places and events that I sometimes find myself \\"google-ing\\" the characters names and can't believe that some these personalities and histories are NOT real. If you've read and enjoyed Mark Helprin's \\"Winter's Tale\\", which tells a similar fantasical story about the history of New York City, you'll love this book.If I can use one of Clarke's own metaphors from JS and Mr.N: this work is like travelling the King's Roads-- it is only a glimpse into an immense world that has come into being and now into reality through her role as author (or as some writers feel, intermediary). I got the feeling many times while reading this novel that the characters demanded of Ms. Clarke that this story be told.How many of us have wandered through the bookstore looking for something magical, only to come away disappointed? Well, there is magic in this book, but like real magic it cannot be mastered through Cliffs Notes or \\"Magic for Dummies\\". You will get no immediate gratification. It will take some focus and a little effort to get the hang of-- but don't most things worth doing take a bit of effort? How many books have you devoured recently that a week later you can't remember the plot of? Would you prefer a TV dinner or a home made meal?This book, if you will slow down your usual wild pace and settle in, will stick to your ribs. You'll pick it up and open to a random point and begin reading again. If you're lucky enough to live in England, you might begin to notice the overgrown fairy roads and catch glimses of vague shapes moving along them.Now, my question for the author-- when do we get a book written by John d'Uskglass?Sincerely,L. MooreSan Francisco, CAUSAljmoore@sfsu.edu"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The worst part of this book was that after the huge investment in reading time - it ended! Like a lot of good things in life, JS&MN; started off slowly enough, but after 150 pages or so, I was captivated and found myself taking the book to work and keeping it in my desk drawer.When you're reading a certain kind of book, coming to its ending is a bit of a shock. You've grown so accustomed to the characters and the world they inhabit, that it's utterly startling to turn the last page and realize (once again) that they only live their lives inside the head of the author - and you!I find that I agree with many disparate opinions about this book. If you find your patience wearing thin during the first 100-200 pages, you may well not enjoy this book. If, on the other hand, you're willing to hang in there, you'll find that the author has created a vivid and fully realized world populated with characters that are as strange, yet oddly familiar, and certainly as memorable, as any whom you may ever have met."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book was recommended by a friend whose taste in literature I deeply respect, but after reading the first part of the novel I harrassed him daily that the payoff had better darn good. Lucky for him, it was.Part one: Mr. Norrell read so dreadfully slow and boring I almost didn't make it through. It reads more like the introduction to a dissertation than a fictional novel. I found the footnotes particularly distracting as they are not truly footnotes in that they refer to non-existent books and yet they must be read to make sense of the storyline.Clarke went overboard by writing 300 pages of dull material to emphasize an exceptionally dull character. Heavy editing would have benefitted this part of the novel.Part two: Jonathan Strange did read better than part one, but only because Clarke made the effort create a slightly more likeable, interesting character out of Strange. There are also more interesting locations and events (Strange actually does magic rather than read about it). It still suffers from overwriting and onerous footnotes.Part three: John Uskglass makes up for the tiresome reading in parts one and two. At last the novel comes back round to the two most interesting characters, Childermass and Vinculus (who could have made the previous 600 pages far more entertaining had they been more fully fleshed out). Proving that patience is truly a virtue, Clarke finally folds together the former hundreds of pages into a series of events that bring the story to a very satisfying ending.Clarke's debut is not by any means comparable to a Harry Potter book and I believe that many avid Rowling readers will be disappointed if they are expecting likeable characters, a quickly-paced storyline and loads of action and adventure. This novel is a serious investment in time and energy, but the conclusion is well worth it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"***UPDATED***I was delighted to get an email from amazon about my kindle edition of this book. It seemed a mass mailing to any who had purchased it and mentioned the numerous typos in the edition I had received and said a corrected one was now available. To get it, all I had to do was reply by email \\"yes.\\" Why this step? Downloading the new version would wipe out any notes etc. I might have put in the original edition, so they were avoiding do that without my permission. Nicely done, Amazon! I am now almost done reading the revised kindle edition and the typos are indeed gone.Original review: Fabulous book but the kindle edition introduces numerous typos (scanning errors?) not found in the print (HB) edition and not all the footnotes are hot linked. Poor job of translating to this format-- something that I have (luckily) not encountered previously even with public domain books on the kindle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I simply loved this book, and for the following reasons:1. The use of English. I could almost hear the words spoken in my head in some sort of delicious old-fashioned accent, and I loved it. The carefully written prose was actually what kept me going for the first two hundred pages or so, as I didn't like Mr Norrel, who is the main character for that part of the book.2. The footnotes; I really loved those, because they give information about the world that wouldn't have fitted into the story, but that was still interesting and/or entertaining to read.3. The world. This book seemed very well-researched to me. Clarke seemed to have a good idea in her head of what England with magic would be like, what the magic itself would be like, what kind of clothes the people would wear, in what kind of houses they lived, and so on.4. The characters. I really liked the way Clarke described them, and I particularly loved Jonathan Strange and Childermass. I found them to be attractive, even though I have never seen any pictures of them, because of how they seemed to move and talk and because of their personalities. Loved them.This book was a slow read, people are right about that, but I didn't see that as a bad thing. In a world where everything goes fast, this book allows someone to take a bit of rest and stop to enjoy the scenery. It is written slowly enough that you can pay attention to the characters, the storyline, the world, and the way it is written all at the same time. I find that a nice change from books that go so fast that I have finished them in a few hours, but where I can hardly remember how it was written or what the names of the main characters were. Reading this book left me happy and content.To those who say you need patience for this book: I am a person who is usually very easily distracted, easily bored, and I quickly change what I'm doing unless something really interests me. This book interested me from the first few sentences because I liked the authors choice of words. What you need for this book is not patience, but to be able to read a book, not to be spoon-fed a storyline, but to enjoy a pretty piece of writing. There were only a few parts of the book where I was actually reading to know what would be happening next; I mostly just read for the pleasure of reading itself. This book is like a beautiful landscape; don't expect it to do the entertaining for you, but instead take the effort and time to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"When you begin a novel that spans more than 800 pages and you start noticing footnotes (shriek!!), it should serve as a warning. One the good side, Ms. Clarke's writing is quite good, and very consistent considering it is done in an \\"Old English\\" style.She is extremely detail oriented; leaving no stone unturned. Her development of a \\"history within a work of historical fiction\\" would not be matched by many authors. Even the footnotes are so well thought out, I began wondering if I was reading history, imagined or real? I would also have to say that the writing, in some spots, is quite witty and humorous! Do yourself a favor, give it at least 100 pages before deciding this book is not for you. The pace is slow and it definitely takes a while to start making some sense of character and plotline.I think it's best to say that if JK Rowling and Jane Austen were to co-produce a novel, this would be it. A little Harry Potter, a little drawing room comedy, a little swashbuckling thrown in for good measure.Now, for the bad news. It is just too darned long! There are way too many plot lines with secondary characters; some of which are revisited after several hundred pages! At this point, you've forgotten what the plot line was or you simply do not care. It's apparent that Ms. Clarke had a great many ideas roaming around in her head. It's unfortunate she felt the need to include all of them into one book. Imagine, Rowling trying to squeeze everthying she had in mind for Harry into one or two books!Personally, I think one book with a tight plot and without an excess of characters would have been more effective. Alternately, I think she could have (with a shorter novel) have begun to build up steam for successive novels and make it a series.But, hey, let's be honest here, too. I did finish the entire book and there was certainly enough to keep me wanting to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of the strangest, longest, most unusual novels I've ever read. Since I like unusual things, and since I've read a lot of books, I found this book to be very interesting. The plot is different, the style of writing is rather arcane and obsolete, and the whole effect is eccentric, to say the least.The setting is the early 19th Century, during the British war against Napoleon's France. When Mr. Norrell is approached by a group of men who study magic, he demonstrates his skill with the arcane and forgotten talents of magic. The idea soon occurs to people: he can utilize his talents to help defeat the French usurper on the continent. Soon, a second man who's learned magic on his own, separately from Norrell, comes forward. His name is Jonathan Strange. Strange and Norrell soon collaborate, and Strange goes to Spain to help fight Bonaparte in the employ of the Duke of Wellington.The whole of this book is so fun that it's hard to explain. The author includes various footnotes, as if this was a history book, and there are a few historical characters and incidents. Events have some relation to reality, though of course the author includes \\"English magic\\" in the history of the world, and there are strange events in the country's past, notably a monarch known as the \\"Raven King\\" who has no real name, as far as anyone knows. One amusing note: Napoleonic fans will be amused to see how D'Erlon's Corps gets lost between Quatre Bras and Ligny here.I enjoyed this book a great deal. There have been many references to the writing style and invocations of Rowling, Patrick O'Brian, and Austen. Frankly they're all appropriate, but in some ways this book is unique. None of those people wrote a 1000-page book, for instance, and none of their stories have quite the weird aura of authenticity that this one has. I enjoyed it a great deal, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a delightful Frankenstein's Monster of a book, stitching together parts and themes from many authors to make something utterly sui generis. If I'm still not sure how one or two of the minor parts fit in with the whole, the book still functions very well as an engrossing, often dazzling entertainment. Just as J.K. Rowling hit the jackpot by imagining a school for young wizards, so Clarke devised a winning formula by imagining early nineteenth-century England as a country literally haunted by its medieval magical past, seeking to recover its wizardly power to outfox that devil \\"Buonaparte.\\" The two men who answer their nation's call could not be more different: crabbed, secretive Gilbert Norrell, who fears the prospect of magic falling into untutored or unscrupulous hands, and bold, impetuous Jonathan Strange, who seeks Byronic glory in the recovery of English magic. (Byron, in fact, makes several appearances in the book, as does the Duke of Wellington.) The book could be described as an amalgam of Mary Shelley and Jane Austen (with the delicious shocks and surprises of the one, and the perceptive drawing-room comedy and fully fleshed characters of the other), with a good measure of Tolkienesque fantasy thrown in. Clarke wittily writes in an Austenian pastiche, even to the point of using authentic spellings of the period (i.e. \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose,\\" \\"connexion\\" for \\"connection\\"), which makes her matter-of-fact descriptions of supernatural horrors all the more effective. The book sprawls over nearly 800 pages, and it may be, as with \\"Piers Plowman,\\" that no one will ever wish it longer. But anyone susceptible to fantasy and magic will find this an excellent read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"My personal opinion is that this genre holds some of the most creative andtalented writers of any field, and this book is proof of that. Clarke'swriting upholds the English tradition in fiction which so perfectly rendersthe setting,the time period, and the historical characterizations sobeautifully that she seamlessly makes us believe everything she wants us to.And, the other thing, I am so thankful for an Epic without the Epicbloodletting. Clarke breathes life into the wonderful legacy left to usby Tolkien, and then takes it all the way to make it something new andshiny again. And without the elves and magic swords. I loved this book.May be tiring for someone not used to this \\"Dickinsonian\\" style of writing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Of all the books in the world to read, I don't think this one is worth the investment of time: reading 1000+ pages of small type.Good: Masterful, at times beautiful, use of language. Innovative plot and magic system.Bad: Lifeless characters that did not engage me. Slow-moving, at times tedious, plot -- especially in the first several hundred pages.Summary: To me, this entire book feels like a fantastical Jane Austen novel, only longer and with less dry wit. Personally, I only enjoy Jane Austen in small doses; so, this book was not very enjoyable for me. I still gave it 4 stars, because I don't deny that this book contains pretty writing. I understand why many people like it, but if you're not into it after the first 200 pages, just put it down and find something else. The structure does not substantially change, and you'll probably regret the wasted time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Ms. Clarke's novel is refreshing such that she creates a world in which you can lose yourself. She is a gifted and talented writer who manages to make a very long novel continually entertaining. I found myself waiting for the novel to become slow or boring, however, Ms. Clarke does not allow this to happen. I highly recommend this book everyone who loses faith in contemporary writing. There are great writers around."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is almost impossible to classify. It's clearly fiction, but how much is based on fact? Are the facts laid out in the story actual English lore, or created solely by the author? Parts of it are written as a novel, but it's laid out as an historical text, replete with footnotes and bibliographical references. I didn't know what to make of it, so decided to simply accept it as it was written.The commencement of the book was rather difficult to get through. I was still struggling in my mind to figure out what it was about, and found it slow and ponderous. Once I cleared my mind of questions (how zen), I was better able to follow the story line and really get into it. If you can get past the first hundred pages, then you can enjoy this book.The only complaint I do have is about those footnotes. There were simply too many. They slowed the pace of reading, because the reader is constantly forced to stop the main story and look up the relevant footnote. Constantly. There were some instances where a footnote was so long that it stretched across two or three pages. Sometimes the footnotes took up more space on a page than the actual text. Although the use of footnotes was a rather clever device, which changed the entire genre of the book, they often bogged down the story and were just plain too numerous.I won't go into characters or plot or story lines, because anybody can figure that out upon actually reading the book. This is a good challenge for a \\"pro\\" reader (one who revels in books over 500 pages long)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is like a grown up Harry Potter! It tells a portion of England's history, but with the added twist of magic. The story and the storytelling is fabulous, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it is VERY long. Sometimes the \\"fake\\" footnotes take up pages in themselves.I listened to this book in my car and I think that worked out better than if I'd tried to read it. It takes awhile to get into the story, but once you do, you'll never put it down (or stop driving around the block, in my case)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Somehow this book fell below my radar, and I had forgotten its existence until about a month ago when a friend of mine who happens to be in a Federal Prison found it in the library, read it, and praised it highly to me.Well, since it has been available for 5 years, my review is unnecessary, and I will make it brief. This book is completely unique in theme, and seems to come out of nowhere, with no real precedent in English fantasy literature. The style is wonderful, a very affectionate parody of early 19th Century British prose, and the characters are all interesting (and many are lovable), and despite the large number of characters they're all easy to keep separate.The turn of events kept surprising me, and I certainly had no idea how things were going to end. In fact, our two major characters are left in a sort of limbo, and I hope we may see a sequel someday. The good guys, like Childermass and Stephen Black, are rewarded, while the bad guys get their just deserts. Two women who have very literally been consigned to a fate worse than death are eventually restored to a semblance of normal existence. And at the end, magic is alive and well in England after centuries when it seemed to have vanished. Even the nameless Raven King has returned, but not so's you'd notice it!I hope the author has not written herself out with this volume which I am told consumed a decade of her life, during which time her hair turned snow-white. I look forward to anything else she does, whether it involves the same fantasy world or not."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I see a low star count for this one. But I absolutely loved it. I read a heap of books last year and this one really struck me. It was admittedly a tedious book and demanded a little patience. But it drew me in and offered an incredible vision, cozy and subtle, dark and magical, lyrical and intelligent. A neat blend of high fantasy and real world. Politics and magic. Yes, you need patience for this read. But if you care for an emersive fiction with cobblestone streets, shadows, portals into other worlds, war, magic, and England, then this gem is the best you can get. If you need a fast-paced thrill ride, then you might want to wait until you're in the mood for something more moody. highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Can a magician kill a man by magic?\\" Lord Welllington asked Strange. Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. \\"I suppose a magician might,\\" he admitted, \\"but a gentleman never could.\\"-----Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is a fantastic work of fiction, providing an alternate take on British history circa 1807-1820. To go with this time setting, the author, Susanna Clarke, writes in a style to fit the times, somewhat like blending Charles Dickens and Jane Austen together. The story is intricate and rich. The air of mystery hangs on every page, teasing the reader from the beginning to the very end. The sudden changes in the novel throw the reader down unforeseen paths, leaving his senses constantly on guard. The subtleness of magic permeates throughout England, though there are only two practical magicians. The backdrop of the French Revolution and England's war against Napoleon set the plot in an all-too-real world.Yes, JS & MN is an amazing work of art. The characters are very well defined and extremely complex. Mr Norrell is England's only practical magician, and he spends all his time collecting books of magic and books on magic, as well as sending his servant Childermass out to persuade theoretical magicians to forsake their studies. Jonathan Strange finds that he can do magic, and he seeks the tutelage of Mr Norrell, quickly mastering technique and rising to become England's second practical magician. Each man is connected in an intricate web of nobility and other well-to-dos, as well as a few lesser men.Clarke did wonders in her characterization, and there were qualities that I liked and disliked in many of the characters, especially with Strange and Norrell. Of course, Childermass was well defined, as well as Lady Pole and Stephen Black. Ah, there were many folks that I really liked.The plot of the book is also compelling. The folks of England remember back when magic was more common, back in the times of the Raven King, back when magicians conversed with fairies and magic was not lost. The main plot of the book centers around Norrell and Strange deciding to try and return magic to England. Typically, the magic is not explosive and avant-garde, but instead subtle and simple, like making illusions in the rain against the Frenchmen.Perhaps the most compelling mystery throughout the book is the many references to the Raven King. His character builds throughout the story, through footnotes and lowly folk gossiping. (Clarke uses many footnotes throughout the book to provide additional anecdotes and more info on certain subjects. This aspect seems almost like a history book, perhaps even one that Mr Norrell himself would read...) By the end of the novel, I was eager to learn all I could about the King.I really cannot say enough about this book. It was funny, witty, suspenseful, exciting, and at times even mundane, but never really boring. There are few idle words in this tome, and I think Clarke knew exactly what she was doing when she was writing each and every part of the book. I savored every quirky story. There were many quotes that I would like to put here, but I feel that I would rob you of something if I did so.I can't think of any negatives about this Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, besides the fact that it's so large that it's unwieldy and difficult to carry easily everywhere. I strongly urge you to read this book if you want to experience something unlike anything you've read before. While the novel does advance slowly at some points, it is not a boring read. No, it is a wonderful read. It's like taking a trip down an old familiar road, and remembering things sweetly passed. It's like eating chocolate ice cream for the first time. It is superb, and I praise Susanna Clarke for her brilliant debut."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I love this book, read it years ago and when it was published for the Kindle, immediately bought it and enjoyed reading it a second time.

In between I have dipped into other books, a short story collection of Alice Monroe's, a non-fiction book about the first trans-Atlantic telegram used to capture a murderer, a couple of English mysteries, and the latest elegant novella by Louis Auchincloss. But every few days I would plunge back again into the very odd and tantalizing world of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as chronicled by their creator Susanna Clarke.This spell binding novel is about two magicians: one old and fusty and secretive; one young, handsome, and daring. From the outset it must be accepted by the reader that these are real magicians, not people who use sleight of hand to present the illusion of magic. To fully enjoy this tremendous novel, we must \\"suspend our disbelief\\" as Coleridge urged us to do when reading poetry. We must believe in a centuries old tradition of English magic in which the worlds of faerie and the human world were often co-mingled, not always with good results for the inhabitants of either kingdom.The year is 1807, and in England everyone is worried about Napoleon and his empire building obsessions which seem intent on subsuming the British Isles. Remarkably, a reclusive magician named Mr. Norrell is able to convince England's political and military powers to give magic a chance in defeating Napoleon's forces. Soon Norrell learns of a young, untutored magician of remarkable natural ability who wishes to learn more about the art of magic. Reluctantly Norrell takes Jonathan Strange under his tutelage, only to suffer the quite common fate of seeing his student rapidly outpace him in popularity and success.The two magicians are now at odds and go their separate ways, at least externally. But each secretly wishes to continue to outpace and impress the other, and the fates of each are inextricably bound. Jonathan is drawn into ever darker, more dangerous realms of magic, unleashing forces that ultimately threaten the lives of those he holds most dear. Meanwhile Mr. Norrell, deeply mortified by his student's independence and disregard of his cautious precepts, sets about discrediting his pupil in every possible way. In addition to the tangled relationship between these two magicians, there are many interwoven tales of others affected by the magic called forth, knowingly or unknowingly, by Strange and Norrell.Many times in the book various characters become aware of magic happening to them, and around them. Objects in rooms disappear or seem to be oddly askew, the air tingles, darkens, or glows, and the world's protective skin seems to be turned inside out, revealing something quite astonishing on the other side. Reading this I felt myself drawn into this otherworldly awareness of magic being just a breath away, viewed out of the corner of my eye, slightly out of focus, but unmistakably there. Author Susanna Clarke has created a virtuoso performance of character, setting, and rich, unforgettable story and subtext that lingers long afterwards and continues to beckon, like a path into the world of faerie itself."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I love this book-- if you like fantasy, but also regency/victorian period dramas, then this is it for you, the perfect creation. If you like either of these genres but NOT the other, then this is the perfect gateway to a whole new world! If you like neither of these genres, then WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU! TRY IT OUT RIGHT NOW. Seriously, take a chance. Give it a hundred pages. Once Jonathan Strange shows up in the story (who is possibly the most charismatic character ever created) then the book takes off at a gallop. Take a chance with it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book was quite long - and it certainly had some slow moving parts (particularly in the beginning!). In fact, there were times that I regretted picking it up in the first place, but, I must admit, as the story drew on (and on!) it really improved. And the ending more than made up for the duller sections.My main complaint though was that the book was broken up into rather anecdotal chapters, which stole some of the cohesiveness of the book as a whole. That being said, there were definitely sections that I really liked - such as King George's and Lord Byron's \\"guest appearances.\\" There were some unanswered questions, of course, but it was very fascinating premise and the amount of details alone were impressive. It certainly had a real epic quality."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"During the Napoleonic Wars, Mr. Norrell, the first English magician in several centuries appears and starts using his powers to aid England against Napoleon. Mr. Norrell believes that he is the only person responsible enough to wield magic and proceeds to try to accumulate all of the known books of magic and prevent anyone one else from learning magical skills. However, when Jonathan Strange appears with some strong innate skills, Mr. Norrell feels forced to take him on as a apprentice. Eventually Strange becomes tired of Norrell's restrictive view of magic and goes off on his own, creating a deep rivalry between the two. Strange also faces danger as he tries to contact fairies and the Raven King, a legendary magician who ruled Northern England in the past.I have mixed feeling about this book. I really enjoyed the wit of it with many individual entertaining scenes. The overall story turns out to be interesting as well. The big problem with the book is its length. It takes forever to get the story moving, and up until about the last third of the book it is very slow-moving. In many ways, it reads like a book that was written in the 19th century, which I sure was the idea, but which can also be somewhat offputting to modern readers. Overall, I found that the strong writing and humor compensate for the slow plot and would recommend the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this book. Even though it was huge (Over 1000 pages) it flew by. I had to keep telling myself to slow down time and time again. The way it was written was amazing, the mix of history and fiction, I kept getting confused and hoping somehow some of these things had really happened. I loved the idea of real magic resurfacing. The writing is beautiful and humorous, like a cross between Sense & Sensibility and Harry Potter. Also, I find most authors choke when it comes to the ending, but this book had suspense from the beginning to the very end. The only complaint I had was a few characters didn't get wrapped up in the ending. All in all a stellar read!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After reading the negative reviews of this book, I thought it would be helpful to clear up some misconceptions and set out a quick test of whether a reader is likely to enjoy \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\".Here's my take: it's NOT Harry Potter. If you want a quick-paced book, with lots of action and easy-to-read prose, THIS IS NOT YOUR BOOK. Here's the test: If, by the end of the first chapter, you have not laughed out loud or even chuckled, YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. And that's perfectly OK - I hope I've saved you from buying it (nothing's worse, IMHO, than buying a book you end up hating).I personally love this book - I'd easily rate it as one of the best books I've read in years. But I also love Jane Austen, Mervyn Peake and Lord Dunsany. To me, this book is both an homage to and a witty send-up of 19th century literature. But you have to like that kind of literature and \\"get\\" the jokes that the author is making (both in the style of the prose as well as the play on historical events) to really enjoy this book.I want to make it clear that I think it's fine if people hate this book. However, I am troubled by comments that suggest it's a bad book. That's not true - it's simply a matter of preferences. For example, I happen to detest Dickens and like comic books. But I don't think that Dickens is an awful writer and comic book writers are superior to him - Dickens just isn't my style. So I'd emphasize that, in my opinion, Susanna Clarke is a phenomenal writer. But the pleasure of this book lies as much (if not more) in the way it's written as the events that take place - so if you're not interested in prose for its own sake, it'll be hard going."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm giving Jonathan Strange a 5 for the simply reason that I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, but I'd warn all readers to be more wary than usual of reviews (including this one). More than many books, this one I think will be a matter of true personal taste and experience will be your only truly accurate guide.To begin with, Strange is often referred to as a \\"fantasy\\" novel, an \\"adult\\" Harry Potter (ignoring Potter's self-obvious claim to millions of \\"adult\\" readers). If you're expecting fantasy in the form of Harry Potter magic (though done by bigger people employing bigger words) or Lord of the Rings-like quests and elves, be advised neither is here. Fantastical might be a better genre-word here than \\"fantasy\\". There is certainly magic here, both human and faerie (very different forms), but when one of the major storylines is how magic has gradually disappeared from England and when one of the major characters has as his purpose the destruction (not Black Tower hordes of evil monsters destruction but economic, social, or legal destruction) of those who would become magician, as you might imagine there isn't a lot of magic going on, at least not for the first few hundred pages. Those looking for a lot of wand-waving or fireball-flinging would best look elsewhere.One of the signs of the book's maturity is that one can't really generalize too much about the magic in it. Magic is almost invisible in the beginning and near-constant toward the end. It is scholarly, bookish and tedious and also vigorous, physical and exciting. It is human and Faerie and a melding of the two. It is all-powerful (Spain complains about the rearrangement of several of their country's geographic landmarks) and ineffective (you can see visions in water but they seldom are helpful). It is the subject of dry articles in academic journals and the cause of near-rumbles in local taverns. It is wonderfully complex and realistic. It is at times dazzlingly original (ships and sailors formed of rain, statues anguished over crimes committed beneath them), and handled often as if it is the most pedestrian, mundane aspect of daily life, except for the whole raise-the-dead, towering-shaft-of-neverending-night sort of thing.As for other fantasy genre elements, there is no band of diverse creatures setting out on a quest to defeat some dark lord; no tall, shining elvish archers; no nomadic horse-loving tribes. If you want to find a Tolkien analogue, it isn't Lord of the Rings but Smith of Wooten Major, an often forgotten story about the collision of the human and faerie realms.Strange is also referred to as a historical novel. It is set in early 19th century England, Wellington and other historical figures make their appearance, characters travel in carriages rather than cars. But the book's historical setting, like its magical element, is more pervasive than emphatic. It exists alongside the characters and story and serves them rather than being front and center as is true of so many historical novels. One is always aware of the historical setting, but I don't think anyone would come away from Strange with a truly enlarged understanding of the time period, as say one might from Lindsay Davis' mystery series set in ancient Rome, where specific foods and social rituals and forms of clothing etc. are constantly set before the reader. The setting is utterly believable, I'm sure meticulously researched, detailed and accurate, but it still doesn't feel like a \\"historical novel\\". Which from my view is a strength not a weakness.My advice therefore is not to place your should I read or not bet on the book's labels. What should you know?It's long. Very long. Longer than it seems according to the page count, since there are pages and pages of small-type footnotes throughout. Is it too long? I'm sure many people will think so. It takes its time in setting up story and character, leisurely is probably too fast-paced a description. It is far from compelling in the first few hundred pages in the sense of \\"must turn page to find out what happens\\". Personally, I found it compelling through character and style rather than plot. If you prefer plot, then prepare to be somewhat bored until the latter third where it moves along more speedily and in more traditional compelling manner.It's discursive. Very discursive. It will wander away quite often and sometimes at great length from the major plot lines, interrupting with academic asides or summaries/analyses of old folktales, or snippets of poetry. Again, some will probably find this maddening, some will simply skip the footnotes entirely. I liked the discursive nature of the book and found the footnotes often as enjoyable as the main text, always tolerable, and only rarely annoying.It is often beautifully written. it's one of those books where you'll pause over a line to reread it or let its effect linger a little while, whether due to the simple beauty of description, the efficiency of its brevity, or its dry wit. It is a true pleasure to read. Not to find out what happened. Simply to read.It's often funny. It is at times frighteningly dark. It has at times a domestic feel and at other times a grand mythic feel, especially in connection to the Raven King, the mysterious magician-king of old North England who also ruled over a land of Faerie and allegedly another land bordering Hell who disappeared centuries ago with the promise of return. Whether that return is to be wished for or not is the core dispute between the two magicians of the title.It is character driven. There are many wonderful scenes of \\"action\\", more so toward the latter half, but they tend to be understated while the book focuses more on character. Both Strange and Norrell are fully-fleshed out characters, totally believable in all their assets and flaws. We are given the time to know them and if Strange seems more appealing due to his more active role in the book, Norrell is no less accessible or recognizable for his minor jealousies and passiveness, though we may wish to deny the same traits in ourselves. The story of their meeting, their partnership, their sundering and what comes next is one of the major storylines and one of the more engaging, even if it happens mostly on the interior and despite the fact that the characters themselves are not particularly compelling by nature.There is a lot more one could say about this book. It's a lengthy work and a dense work. One could discuss the conflict between wild faerie and civilized England--presented in shades of grey rather than black and white. The sharp social commentary. The distant narrative tone. But this review is edging close to the length of one of her footnotes, so I'll bring it to a close.Try Jonathan Strange. If it doesn't draw you along, keep trying. If it still doesn't, try skimming footnotes, skimming pages, dipping in now and then to keep up on plot and catch one of those well-crafted lines, then come in for a landing and try again word by word. It isn't a rollercoaster ride on a summer Saturday . But it is a memorably gorgeous walk on a crisp autumn day, filled with slow sensual delight. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is hard to describe. In terms of genre, it is both fantasy and well-researched historical fiction, which makes it a rather rare bird. The writing style falls somewhere between Austen and Gaiman and Dickens. The plot is somewhat rambling and disjoint, forsaking the standard quest narratives; in some ways it is a fantastic history of England, in some ways a tale of rescue. If it is anything, it is the story of the relationship between the two title characters, but one of them is not even introduced for two hundred pages.. Unlike most of the better modern fantasy, this book is not a page-turner, and I mean that as a compliment; rather, it is a book to savor. Not that the plot isn't engaging - it is - but I frequently found myself comparing how many pages I'd read to how many I had left, deciding that I was burning through the book too quickly, and setting it down while I turned the passages I'd just read over in my head.As befits a character-driven fantasy, almost all the characters are likeable, or at least understandable; even when they take larger-than-life action, they do so for incredibly human reasons. There are also a number of historical-character cameos, all of them well-drawn and believable..I do not agree with Mr. Gaiman's statement that this is \\"the finest English novel of the fantasticke to appear in the past 70 years.\\" Tolkien is better; his work has an epic grandeur that this book lacks, perhaps because Susanna Clarke so realistically and concretely evokes the precise historical era at which she aims : the imagination has a somewhat wider canvas to paint on when reading Tolkien or similar high fantasy, with more blank space to be filled in by the reader. Setting fantasy in a specific historical setting means that the magic stands out against the realistic elements, rather than dictating the whole scope and shape of the world, and readers who prefer their fantasy more total - who prefer to sink themselves into a wholly fantastic world - may prefer other books. (On the other hand, readers who prefer to sink themselves into specific historical eras, but still appreciate fantasy elements, will no doubt enjoy this book, especially the ways in which the author incorporates magical elements into the recorded historical happenings of the era, such as, for example, the battle of Waterloo). I would also argue that Mr. Gaiman's novels are \\"better,\\" in that I personally prefer them slightly, if only because they tend to have a little more tension and action in them.But on the whole this book is very, very good, and I recommend it highly to anyone who likes historical fiction, fantasy novels, or just quality writing and well-drawn, likeable characters. This is not, however, fantasy for the action-oriented, or for those who desire a bad guy or monster every few pages. This is a book to be read while sitting in a comfortable chair by a warm fire, something drinkable near at hand; a book to be quietly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Historical fiction is hard, because you have to respect the past while seeming to move about freely within it. Genre fiction is also hard, because you have to work to create a totally believable world without letting any of the scaffolding show. And when you try to blend the two, the difficulty of the task is compounded. It's wondrous that Susanna Clarke pulls this off, and miraculous that she does it so well. Not a note rings false. She imagines Great Britain at the close of the Age of Enlightenment, in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, and she also imagines that world having the study and investigation of magic as one of its core components. Her Gilbert Norrell is one of the miracles of this book -- precisely the sort of magician that the era of Hume, Dr. Johnson, and Benjamin Franklin would produce. Her Jonathan Strange is also totally believable -- a product of the era of Byron and Shelley who is also reminiscent of Jane Austen's Mr. Knightley, yet just as sardonic and intellectually venturesome as his sometime mentor, sometime adversary. And John Childermass, Norrell's servant and conscience, is brilliantly realized. And I could say the same about just about every other character in this book. Every step of the way, her vast, crowded, action-packed, yet intensely thoughtful book works perfectly. I usually hate these analogies, but imagine if Jane Austen teamed up with China Mieville to write a book with J. K. Rowling, William Makepeace Thackeray, and John Le Carre as an editorial advisory committee. (By the way, I am a historian who works on this period, so when I say that this book works as a historical novel as well as a fantasy novel, it's the real deal.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"1. Have you read the Amazon excerpt or, better yet, the first chapter? If not, please do so. This, for better or worse, is what the next several hundred pages are going to be - dense, semi-archaic prose; voluminous footnotes in tiny print, few of which relate to the plot; and a very focussed, extremely painstaking approach to what some may feel is a genre best treated with a little less solemnity.2. Do you have a LOT of time on your hands? The book demands as much. It does not easily lend itself to brief sessions of reading over an extended period of time.3. Would it bother you to spend all that time and all those pages on a narrative whose main characters are somewhat less than sympathetic? If any of the answers are \\"No\\" then maybe another book would provide a more pleasurable reading experience.However, please note the five star rating. This is a magical experience, with double meaning fully intended. I've read the book twice from cover to cover in the last six months and will probably revisit it again this summer. Ms. Clarke has created a world which compares, in richness and detail, with any of her contemporaries and most of her predecessors. The plot holds together remarkably well considering the infinity of digressions she provides. I am dying for a sequel. If you're interested, but not convinced, I would strongly recommend taking advantage of Barnes and Noble's comfortable chairs, or those in your closest library, and perusing a chapter or two. If you're not hooked by then, let it go. Otherwise, clear your calendar for the next several days and enter a new world. Real English magic may not exist, but Ms. Clarke's will more than suffice."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First of all, I never believe book-hypes. They virtually say the same thing over and over again, it will be the next Tolkien, if Harry Potter has fed your thirst for fantasy, try this, making unworthy comparisons that only a ridiculously gullible person would believe. Now I did not believe that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell would live up to its hype, yet I bought it all the same. I was dumbfounded.To start out with, it's every bit as complete as Lord of the Rings, Dune, and Harry Potter, creating a convincing history of magic and magicians that's almost believeable. In every chapter there's at least 3 footnotes elaborating on fairies, various magicians, magical books, and the like, some betraying the term \\"footnote\\" by being several pages long. But they do not get tedious.Also, the characters are wonderously detailed, having they're own funny, shocking, even haunting personalities, with names that depict the nature of the character just like in Dickens. The thing is, neither Jonathan Strange or Mr. Norrell are your ideal appealing characters. The side characters, such as Stephen Black,Childermass, and John Segundus, would be your ideal main characters. Yet it is their flaws that somehow makes them so likeable.As well as funny and enthralling, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is also utterly haunting. The fairies and their somewhat ambitious acts chilled me, and whenever the gentleman with thistledown hair took the stage I muttered \\"Oh please no.\\"As for the plot, too much must not be given away, but essentially, Mr. Norrell, the only practical magician in England for centuries, emerges from hiding and proceeds to make all sorts of wonders happen, and is soon joined by Jonathan Strange. Yet signs of the greatest mideval magician of all time's return, The Raven King, have found their way into into the story, while Stephen Black, an African servant, is held in thrall by a fairy.Do not hesitate to buy it, it may be intimidatingly long, but I promise you, you won't want it to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a startlingly original fantasy. No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell combines the style and pace of a Victorian era novel with a dash of magic and it's resulting messes to create a 1000 page book that is bulging with mock historical digressions and footnotes that will either make you pull your hair out or fall off your chair laughing. The Victorian style and pace make the fantasy die-hards go crazy, but it fills the historian and Victorian fans with delight. The things that are most frustrating to the average reader are the slow pace (I'll admit I nearly gave up near the end) and historical digressions. To an audience that is more used to such things, however it is a very fun and interesting book.The book follows the stories of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, although it is 260 pages before we meet Strange and begin volume two and we start to follow his story. This slow introduction gets a little frustrating because Mr. Norrell is a very horrible man and the lack of moral characters starts to irritate you after two hundred pages or so. A quarter in to the book, we finally meet our protagonist and the reader begins to get more comfortable reading through the chaos caused by these two magicians learning magic and their participation in the war against France. After the war is concluded the plot slows down again and things get dull for a while. This would be fine place to end the book except that some of the plot threads still have not made any progress since the beginning of the book and characters like the man with thistle down hair still are complete mysteries to the reader. To keep the reader in confusion about a problem and then slow the pace of the book down is very unkind and it makes you want to give up on the book altogether. Then volume three begins three where there is a horrific mess with everything and all seems lost for a good 100 pages. This is like the climax of the book but it is so drawn out and slow that you begin to go crazy (and so does the main character at this point in the book). Finally the book ends with a bang and you still don't feel completely resolved with all of the issues raised but you shrug your shoulders and hold your breath to see if it has a sequel. In general, the book has a stop and go sort of feel where you can't put the book down in some places and you can't bear to pick it up in others. This is just fine for a patient reader but it can make everyone else go nuts.The other thing that can frustrate the average reader are the historical digressions. Throughout the book there are footnotes, and sometimes they take up more of the page than the actual text. This is convenient because the reader can skip them at will or read them and enjoy the humorous tone of the mock-historical observations, but some of the digressions are in the text. For instance, the first 200 pages barely advance the plot at all because the protagonist has not even been introduced to the reader. A great deal of that is spent on discussing Mr. Norrell's experiences with high society and frankly it is quite dull to read. These can all be very discouraging when all you want to do is to finish the book off.The book is very long and can make a reader impatient with the plot lines that never resolve and the slow pace and sometimes you just want it to end. Don't go into it expecting an action-packed Harry Potter adventure, but with patience and a lot of time, you'll finish the sucker off with a feeling of satisfaction that you managed to kill the 1000 page beast that has been lurking on your book shelf unfinished for who knows how long."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't believe anyone can write a reasonable review until they've finished a book - and this book is a beautiful example of why. I had a completely different opinion of the book at the end than at, say, 250 pages (where it seems not a few folks put this heavy tome down). You see, the book grows on you like a very subtle magic spell. This is how it went for me:The first 150 pages, all about Mr Norrell, are fusty and tedious, just like he is. The tedium is broken by the footnotes which simply sparkle with promises of how big and complex Clarke's world will be. Several characters pulled me along - Vinculus is a marvelous gypsy full of life and tantalizing malice - and Childermass - well, could he be the mysterious Raven King or a secret magician?In the next couple of hundred pages Jonathan Strange is introduced. Clarke refuses to moderate her idea of him - he should be romantic, but he simply can't be - he's just too true to the driven scientist - he only has one passion, and he doesn't even begin to get comfortable it until well on (i.e., magic).The historical setting (heavy in the mid section of the book) is \\"litely\\" handled - but it does make one go to other sources to check out Wellington and Byron and King George - so there are fun history facts to check on.And then, in the last third of the book, things really start to happen - the man with the thistledown hair is a fully realized villian, and his victims are indeed pitiable. (One of them, Steven Black, has a wrap-up that is worth the whole 800 pages.)By the last 200 pages everything is just absolutely swimming along. Gads, Clarke even introduces a classic (perfect) heroine (Emma Greysteele)! Everyone is busy huffing and puffing to perfection. Small irritating people grow into bad guys, bland people start to really deserve rescuing, the magicians are brewing up real magic, and Good and Evil start to be recognizable. The ending is heart-thumping - everyone is busy busy busy interacting. The best part is that Dr. Norrell and Jonathan Strange have developed into a dual magical entity - it's quite wonderfully done.So, after the first 150 pages I would have said the book was a 2. After 500 it was a 3. And by the end it was terrific - 4 stars! This is a book that you need to keep with 'til the end. Well done!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In general I dislike fantasy books. Harry Potter excepted, most strike me as third rate derivatives of Lord of the Rings. So I bought Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell for my mother, & read the beginning just out of curiosity. After only two pages I knew I was in for a treat, and so it proved. I haven't enjoyed a book so much for years!There are a very few books that I wish I could somehow erase from my memory, just to have the pleasure of reading them again for the first time. Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is one of those.Ms Clark has an imagination easily the equal of J.K.Rowling. The story is packed with memorable images - a fleet of battleships conjured out of rain; a wooden mermaid on a ship's prow, who, when animated, uses all the insults learnt from generations of sailors. The author's descriptions of sounds and colors are quite haunting: 'not quite blue, not yet lilac, not quite grey - the color of heartache'. Also like Harry Potter, everything and everyone is perfectly & evocatively named, some of the names of spells are wonderful.This magical environment is superimposed not on an English boarding school this time, but on Regency England with its stock cast of upstairs & downstairs characters, mad kings, foppish gentlemen callers and Napoleonic generals. Ms Clark merges the magical with the mundane in a completely natural way. 'In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, faries in England were fond of adding to their magic, exhortations to random collections of Christian saints. Fairies were baffled by Christian doctrine, but they were greatly attracted to saints...' The Duke of Wellington's battles in Spain, with the aid of a military magician, seem quite plausible.And the footnotes! The footnotes are almost the best part of the book. Everyone who reads it has a favorite footnote. There are nearly 200 of them, ranging from pithy observations ('It is all very well in fairy-tales to ask, \\"Who is the fairest of them all?\\" But in reality no magic, fairy or human, could ever be persuaded to answer such an imprecise question.') to extensive self-contained short stories, to explanations for the magical layman - my favorite being the important difference between 'books of magic' and 'books about magic'. Books of magic are rare and precious in this story - sought after by everyone, obsessively collected and guarded by Mr Norrell, and carefully described, in the ever-present footnotes, by the author. Books have such power; when Mr Strange at last manages to enter Nr Norrell's forbidden secret library, something momentous just has to happen...We recognise people like Mr Norrell & Mr Strange in every era and many endeavours. Norrell is a cautious 'by the book' practical magician taught by years of study. He considers modern magic a gentlemen's profession, wants it regulated by the government, performs dull 'public service' magic to protect coastlines and so on, and disavows 'fairy magic' as a dangerous throwback to more primitive times. Mr Strange has a natural practical ability, a disaster waiting to happen when combined with his obsession with the Raven King, aka the Magician King, the Black King, the 'magician par excellence' who centuries ago ruled northern England, where the stones and trees still remember him...Ironically though it is Mr Norrell, in sorcerer's apprentice fashion, whose magic conjures up what he most scorns yet fears - the Faerie King, referred to only as, 'the gentlemen with the thistle-down hair', whose anarchic presence thoughout the book is both entertaining and malevolent.No review can convey how enjoyable this book is. Writing about it makes me want to read it again. It's a real book of magic, worth 10 stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is the best book I read this year.

They're distracting at first, jumping back and forth between the text and the side stories, but after a while she gets the flow and doesn't make them 6 page footnotes anymore. They are interesting stories so kudos to her for making so many neat side stories. The book takes a while to get into, like I said. Seriously, it's going to be a few hundred pages.

In my opinion, this book is nothing like it. I can see some simmularities, but very few. I think the book is very dry and dull. Nothing exciting happens for the first 200 pages, not to menchion the footnotes that have very little to do with the story at all. I don't care who read what or when they wrote it, if it has nothing to do with the story line then i don't care. it just seemed to me that they were a waste of paper and good book space. the book was also hard for me to follow, and some of the spelling (not that i'm a great speller either) seemed wrong to me, like she was using old english or something but i don't understand why she couldn't spell words how we do now. The fancy wording didn't add anything to the book.

This book is incredibly boring. I gave up in the middle and listened to Mornings On Horseback and a Terry Pratchett novel before I could force myself to finish it. The only reason I did get through it is becuase it was on CD. I would NEVER have been able to read this!There's no plot. Period. So, don't bother looking for it, thinking you're missing something. You aren't. It isn't hiding under the rug, or back behind a box of old love letters in the top shelf in your closet. It's not there. Don't continue to waste your time looking for it!Although the author rambles through approxomately 12 years of Strange and Norell's lives, this is not a saga either. Family or otherwise. None of the characters, even Strange, is particularly likable. There are subplots galore that go no where and do nothing. It has host of characters, some of whom could have been interesting if they'd been developed. But why would we want to do *that*! There is no humor, no wit. If I heard 'the man with the thistledown hair' one more time I was ready to throw the CDs out the window!I get the feeling that Susanna Clarke wrote this in bits and pieces and then tried to stitch it all together, for a disasterous result!Save yourself the pain and boredom and steer clear of this mess..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Here is my 5 theses regarding this horrid novelFirst, Clarke uses the plot mainly as a giant anticliche against all other fantasy booksSecond, She elaborates more on insignificant people by writing long footnotes that only stress your eyes with the sall printThird, She lacks good variety in character, and her style practicaly causes characters to contradict themselvesFourth, the story is MASSIVELY discursiveFifth, you say the writing is beautiful? Her style is very modern and, once again, discursive. She directly refers to and converses directly with the reader too infrequently, as well as writing rhetorical questions, prose of her own. Her style is a sad attempt to bring the book an antique feel to it, but I myself write like that, and I'm twelve...HER WRITING IS CHILDISH!Any good quality there may be is definitely overshadowed by the above."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"792 pages.

Unfortunately, although it came highly recommended from a friend, I have yet to survive beyond the first chapter. The problem is this book is so enormous that it is impossible to bring on subways or planes. And at home I usually fall asleep before I can finish reading 10 pages (it is so heavy, it is even difficult to read in bed or on the couch!). The prose really takes a long time for one to get into. I've had it for months. I've since seen that the publisher has brought it out in 3 separate volumes. Better buy that one if you are the type who can't stand reading jumbo thick books.

I have read reviews on it and they angered me so greatly I was forced to create an account to add my own critique. People seem to think books today are too \\"fast paced.\\" There is a difference between a slow book with inricate build up that takes a long time to play out, and this book. Nothing whatsoever happens in this book.

I read a lot of books and this is only one of two books I've ever read in 25 years that I did not enjoy at all. I lost interest in it before I was half through it, but insisted on soldiering through it. It was so slow and dry it took me a full two weeks to finish it (though I can typically read a book this long in about three days).I let my sister borrow it with a warning that she wouldn't like it and she never finished it and is convinced I gave it to her to punish her for some insult she had paid me. It's a personal thing really, obviously plenty of people liked it. I honestly wanted to like it as well, but just couldn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Reading other reviews giving this 5 stars has become too much for me. I truly do not understand how anyone finished this book. The footnotes taking up sometimes overhalf the page made me feel like I was reading a research paper and not a very interesting one either. The best two words to describe this book are TEDIOUS and BORING!!! I read fiction for pleasure. There was no pleasure in reading a single page of this book. I did not finish it.

Don't let it happen to you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I agree with the last two posted reviews that this book was a huge disappointment. After reading some of the hype and reviews on Amazon, I thought I was in for a great fiction read that I would be hard pressed to put down. What a joke!

Maybe I can sell on Ebay?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The lowest I can go is 1 star - this book is so boring, un-interesting, lacking any high- or low points, that it is app.799 pages too long. A cocking book for British Food might be more exciting and interesting. The Author moves along the story very slowy - the points are missing and the conclusion is just about the most awfull. The book could be written in one page - pupil fight teacher, teacher fight pupil - during that the consequences for the rest of the world is nearly horrible.Next to that, the plot is completely un-realistic and a kind of very sought for - The Author obviously hoped to be the next J.K. Rowling - but Harry Potter by many length beats Mr. Norrell and even though Harry Potter is a book for children - it's far better than this. Don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is clever and is obviously well written. For my taste, however, it's slow and overly long. The style is passe. There are some very amusing comments (like when the end of the war is celebrated so that the English no longer have to go to Scotland to observe strange races). To compare it to Harry Potter is absurd. Potter is a kids' book; this is an adult book. On the whole, I think I prefer HP."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Described by some as \\"Harry Potter for adiults\\", I'm sorry to sya it isn't. Where Rowling's plots are well constructed and move well, Clarke's move with the speed of a glacier. She is also enamored of the word \\"Oh!\\" - exclamation included - which starts almost every conversation and on some - many! - pages gets annoying. Nice try but someone called an \\"editor\\" would have been most helpful to omit the \\"Oh!\\" plethora and keep the plot a bit more on track.

I have just finished reading this boring, boring, boring book and I cannot believe that there are so many people out there who love it. The most tedious and boring read I have ever had the misfortune of coming across! The story is very slow moving and the footnotes are more interesting then the text of the book (although their length is quite annoying). I have read several other reviews and still cannot figure out what everyone else has seen in this novel. This book, like it's main character (Mr. Norell) is boring, tedious and given to long silences. Ms. Clark spends most of her time on character development of entirely boring characters -- some of whom are not important to the story. The entire story is told in the last 80 pages of the book although the reader is expected to plod through 720 pages of drivel to get there! If you are looking for an entertaining read, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I borrowed JS & Mr. Norrell from the library. My suggestion is to do the same and if you can make it though the first half of the book then purchase it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Like many readers, I was intrigued by comparisons with the Harry Potter series. An epic set in late Georgian England with two magicians trying to return magic to the land sounded too much fun to pass up. The first few chapters established a wonderful sense of atmosphere- Ms. Clarke has a fantastic sense of worldcraft.Unfortunately, the story quickly begins to drag. This kind of novel depends on its characters, and while many of them are colorful, none are of them are appealing. In a good story, whenever a character I like is off stage, I find myself anxious to learn what's happening to him or her. In JS & Mr. N, I never felt concern for any of the characters. By the halfway point I lost all interest in any of their fates, but diligently read to the very end.If you're looking for an escapist adventure with characters that grow to feel like good friends, do not buy this book. If you want a good long read with lots of detail, and don't care too much about the characters, this might be a good choice."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend. He knows I love Dickens and said this book was like reading the same but with magic. When I read the prologue, I agreed and I began loving this book. But when I got to chapter 3, I realized the tone of the book had completely changed and I was not enjoying it. I did try because the writing is very good, but I couldn't make it beyond chapter 7 without giving up. I wish the book would have had the same comical flare that it did in the prologue. Not for me, but maybe for others."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Those of us who appreciate Terry Pratchett are familiar with the delight a well-placed footnote can add to a tale. Some of Ms. Clarke's footnotes are not quite as delightful as others, but many of them provide a little escape - a sort of \\"short story\\" break from the main novel.I picked this book up without having read a single review; no one had recommended it and the only thing I knew of it was reading the jacket there in the store. But I'm a sucker for a Big Book, so I bought it. As many others have commented, I had some trouble getting into it, and I did set it aside for a longish period of time after getting to perhaps the 150-page mark.Then I got the flu. I did not want to have to be up and down, back and forth to the bookshelves, so I picked up this behemoth of a book with (apologies, Ms. Clarke) the thought that perhaps I'd even be able to fall asleep. A curious thing happened then: I got into the groove. The pacing seemed just right, the plot moved - slowly, but steadily - and whenever I was tempted to get a bit bored, there was a lovely little fairy-tale footnote to revive my interests like a cool drink of water.A few months later, I was having a bout of insomnia, so I picked up the book - I didn't remember much about the plot from my flu-addled reading, but I did remember that it was a \\"slow starter\\" and figured it'd help me doze off. At 5 A.M. the next morning, I reluctantly set the book aside and got up to start my day, despite a completely sleepless night... and even though I was exhausted, I still had to get a little bit more reading in before bed that night.I've read it four or perhaps five times in total, and it gets better every time. Some people will never \\"get it\\" and will never be able to appreciate the layers and careful construction of the story - even the little bits that don't seem to go anywhere. They're the people, I reckon, who'd want to know why you need \\"all those strings\\" to make a handwoven Persian rug. Ms. Clarke doesn't sell her characters out, though - they move through their universe as people in that time, of those stations, did - dignified, stately, precisely, with a minimum of flash and drama. (The main exception being, of course, the Man With the Thistledown Hair, and it's in HIS \\"flash and drama\\" that most of the difficulties of the other characters are rooted.)I feel certain that there are deep philosophical references, symbolism and observations on our culture and human nature, and - as usual - they've all gone right over my head. That's all right, because I enjoyed it quite well without them.I have friends who insist (rather pretentiously, IMO) that they'll never read past the first 50 pages if a book hasn't \\"hooked\\" them by then - they say they don't have the time to \\"waste\\" on something that can't prove itself by then. I feel sorry for them, knowing that they would probably discard this book without ever discovering its hidden jewels."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Though I was told that this book was mesmerizing, fantastical and well written; it was still shockingly so. Rarely do I come upon a book overflowing with originality, elegance, and grace as well as humor. I laughed often while reading this book, it was somewhat embarrassing to be in a room alone chuckling to myself. This is my all time favorite book in all the world. Not like anything I have ever read before. I know the size of the book can be overwhelming for some, but if they can get over it they will be rewarded with a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have never had a favorite book. I've read so many books that the notion of singling out just one title seemed to me absurd. Well, screw that mode of thinking. Ms. Clarke's debut novel is, hands down, my favorite book. It never ceased to surprise me. Why say more? Except, perhaps, God bless that woman's heart."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"For me, the intriguing feature of the book was that, rather than creating an illusionary setting for her story, the author placed the fantastic alongside the real. No Hogwarts School was required in this highly adult treatment. She departed from wizard-like portrayals of an occult science by artfully, if laboriously, depicting English gentlemen who sculpt magical acts within the structural and historical contexts of nineteenth century Europe. Parallel dimensions were progressively revealed as they interface with the \\"English world.\\"As a reader of some patience, I would have liked the laying of groundwork to be less pedantic. A full third of the way into the book, I found myself muttering, \\"Move on.\\" Nonetheless, the use of period language and culture was exquisite. But the dower tone of many early nineteenth century authors was also captured, which weighed on this reader's spirits. Also, having read all 782 pages, including voluminous footnotes, I gained little sense of the import or relevance to the story of the society of magicians. Nothing of substance tied it back in during the resolution scenes or chapters. Further, I expected to learn a soupcon about magic. Because the author focused on product, keeping process obtuse, what I took from the descriptions was that stumbling upon the real thing can be nasty business. That having been said, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is still quiet worth the read.Many writing critics attribute to written works themes that were never intended by the authors. At that risk, I must say that I enjoyed the author's treatment of her character's interactions with magical arts and the resulting evolution of their personalities by intermingling elements of protagonist and antagonist. The author gave another fine polishing to the corrupting mirror of unchecked power and illustrated how that corruption transcends all sentient beings.Finally, despite giving Tinker Bell a bad name, the author's twist on the faerie community jumpstarted this reader's imagination as to folklore and parallel worlds that bridge earth, heaven and hell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrrell\\" is a very long novel, (782 pages), yet when I came to the conclusion I was sorry to see it end and to say good-by to the characters I had become so attached to. Apparently I am not the only one to think this book is a marvel. As I write this review, it is shortlisted for the 2004 Whitbread Award for First Novel.In early 19th century Georgian England, the big news was the seemingly never-ending war with Napoleon Bonaparte. Of lesser interest, except to a few, was magic. All over the country small groups of men, theoretical magicians, scholars all, would meet from time-to-time to discuss the practice and history of magic. No one had actually practiced real magic for hundreds of years. A small society of theoretical magicians lived in the city of York. They had heard of a magician in Yorkshire, a Mr. Norrell, who had an extraordinary library of rare books on magic. They assumed that he was a theoretical magician, like themselves. A delegation of two were selected to pay a visit to Mr. Norrell in order to see his wonderful library. Norrell, reclusive, self-centered and socially inept, hoarded his precious volumes and seemed reluctant to share his books or his knowledge. The two magicians from York asked their host, \\"...why magic has fallen from its once-great state in our nation? Our question is, sir, why is no more magic done in England?\\" Upon which Norrell replied, \\"It is a wrong question, sir. Magic is not ended in England. I myself am quite a tolerable magician.\\" When the collective York society heard about Norrell's proclamation, they doubted his \\"active magician\\" status. They asked him to make some magic to prove his claims. Norrell, incensed at being called a fabulist, agreed to perform a magical feat in the York Cathedral on a given day and time. He then made a bargain with the society members that if he failed to live up to his claims, he would give his oath never to make any such claims again. However, if he should succeed, the members of the society would disband and promise never to claim the title of \\"magician\\" again. Need I say that Norrell proved himself beyond anyone's expectations?As the only practicing magician in England, Mr. Norrell, whose ambitions began to grow after the York event, moved to London with the intent of bringing magic back to his country. He also got the notion that he would like to use his magic to aid the British in their war efforts, thus bringing fame to himself and practical magic into the spotlight. Sir Walter Pole, a cabinet minister, saw no reason to utilize Norrell's services - after all, he had no military training. Then Norrell performed a truly unbelievable act of black magic for Pole, the kind of magic which he had thought to never use. That act persuaded Pole to accept the magicians assistance. Norrell's participation in the war managed to terrify the French. Unfortunately and unknowingly, Norrell's dark magic brought a thistle-haired gentleman from the land of faeries to London, who worked some very nasty magic of his own, and wrecked havoc in the world around him - as well as the Other World.Meanwhile, Jonathan Strange, a wealthy gentleman who lived near the Welsh border, wanted to marry. Desiring a career, something meaningful to occupy his time in order to please his pretty young fiance, he decided to become a magician after finding he had a talent for the practice. Strange was quite different from Mr. Norrell, being young, handsome and charismatic. He too moved to London where his path crossed Norrell's. The older magician took the younger man on as a pupil. Norrell actually shared his books and knowledge with him, but his underlying motive was to control Strange's magical knowledge. When Strange decided he no longer needed Norrell, exactly what the older magician feared most, a feud began between the two which estranged them. Neither man, however was aware of the strange and dangerous being from the land of faeries who had entered their world.The above is just a brief summary of this tale's beginning - a tiny taste of the enchanting plot - and doesn't begin to do it justice. The book is narrated in a scholarly, (but not dry), manner, complete with footnotes which are almost as fascinating as the main story. It's as if a magician, perhaps a former colleague, were looking back in time and relating this history. The thread which ties the entire novel together is the prophecy attributed to the shadowy figure of the Raven King. As a child he was taken by faeries and later became king of both England and Faerie, and the greatest magician of all time. His prophecy: \\"Two magicians will appear in England. The first shall fear me; the second long to behold me. . . .\\" It is Susanna Clarke's spectacular, rich narrative that makes it all work - like magic.Ms. Clarke's characters are magnificent - so real they practically leap off the page. Her descriptions enable one to really get a three-dimensional picture of each one in the mind's eye. Ms. Clarke also gives the reader remarkable insight into human passions - envy, greed, ambition, friendship, love and redemption. Her take on English society during this period is often satirical, and very humorous at times.Oddly, I have heard some compare \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" to \\"Harry Potter.\\" I don't understand the comparison. The only commonality between the two is the world of magic. I could better compare this novel to the work of Charles Dickens, especially the way Clarke's characters and settings are brought to life by her vivid descriptions. I highly recommend \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" - a novel destined to become a classic.JANA"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a wonderful, beautifully written and witty book. It is unfortunate that it could not have been printed in a more user friendly format- it is so fat that it is very uncomfortable to read. Despite this, a very readable and highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I guess some people really like this sort of thing. Hundreds of pages prose with characters speculating about what they are going to do, then doing things that don't seem to have a whole lot of connection to their speculation or to the fantasy-reality world that the reader is supposed to imagine.Clarke really missed a chance for greatness. She could have developed a few threads along detailed lines that would have provided for a \\"realistic\\" explanation of how magic, politics, and the British empire could have fused together to conquer much of the world...come on, it has to be more than a technological edge and blind devotion to ethnocentricism and the \\"white man's burden\\".Instead she jumbled things together in a way that causes speculation about what the characters actually think and do, but doesn't really give enough information or background to help the reader resolve the issues. Strong on 19th century style and pretention, weak on plot and historical context.The book tantalized with just enough development to keep me going. I'd come to a point of tossing the book down and moving on. Then I'd think, maybe she will do something interesting with this. But I'd come to the answer of a question and imagine, is that all? Serialistically episodic with little internal coherence.Clarke has captured Henry James's style without his depth. She has copied Charles Dickens's structure without his crafty plot resolution or the intriguing development of character.Oh, for a Miss Haversham or Sydney Carton."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Looking over the previous reviews it is obvious that camps have formed and that this novel has both its fans and detractors. For all this disagreement, few reviewers have put energy into understanding why they do or do not like Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Most of the problem, at least from my viewpoint, has nothing to do with the plot per se, but a great deal to do with Susanna Clarke's writing style. Not only does she set her tale in the late Georgian and Regency periods, but also she has adopted the writing style most popular in that period. A style which, all other factors being even, is so in love with its language that it can take forever to get to the point. You will either like this, or you won't.In my personal case, I find it tiresome. We are no longer in an era where the only thing we have to do to fill long hours is sit and read extended novels. Susanna Clarke is a pleasant writer. But she is no Charles Dickens nor is Jonathan Clarke the equal of Sense and Sensibility. The innermost plot arc - an attempt by one of the most powerful of the Fay to establish power in England - gets short shrift until nearly the end of the book. In fact, is may be quite a while before the reader is positive that there is a plot.Despite having sole possession of the first two words of the title, Jonathan Strange does not appear for some time. Instead we first meet Mr. Norrell (the nearly next to last magician in England) and a host of lesser characters that will continue to play a part throughout the story. Norrell himself is an unsympathetic character, very much wrapped up in his own talents and self importance, including a very strong belief that magic is best served by not practicing it. And when he does, he manages to make one of magic's greatest mistakes, setting in motion a plot that will only crystallize hundreds of pages later.By the time Strange advances onto the book's stage, the reader's reaction is likely to be a sense of relief from Norrell's dour outlook on the future (and present) of English magic. And for a time it seems so. Norrell becomes Strange's tutor, advances are made, and the two become enmeshed in England's battles in Europe. As often as not these smaller arcs have some humorous content as Strange journey's about in the service of Wellington and Norrell minds the home front. This serves to distract us from the undercurrent of disquiet that frames the story. All is not roses and Norrell's deal with a prince of Fairie is due to bear unwelcome fruit.The competition between Norrell and Strange comes to a head, and several crises drive them to separate. Strange has some very real challenges in the way of his dream of recreating the great English magic of the Raven King, and he is beset with personal tragedy as well. He will face madness, ridicule and loss before he can resolve a threat that is only partly personal. For what lays in his way may very well destroy his homeland as well.The book's style is primarily one of laying one story arc on top of another until the final effect is of a giant clockwork. One that is more complicated than is absolutely necessary, and that masks the real underlying story for most of the book. My real complaint is that this is a book that asks whether it is the magicians or their spells that are the real magic, and that expresses a firm belief that there are elements of the world that are self correcting. Yet these topics are brushed by as we advance on a conclusion that is both a bit abrupt and fails to deliver on the book's promises. The story is well written, but scatter plotted, and I feel that Clarke has let her prose get in the way of her intentions. The book is more of a spider web than it is a narrative and I will have to confirm that, indeed, you will either find it hard to put down, or hard to pick up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Before reading this book several people told me it was being hailed as the 'Harry Potter for adults.' Something I found a bit odd, considering I thought Harry Potter was the Harry Potter for adults. Despite the fact that I do not agree with this speculation, Ms. Clarke has given us a tale as wondrous and intoxicating as those of everyone's favorite adolescent wizard. There was so much detail put into this novel that I don't find it hard at all to believe it took ten years to write. The footnotes used throughout to give depth to the rich history of magic Ms. Clarke has created were fantastic. At times I found myself so enraptured by the specifics that I could almost believe I was reading a history book rather than a work of fiction. The characters were well developed, and the settings were so vivid I still have scenes burned into my imagination. Hopefully they will remain there for years to come. For a first novel, Ms. Clarke shows exceptional skill in her craft, and I look forward with much anticipation for her next work. Any fan of words would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke penned the best novel written in 2004, period. As much as I loved Alan Hollinghurst's \\"the line of beauty\\", winner of the 2004 Man Booker prize, \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" should have won. Bah, literary gossip aside, this is a damn fine read. Think about fantasy written by W.M. Thackeray. No, wait, whenever I mention fantasy people think of either Harry Potter or sword&sorcery fare. Well, rest assured Clarke's novel has close to nothin' in common with that pulp. First of all, the language is utterly beautiful and the writing is brilliant. As for the topic: this carefully footnoted mammoth of a novel is closer to historic fiction than true and sound fantasy. It deals with the return of magic to england, almost-singlehandedly accomplished by one Mr. Norrel, a misanthropic, obscurantist, bibliophile and ultimately hilarious character. Magic is used for practical purposes, such as fighting Bonaparte and protecting her Majesty's kingdom. Things begin to change when Strange, a younger magician, becomes Norrel's pupil. He's far more curious about magic' \\"exotic\\" uses, like visiting magic kingdoms of the netherworld and summoning the Raven King, once Britain's fairy ruler. The friendship between the two magicians turns into rivalry and....I won't give the plot away, suffice it to say that this is a page-turner. One little complaint: the ending seemed a bit rushed, meaning that mrs. clarke probably had her editor's breath on her neck. Anyway, read it and you won't feel disappointed! Allegedly, it took 10 years in the making. My only hope is that Mrs. Clarke, under pressures from her editor, won't turn into a bestseller factory and dish out one novel a year because that would in all likelihood spoil the quality of her writing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Many of the customer reviews make much of the page length of this book, noting that the length is amplified by the inclusion of many footnotes. As we \\"read\\" the book by listening to the cd, this did not present an issue. In fact, it enhanced the experience. Since we were listening to it together, we were much more aware of the laugh-out-loud humor it contained. We are both avid readers, but thoroughly enjoyed the extra dimension that sharing this cd version afforded. Mr. Prebble's reading is superb. We recently \\"read\\" (thanks to Jim Dale) Books 4 and 5 of the Harry Potter series in this manner, and our enjoyment of those books led us to chose this cd. Messrs. Prebble and Dale sound like they're having a whale of a time with the accents and voices these books contain. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I usually never give a book this much time to get me involved. It was a gift from a well respected fellow reader. So I felt I had to give it the benefit of the doubt. I strongly urge those who wish to put the book down to continue. If once the first chapter in the Jonathan Strange section is finished, and you have not yet gotten into it, then put it down, but it gets much more interesting from here. The characters become more realized, and the historical and fantasy worlds are more fully defined. By the time I hit the last section, it was a page turner."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It is written that it took Susanna Clarke ten years to write this novel. I don't doubt that in the slightest. I thought at first it might take me ten years to read it. I ordered the book this past October and couldn't wait to start reading what others have billed as the adult version of Harry Potter. Perhaps, but I myself didn't see it that way. After I started reading, I found my mind wandering to other things and I knew immediately that this book wasn't holding my attention. So, I set it down and picked up another book, which I read in its entirety within a week. It bugs me to start a novel and not finish it, but I wasn't at all enthused about going back to Clarke's novel. But the more I thought about it, I couldn't imagine anyone working ten years on just one book. So I made myself start reading it again. It wasn't until I'd read well into the book about half way, or let me say to Chapter 42, Strange Decides to Write a Book. From this point on, I found myself with a totally different attitude since the book had begun to hold every moment of my attention.I only wish I could give this book a better rating because the last half of this novel is very good. But that's just it. The first half nearly bored me to tears. I am glad I stayed with it and finished it...finally. I do commend the writer for the vast amount of work that must have gone into her efforts. BUT, the book is entirely too big and hard to hold. My fingers grew tired just from the book's weight. The print was too small for me. And the punctuation seemed to be totally ignored. Thus, those are my reasons for giving the book only three stars. Had this book been about half the size it is, covering the last half of its story, then I think Clarke had a wonderful plot, her characters were excellent, and her prose very good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This redefines the word 'piffle'. If you leave this book in a fishstore, floating goldfish in ten minutes. Save your braincells and avoid this trash. And if any 'wise' guy tries to enlighten you, slap him upside his mug with a cod! This could put Lunestra out of business."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I first heard about this book where it was presented as a Harry Potter for adults. I think that other than the mention of magic there is very little similar between these two works.As I read it I just said to myself that this is just like reading Dickens. It has Dicken's skill at characterization and subtle humor. While HP has cutsy magic this interacts with strange and mystical worlds here you get the magic and worlds like in the \\"wrinkle in time\\" series.The Characters are deep and nothing happens just as you expect. I found myself deeply satisfied when I finished reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"One of the new classics of the genre. I liked the setting in historical times. While it drags at times it is still ultimately good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jane Austen's writing meets Emily Bront's mistery together with a touch of splendid magic. It's being quite strange of me to read that slowly, but I wanted to savour every page of this book. It's slowliness itself in the beginning, but not a kind of slowliness that bores the reader or that prompts them to put away the book and then forget its existence.It's like some kind of spell would really affect the eyes and the soul.Awesome."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is such a lovely, wonderful book, I felt bereft when it ended. The reviewers who complain of nothing happening are truly missing the point. The writing is magical, the humor is subtle and witty, the characters developed and complex. It completely rid me of the bad taste that \\"The Magicians\\" (a horrid, lazy book) left in my mouth, to compare it to another \\"grown up\\" magician book. It does start slow, but it builds speed gradually until I found I didn't want to stop reading. I only wish there were more Susanna Clarke books for me to instantly turn to and read. I have downloaded her book of stories, so I guess that will have to be enough for now."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This has got to be the best attempt ever at writing in any pre-modern style and making it sound totally natural. I've never seen it done this well. It reads like it could really have been written during the Napoleanic wars, but it's as clear and crisp as any tight narrative in modern style. The magic parts are spooky and the human relations are hilarious and melancholy in the right measure. Even if you don't like fantasy, you'll like this. It's one of a kind."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a story of a world that might have been or is still in the making. At the end our protagonist is travelling the halls of magic and we want to go too. I read this in h/ back and on kindle and will read it again. You will never see the faeries and their world in the same way as your childhood tales. To put this in the same category as Potter is like saying Neverwhen is in the same category as The Historian. All are wonderfull all should be on kindle. I will read them again when I am 90."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is an epic tale of nineteenth-century England and two magicians, first teacher and student, then rivals, who change its history. In 1806, most people believe magic no longer exists in England- until Mr Norrell (note the British Mr) of Hurtfew Abbey reveals his powers and becomes a celebrity. Another magician emerges: young, handsome, and daring Jonathan Strange. Strange becomes Norrell's student, and the two join forces in the war against France. But as Strange is increasingly drawn to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic, he risks sacrificing everything that he values, including his partnership with Norrell.I just loved this book, which was written in a typical British style with humor and wit. Though the book is over 800 pages long, I don't think I was ever bored by it. There's a whole host of great characters, funny and strange. It's really just hard to describe this book, but if you decide to read it, you will be rewarded. There are long \\"historical\\" footnotes at the bottom of pages, there are fairies, shady characters, and bumbling politicians. In short, everything you could ask for in a story of any kind, especially a fantasy story. Bear in mind, though, that if you're looking for a story about magicians throwing magic at one another, this is not the book for you. It's more subtle than that. There were a lot of side-plots in the book that all eventually came together.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, [...]*"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this epic novel. Stayed up way past my bedtime most nights just to finish the chapters; I couldn't wait to pick it up again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke's Johnathan Strange & Mr Norrell is an ingeniously plotted, wonderfully detailed novelization of the history of English magic. Norrell is an eccentric, introverted anti-hero, paired against rebellious forward-thinking Strange. These two characters are only a portion of our meandering dialogue, however. There is an arc about a long-dead (or is he?) king, a thistle-haired fairie, a servant who would be king, aristocrats, generals, theoretical and practical magicians and at least three significant arcs following wives and would-be girlfriends. If you think that sounds like a lot to cram in an average-length book, you'd be right, so Clarke doesn't even try. My chief complaint about the work is that it's just too long. There are so many explanations and descriptions that it detracts from the work and becomes monotonous and repetitive (Strange's war exploits, Norrell's books or nightly dances anyone?). A good editor could have shorn this book up to a more respectable 750 pages and saved the reader 200 pages of bloat. The footnotes in this book are enough to fill a long novella. Still, the book is an interesting and creative effort where the only \\"Abracadabras\\" to be found are used in jest. This is an evaluation of \\"serious\\" magic, and it's importance to England. I really like this book and place it in high esteem. With a little trimming, however, it could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This became my favorite book the year I read it. A really neat amalgam of real historical events during the Napoleonic Wars sprinkled with what could have been if magicians were involved. More than a bit of faery lore is worked into the story but not the kind that evokes images of Tinkerbell. These faeries are dark and malevolent, more along the lines of a Del Toro character. The pace and brooding nature of the plot feels more akin to the Bram Stoker \\"Dracula\\" text rather than the thriller plots seen in much of the fantasy genre.Even more compelling than the characters and the story development is the method in which the novel is written. Much of the important story details take place in the ever present footnotes, giving authenticity to the historical nature of story. Brilliantly thought out with a plot the educated (but imaginative) will find engaging."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"... the other nearly 500 reviewers that have praised this book. This is one of those books that I came upon randomly as an audiobook and rented from New Haven's one & only \\"Best Video\\" for a long road trip. I'd never heard of it, the title didn't tell me anything... but something about the cover image caught my imagination. And boy was it a good gamble into the unknown... Clarke's flight of fancy just took me away to a different world unlike any I'd ever encountered. The \\"man with thistledown hair\\" was such a marvelous creation and the Raven King an equally marvelous enigma. A true experience that is hard to pin into a category or genre. I loved it but I can see where this is a book for a somewhat old- fashioned reader and perhaps not for the fast-track world of today. Then again given the number of positive reviews I've seen maybe there are more of us than I thought.I keep looking to see if Clarke has written other books but I guess something like this will take years and years (not comparing in any way but didn't it take Ayn Rand 17 years or so to get Atlas Shrugged?) to conceive of and then to write. And there is something to be said for getting it right in one and turning to other projects."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a professed Anglophile, I loved the use of the old language in this book which at times can be a daunting read but keeps your attention with twist right when you think you've read as much as you can. It would make a great movie, although it maybe 3 hours long. I would suggest this boo to any one who likes there fantasy in a practical setting and has the attention span long enough to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The powers of the author are impressive, but the forced dedication to the particulars after 10 years of writing this book show some scatter and the dryness of time.The book is a fantastical fictional history of 2 Magicians that try to return England to a time of Magic and focuses on the very slow schism between the scholarly dedication of one overly philosophical and rational(-izing) yet emotional gentleman versus the cool man of actions that also happens to be manic-depressive, both foiled by an ALMOST all powerful fairy king and his friend, the un-classed and named, yet un-named Servant Stephen Black.If the above seems a bit long, a bit dry, and a bit over-wrought, it is only because it, in it's poor way, is my attempt to sum up the book both in essence and style.This opus, (as it is indeed a bit of a work to try and progress through it), has quite the base of beauty of language and character development, but after ten long years of of writing, of, what I assume, editing, and re-editing, make the work a bit too scholarly and pedantic. I found myself grasping at ravens feathers of pretty prose and trifles of dark humor to lighten the load but, in the end, it was just too heavy and discordant.For example, while some might applaud the wisdom of naming another character in another book \\"Angel Claire\\" and claim superior character knowledge from the naming, I find names like \\"Stephen Black\\" (which translates to \\"Crowned Black Man\\") and Mr. Strange seem incongruous and simple in a work that toils to build full characters.*I finished it, I found some measure of enjoyment in it, but I can't honestly recommend it to somebody unless I know they are patient of mind and open to a more plodding and fanciful structure.Finally, to dispel some misconceptions, this book is NOT-Harry Potter-ish (just because it is about magic)-Tolkien-esque (just because it describes the scenery with attention)-a simple battle of good and evil (nor, really, a book of good an evil)-(nor really, a simple book)*There are many of asterisks in this book, which serve as imaginative foot notes. Some of these are of interest but many just comment on items which somebody that was a scholar of the History of English Magic might like to use to further their studies. Since this book is indeed an imaginative History a majority of these footnotes soon become tiresome and provide nothing of interest to the plot of the book and sometimes provide some interest de rerum naturi."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first two volumes can be rather slow in parts, but things really pick up and become quite engaging by the third, though perhaps almost too much of a rush to a conclusion as one nears the final chapters (but definitely not as obvious as one would see in the typical Hollywood blockbuster which crams endless car chases, explosions, and plot twists until the very end). The delta between \\"real\\" and alternative historical timelines is just the right amount, as is what's revealed (and not) about the Raven King. The degree to which one's feelings change about the various characters over the course of the interwoven stories is a good indication of how they're both multi-dimensional and believable. Definitely to be considered part of the fantasy genre canon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A first indicator of what you're going to experience in this book is the fact that the introduction is by Neil Gaiman. If you know of and like his work, this is your book ... although it is quite, quite different from much of what Mr. Gaiman does.With over 700 other customer reviews, I don't want to go into a lot of details about my personal experience with this work. I just want to record for the ages that I think this book is utterly entrancing in a slightly creepy way. It's a bent and dark world of astonishing characters and relationships and plots. It's not for your average fantasy reader at all, though. Whoever you are, be ready for something that might be unlike anything you've read in years."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I keep this book under my pillow at night. It is severely damaged from taking showers with me. I let it drive my car. Please please please do not take this book away from me, ever."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am a big fan of historical novels and the occasional epic fantasy series. This book brought the best of those worlds together for me, and I couldn't put it down. If you are at all similar in your tastes, don't even hesitate. Read it, and Enjoy it!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a beautifully crafted novel. I would recommend it to all lovers of fiction and prose, not just to fantasy buffs. In fact, I think Clarke's writing might resonate more with readers who love literature, beautiful writing, and carefully developed characters than with some (but definitely not all) strictly fantasy readers. JS&MN is not really a fantasy novel after the tradition of most genre-fantasy novels. Story, character, and setting development take precedence over fast paced action, though this is done in such an exciting and fascinating way that the result is a world and characters so believable that the reader is completely drawn into them. And while the novel is long, the actual writing in this novel is not at all difficult to read or understand, and there is plenty of magic, fairies, and strange lands throughout. It's a fantasy novel about our own world-a realistic fantasy, an alternate retelling of our own past that asks and realistically answers the question we've all always wanted to know to know the answer to: What if magic really was real? It's true that this novel isn't for everyone-if you're looking for a light, fast paced summer read this might not be it. However, if you love magic, artful writing, unforgettable characters, as well as wonderful storytelling and plot, JS&MN is one of the best."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell is, simply put, amazing. I am an avid reader and this is my favorite book of all time. The writing is beautiful and the story is captivating. You will not regret picking up this book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First I would recommend this book. At times it felt a little Harry Potter-esque in that they both deal with magic and England. Ms Clarke's novel, however, is set in the early 1800's and that at times feel much more Jane Austin than JK Rowling. What you should know first is the author's overuse of footnotes, as well as my hatred of them in general, especially in novels. I believe she has 180 or more and many go on for more than a page. She does cleverly use them to help set the mood in the reader's mind that magic is not only usual in England, but that the lack of current users in magic is more the problem. I, however, was frustrated by them thinking that I'd miss a fact or a subtlety if I didn't wade through them. They are not important. Also, Ms Clarke has a Michener way of going on ad nausea over details that aren't important to the story. This happened much more in the beginning than towards the middle or end. There, once she gets the plot underway, is where the story does grab you and makes you want to read on. The plot takes interesting turns that I never saw coming and the characters get more developed and better to understand. She also blends real history with fantasy in a way that more than once sent me to the Internet to confirm historic battles and events. This is a good and engaging novel. With firmer editing and some 300 pages less, it would have been great."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is definitely one of my new favorites. It is set in England in the 1800s, but in an England where magic has been prevalent throughout its history, but at present dormant. Enter Gilbert Norrell-a very learned magician who learned his craft from buying up all the available books on magic in the land. He is very content to be the world's only practicing magician. But then Jonathan Strange appears. He is drawn to magic, and then to Mr. Norrell who has become the epicenter of English magic. The two are quite a pair of opposites, but their shared love of learning and magic unite them. They begin to aid England in the Napoleonic wars with their skills and are perceived as England's heroes. But a rather foolish pact That Mr. Norrell made with a Fairy will come back to bite both of them. Despite their differences they will need each other to fix things and fulfill a prophecy to bring English magic back to its former strength.What a great book. Even though it is over 800 pages it was engaging from start to finish. Some parts read like a book right out of Jane Austen's era, but with a twist of magic thrown in for spice. The footnotes that explain references to ancient magical history are also very engaging. This is a wonderful and unique undertaking, and I count Clarke among some of my favorite novelists. I look forward to reading more from this wonderful author.About the Author:Susanna Clarke is a British author. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is her debut novel, which is a Hugo Award-winning alternate history. Clarke began Jonathan Strange in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time while editing cookbooks for Simon and Schuster. For the next decade, she published short stories from the Strange universe, but it was not until 2003 that Bloomsbury bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a bestseller. Two years later, she published a collection of her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of nineteenth-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses on the relationship of two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.If you find this interesting, also check out: Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. Both are excellent novels that really paint the entire history of the magical world around the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The story follows two English magicians as they try to restore magic to England during the Napoleonic Wars. It is an alternate history about how Mr. Norrell and his pupil begin practice magic for the government after it's long absence in their country. The two magicians have very different ideas about what types of magic should be practiced and eventually part ways. Mr. Norrell prefers to read the books he hordes and perform menial acts of magic while Strange explores darker magic to the detriment of his family and friends. Because this book is an alternate history, it is probably not for anyone who finds history to be very dull. It is also a book that requires a lot more time than most. I am a pretty quick reader but this book took a lot of time for me due to the extensive footnotes. Some of the notes are several pages long, which means a lot of time is spent flipping back and forth through pages. This was an excellent book for fans of fantasy and history."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell is probably like the studyof magic itself. It can be a painstaking, tedious endeavorthat demands time, effort and commitment, but its rewards canbe marvelous. I agree that not everyone will enjoy this book.Parts of it can be slow, studious, almost fussy, and likeMr. Norrell himself, much taken with detail and appearancesand manners. Today's readers often don't have the patienceor desire to sit and plow through hundreds of pages ofmeticulous detail and character and scene development.I loved the book immensely. I loved its finely tuned characters,its dry, restrained humor, with just the right amount of gossipychattiness. I loved its ornate, gothic descriptions and footnotes,the intricasies of the story. Yes, there were times when it allseemed to veer off into subplots, and I wasn't sure where theauthor was taking it, but the charm of her writing kept mestrolling pleasurably through the pages and chapters.It all comes together in a precipitous, dizzying climax, swoopingdown and taking its characters to places they never imagined orintended, surprising them all as well as the reader. Suddenly magicis alive, and no one is in control but magic itself.I commend Ms. Clarke for her prodigious imagination, dry humor,flawless detail, and loving attention to character."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A wonderful book, written in the style of Jane Austen, and that era of English literature. Wry and surprising, and complex..........the characters are many and fantastic, the story is entrancing. It concerns the return of magic to the English people........it is worthy of being compared to Neil Gaiman. I can think of no higher praise."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Disenchanted with Fantasy for the past several years I had begun to despair of finding anything interesting and unique. To be sure, there have been several quite popular novels and series. But most ran to tales more distinctly political intrigues than magical or meandering stories that should have been put to bed long ago - none of which is to my taste. It was one reviewer's characterization of Clarke's style as \\"pitch-perfect Austen\\" that intrigued me enough to purchase, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and am quite fond of them. Having recently finished Clarke's debut novel I can attest that, on the face of it, the reviewer wasn't far off the mark. But if Clarke is a modern Jane Austen she is a more melancholy one.Clarke should be congratulated for such a finely crafted first novel. Her mastery of language and structure allow her to maintain the fiction of a story set and written in the nineteenth century. It is marred somewhat by her choice to \\"misspell\\" - or use a much older spelling - a word or two to maintain the illusion of some age. It had rather the opposite effect on me in that it seemed more like the contrivance of a modern author attempting to lend an antique air to her voice. Nevertheless, this is a minor quibble. A more annoying habit was the constant use of long footnotes. Instead of a few short lines or references we are often treated to footnotes that either take up over three-quarters of the page or run on for several pages! They are a distraction that adds next to nothing to the story itself. The attempt reminded me of Penguin's series of literary classics containing notes explaining terms or ideas likely unknown to modern readers. But they are mercifully short and to the point.The lack of action in Jane Austen's novels is counterbalanced with a nearly perfect choice of when to end the story - just before interest turns into boredom for lack of anything substantial happening. Clarke throws in more action but the story still seems a little long (more than twice the length of an Austen novel). The story builds so slowly that the climax sneaks up and it is almost over before you know it. It turns darker towards the end. Clarke turns Strange, for a time, into a more Poe-like character - sad, insane, dark - than anything you will find in Austen. You might think that someone writing in \\"pitch-perfect Austen\\" would be out of their element in such a setting. But Clarke's imagery and characterization remain strong even as it becomes less Austen-like. The ending felt neither like a resolution or the promise of one. In the end (pun intended) I was dissatisfied. But the journey itself was pleasurable enough to make up for it.Despite criticism the story is very fine indeed, if a little long. It is one of the finest I have read in recent years. If you enjoy Clarke's storytelling you might want to pick up a Jane Austen novel or two."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"beacause all I want to do today (and for the next couple of days), is read this book. I am only on page 103 and I know that I will be staying up tonight to see how far I can get within the story.This novel, is by far, one of the most unusual and well written books I have read in a long time and I read a lot.I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Clarke during a book signing in Oxford, MS and I had told her that I travelled from my home city of Memphis, TN to see her that day. That afternoon was an absolute pleasure!Even if you are not into fantasy, or British historical novels, and into ANY kind of reading, do yourself a favour: get $30, buy this book, get comfortable and read it!Thank you, Ms. Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I can't remember when or why I'd purchased this book. It's almost as though the book found me. At first glance, a novel of over 800 pages written in period style may seem like a challenge you don't wish to undertake, but you'd miss out on this truly astounding and, yes, magical story. The story offers surprises, wonderful and rich characters and more humor than I could have anticipated.The setting is England, but not the England we know. This is an England torn in half, ruled by two kings; the mad King George in the south and the long-disappeared Raven King of the north, in whose stead the southern kings rule according to treaty until the Raven King's highly unlikely return. The Raven King ruled with magic for three hundred years and it would seem that magic had disappeared with him, and for the four hundred years since his departure, English magic has faded out of both fashion and effectiveness. Plenty of men consider themselves magicians by way of theoretical study when our story begins, but no one has successfully practiced magic.A Northerner of means named Gilbert Norrell has accumulated as many magical books as he can, buying or outright tricking the volumes out from the hands of the rest of the country. He makes a name for himself with a demonstration of his magic, a demonstration performed in order to discredit a society of magicians and claim their library for his own, and he comes to London intending to offer his talents to the crown so as to return magic to England once more. But Norrell is a small-minded and selfish man lacking the required social graces to make much headway into London society, despite gaining the efforts of two petty gentlemen bent on riding his coattails as long as fashionable. Desperate for attention from the crown, Norrell finds himself backed into a corner when his two gentleman associates promise a neighboring Government Minister that Norrell can bring his young fiance back to life. Norrell does so, but only by making a hasty bargain with a fairy he summons in secret. Norrell's feat succeeds in bringing him the attention of the crown and his services soon prove indispensable.Norrell comes to be regarded as the face and guardian of English magic, but an ill-regarded street magician delivers a prophecy to Norrell, a prophecy about TWO English magicians. Norrell dismisses the prophecy, but some time later, a young gentleman named Jonathan Strange encounters the beggar and purchases a few spells, eventually finding he has a proclivity for magic he hadn't realized.The two magicians differ in every way but in their love for magic; where Norrell researches and researches a spell, Strange is quick to cast the spell and improve it; where Norrell is merely tolerated by society, Strange and his wife are embraced warmly. Strange is at first happy in assuming the role of student to Norrell, but as his talents grow and Norrell's jealousy stews, the war between England and France draws the two men to different fronts, and all the while, the bargain Norrell had made has given the mischievous and brutal fairy all the license he requires to meddle in the lives of those surrounding the two magicians in ways that Norrell and Strange are at once unaware of and unable to repair."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The thing about this book is that it is long. That's it, really. If it were shorter and to the point, the great many negative reviews here would be positive. Most of the people who didn't like this book just grew impatient with it. And I'm not faulting those people; this book is really, really long. It's easy to lose your patience with it.However, everyone has had the experience of reading a truly great book and then being sad when it was over. \\"I wish it had been longer,\\" we think. In the spirit of that, Clarke has written a book that is less about conflicts and stories and more about the very act of story-telling. She has created smart, interesting, and unique characters, put them in a rich, evocative world, and then she's let them go about their business, having funny conversations, dealing cleverly with small problems, and creating and breaking relationships with one another.Although I grew a little annoyed at the start by the rambling style of plotting, once I saw it for what it was -- a sort of bedtime story that your parents just add onto every night so that it might never end -- I began to enjoy it quite a bit. Clarke is a gifted writer, and her world was so well-rounded that even when nothing much seemed to be happening in it, it was still a joy to visit.At its most basic, the story is about two magicians who develop a friendship/rivalry over the state of magic in England. They are (without much realizing it) at odds to the story's biggest antagonist, a deceptively kind and magical spirit known only as the gentleman with the thistledown hair. If the book is to be said to be about anything at all, it is about the consequences and ramifications of this unlikely triangle of magicians. Even so, the ultimate conclusion of this plot is done so hastily and obliquely that Clarke seems openly to announce that it is not really the point of the book.The vivid and archaic tone of voice of the book is quite enrapturing for those who aren't in a hurry to get anywhere, and although the constant footnotes seem unevenly applied (some footnotes seem necessary to understand the story, while others discuss things that barely have any connection at all to the plot), they are almost as entertaining as the book itself. Clarke, it seems, has crammed every magical idea she could come up with into them, including how that magic would fit in the larger world that we more regularly experience (the footnote that details the conflicts between magicians and priests was my favorite). In fact, ironically, I found that it was the magical aspect of the story that bothered me the most.The book treats magic as if it were no less common to people than Latin: something old, once ubiquitous, but no longer in use. Norrell and Strange are responsible for bringing magic back into use, and with it they get church statues to talk as well as foil the forces of Napoleon's army. Unfortunately, magic (much like time travel) can be a tough element to have in a story unless there are clear and recognizable limits to its use. If anything really can happen, then it makes what DOES happen less interesting or at least less at risk. It is never obvious what rules govern the magic that Norrell, Strange, and Mr. Thistledown Hair are utilizing, and so, when they are suddenly able to do something amazing (walk through mirrors) or are suddenly NOT able to do something they could once before (locate people through bowls of water), the reader is asked simply to believe that, yes, suddenly these rules have always existed.It was the same reason I stopped reading HARRY POTTER: writers of magical worlds often seem to have the least work to do in creating conflict or tension. A new rule is introduced, or a magical exception is made to an old one. It seems a little cheap, and if this WERE a story-driven novel, I'm sure this arbitrary wizardry would've dropped my enjoyment of the book. However, being so obviously about the mere joy of fiction, the book only uses these few cheap tricks to keep some semblance of a trajectory to the otherwise static, playground world of the book's various heroes and villains. There are a few satisfying resolves to some of the book's questions, but the end result, really, is just about enjoying those questions for as long as you can."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Intricate, funny, and affirmative. This is a novel for adventure-seekers and home-bodies alike. Interesting commentary on the nature of duty and power."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The biggest strength of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke is that the writing is spectacular, and Clarke obviously did her research. Sometimes, I don't think good writing is stressed enough when it comes to novels, and the author often sacrifices it in order to spend more time on entertainment value and drama. Not so with this book. It is both entertaining, and brilliantly written. Besides that, the plot is incredibly thorough; each character gets his or her time in the spotlight and the end comes together beautifully.However, this book does tend to be a bit tedious. It reads more like a historical narrative than anything else, which sometimes got in the way of me enjoying it. But there are some fun parts having to do with magic that had me laughing out loud. (If a book that deals with magic doesn't have a bit of playfulness in it, it's taking itself far too seriously.) But Clarke doesn't make magicking all fun and games -- she strikes a balance between serious and light-hearted. I appreciated the combination of the hard work (the studying, the danger, and all the effort Norrell and Strange put in) and the fun. Norrell and Strange make stones speak, bring the dead back to life, and wander around thousand-year-old magical roads that can take them anywhere in England or Faerie.This was a perfect book, except for its length and tediousness. A quarter of the way into it, I thought that quite a few chapters and anecdotes could have been cut without making a difference to the rest of the story. There was way too much time spent on some characters (Drawlight, especially), and on describing some events that didn't go anywhere in the end.Still, I consider this worth a read. It won't be for everyone, but lovers of magic, alternate histories, and lengthy books will find it satisfying."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Warning: this book is long, really long! The story is divided into three volumes, and the first definitely requires patience and a lot of will to go on reading. It is mostly because it is very directed at developing characters and no so much at advancing in the story. It tells us how magic is slowly leaving England, how nobody seems to know how to use it any more and how the magicians left are actually theoretical magicians that read books on the subject. Then Mr. Norrell comes along and we find out that he can actually perform magic. He's a reclusive man that is also awfully full of himself and decides that no one should be studying magic besides him, after all, he is the only practical magician alive. Norrell ends up in London doing what he wants: helping the English fight the French with magic - Clarke writes beautiful scenes on account of that. In the meantime, the magician also spends a lot of energy trying to stop the other so-called magicians and hides every book of magic he can get his hands on. This volume is quite slow paced but some of the scenes where magic is taking place are beautifully described and a pleasure to read.But it turns out Norrell is not the only magician left, since there's also a handsome man called Jonathan Strange who can perform magic, even if he's quite unaware of his abilities until someone tells him he is part of a prophesy. Mr. Norrell takes this news badly and sees Strange as his rival. The second and third volumes are easier to read. I've read some review that said some readers could start in the second volume if they think they cannot endure the first one, which probably is a good advice. Jonathan Strange is brought into the spotlight in the second volume and he is much more likeable than Norrell, even though he is too easily distracted to understand at once what's happening and that is a little exasperating sometimes. As the war against France escalates, Strange is sent to Portugal to help Wellington fight the french with his magic. Clarke did an amazing job intertwining her magical story with England's History. There's also a funny and suspenseful scene involving a visit to King George, the mad King who happens to be able to see and talk to fairies - like most madmen apparently do. Although this book is not exactly funny and sometimes is rather dark, some bits do feel like magic.I don't give it five starts for a set of reasons, starting with the first volume being quite dull. The footnotes are too many and too long, some of those footnotes could be standalone stories. It's interesting to know that the whole world behind the book is so well thought, but at the same time it keeps breaking the pace and a number of times I lost track of the story when I got back to the main text. I guess some readers can just ignore the footnotes altogether. I have to admit I was beginning to cringe at every paragraph that started with \\"Stephen and the gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\", most of it was just chatter that didn't enrich the story or helped it move on. Honestly, I was as bored as Stephen listening to the fairy. And I still don't understand the magic court \\"The Cinque Dragownes\\" chapter, it seems completely pointless.I think I would have made it quite shorter, but this book is undoubtedly a beautiful read full of magic. It's like you're transported to a complete different world and feel each character as a friend and understand their doubts and actions. It's really well written."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"For those who compare this book to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, I think that is a very bad comparison. Magic is in the book, but often it is more of a side story, especially in the first 1/2 of the book. Even in the second half where magic is more prevalent, the story is really more about characters. Unfortunately, is too much detail in my opinion. I often wondered where the story was going. It is not a very plot driven book. Great insight into some very unique characters, but sometimes too much. This book dragged for me in many places and I often found myself reading to book out of shear inertia, hoping to finish it soon so I could start another book. Don't get me wrong, I love getting into the characters, settings, etc. Lord of the Rings is a great example of this. But in this book, it was too much. If you're looking for a magical adventure, fantasy, etc. you probably won't like it. It's not an adventure. It's more of a character study of some very unique people with their own quirky personalities, with a little magic thrown in, and only a very little adventure. In the end it's not a terrible book, but could have used some healthy editing. The book could have been cut by 1/3 without missing anything."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I get it, I really do, but that doesn't make me like it. At first it was wonderful, I was aware that Segundus wasn't a main character but everytime I read about him after the first chapter, I was happy. He was one of the few characters that didn't make me cringe in disgust. There were three characters I liked Stephen Black, Segundus, and Jonathan Strange. I enjoyed reading about the fairy, mostly because Stephen was there and I would have been happy following him around because at least things were happening to him. I read Norrell and I was bored and ticked off. I read Strange and I was usually just bored. Which is part of the problem, everytime we're with a character very little that is interesting is happening at the time. Oh, some magic will go on, but interesting, engaging magic happens very briefly, just enough that I made it through the book. The king was fun, even if we only saw him once, but nothing else mattered. She could have made this interesting, she could have made this something I actually took time out of my day to ponder, but there's nothing to ponder. I know why Mr. Norrell is such an unlikeable 'secrective' man. I don't have to wonder at his motivation, I know his motivation, his motivation is what made me want to read Segundus instead of him those first couple of hundred pages because I hated him and felt no sympathy or attachment.Why don't I like the female characters? Well, where do I begin with them? I can't really review the ones that show up near the end well enough, becaue I was plowing through the book intent on finishing it. Plus, the female characters are female characters, if they're anything besides being female they're insane or vindictive. At least some guys got slightly indebt, 'I like them in the book even if I hate them as a rule', personalities, like Childermass -- oddly enough, I actually disliked it when he took a more active role near the end of the book. I liked his smarmy character, he offset Norrell well enough so that Norrell's antics were interesting in that his little minioin came around placating everyone but keeping a firm foot down on what was happening. Arabella, Mrs. Pole, were just uninteresting. Arabella I pointed out as hostage material early on when she became mroe than the love interest. Mrs. Pole just became haughty and cruel in an uninteresting overdone way in the end. The rest of the female cast is easy to shrug off.Not so much with the male ones, but I can usually point to something (even with Norrell) that they did that was of interest. It might have been predictable, but it was interesting.But enough about characters.The writing style was not what I hoped it would pan out to be. It started out interesting with that Victorian feel to it, but by page 100 I was reading 10 pages at a time to give my brain a break. Things that can ruin a book: bad narration. And it's not bad as in \\"horrible grammar\\" the style is just so uninteresting that I can't keep engaged with it that long to be able to concentrate on the words to enjoy them so I start zoning out. Next thing I know I've 'read' twenty pages without retaining a word. I like Victorian style writing. No, scratch that, I like books written in that era. It's like Clarke pulled in everything I hated about that style of writing and put it into the book without actaully putting in any elements that interested me. And I love Dickens, I know this rambles with Dickens, but it is not him. His characters can be one dimensional to a point, but at least at the end I feel like I know them, like they've grown and changed and matured. Nothing happened worth mentioning in this book. I feeel like the end was just put there because someone said it was getting too long and Clarke had to find a way to tie up all the loose ends so she wrote that and to say it was a letdown after all the buildup would be stretching it. It wasn't like I expected some magnificent fight. I would have been dissapointed in that. but this was just lack luster to a fault.Oh, and the footnotes? Sometimes it makes the book. Sometimes footnotes are witty enough to make me love the book or even recommend the book even if the actual story sucks. I started ignoring the footnotes to this book after fifty pages and maybe glanced at them once or twice afterwards. They didn't need to be there.Subject matter was predictable. All the questions and issues it covered I could point to other books that did it and did it better. Not only that, they did it more subtly, which is impressive seeing as a coupe that I'm thinking of are action fantasy. So yeah, all question brought up are things that have been before. Knowledge, who should have it. Should it be kept from people or shared? The consequences of both options. Power and how to weild it. Like and death. Servatitude. And so on and so forth. One of the problems is that they are brought up but barely explored. I don't expect an answer, but the book was dealing with so much and weighed itself down with some things that weren't consequential that I don't feel inspired to explore these questions. When these things are brought up, I'm usualy given a little to work my mind around, a new perspective to consider and juxtapose to my own world view, a flaw, a belief, a fact, this brought the subject up. But my views of everything stay the same and unquestioned. Nothing new to the table, nothing to think about unless I felt like it and then I'd go somewhere else to start because this isn't inspiring me to think it through.So, yeah, if you want to tote around the superior knowledge that you read an 800 page book, good for you, knock yourself out. Just don't go looking for something or new. I don't know, maybe other people will find gems in it, and as I said, the magic can have it's moments, but to me the characters are cardboard cut outs. The plot is stupid and overall a let down, and the subject matter is repetetive and done better in other stories."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke's novel is essentially pastiche. She has adopted (one can hardly say mastered) a certain voice then spends her many pages ruminating in it. But there is more --much more-- to good writing or storytelling than chewing the cud. One reads page after page longing for something to happen. It seldom does."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I became thoroughly captivated in the storyline from the first page. This is one of those kind of books that you cannot skim through, where every word needs to be absorbed, therefore it took me some time to get through it. But, I felt like I was transported to another time and place. The story and the characters are clever and written with an engaging sense of humor, yet with a traditional sensibility. I would highly ghly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something like they never have before."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I really enjoyed this book from start to finish, but I was surprised to find that the plot(what there is of it) doesn't start until fully a third of the way in, at which point there suddenly is a situation that pushes the action along until it gets resolved at the end. I enjoyed the leisurely pace, but since so much of the book was not concerned with what turned out to be the main action, when that action was over I didn't really see any reason the book shouldn't ramble on for another four or five hundred pages! I felt that at a certain point the author got tired of it and wanted to wrap it up quickly. The characters and \\"historical\\" incidents are fascinating and I wouldn't mind a sequel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What a book! It took me a little bit to really get into the story, but then I was fascinated. It is a wonderful story, and its really more than just a story. It is a whole alternate history of England with magic. Ms. Clarke has crafted an entire world that is just fascinating. She provides plenty of detail about all the characters, sometimes seeming like the book is wandering off into another story, but I think that is just part of its charm. I was kept guessing throughout about what would happen and who was evil and who was good. I could read a chapter and savor it for a long time before moving on. It was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Most of the reviews I've seen complain that its tedious and boring and a triumph of marketing. Nothing could be further from the truth! This is by far one of the most original, creative and well thought-out books I have ever read. While some may find the writing style laborious to get through anyone who puts any effort into the reading of this book will reap the rewards of their labours. While I found perhaps maybe the first 200 pages \\"slow,\\" the story rapidly picks up and after finishing every single word is exactly where it belongs and is brilliantly crafted. A superb read!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"When I read Clarke's short story Mr Simonelli a couple of years ago, I was blown away - it was the most beautiful and magical description of fairies I had ever read, and I was thrilled to find out a novel might be on the way. And I was not disappointed. This is an amzing book- engrossing, entertaining, very funny and utterly convincing. What I love more than anything is the fairies and the descriptions of the other worlds - which are exquisite and very powerful. The book is bound to be a huge success and deservedly so."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Exquisite in her choice of words, Susanna Clarke is part Jane Austen, part J.R.R. Tolkien. This is one of those rare, once in a generation works, which harmonizes serious writing with wildly entertaining storytelling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I tried. I really did. But it just didn't work. First I tried the audiobook--I have large chunks of time where I can listen as I commute or work out. About 6-8 hours in, I couldn't take it anymore--because nothing had happened. I kept listening and listening, thinking that finally it would get going--and it never did. I got home one evening, realized that I had wasted another perfectly good hour and a half listening to nothing happen, and pulled the book off my Ipod. Enough. But--so many liked it--so I tried reading it. But that didn't help either, as still nothing happened. Finally the book just sat by the chair and I had no incentive to pick it up again. Clearly, this is a book that is read for atmosphere, or historical setting, or for characterization, or something that escapes me, and not just for a plot moving along to a conclusion. Tolkien can get pretty slow at times too, but at least its pretty easy to skip over the songs or poetry, or other parts that I consider dull and keep moving. I could never do that with this book. So I finally just skipped over the book. I didn't even turn to the end to see how it ended. By then, I didn't care. And I still don't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I find myself in the minority on this one, but Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell for whatever reason just didn't strike a chord with me. The characters are colorful and distinct, and the settings, from Wellington's London, to rural England to Venice of the era are fantastic and atmospheric. The writing is delicious - evocative of popular 19th work right down to the quirky 3 page long digressive footnotes. But the story just fell flat for me. As a literature fan, I appreciated it very much - but as a fan of fiction, it just didn't grab me. If any of the above sounds appealing, by all means give it a try - but if you're going for a quick fantasy fix, or \\"Harry Potter\\" for adults, maybe go somewhere else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In JS&MB;, Clarke proves she's a wonderful writer. The scenes of wintry London and rural England are fabulous, and she has a knack for crafting characters at their persnickity best. But the biggest problem with this book is one of momentum, er...the lack of one. Little keeps the book moving forward, and it's a heavy book to keep balanced on your chest at night. I loved the characters, loved the mood, but the book on a whole never really goes anywhere. It's a quite maddening read. I really wanted to love this - devoted weeks to it, but the enchantment never came.I too was taken by the Harry Potter meets Victorian England marketing ploy. And the book does plod like an Jane Austen novel. All in all, more a page borer than a page burner. But three stars because Clarke can write. It's a shame she can't pace (or edit).And the footnotes detract. What's she trying to prove? As the book was coming to an end, I was glad for them though (they made the pages shorter)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Thia is not a Harry Potter magic kind of book - it casts you into a world of the magical unknown.This is the story of two magicians, and when you dabble where you should not go, you pay the price.

Every atmospheric detail is rich and crucial; there is nothing that is not essential to this mesmerizing, often frightening tale. Clarke's graceful-yet-tight writing is to be venerated--she has composed a masterwork to rival that of Tolkien, though in a much different context, of course. Each character, even the most minor, comes to life in a way that mirrors the famous \\"cathedral statuary\\" scene at the book's beginning. Much can be said about plot and subplots, but it suffices to reiterate that this is a book about two English magicians who become associates and, eventually, bitter rivals. That should imply enough to get you to buy it NOW.This should be read by anyone who admires excellence in fiction/historical-fiction, etc. More than just a fantasy, JS&MN; is (or will one day be regarded as) a true English-language classic.

It becomes necessary to know what happens to the difficult Mr. Norrell and his more talented student, Jonathan Strange, particularly after they become estranged. The mythic threads of this book are so tightly interwoven with mundane historical detail that one becomes locked into a mindset where the magical almost seems mundane also.The subgenre of \\"historical\\" fantasy continues to broaden and develop.

There is no doubt at to why Clarke took ten years to complete this story. The history she creates regarding the historical figure of the Raven King is astonishing. I can only imagine the pain and difficulty of creating a 'well known' historical character who is so controversial without being a charicature, that it inspires this fictional England to divide into two sects regardings this man. The characterization of the Raven King is central to the readability of the book. Without him, the world Clarke creates would be hollow.I also deeply appreciate the push and pull portrayed between jealous academics and the control of knowledge of magic in England. Those who live in the academic world can truly identify the debate and the utter pettiness of which Norrel and Strange engage. On occasion, Norrell appears to the reader as a bit obtuse, but this seems like a delibrate decision to highlight his absolute and ironic certainty that magic is a gentleman's calling, that the public need only be awed by it's results, and that the upper classes are the most trustworthy in all aspects of life.All of this sounds ponderous, I know, but the story is handled quite whimsically, especially when you read the engaging footnotes. I laughed hard on more than one occasion.I am an avid reader and can generally get through a large book in a couple of weeks. Not so with this book, but don't let it put you off. The characterization, the tug of war between theoretical and practical magic, and the meticulous creation of 19th century England is well worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Most of the 1 or 2 star reviews of this book I have read here say something like \\"I only got through the first 200 pages before I quit\\" somewhere in the review. I grant you that this book is not a good read for someone with no patience. It contains long breaks between the dramatic and suspenceful parts, but it is in these breaks in which the book stands apart from many others in the fantasy genre. It is in these breaks where much time and care is spent bringing the characters to life. Not only do you get to know the two title characters intimately, but you also grow to know and love many of the side characters. I admit there were times when I started to get bored and began to wonder if Mrs. Clark forgot about the plot entirely, but it seemed as though just at these times she gave me just enough of a taste of what was to come to keep me interested. Many of the seemingly disjointed and random subplots begin to weave themselves together brilliantly towards the end.

However, it is very slow-paced, and didn't get interesting until almost 200 pages into the story. If the editor had been a little more proactive (cutting some unnecessary passages) this would have been a better book. The story is nice, but it gets lost in the prose."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I badly wanted to love this book. I had read some of the reviews, and came to this missive with high expectations and a great deal of anticipation. The premise of the book is wonderful - magic always has been and always will be a part of English history, but for the moment (early 1800's), magic has retreated into other worlds, until Mr. Norrel and Jonathan Strange arrive on the scene. So far so good. When they do arrive on the scene, no one is the last bit surprised by the resurgence of magic. People know it always existed and are not the least bit surprised when stone statues in York start to talk, or geography is re-arranged in Spain to help Wellington and his troops. Nor are people the least bit scared of the magic. Magic, once found, is a natural tool in day to day lives. Again, so far so good.Susanna Clarke creates a wonderful structure for her novel. She skillfully weaves history and historical figures into a novel of fantasy, and very much makes you believe that magic certainly could be part of history ... or at the very least, could have been very useful back then, or even right now. She masterfully creates parallel worlds in the novel - the world as we know it in front of the mirror, and the magical worlds she creates behind the mirror. Using a mirror as the doorway between two worlds in nothing new, but the land of Faerie and the characters she creates are somewhat unique - since many of them are characters that started in our day-to-day world, but through enchantment, ended up locked on the other side. So one more time, so far so good.Then why only three stars (one for structure; one for imaginative plot; one because its Christmas and I am feeling generous)? Because there is simply nothing magical about the language. This books plods along at an almost tiresome pace. There is nothing about Ms. Clark's use of language that even hints at magic. This is the type of book where words and phrases should jump off the page - they should delight the reader, entice the reader; the story should literally fly (it is about magic, after all). Instead the quality of the prose is pedestrian. The pace is absolutely laconic. I wanted this story to literally take flight and transport me into the Faerie worlds, and instead, I felt like I was always an outsider looking in. I never felt as if I was \\"in\\" the book, but rather, was just reading the book. Had only Ms. Clarke teamed up with J.K.Rowling (who knows how to pace a book and use words), this might have been the book I had hoped it to be. This is not an adult Harry Potter - the plot and structure is completely different - but the way J.K.Rowling creates her books through language and pace would have been a good model for Ms. Clarke.Take, for example, the title characters. Have there ever been in the history of literature two more pedantic magicians than Norrell and Strange? While the book does not create a world where magicians look or dress any different than anyone else, these two magicians are not the least bit attractive. In a book this size, one needs to feel some sort of empathy with the characters - or at least strong associations, positive or negative - and I felt nothing for these two. Their rise, fall, demise, and confusion were just not the least bit interesting. And while the book certainly sets up volume two - they remain locked in perpetual darkness right to the end - I anticipate the next book about as much as I look forward to next recipe laden formula mystery ( I hate serial mysteries starring cats and chefs!).This is not a short book, and burdened with pedantic language and laborious pacing, its hard for me to believe that most readers will ever actually finish it. Nonetheless, it is a first novel, and one can always hope that perhaps the gentleman with thistle-down hair will become so incensed with the magic-less telling of his story, that he will cast a spell of enchantment upon Ms. Clarke and her use of language will become enchanted as well. I will admit, that if the next book continues with the history of the Raven King - John Uskglass - I will buy it for that. The Raven King was, for me. the most interesting character in the book, and I would love to see Ms. Clarke develop her next novel into a history of the Raven King - perhaps dispensing with the two work-a-day magicians, Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Boy, is this book overhyped. I think it will be like \\"..And Ladies of the Club\\" -- many will buy but few will read.About page 400, I stopped reading because what little plot there was had disappeared.

When the staffperson brought it out and it hit the desk with a resounding thud, I looked at the sheer thickness of it and thought \\"I absolutely hate to abandon a book that I've started, so this had better be as good as it sounded.\\" One hundred pages into it, I was rejoicing that it was so long, because it would last that much longer. Compared to the Happy Meal of my title, this is a long elaborate dinner with many courses, served with people who become good friends and who weave a spell with their dinner stories.But, as evidenced by other reviews here from people who had trouble with its style, it suffers from the kind of misperception that also spoiled the appetite of some mystery readers when they picked up Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The latter was not a mystery book in any classic sense; it wove a spell that pulled you into a time and place and it did so without being true to a particular genre.Even with the intrinsic presence of fantasy driving the plot, Strange/Norrell is much more a \\"classic\\" historical novel, character study and comedy of manners, footnoted with the kind of details with which Tolkien filled \\"The Silmarillion.\\" The fantasy is used to enrich it and to support several themes: Large ones such as the viral effects of advanced technology (substitute \\"genetic research\\" for \\"English Magic\\") or personal ones, such as the futility of dealing with one's worst nightmares by locking them up (oh, but just a peek won't hurt, unlocking it just this once can't hurt, oh yes). So I can say this, echoing other comments: If you are looking for Sword & Sorcery and lots of action, this isn't your cup of tea. But if you want something with substantial characters, wickedly dry humor, some existentialist horror, and scenes that will hang in your memory for months afterward, try this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is an odd book. It is 782 pages and, given the plot, should be about 150-200 pages, tops. In places, particularly at the the beginning, the author imitates the style and/or idiom of various 18th century writers. Towards the end, she appears to drop the pretense and just gets on with the narrative. In some places, imitative or not, the writing is quite good; at other times, it is merely servicable. The influences on the author apparently include Dickens, Thackeray, Austen, Stevenson and -- contemporary horror movies. In places, the dry humor and/or style references are amusing, at other times annoying or boring. After all, Dickens wrote in serial form and padded his works, but he was Dickens, and we don't quibble much now. It doesn't work for contemporary writers to imitate his excessiveness, which Ms. Clarke does.The faux-scholarly footnotes are a very bad idea. Particularly at the beginning, most particularly in the first chapter, the footnotes are a severe trial to one's patience, seeming like a very stupid addition to the story, having precious little to do with the actual plot. Any high school slacker could make up most of the footnotes, and generally they are not very amusing. The attention to detail with the inclusion of faux-scholarly old fairy stories in the footnotes is all the more bizarre when one considers that the author does not narrate or conclude her story in a scholarly fashion or even resolve her narrative satisfactorily. She raises a few questions about the fate of some characters, but doesn't honor the reader with so much as a footnote about the fate of the characters essential to her main plot.The first third of the book is boring, for the most part, because it is about Mr. Norrell. And, as many of her characters point out, Mr. Norrell is boring. When Mr. Strange enters the picture, things pick up. His development as a person and as a magician is quite interesting, but that's past the point where many readers will be sticking around to enjoy it. Moreover, the ending is disappointing and murky.If I were Ms. Clarke's editor, I would have insisted she rewrite the first chapter (many readers won't be tempted to go past it) and the last. When adopting the conceit of writing a faux-scholarly piece of fiction, no matter how unconvincing, the author would best serve the readers by concluding the story in accord with that conceit."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of the most excellent books I have ever read. Snobs will not like it. People who only like fast paced, Television style entertainment will not like it. If you like brilliant use of words for their own sake you will like this novel. this book is a wonderful story, with wonderful characters. long time English professors will not like it. New English majors will not like it. People who are entertained by anything on network televsion will not like it. This is a book made for graduate students of English and anyone who loves language. You can not come to it with prejudices."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's a sad state of affairs that a writer who so obviously loves language, the flow and form and rhythm and meter of it (19th century formality in particular) will undoubtedly find many negative reactions to her fine book.Too few people genuinely read nowadays. I grant you, many will perhaps ignore a health warning upon their cigarette packet, or pass a fleeting glance over ingredient lists to spot those pernicious carbs a-lurking. Perhaps one has even picked up a J. K. Rowling novel (which I can assure you will never ever find its way onto the recommended reading list of any reasonable school. Strange & Norrell is very likely to do so).This is not 'reading', no more than using a camcorder to forever commit ones relatives gyrating drunkenly at a wedding makes one a 'director', 'cameraman', or 'film-maker'.Ms. Clarke loves language. She loves stories. She loves worlds. There are more good examples of these latter two within \\"Strange & Norrell\\" than you will find in most writer's lifetime careers. Those who choose to ignore the footnotes are bypassing little gems of brilliance: fairytales of true originality, historical references which lend Clarke's Georgian England an even more convincing tie with our own, and even simple cross-references that remind you that, above all, this writer crafts her work with conviction.Once the book reaches its popular apogee, it will be interesting to see how many people attempt to justify its presence on their shelves by insisting that it is somehow 'not really fantasy', that it is in some way more respectable than that noun would suggest. They will use terms like: 'Alternative History', 'Fantastical Reality', or that old chestnut: 'Speculative Fiction'.I for one believe that the fairies and magicians in this book give lie to this notion.Embrace this book for what it is. This is the finest fantasy creation you are likely to read for a very, very long time.If by 'Liking fantasy' you mean that you have watched 'The Two Towers' with a bargain bucket of the Colonel's chicken spreading a grease stain over your pants like a meaty glacier, guffawing at the hilarious dwarf-tossing references, or that you insist upon the presence of Elves in your literature, then please move along. There is nothing to see here, and most would not appreciate you cluttering up the view."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"My fiance and I love to read to each other. This novel was one of the best readaloud books we have read. The careful descriptions and slowness of the pacing perfectly suited us. We loved the wit of the author - her quick moves from profound to trivial were delightful. We have been describing it as Jane Austen meets Harry Potter - wonderful period descriptions of the English upper classes of the early 19th century, with magic overlayed.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":". . . that gives an average of 3 stars.This really could have been two books. The first would end at the point where Napoleon is defeated at Waterloo. But, if I had read that 1st book, I probably would not have gone on to read the second because the 1st was so boring. Interestingly, most of the descriptions that I've read of the book really only address what happens in the first half of the book. They talk about how the two magicians go out and help England fight the forces of Napoleon using magic. Quite frankly, this part of the book is unbelievably boring and the plot seems to go nowhere. In fact, the whole thing with Napeleon has nothing to do with the last half of the book other than to have introduced a couple of characters whose background could have been explained in one sentence. It also gives a reason for the two magicians notoriety. All of that could have been done in a chapter or two. The first half of the book is also where we become painfully acquainted with Ms. Clarke's annoying footnotes. There is one of these disgusting things that runs the major portion of 4 pages in tiny mice type. If all this information is truly important to the story line, then put it in the text! As one reviewer suggested, you get the feeling that she just couldn't figure out how to work it into the text, so she just stuck it in the footnote. I suppose that she feels that it give the book a feeling of being an historical work. No, it's irritating! I also read that it took Ms. Clarke 10 years to write this 800+ page beast. To me it's almost like she's learning to write during the course of the book. By about mid-way, she figures out how to do it. It's too bad that a good editor or publisher didn't convince her to reduce the 1st half of the book to a few background paragraphs explaining how Mr. Norrell \\"came out of the closet\\" so to speak, how he met Jonathan Strange, and how they rose to fame in England.But once the war is over and Strange and Norrell part company because they have vastly different ideas on how the future of magic should unfold in England is where the real and good book begins. Here we start exploring the motivations behind the characters, their good and bad points, what makes them tick. Here I actually started loosing myself in the rich descriptions of Venice and the strange old woman who holds the secret of how a mere mortal can gain access to Farie. Here the novel actually starts to seem magical. Although the annoying footnotes continue, they seem to shrink in size.One thing that I feel I must address is the claim that this is an \\"adult\\" Harry Potter. I know I'm not the first to say this, but it's not. Harry Potter has the major underlying theme of good vs. evil. In this book, there is no monolithic struggle between good and evil. Each character is painted in shades of grey, each with a mixture of good and evil making a complex whole. This book is more about the interaction between these people and their internal struggles with themselves.It's quite obvious at the end of the book that Ms. Clarke is leaving it open so that if she feels like it she can write a sequel. I'll probably read it, but I sincerely hope it will read more like the last half of this book than the first half.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection.

Typically in books nearing 800 pages, there will be some moments of tedium, or points at which one just wishes the story to move along and finally get to the point...but this novel was completely lacking in those. The story never seems to move beyond a deliberate pace, however that pace is absolutely perfect for the story. At no point did i ever feel the story was rushed, or filler material thrown in to flesh out some minor point. One gets the impression that this being her first novel, Clarke was able to write it exactly as she wished, under her own contraints and not those of an editor with a deadline to meet. The end of the novel is written exactly the same as the beginning...even though one knows we are moving to the end, it is not done in a blind rush to just finish the story and get it printed. The story is ended in as detailed and intricate manner as the remainder of the book. Few books are written as such these days, and fewer still that can maintain energy and interest over 800 pages.I would highly reccommend this novel to anyone. It will suck you in immediately...but be warned, it will take awhile to read, and you will not want to do much else besides read it..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a great book but a slow one. Very tedious at times because it is written like a lecture or a scientific paper. It is written like a typical book of the early 19th Century with all the English snobbery, arrogance, and pompostity you's expect. All this makes it authentic and questioning if this book about magic and magicians coulld be real but it also very a drag for those that are not big fans of this type of druggery. Finally the book is so filled with fictional footnotes that it slows the pace of the book even further to the point that most fans of fantasy will be turned off by this book or give up on it.Having said that, the story is awesome and it breaks new ground in not only the fantasy genre but also that of historical fiction. If you can push yourself through it, or better yet listen to it on audio like I did, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"... and I read a lot. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is an eccentric book. It takes a lot of time and patience; but in the end it is worth all the effort. This book is rather an odd one to classify- its like nothing else I've ever read. It puts me in mind of a combination of Edmund Spenser's The Fairie Queene and Dickens's Pickwick Papers. I would argue that this book is nothing like Harry Potter- the magic in the Harry Potter series in darker and more sinister, though the magic performed in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turns out not to be all that it appears. Don't be intimidated by the length of the book- nearly 800 pages- this is a good, satidfying read which will have you hooked. The action centers around two magicians: Mr. Norrell and Mr. Strange, the former of which is determined to get rid of all the magicians in England aside from himself- and successfully wipes out all of the magicians of the city of York. He them goes to London, where he tries to bring the spirit of magic back into England. I found it interesting that Clarke combines religion and magic in an interesting way- Mr. Norrell performs a spectacular act of magic in York Cathedral. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is filled with all kinds of magical lore and magical history. Primary in the events of English magic is the reign of the Raven King, aka John Uskglass, whose reign lasted for 300 years. There are the Other Lands, which include Faerie, Northern England, and the Other Side of Hell.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell takes place between the years of 1808 and 1817, covering the events that took place in the wars against Napoleon and his French armies. Susanna Clarke tries to make light of a period of English history which was particularly troubling for the English. Throughout the course of the book Strange and Norrell perform acts of magic which include, but are certainly not limited to: creating roads which disapear again; moving rivers and other geographical features (ie moving Brussels to America); creating illusions to confuse the French; walking through mirrors; and looking into a bowl of water to determine what other people are doing. The book is filled with all kinds of fantastic similes- for example, \\"House, like people, are apt to become rather eccentric if left too much on their own; this house was the architectural equivalent of an old gentleman in a worn dressing-gown and slippers, who got up and went to bed at odd times of day, and who kept up a continual conversation with friends no one else could see\\" (452).There are some other characters which are worth paying attention to: Sir Walter Pole, a minister in Parliament; his wife, Lady Pole, who is brought back from the dead thanks to Mr. Norrell; Pole's butler, Stephen Black; Strange's wife, Arabella; a street performer named Vinculus; and the mysterious man with the thistle-down hair.Strange publishes an article in the Edinburg Review which challenges the views of his former tutor, Mr. Norrell; he later publishes a book called The History and Practice of English Magic, which outlines the subject from its beginnings to the present. Of course, there is a lot missing, as Mr. Norrell won't allow Mr. Strange to view the 4000 + books in his library at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire. The article and the book cause a divide in the relationship between the two magicians. It is at this point in the book that it becomes clear that the magic performed in this book is a lot more serious than we'd previously thought. In Fairie, there is a place called Lost-hope, where Stephen Black, Lady Pole, and later Arabella Strange spend all their time. The place is symbolic of the fates of all three of these characters.As Susanna Clarke mentions, \\"magic is the noblest profession in the world\\" (456). It may just be true, in the case of this book. I've said before that, although Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a long, often complicated book, it is not without its mysteries. It is precisely because of this that this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Headline in a local newspaper: Jane Austen is Alive and Well, and Writing Fantasy.Yup, that's right, folks. Jane Austen died and came back as a fantasy writer. In her new avatar, she calls herself Susanna Clarke, lives in Cambridge, and has authored a fat historical fantasy novel set in the year 1860. The book, which she now calls her \\"debut\\", began attracting media attention long before publication and on release it's been universally lauded. Unlike her previous avatar, the 21st century Ms Clarke (nee Austen) seems to be enjoying the attention showered upon her, and far from publishing her first book under a pseudonym, has been a central performer at her own media circus.The book itself has been called, by a media ever eager to summarize even 800-page hardcover tomes into a snappy catchphrase, \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" It's also been praised by perhaps the best living author of British fantasy novels (though he's now moved to the USA), Neil Gaiman, \\"Unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the past seventy years.\\"It helps that it's published by Bloomsbury, the very people who bought and believed in the maiden effort of a certain Joanna Rowling not many years past, and who were then stamped with the label of the \\"world's biggest fantasy publisher\\" on the strength of that Hogwartian breakthrough. At first appearance, this book would seem to have everything to recommend it: a great publisher, a promising new author (who spent an alleged ten years on the book), a beautifully-produced book design (the white covers were restricted to only the first 40,000 copies, so if you got one, you probably know already that it's a collector's item), and a book that seems perfect in every respect.So you really want to like this book. Love it, in fact. Especially if fat fantasy tomes are your buzz-biz. And discovering a great new author gives you the kind of kick that coke users must get when they take their first 'hit' of the day (and I'm talking about the soft drink addiction as well as the other kind!). So you settle into a cosy sofa, or your favourite ergonomically-designed seating, and crack the spine.And that's where the castle in the air falls to smoky shards. Crumbles into vapour. Vanishes with the suddenness of yet another overhyped media celebrity after her 15 nanoseconds of frame.Here's the story behind the headlines. JS & Mr N is a boring, dreary and unimaginative novel of manners, not magic. Unimaginative? Yes. Believe it or not, there's less imagination and originality displayed in these almost-800 large pages than in ten pages of a Harry Potter novel-and I'm not even a Harry Potter fanatic (just an ardent admirer)!The story is easily enough summed up: In an England where magic is studied but no longer practised, two practising magicians appear, aid their country in the war against Napolean, and generally change society forever. It's an interesting enough premise and one that you expect something dazzling of, perhaps even a clever fantasy take on War and Peace or Dickens with dragons. Anything but the dull and plodding monstrosity that it actually turns out to be.The novel is written in an impeccably manicured faux-Victorian prose straight out of the pages of an Austen novel of manners. And that's exactly what it is: a novel of manners, not magic. The characters parade about much like characters in an Austen novel, with great emphasis on how a person dresses, speaks and which parties he or she attends (or doesn't) but without the genial, deceptively-incisive Austen insight into hearts and minds that makes her simplicity so profound even today.There's a super-abundance of stiff, English-backed male characters who disembark from horse-carriages and tug on bellpulls to call for their valets, with the usual disregard for well-drawn women characters (extremely odd in a novel written by a 21st-century woman author) and even the obligatory repetition of numerous stereotypes and social slurs of the period, all, presumably, to convey historical accuracy.This is perhaps the one thing that Clarke does get right: accuracy. She recreates the English novel of the period with pitch-perfect detail. This is the novel's greatest strength-and failing. If you love utterly \\"English\\" novels, then you'll be in heaven. If you haven't read much literature since 1860, the period in the which the novel begins, then you've got a great treat in store.But if you've managed to imbibe something of world literature after the death of Napoleon, then you'll be left scratching your head and wondering at the lack of psychological insight, the completely bereft inner lives of the characters, the tepid and hesitant story that develops-lacking the subtle but certain iron-fist-in-velvet-glove surety of an Austen, the character depth and symbolic beauty of a James, and quite definitely the raucous emotional drama of a Dickens.On the fantasy front, the book falls woefully short in every respect. The footnotes, virtually a novel within a novel, are cleverly done but have been done before far more effectively-check out Mark Danielswki's brilliant dark literary fantasy House of Leaves. The attempt to combine realistic English settings with imaginative elements has been done far more effectively by writers like Tim Powers, Graham Joyce, Christopher Priest, and even Gaiman himself.The fantasy elements, while nicely done, are ultimately quite ordinary and lacking ambition. The historical period, while brilliantly recreated, stands like a beautiful set upon which no truly worthy drama is played out. Unlike, say, last year's well-deserved Booker winner, Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty published around the same time, this novel doesn't even aspire to re-visit a period of history in order to better illuminate some new aspect of the human condition. In fact, to pursue the unlikely comparison, Line of Beauty is a far more entertaining and rewarding book.On the plus side, Clarke's wit is brilliant, and she writes marvelously elegant prose. Who was it who said \\"the British write the best boring books\\"? Well, they also write some of the best books, period, but this is not one of them! JS & Mr N is immensely readable and not entirely without its charms. If beautiful writing, wit, and a perfectly achieved mimicry of the 19th century novel of manners were all this novel claimed to be, you could even forgive it its hype. A great novel of the fantastic, it certainly isn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.

Reading the entirety of this book is like starting a bicycle race on asphalt, then being handed a pogo stick and pointed at a bog. If you tough it out, then eventually you end up back on the asphalt, cruising to a delightful finish.Susanna Clarke is a woman with enormous talent, imagination, wonderful attention to detail and an excellent voice for parroting the masters of Old School.

Instead it is a wonderfully written tale that tries to insert a magical air to a certin period of time in England's history. I was amazed to find that this was Clarke's first published book as it was well written with a very nice flow to it, (although it does bog down every now and then when she discusses the particulars of magic, but this is done deliberately and it also helps define the charaters of some of the participants in the story). The writing style has been compared to that of Austen's and I would agree. The biggest difference is the lack of ease in the conversational dialogue, but the narrative is wonderful, and it more than makes up for it.

It's a spell to make you turn over 700 hundred plus pages. While there are qualities to the work that recommend the writer, the work itself is raw and unfinished.I fall in the camp that says not near enough happens in this book. But I say to the people who argue, with an air superiority, that He wants action - that action is character.There is no character development in this piece. The storylines of the characters just when they become engaging or, at least, tantalizing are dropped for too long and by the time they're picked up again, you're too frustrated to care.Stylistically, tone-wise, I give the author credit for carefully choosing and sifting out how to present the magic so that it feels real and firmly established in her world, but... that's too small an aspect to make up for such a turgid read.If anything, books that are written well move, and reveal, and develop, and engage - all of which is action."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke obviously put a lot of effort into this book. However, I think it was at least in part misdirected.I think the book is overly long and attempts to be too biographical in scope.

It's too rambling and unfocused to be a really good read.While attempting to include too long a stretch of time and too many events, the book fails to flesh out the events to a satisfying degree.If Clarke had opted for concentrating the conflicts of the story into a shorter time frame and fewer events, and really developing the plot and narrative around those elements, this could have been a great book.I really look forward to something else from this author, but I won't buy another 1000 page behemoth. A nice tight 300-400 page novel focused on tellnig a story, but with the same wit and humor, could be a real pleasure."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I read all the wonderful reviews and bought this book. I have picked it up 3 or 4 times and tried to get into it and I have yet to manage reading it. I just CANNOT get interested in the story or the characters. I LOVE the genre. Maybe it is the writing style, I really don't know. I would love to enjoy it the way others have but it puts me to sleep everytime I pick the darn thing up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I must not have read the reader profiles, or missed what was between the lines. This is one tedious book- be warned. In poking fun at her prissy characters the writer talks down all the time to the readers. The supposed parody of regency brit class system and manners is without original humor, very broad and superficial, unforgivably it is also very boring..The tale is purportedly about a magician in the times of Napoleon, winning the war for the brits by creating illusions such as a blockade or some such humbug- all without inciting too much emotion in England, to show the phlegmatic nature I suppose..It's like Harry Potter extra lite ..ie without the JK Rawlins talent, so sinks rapidly.The author paints the magicians as dreary,buffoonish petty characters and now 2/3 of the way into the book it's a dreary uninteresting NOT WELL WRITTEN read. You are warned! I will soon be donating my copy, check one out before you click on buy!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Evidently, I just don't \\"get it\\". And after trying to wade through this 10 lbs. of drivel, I really don't want to! This book was one of the most boring books I have picked up in a long time. There is no consistent plot and after getting half way through the book, there was not one character that I even cared about. I had read many reviews on this book and was expecting an enjoyable read. Boy, was I sadly mistaken. After reading 387 pages of this behemoth, I finally gave up. Luckily, I picked this up at my local library, so I wasn't out any money. Please save yourself the time and trouble and pass on this book. Although if you are looking for something to read at night to help you sleep, by all means, pick this one up. I was dosing usually within 2 to 3 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I tried, I really did. I made it as far as page 63. That is where the footnotes (footnotes!?) with size 5 font took up more space than the actual story. After squinting at the tiny type for a good ten minutes I tossed the book into the corner of my study. And there it lays still.Was there ever a more ponderous, tedious, flabby, unocoordinated, self-indulgent work of neuron sedating prose than this malodorous piece of bloated pseudo-fiction? I've had more fun reading an undergrad Physics textbook. I would rather listen to every one of George Bush's State of The Union speeches back-to-back, with the volume turned up, than attempt to read this monstrosity again.I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this book. It won the Hugo Award, the reviews were solid, if a bit evasive. It was likened to an adult Harry Potter. Okay, so I am an adult, is that any excuse for me to dabble in extreme mental masochism? And to call it science fiction is like calling Spinoza a light read. In short I feel conned, hoodwinked, pockets picked, my ear filled with the serpent's sweet lies, led astray by false advertising.The only good thing I can say about this careless heap of arcane mouthings is that I bought the paperback under Amazon's supersaver plan. It's in excellent condition, virtually unread, so I suppose I could gift wrap it and send it to someone I truly detest."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Let me say that I wanted to like this book. I really did. I adore the Harry Potter series and was looking forwarding to reading a fantasy book for adults, so to speak. However, as I slogged through the interminable pages, I found myself asking (a) how did this get published; (b) why such glowing reviews and (c) was the length really necessary? I believe this could have been half the length without losing any of its flavor. So, if you have a lot of time on your hands and wish to read something that could have been interesting and fun but just misses the mark, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought the hardback at Sam's a few years ago. I invested waaay too much time and money.This book was so beautifully written - but the story sucked. The author is certainly gifted. But i hated the book.Don't know to this day why(or how) I finished it.The characters were so very unlikeable - all of them. Except maybe for the black servant. He was ok. Not a redeeming quality assigned to any of them.The history part (Napoleonic Wars) was on the verge of interesting, but wasn't.There's a reason this book is NOT a movie. Nothing happens.I was most uncharitable when donated this book to the Y for their quarterly book sale. God forgive me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I tried to read this book. Really, I did. But I couldn't choke it down. Even after about 300 pages into it, I had to abandon ship. In concept, it should be a great book. Unfortunately, it is slow slow slow... Plus there are volumes and volumes of footnotes to the story that are completely superflous and have absolutely no bearing on the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It is long...and it is written to mimic speech of the early 19th century, but it is really a fun read. It's not Harry Potter and that's just fine, it's still a nice little trip far away from reality. I love the author's style, the characters are exasperatingly real and the story is great. Buy this book, enjoy this book...hopefully Ms. Clarke will write another book very soon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've read many thousands of books, and many more dense and detailed that this one. That people who like the novel seem to deride people who don't as being unintelligent or not having an attention span makes my blood boil.After 200 or so pages of this book, I just felt irritated beyond belief, and I could just imagine the author at her PC or typewriter with a smug look on her face thinking how great she is. I get that at times with Pratchett too. The footnotes that increased throughout the book added nothing and just took you out of what little story there was. How I finished it 'll never know, but I have to say it's the one book I really wish I'd not botehred with as it's just empty. Of everything. That's just my opinion.... If you feel otherwise that's fine.... I just don't happen to like prose for prose's sake. To me that's just self-indulgence.If I could have given this book minus stars I would have. I didn't just not enjoy it. I hated it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a well written novel but somehow the characters lack charisma. I felt absolutely no empathy for anyone in the book. The story loses steam in the middle and goes downhill after that. I would give this a miss and try Fingersmith by Sarah Walters instead or the classic Woman in White which is a thousand times better!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book was a real disappointment. Such plot as there was moved, if at all, with extraordinary sloth. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters. It was a death march in which the author painted impossibly broad and self-indulgent tapestries of backstory and side details while ignoring any semblance of story momentum.I can't believe that I actually finished it. It was probbably the incredulity I felt at having wasted so much time up to the point at which I had by the read that kept me going. \\"There has to be some redeeming material up ahead! I can't really have wasted this much time!\\" No such luck.I wish I had back the time I spent reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After all the glowing reviews this summer, I was really looking forward to devouring this book. After 250 pages (with 500+ to go), I put it down. Maybe it's me--I'm just not into fantasy writing much. I adore \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and have read it several times, and I've enjoyed the Harry Potter books, but...Calling this book \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" may be too correct: like Potter, it's English and it's about wizards, and it's long and lots of things happen, but like Potter, its author is more a story teller than a writer, and the best story (which HP and JS are not) still needs writing to keep it going. And editing. There's no reason this thing has to be this long. For a while I enjoyed Clarke's ability to mirror Jane Austen archetypes and syntax, but that's not enough. She introduces a zillion characters, then drops their stories for fifty pages or more, expecting you to remember who they are, but since they were never that well delineated to begin with, it's hard to remember who they are and what their stories are. About the best I can say is that the first third of the book is pleasant, but it's never compelling, and you gotta love fantasy for fantasy's sake, and length for length's sake."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There was a lot of fuss over this book when it first came out. The author asserted that it took her 10 years to write this book. It was touted as Harry Potter for adults, with the publisher so sure of success that they paid the author a 1 million advance. This was absolutely record breaking for a debut novel. Professional reviewers raved about the book. It won the 2005 Hugo award for best novel, and the 2004 Man Booker Award.So, curious, I picked up my own copy. I suppose, if I hadn't gone in with any expectations and more patience, I might have liked the book more. It is undoubtedly well-written, though not lyrical. More literary than a genre novel. However, I am a product of my television-reared generation... which means I have a very short attention span. This book definitely failed the 15 minute test (i.e. something must happen every 15 minutes or I get bored). I don't actually mean 15 minutes, though I do read pretty quickly... I'm just exaggerating to tell you that the pacing of the book is really slow.In fact, I found it so ploddingly slow that I gave up about 1/3 of the way through and have never picked it back up again. I've heard from others that it is quite rewarding if you can make yourself stick to it. However, I don't feel like I should have to make myself stick to something that I'm supposed to be doing for entertainment. Thus, the low scoring review. For those of you who are more inclined to work for your entertainment than just be entertained, have at it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm not sure why this book is so awfully transcribed. Don't you have your versions saved as a text program anyway? What happened to editors or proof readers? There are typos literally riddled throughout this text and it takes away from the story. Why would you even want to publish this? Be more professional in the future about E-book transitions.The rating above is for the poor presentation, I can barely get through the book because I'm so irritated by it's awful text mistakes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Can a magician kill a man by magic?\\" Lord Wellington asked Strange.Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. \\"I suppose a magician might,\\" he admitted, \\"but a gentleman never could.\\"The ultimate novel. An epic on English magic which is first and foremost, English, and secondly, magical.Extremely well-written, well-researched, and most of all, humorous. Susanna Clarke writes with the breadth of Tolkien, but the characters she creates are utterly believable, despite their uniqueness. Her prose rivals Lewis, elaborate and luxurious, yet an effortless read. Her footnotes are given much importance, and at times a page has nothing but. It makes re-reading an original experience. They contain side stories that are, in themselves, potential novels.An example:\\"Richard Chaston (1620-95). Chaston wrote that men and fairies both contain within them a faculty of reason and a faculty of magic. In men reason is strong and magic is weak. With fairies it is the other way around: magic comes very naturally to them, but by human standards they are barely sane.\\"Another favorite:\\"A thought appeared to strike him.\\"Would you like to be Archbishop of Canterbury tomorrow, Stephen?\\"\\"No thank you, sir.\\"\\"Are you quite certain? It is scarcely any trouble and if the Church has any attraction for you...?\\"\\"I promise you sir, it has none.\\"\\"Your good taste as ever does you credit.

Five stars? Susanna Clarke, is that you?This audiobook (or book if you read the print version) will break your heart. 32 hours of rambling tedium. Very little character development, not much internal consistency, and perhaps most damning of all, no action whatsover. Even the greatest \\"reveal\\" of the story is an offhand mention - no understanding of how it even happened.It was essentially a 100 page story spread out over 700 or so pages (over 30 hours). Go ahead and listen to it. I dare you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I waiver between liking this book (I'm only a few pages from the end, so I must like it enough to keep reading) and wishing I'd never bought it.The plot meanders all over the place. There is no one distinct story. There are several places it could have ended.My wish is that this was a series rather than a single book. With over 300,000 words there's plenty here for three books.I'm amazed that Clarke managed to find an agent, much less a publisher. But, I see all those different editions and so many reviews, it must be okay.Being a writer and knowing a lot of writers, we'd like to know what spell Clarke used to get this first \\"novel\\" published. It couldn't be the process the rest of us are going through."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"loved the clever, thoughtful austenite language and was drawn in at the start and the end, but lost the plot along with Strange during the middle (why did we need to go through all that stuff?), therefore found it too long and ended up wanting a more satisfactory conclusion (didn't anyone else think Childermass MUST have been the raven king? i think Clarke missed this! he slipped out of our grasp AGAIN!). However, the delightfully drawn characters, particularly subsidiary characters like Arabella and Drawlight, kept you feeling you were there with them so by half way through the book I'd say to myself \\"I really should read a book, it's been awhile since I read a book?\\", forgetting that I already was. Don't know whether this is a good thing or not. however, if you have been struggling to reconcile your love for both Harry Potter and Mr Darcy, i suggest a good dose of Strangites and Norrellites. 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is not a book that grabs your attention right away. The story starts with Mr. Norrell whom is neither an interesting character nor a likable one. Jonathan Strange is only moderately likable. Strange is introduced much later in the book.The plot is slow to develop and does not really begin till maybe the last 3/4 of the book.The strength of the book lies in Susana Clarke's development of this world. The many small side stories help creates an interesting world but at the same time it slows down the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Like the title of my review illustrating that the Beatles found some parts of their life story hard and long, the reading of this delicious novel is both hard and long too. I could read no more than 30/50 pages at any one sitting. The plot is Dickensian, the descriptions of events are long and wordy (though never difficult) and the action is developed among several main characters, making the read laborious.Well, it was worth it. The writing is terrific...often poetic and surprising in its mood changes. The writing is what kept me going.The two magicians, Strange and Norell live in early 19th century England where magicians have been banished for over 400 years. Their value has been diminished (due to the Age of Reason?), Prime Ministers, lesser ministers as well as the King himself seemed to have no use for magicians, and sure enough the country has done well enough without them. Along comes Napoleon and England's leaders are flustered....they don't know what to do about him and are losing their power year after year.Strange and Norell come to the rescue ( really Strange who is the social darling of the age and is a student of the anti-social Norell) and sure enough Wellington is able to defeat Napoleon.All of the social classes (snobby gentry, foolish ministers, and everyday people) are made fun of and are satirized very cleverly by Susanna Clarke, in her first novel.What made me leave the last star off my review was the ending, which fell flat. The main theme of the author was whether we humans are able to use magic (our imagination really) successfully in our lives or not. Was Clarke unable to come up with a more fulfilled finale to the battle of whether magic is good or evil....or did she want to leave the question open? Either way she left us uninspired at the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this amusing combination of magic, history, and good writing. Though at times a little dry, any who enjoy a fun historical should pick this gem up!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Boy this is a long book, and not exactly a page-turner. But I enjoyed it and plowed through it pretty rapidly. The two main characters are realistically drawn and yet somewhat underdeveloped. Norrell is a smallminded grump, Strange an absentminded gentleman. The magic is portrayed as an odd mixture of wonder, tedium, and ineffectiveness. It all works in terms of the plot and the story's internal logic, though. There are some really beautiful bits, and it is surely an impressive, even beautiful achievement. The main villain--the \\"gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\"--makes an indelible and oddly sympathetic impression. For a work with such massive heft I am not sure that the ultimate effect or weight is all that great, though. I see it as more of a brilliantly executed tour de force that is ultimately somewhat insubstantial--sort of like a literary version of the movie Forrest Gump. That comparison doesn't quite do justice to this book, but nevertheless kind of expresses my feelings upon putting it down after nearly a week and 780 enjoyable yet mildly baffling pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"you'll either love this book or else put it away esp. if you're the type of reader who prefers instant gratification. this work may appear initially daunting and voluminous, but therein lies its magic... it's not for everyone to appreciate and immediately like. in fact, i find it difficult to explain to my friends why i like it so much. i just know i do, and for some selfish reasons, it makes me even feel more blessed that only a few appreciate it the way i do. i know that sounds weird, but i'd probably feel bad (and somehow insulted) if i could hear somebody discuss it like some piece of pedestrian literature -- which isn't really far-fetched had the book become even more explosively popular than it already is. if you appreciate the exquiste combination of austen, wit (rather than just plain humor), history and fantasy -- like i do -- this book is for you. believe me, it's worth it. ENJOY"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I never thought I'd read, let alone positively review, an 800-page novel about magicians in 19th-century England. I admit I wouldn't have picked this up had the hardcover jacket not had such glowing reviews from American media. But pick it up (no small feat) I did and I am happy to report that nearly a month later I am very glad I did. The book takes a while to settle into, and requires no small amount of patience. There are numerous footnotes and archaic spellings. But its good qualities: sharp,subtle humor; beautifully realized characters; lovely writing--all make it worth the effort. It is Jane Austen and Tolkein and Dickens all at once. My only major complaint is that there are not enough compelling female characters! The most interesting one, Arabella Strange, is only there as a foil to her husband. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an absorbing and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Note: this review pertains specifically to the unabridged audio version of this book.I don't think I would have been to finish Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell if I had read it rather than listened to the unabridged audiobook. The story is slow moving, frequently digresses, and sometimes seems far more interested in atmosphere and background than in moving any story along. But at the same time there are pleasures to be had in abundance. If one likes the social panorama and dense detail of Dickens and the social commentary of Austen, you can find all of it here, in a panoply of characters ranging from the servant class through the military to the highest ranks of royalty. And all in the service of an alternate history/fantasy of an England once ruled by magic, and the quest to recover English magic and return it to the service of the nation.Parts of the book gallop along, including the segments showing the use of magic in the Napoleonic wars and the long awaited climax. Other parts tend to drag slowly and could probably have been trimmed.HOwever, the excellent narration by Simon Prebble kept me interested and involved during the slow bits when if I were reading it myself I might have wandered off for more flashy and immediately rewarding books. He does a masterful job of accents and voices, enabling me to keep a large cast of characters straight and even reading the numerous footnotes (they are more interesting than you would think!) in such a way that the digressions never cause the listener to lose track of the story.The unabridged book was a project of several months of listening, and I did wander off a few times, but my enjoyment of Prebble's reading always brought me back in the end. My only disappointment is the incomplete ending--after 30-odd hours of story I expected everything to be wrapped up--but there is room left for a sequel. On the other hand, I do look forward to a chance to spend some more time in the wonderful world of 19th century magical England, with characters I came to like very much (some in spite of their cranky selves, like Mr. Norrell!)If you have been interested in this book but find yourself daunted at the length of it, definitely check out the audio version. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am really amazed by some of the hostile reviews this book has recieved. First of all to say a book is horrible and a waste of time without giving a reason isn't very helpful. Tell us why you don't like the book instead of just spouting off about how much YOU hated it. Now that being said, this is indeed a long book, the first 200 or so pages do drag a bit, however it is so well written that it makes it worth while to stick with it. I found the last 600 pages are very entertaining. All of the charachters are very well developed, something that is really lacking in a lot of books. I can't say buy this book you will love it, because you may not, however if you enjoy any of the following:19th Century English History, Charles Dickens, British wit, intellegent writting,established charachters you actually care about, a book without swearing and sex in order to make it interesting, and you don't give up on a book just because it's too long, you will enjoy this book.If you enjoy any of the following:complaining a book is too long (for pete's sake Harry Potter is over 600 pages and 10 year olds read it without complaning), don't read anything but comic books, think farting and burping are funny, and find that intellegent, beautifully crafted writing is boring, then by all means stay away from this book. It's probably too deep for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Not your usual fantasy book. I was sad to finish this book because I had grown to enjoy your characters. Don't be put off by the first 200 pages, this is a beautiful read, which really uses the 1820 period as if you where there. If you are looking for elves and orc's don't bother, if you are looking for complex characters and well written story then this is a must read. If you've got a lot of time then I recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The book is about two 19th century magicians who attempt to return magic to England in a time of war.Four points:1. Clarke's language can be alienating at first to one expecting clipped, modern prose. You get over it - rather, you get into it.2. It is a well-researched book. Enough to fake it well. The footnotes I found distracting I skipped - reading them or not didn't effect the tangiblity of the world; they are a trick, but not an unpleasant one. Real historical characters wandered around the plot and are a good fit. Felt accurate, if not real.3. The book builds slowly, like falling snow. There's a lot of magic, but no 'set-pieces' - Clarke's success and failure comes from the slow integration of magic into the mannered comedy of her 19th century England. It never feels forced; it never explodes.4. There is sufficient resolution in that we know what each of the main characters will be doing at the start of the next story. It's the strangest thing - for so big a book to leave you wanting more. Magic indeed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I just finished today and was much more moved by the book's end than I expected to be. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, loved the characterizations, loved the historical detail and the dry dry humor, but wasn't very emotionally involved until the end. This is the kind of book you can't expect to like if you are impatient for things to \\"happen.\\" Things do happen, but it is minute attention to detail, manners and mores of the time, and an enjoyment of language that gets you there. I'm looking forward to the next one, whever and whatever it may be!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I can't tell you how refreshing it was to read a fantasy novel for adults that was not yet another \\"Lord of the Rings\\" rip-off. Instead, Susanna Clarke treats us to a story filled with magicians, folklore, fairies, footnotes and creatures from her own imagination that enrich the pages of her first novel. Perhaps her only similarity to Tolkien is her skill in making us believe that the events she describes are true occurrences, helped by her extensive use of footnotes, grounding in real folklore and enlightened, chatty prose. The next time you read of the Napoleonic War you may be surprised to find nothing of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell in the sources.Set between 1806 and 1817, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" tells the story of these two gentlemen magicians and their attempts to bring magic back into England and to magically assist the government in the war against Napoleon. After Mr Norrell proves to the country that he can indeed perform magical feats, he takes Jonathan Strange as his pupil. Eventually however, they find that they are too different to work together: Mr Norrell believes that magic is a studious, secret thing and keeps all his magical books locked away in a library. Strange however, thinks that magic should be shared and explored, and is attracted to the most perilous and dangerous magic that there is. Their biggest difference concerns the Raven King, a human child stolen and raised by fairies before coming back to conquer northern England. Though his reign ended hundreds of years ago, Norrell detests him and Strange adores him...and there are signs he has not quite left England...They are also surrounded by many other characters; wives, patrons, servants, friends and associates, most of whom have their own interconnecting stories throughout the story. This is perhaps one of the most rewarding parts of reading the book: the different threads of narratives that seem random and unconnected, but which exquisitely join together as the story reaches its end. Clarke does not spoon-fed the reader what he/she needs to know - if you want to unravel the various mysteries and intrigues, then you'll have to pay close attention to what's going on.Clarke speaks with a delicate narrative voice that is much akin to what you'll find in Jane Austen and other books published in this period, and she often addresses the reader directly, making it quite a personal read. Her use of footnotes is wonderful - every time a character mentions a book , a theory or story, she'll footnote more information concerning it, which once again gives the feeling that you're reading an historic account of these people's actions. Furthermore is her use of \`real' fairy lore, such as the capturing of human beings into the realm of Faery. Best of all, there's none of this \`sparkly, pretty, rainbows-and-flowers' fairy rubbish - these fairies are as they're meant to be - mysterious, sinister and capable of much destruction.Likewise, key historical events and figures, such as Napoleon, Wellington and Byron are included, and the story stretches from London, to the English countryside, to Italy, all of which is described in beautiful detail. Moments of intrigue - from the murder of a girl with ivy in her hair to an old woman who can only speak in cat - are scattered throughout, and exist only to add beauty and mystery to the overall novel. Such episodes are wonderful to read and ponder over.One thing that must be said though, is that it is a very unique book in terms of plotting. Though a climax to the tension does come (eventually), Clarke is content to explore the everyday life of the magicians and their associates, with the underlying mystery rearing its head on instances few and far between. This may not appeal to some; others may enjoy the slow meandering and subversive feel of the plot - that something sinister is going on beneath the more everyday occurrences. Another slight fault is the main characters themselves: although they are realistic and interesting, at times they do not come across as very nice people. Strange is certainly more sympathetic than Norrell, but he does not fully turn up till midway through the story.This is one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had in a long time: at different points thoughtful, original, clever, humorous, poignant and even scary! In a genre that is made up mostly of magic swords, dark lords, plucky young heroes and all the other fantasy cliches, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" is a welcome relief. If only all such authors took the same care and creativity with their novels that Susanna Clarke does with hers."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I found this book so enthralling, so well-done, so moving, and so intelligent that I savored it night after night, rationing my consumption to just a few pages at a time. If the book has one shortcoming, it is that it is not at least twice as long. I think it deserves all the praise it has received--and then some (why it wasn't nominated for the major international book awards mystifies me, bu then I quickly remember how hide-bound and resistant to real interest, accomplishment, and innovation such award-granting committees are). As a fan of J.K. Rowling, who is diverting and amusing in a thoroughly trivial way, I found Clarke's book devastatingly superior. The \\"Harry Potter for Grown Ups\\" marketing of this book never made sense to me. This book is a masterpiece, and comparing it to the chronicles of Hogwarts is like comparing Shakespeare to, say, John Grisham."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a busy working mom, my one chapter of a book a night before going to bed is my daily treat.

I was totally engaged from the first chapter and so sad when I read the final words. (Actually, the final \\"scene\\" in the book was my FAVORITE. Could definitely see it in a movie.) What really stuck with me, beyond the incredible imagery, the rich characterization, the wonderfully creative premise and detail, was the story of an enduring friendship based on a love of a craft.

This book is my MUST READ of 2004."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Although she is the author of several short stories, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" is Susanna Clarke's debut novel. Set in England in the early nineteenth century, it was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award.The book opens in late 1806 and charts the efforts of two men to re-establish magic in England. Of the title characters, Gilbert Norrell is introduced first. A 'gentleman', Norrell has seemingly devoted his life to the study of magic. He has an extensive library at his home (Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire) - so extensive, in fact, that very few others possess any books of value on the subject. While there are many 'theoretical' magicians throughout England - the Learned Society of York Magicians, for example - Norrell is the country's first practising magician in over two centuries. He deludes himself that he wants nothing more that the restoration of English Magic - in reality, he is a small, petty and vain man who really wants to be England's only magician. The early pages cover his meeting with two members of the York Society - Mr. Segundus and Mr. Honeyfoot - and his efforts to close the Society down. This final nail in their coffin comes when he casts a spell that makes the statues in York Cathedral 'come alive' they move and speak, telling all they have seen over the years. Shortly afterwards, following the advice of his servant Childermass, Norrell moves to London - here, he hopes to win greater influence. However, in convincing the government and military of his worth, he resorts to magic he would rather not use : he seeks help from a gentleman with thistle-down hair. Although the resulting magic brings him the fame and influence he sought, it ultimately causes a great deal of trouble for its beneficiary, Lady Pole, and her butler, Stephen Black.Jonathan Strange isn't introduced until much later into the book. Another gentleman, he is a good deal more likeable than Norrell - though some think him arrogant. Until a chance meeting with a character called Vinculus, Strange had tried his hand at several professions - but settled on none. Vinculus is one of the book's minor, but influential, characters. He had been one of London's 'street magicians' (mostly con artists), and was driven out of the city by Norrell. However, it seems that, one way or another, he has access to a prophecy relating to Norrell and Strange. Upon hearing it, Strange settles on magic and starts studying as best he can - in fact, he seems to have a natural talent for it. In time, he becomes totally immersed in his new career - perhaps sacrificing some things he shouldn't have along the way. However, at no point does he display the spiteful, self-centred streak Norrell regularly does.It is only a matter of time before the two magicians meet and, for a while, they appear to work well together. Before long, however, their relationship turns to rivalry. They key factor in the change is their differing opinion of John Uskridge, The Raven King. The greatest magician England had ever known, Uskridge was born in England but raised in Faerie. He returned in the 12th Century to establish his kingdom in Northern England. Norrell detests Uskridge - he considers the Raven King's magic to be of the darkest variety and should be removed from English Magic. Strange, on the other hand, feels this is impossible. In his opinion, Uskridge established the tradition of English Magic and one cannot exist without the other.While I did enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend this book unconditionally. Anyone expecting a grown-up version of Harry Potter will be disappointed - in my opinion, it's more like a grown-up version of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". It is very long (around 800 pages) and gets off to a slow start. Clarke is a big fan of Jane Austen, and seems to have modelled her writing for this book on Austen's. For example, some of the spellings are 'old-fashioned' - 'chuse' instead of choose. This may put some off - I know I'd have hated it as a teenager. It'll be hard work, but it's worth it in the end !"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Don't buy this book if Rowling is your template of excellence. It takes a more sophisticated reader to enjoy this book. The 19th century authors that seem closest to me are Trollope, Eliot, and Dickens. Perhaps the dry wit is Austen-like but it is too dark and large in scope to truly be like Austen. (I too am a huge Austen fan but that doesn't mean I can write like her). I think she has unacknowleged debt to Saki and M.R. James, two English authors from the early twentieth century who also wrote fantastic literature. Saki stories almost always take place in the countryside of England (and he, too, writes about the natural/fairy world as often malevolent) and James wrote about magic without using that word (characters in his stories cast runes or look in mirroirs and see the past or future, they cast spells on one another).I also agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is easier to read if you are familiar with 19th literature and history. It is possible that some of the jokes might be lost, but I am confident that it is more likely that whoever enjoys this book and doesn't know 19th century lit will realize that there might be some really wonderful books to be read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm not going to lie, I nearly gave up on reading this at 3 different occasions. The first third of the book is almost painfully dull and reading it is almost a chore. However, the author is just laying the foundation for the second and third acts of the book which pay off in a big way. Congratulations to the author on her achievement."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Author Susanna Clarke lists among her influences both J. R. R. Tolkein, and Jane Austen. Both these inspirations show strongly in \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.\\" This book, set in an alternate-historical England during the Napoleonic wars chronicles the restoration of English Magic through the efforts of two magicians (the titular Messrs Strange and Norrell). Conflict builds between the magicians, and an immortal, amoral third party threatens the life and sanity of all.Written in a style adapted from Austen's classics (known as 'Free indirect speech' to the English students), \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is enthralling primarily because of the brilliant imagination of setting and characters. A continuous witty sense of humor combines with rich and believable (if fantastic) back story to create the feeling of something actually written in the nineteenth century. One entertaining extra is the wealth of footnotes explaining events both historical and fictional.One word of caution: This book has been presented as an action story like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or Harry Potter. This is not the case. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is more \\"Downton Abbey\\" than \\"24\\". While absorbing and even exciting, this book is not thrill-a-minute.I recommend this book to all readers, but especially to the Ladies and Gentlemen with the patience to appreciate its depth and wit.If you can quote along with \\"The Princess Bride\\", or spend six hours with Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth with A&E;'s \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", this book is for you.Five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Let me start by saying that I don't normally read in the fantasy/sci-fi genre, but this one came highly recommended to me by a friend, so I gave it a chance. It almost didn't get finished. At over 850 pages of smaller than usual print (and given my limited reading time), I was a little leery of committing that much time.I was also nervous when I saw the style compared with Jane Austen. I've never been a huge fan of that style of writing. The characters often seem more like caricatures, either flat or over exaggerated. And this was the sense I got at the beginning of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, but I decided I would give it 100 pages before I gave up on it.Previous to the 100 pages, while I didn't find myself caring that much about the characters, there were just enough interesting moments to keep me going (such as Norrell essentially banning all other magicians from ever doing magic again... or more specifically how he pulled that feat off).However, I was hooked at probably page 96. Just in time. There was an act of just enough darkness to string me along past page 100, and the more I read, the more I enjoyed the story. There were still many moments where the character interactions bounced back to the superficial, but soon they started to fill out and seem like real people.I also enjoyed the historical aspect, especially the idea that magic played a part in the Napoleonic Wars (and I really enjoyed the individual acts of magic used) and the idea that this was a time when magic was accepted as reality (I believe this would fall under \\"speculative fiction\\"?).I even liked most of the numerous footnotes (although some tended to go on a little long. I've always been a fan of footnotes, often inserting them into my nonfiction). They added an element of \\"fantastic truth\\" to this world of men interacting with magic and the fairy realm (the latter of which was different than anything I've seen, although again, this isn't my normal genre). The mythology surrounding the mysterious Raven King, a child taken by fairies who went on to become a king of both England and Faerie, was well-crafted.I only had two gripes (besides the writing style/characterization in the beginning), which aren't that major. The first one was that it seemed like Clarke wasn't sure what type of story she wanted it to be once it really got going. There were several points where the story took very dark turns, and I would get excited and think it was a changing point, but then she would go back to the farcical. Some scenes were downright graphic (some I would even go so far as to describe as disturbing), and while I enjoyed them, they didn't seem to fit with the flavor of the rest of the book. I found myself wanting more of that type of story . I understand that ultimately this is her story and she can write it however she wants, but there was an accompanying unsettling feeling brought about by the shifts in tone.SPOILER ALERT FOR MY SECOND GRIPEMy other gripe was the fact that the Raven King never plays a significant part in the action of the story (beside in the development of the story). As I mentioned, the author goes to great lengths to create a mythology around this character and at least this reader was led to believe that he was going to make an appearance in some major way in the story. However, he only shows up for perhaps two pages towards the end (if I'm guessing correctly. The aforementioned figure is never named). Granted, what he does in those two pages is indeed important (and I know this isn't his story), but it seems like all of the build-up should've had more pay-off.IN CONCLUSION:Well, I hope I've given you enough information to decide if you want to read it or not. If you like historical fiction, matched with magic and fantasy, you'll love it. Personally, even though I'm not normally a fan or any of that, I'm still happy to say that I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable and immersive books I've read in a long time.

Not everyone can handle such complete and unapologetic fantasy, and you will know pretty soon whether or not this book is for you. But if you can allow this epic length story to completely sweep you away - then you will fall inexorably in love. I cannot believe this is a Kindle daily deal for $1.99 today.

Sure it takes a few hundred pages to gain plot momentum, but every sentence is pure gold. I don't think it necessary to describe what I liked about it - it's the same stuff every reviewer (who got it) liked. Suffice to say I'm at a loss as to what to read next - everything I've picked up (and put down) since has seemed childish and hack. I guess I'll have to read it again.That said, it's not for everyone. An affinity for 19th century history and literature is a genuine prerequisite. Otherwise may never get past the first couple hundred pages. I guess if you're a fan of George MacDonald or that guy who wrote about rings (sorry - I'm not a fan), you should dig this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this book. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is one of those rare books that makes you wish that you could immediately erase your memory so that you can read the book again, right now.

But if you like fantasy please give it a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell - Susanna Clark4 starsQuick version:This is an amazingly long story about two 19th century English magicians. Jonathan Strange becomes an apprentice to Mr. Norrell and together they help England defeat Napoleon. After the war, Strange and Norrell part company and form competing schools of magical study. In the end, they must work together to save innocent lives....................spoilers...................................Long version:Meticulously detailed, Susanna Clark has created an elaborate and historically accurate picture of early 19th century England ...except for the magicians...and the faeries.Her drawing room conversations contain all of the acute observation and dry wit of Jane Austin.\\"It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week\\"Her colorful characters lampoon British law and the aristocracy in the manner of Charles Dickens.\\" \`I would not have you think that the Admiralty is entirely helpless without Mr. Strange,' smiled Sir Walter. \`They have done what they can. They sent one of the clerks, a Mr. Petrofax, to Greenwich to seek out a childhood friend of Admiral Armincroft's to ask him, with his superior knowledge of the Admiral's character, what he thought the Admiral would do under such circumstances. But when Mr. Petrofax got to Greenwich the Admiral's childhood friend was drunk in bed, and Mr. Petrofax was not sure he understood the question.' \\"She rivals Tolkien in the scrupulous, painstaking development of her magical history. Tolkien added appendices and timelines to the end of his books. Ms Clark specializes in footnotes; many, many footnotes. In chapter 25, footnote 4, is actually a four page short story about the Master of Nottingham's daughter and a magic ring.This novel progresses very slowly with numerous sub-plots and the ever present footnotes. The atmosphere of the story changes with the scenery. Tales of the magic done in the war against Napoleon have an almost campy humor. (Before the Battle of Waterloo, Mr. Strange is called upon to move the city of Brussels out of harm's way. He removes it to a remote part of America. According to footnote 1 of Chapter 40, some deserters of the battle were discovered 15 years later, living among the Lakota as The Tribe of Half-Finished People.) On the other hand, the story Lady Pole's enchantment has a much darker tone of gothic horror. At the end of the book, Lord Byron makes a darkly comic appearance as he studies the seemingly mad Jonathan Strange with a view to using him as the great poet's muse.It is very hard for me to believe that this amazing book was a debut novel. On the other hand, I have no difficulty believing that Susanna Clark took 12 years to write it. The book comprises 782 pages of densely packed reading. Simon Prebble gives a superb performance on the 32 hour audio edition. One advantage of the audio version is that each footnote is tracked separately, so it is possible to use the forward button to skip past them. Those footnotes are the feature that prevents me from giving this book 5 stars. Most of the notes were interesting, entertaining or funny, but they always interrupted the narrative and brought an already slow story to a snail's pace.At times I wondered if Jonathan Strange, Mr. Norrell and Susanna Clark were having a good magician's laugh by continually adding pages to the text as I read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This rather long and sometimes meandering novel is one of the more unique pieces of writing to come along for quite some time. The fact that is has so many 5-star and 1-star ratings is indicative that it isn't everybody's cup-of-tea. More than most books, the writing style is either going to enamor or turn off readers. I personally liked the novel, and gave it five stars, but I also understand those who didn't like it and gave it poor reviews. Neither the high-reviewers nor the low-reviewers are right or wrong. This is the anchovies of books; some love them, and some hate them, and so with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.One thing for certain is that this is not the \\"Adult Harry Potter\\" as it is sometimes described. Other than taking place in England and having magic in the storyline, not much else is similar. I was more inclined to see similarities between this book and Tom Jones, despite the different eras and the complete lack of magic in that classic. But the feel of Jonathan Strange was reminiscent of that in Tom Jones.In other books with magic, the magic is usually center stage, the raison d'etre of the story. Despite the increasing amount of magic being conducted as the story progressed, I never got the feeling that magic was center stage. This novel was more about people and relationships, with the magic just being a skill that some of the characters could do.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but that is personal taste. Not everyone has enjoyed it. On the Kindle version, Amazon lets a prospective reader download a sample before purchase. I would recommend that readers take advantage of this opportunity to see if the story and style resonates with them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read. What an amazing story with such endearing characters. Many times I read books that are characterized as \\"well written,\\" only to be disappointed with a dull story line and thick prose. THIS book, however, was anything but. While it took me a while to get through it, I could never be gone from the story and its characters for too long. There were many different character story lines, all of which were interconnected and beautifully woven together - the jump from one character's story to another was not choppy at all. The love/hate friendship between Strange and Norrel often made me smile and even laugh, and once the two were together in the text, they complimented each other so well.I also loved how the study of English \\"magic\\" was akinned to philosophy or the law - a nobel profession quite unlike other contemperaneous depictions of magic where it is shunned and/or hidden from the \\"muggles\\". Yet in the end, well . . . I guess you'll have to read to find out."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"1,024 pages felt like 5,000 pages. The Author is brilliant, weaving her tale from story to story. However, I feel that it could have been condensed. It was tedious and felt like it was never going to end. I don't want to give the ending away, but it was not as climactic for all the time invested. I'm happy with myself that I finished it, but just not my cup of tea! I should have read the reviews, first!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said elsewhere: JS&MN is an awesome (in pretty much every sense of the word) literary achievement. It is a beautiful piece of writing and an exceptional act of story-telling. JS&MN is a fully-realized, wholly convincing, 19th century British novel from the pen of a 21st century author. In every way, on most every page, JS&MN astounds with its artful turns of phrase, its unexpected narrative twists, and its subtle humor. I was, for the most part, completely absorbed in this book. It's hard to believe this is Clarke's first novel. Here's hoping it is the first of many to come. The note of hesitancy I strike in the title of my review is not on account of any intended criticism of this novel or its author. In the interest of providing a full accounting of my own readerly experience, I simply feel the need to note that I personally found JS&MN a bit long in the tooth. It's not that this novel's page count was excessive (though it is, to be sure, quite high) or that any of that count seemed like filler (it did not). It's just that 400 or so pages in, I wasn't quite so interested in the world of this novel as I had been at the outset. There's so much to read, and only so much time... That said, I am very glad I read this brilliant and highly original book. Clarke richly deserves a space on the shelf with the immortals of fantasy literature. Whatever your tastes in fiction, you'd be crazy not to give JS&MN a go."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This was my second attempt at reading this book. I'd tried when it first came out, with the heavy intimidating hardback (though sometimes a giant hardback that I can't hold in one hand is the best thing ever!). Since it was a fantasy novel with magic and wizards and set within a historical period, I was expecting something fast paced and somewhat action packed. So when I got 200+ pages in and had yet to have a scene where something physically happened involving some sort of action, I gave up.When the paperback came out I was unable to stop myself from purchasing it. This is a thing that's developed in me over the years spent in the book business. When I see a book that I think should be good and has a really great cover (since I have seen many bad covers, such as all the Robert Jordan books), I need to own it. I'd told myself that I'd give this book another try at a later date and so before I left Copperfield's I bought it.About a month ago I started listening to it on audiobook, got about fifteen minutes into it, and while the voices were very good and English, I could tell from the well developed language of the book that it would be better and deserved to be read in the paper form. I sloughed through it this time, finally rewarded with a few actions scenes, and some very interesting plot. I still felt it went on a little too long and there could've been an entire book of the same size with all the stuff that didn't get revealed in the book. When you create a unique world, I like to know how it came to be and a lot of the details of why it is this way, and there wasn't as much of that in Jonathan Strange. It centered more around two kind of lame magicians, one of which is an old annoying selfish fart, and an ego-maniacal fairy who wants to control the real world as well as that of Faerie. Near the end some of the characters did some weird things as well that I thought were unwarranted and kind of came out of nowhere, which really bugs me with long books that have the room and the time to set this up.Nevertheless, I'm definitely glad I worked through it and read the whole thing and that I own it and maybe, in five or ten years, I'll give it a reread and see it in a totally different way.I've discovered in my reading that it really depends on my current mood and state of what I can get from a book. I can be impatient and want something to grab me right away, which is why I didn't like the book at first, but when I tried again in a calmer state, I was able to enjoy it. It's all very weird and probably a little OCD in some way, but over the many many years of reading and the many many books read, I've become picky in what I read and what I want to read and how I want to read it.Originally written on April 26th, 2006 Alex C. Telander.For more reviews and exclusive interviews, go to BookBanter:[...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In response to the reviewers who found this book too long and too boring:I found this book enchanting. There were times where I couldn't put it down. There were other times where it was difficult to read and I had to slog through parts, but it was incredibly rewarding in the end. The best reward is that here I am 6 years later thinking about the book and wanting to re-read it. So many images from \\"Strange\\" are burned into my memory, and still haunt me. The magic performed in the book is almost tangible, and it does go to some dark places (that sometimes resemble the subconscious). For example, raising the dead, who is then nothing but a shadow of her former self, more married to the other world than this one. The other scene which is burned in my mind comes towards the later half when the protagonist is exploring how to drive himself insane, and poisons himself with the essence of a truly insane woman and her dead rats. Wow. Who thinks up that stuff?So while the plot often meanders in many different directions, I enjoyed the journey, and am planning to take the trip again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell has the style of Charles Dickens mixed with the social comedy of Jane Austen with a little bit of magic sprinkled on top. Deliciously sarcastic, witty, mysterious and entertaining the whole way through. Magic is handled in a way that was so refreshing and unique. It flows beautifully and isn't chopping like old-fashioned novels are wont to be. There's a slight eeriness woven throughout that makes it so compelling. I'm not going to lie, though. It took me a good 4 weeks to plow through the whole thing. It doesn't end on a cliff-hanger, but at the same time it doesn't wrap everything up for you - it leaves you to imagine what will happen next. It's possible that the author left it open for a sequel, but there just wasn't enough story left for an entire book (as far as I can tell)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I received Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell as a Christmas gift and was put off from reading it by its considerable bulk. I'm not typically into fantasy novels, and I was put off by a few remarks from friends about it; however, over the summer I finally decided to delve into this book and found that it was a treasure. I suppose the book was tailor made for me as an English major and somewhat of a history buff. Ms. Clarke does a superb job of weaving together Austenesque Regency England, fantasy and a lite version of Wallace/ Mark Z. Danielewski footnoting.Anyone venturing through these reviews will have the gist of the story. Two wizards, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, appear in England to revive magic and gain considerable fame in the process. The two wizards become friends only to develop a personal rivalry, etc etc. Of course, you can get most of that from the Amazon description. What really makes the story is the world that Ms. Clarke develops. As a historical novel, she frequently mixes historical and fiction figures; equally, she does a good job of depicting Regency England, while also critiquing certain aspects of society.A lot of the negative reviews bring up the footnotes. I can see where people are coming from. Most of the footnotes do not necessary change the story in any dramatic way, but I think the footnotes do add an extra layer to the story. Also, it seems impossible to not compare and contrast this with Harry Potter, yet I would urge potental buys to resist the tempation. If you're looking for an extention of the Harry Potter series (which a lot of people were asking me when I was reading this), then you'll end up dissapointed; equally, if you are looking for the \\"adult\\" verision of Harry Potter, I think you'll also end up a bit dissapointed. In the end,it's unfair to compare these books to each other (especially considering there are six more books in Ms. Rowlings series, and it appears that Ms. Clarke will be laboring on the possible sequal to this book for God knows how long).While I wouldn't call Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell great literature, I do the book is an excellent read. If you give the story time to do its magic, you'll find that the 1,000 odd pages hardly seem long enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I find it difficult to recommend this book to anyone, even though I thoroughly loved it. Whether or not you enjoy it truly depends on what you want to get out of the book.Pros: immensely intricate plot, likeable and believably flawed characters, occasionally beautiful writing, events are consistent with the time period described, humor throughout, clever alternative history, satisfying conclusionCons: very long, extensive exposition in footnotes, writing style may seem gimmicky to someI didn't personally have any problems with the length, footnotes, or writing style. This is not a quick read. Nor is it a fantasy epic in the traditional sense. This is a book to be savored slowly, not devoured. And the only way you can really savor it is if you give it the time of day. The often meandering plot is punctuated with several extraneous details -- and it is not until the last third of the book that these diverging plot threads take on some meaning. If that doesn't sound fun to you, I don't blame you. Even I felt that the plot dragged at some points, but the writing was always so sharp that I didn't end up caring.The star of this novel is the writing. Clarke has a firm grasp of her characters and setting and can show us, rather than tell us, what is going on. She has the gift of saying a lot without saying much. This novel has some great one-liners which are sure to make you chuckle. In fact the humor is what drew me to it initially. It's a pretty good way to see if you'll like the book, actually: Read the first couple of chapters. If you don't think they're funny, then you probably won't enjoy the book.Give it a try. It requires a commitment but is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell ( S&N; from here out), has been described as a fantasy novel, an alternative history novel, and a historical novel. I'm not too concerned about that, though, since this 2005 Hugo Award winner falls into the most important category of novels: good novels.Set in early 19th century England, S&N; opens in 1806, and carries the characters through the Napoleonic Wars and into 1816. The book assumes a history of magic in England that had died out centuries before the story begins, and the title characters (first Norrell and then Strange) become the first practicing magicians in centuries. The story follows their attempts to restore English magic (and figuring out what that even means in practice).The story begins slowly, admittedly, as the reader is introduced to a large cast of memorable characters, with the title duo joined by African-British butler Stephen Black, Norrell's servant John Childermass, the ever-afflicted Lady Pole, gentlemen about town Henry Lascelles and Christopher Drawlight, and the mysterious fairy, the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair all being developed as well-rounded, believable, deep (if not all of them likeable) characters. Historical figures make appearances as well, most predominately and most enjoyably Duke Wellington and Lord Byron.In addition to the large cast, S&N; is peppered with footnotes that expound upon the history of magic in England, discussing magicians and magic of long ago, and adding layer upon layer upon the history of the real England. Looming over all of this history is the enigmatic Raven King, a magician who ruled northern England for centuries before disappearing and is credited with the creation of English magic.As the novel progresses, the characters and the histories are drawn tighter and tighter together, and the pace of the novel picks up as the different pieces all fall into place. It may seem like a lot of characters and a lot of background, but almost all of it ends ups tying into the many and satisfying payoffs at the conclusion of the novel.Besides the setting, plot, and characters, what really sets S&N; apart is the language. Clarke's writing is full of fantastic turns of phrases and a subtle poetic quality, combined with a dry and occasionally sarcastic humor. Having recently re-read Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, along with previously enjoying British novels of 19th century such as Frankenstein and Dracula, the prose manages to capture much of the feel of the time, and really makes the reader believe that this book could have been published in 1820, instead of 2004.I listened to S&N; on audio book, and Simon Prebble's reading was very strong. He carries off the old fashioned language as if it were the simplest thing in the world, and his voices for each character fit them perfectly.If you have the patience to allow the story to build, and enjoy deeply layed narrative and great use of the English language, I highly recommend Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. I'll leave you with two of my favorite examples of the language and themes in the novel.- \\"'Can a magician kill a man by magic?' Lord Wellington asked Strange. Strange frowned.

If you find it hard to sleep, and don't like to rely on pills, this is the bedtime reading for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The reviews of this book are polarized. A large number of reader-reviewers love this book, a smaller but apparently equally passionate reader-reviewers can't stand it. On balance, this is a good book. The premise and development of an alternative universe involving magic are very good. The plot is ingenious and I found character development to be good. Set in the early 19th century, Clarke made a conscious and largely successful effort to pattern this book on the work of Jane Austen and particularly Thackray. The combination of fantasy with serious comedy of manners in unusual and largely successful. Clarke has also done a reasonably good job of integrating some real historical personages like Wellington, and Byron into the book.Readers, however, who object to the length of the book are justified in their complaints. I think more vigorous editing would have improved the book without sacrificing the period quality of the presentation. This is a first novel and the conclusion leaves open the door for a sequel. We'll see what Clarke can do in her next book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I found myself gripped by this novel right from the start. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell surreally combines the righteous ordered world of an early 19th century novel with a fierce mystical magical vision very out of place with an early 19th century novel. This discontinuity sets off a delicious tension; between the real and the unreal; between good and evil; between the natural and the artificial; between love and hate.Susanna Clarke creates brilliantly realized characters that play off one another in classic, but seldom unoriginal ways. She then stirs in a vision of magic that is both ancient, sublime, and yet utterly modern and original too. At its heart it's a buddy story - a pair of two totally different people with real love-hate relationship. The narrative plays with notions of good and evil but things are seldom as cut and dried as they seem. Good and evil frequently change places (or at least our perception of whether a given character or act is good or evil frequently changes). Throw in a good dose of danger, excitement, weirdness of the supernatural and madness and you have high gothic thriller than manages to be something more sublime - a superbly detailed parallel universe; one with recognizable people and historical details but one very alien to our own suffused with magic as it is.My wife didn't like or recommend this to me. She found too many of the characters unlikeable. I feel she has missed the mark. Just like Dickens - there are some really odious characters here - particularly the jealous, fearful, miserly Norrell; the sycophantic and scheming Drawlight; the foppish yet morally bankrupt Lascelles - and even the eerie, somehow sinister and uncouth Childermass. I haven't even touched on the villain of the piece either. Even Strange - apparently the most admirable character is somewhat maddeningly self involved and unobservant. Many of these characters have redeeming and even heroic aspects. Secondly, the use of the dark underbelly of the human soul sets off the shining virtues (when they appear) like chiaroscuro. This isn't a standard adventure tale. This is far more sophisticated stuff where people make choices of ambiguous moral content and then live the consequences, even if their hearts are in the right place.But even more impressive than the characters is the depiction of magic itself. Landscapes and elemental forces are molded - water, earth, paintings, and brick are molded into magical servants. Bowls of water are visionary portals. Mirrors are doors. Landscapes are putty to be moved around. Whole cities and rivers are moved. In the latter phases of the book when the plot ups the magical ante a deep mysterious connection between an animistic consciousness in aspects of the natural world (the sky, rocks, rivers, trees, the earth) communicates and relates. Sorcerers in fantasy tales are usually viewed from a 3rd person perspective. In a modern, Tolstoy-like manner, Clarke takes us inside the minds of people doing and experiencing magic. Her vision is original and powerful and the experience is unsettling.Looking over the reviews here I can see lots of folks complaining about the length and pacing of this book. I didn't have any problems with either. Certainly it's very long (probably same word count as War and Peace - to keep my Tolstoy parallel going) - and like War and Peace it alternates between domestic spheres of action (conversations in drawing rooms) and action on the (many and varied) battlefields. Magical terms and a vast, vital, library of magical texts and traditions, lore, tales, characters, history is invoked and then explained in lengthy, brilliantly detailed footnotes. Undoubtedly this drives some people nuts. In many ways the stand-alone stories in some of the footnotes are the best and must fun things in the whole book. This extra level of detail suffuses the whole enterprise with a convincing verisimilitude that made me actually believe in these pseudo traditions enough to look them up on the Internet to find out more - (but of course they are part of Clarke's inventions). Such amazing inventiveness! I could have devoured it if it were twice as long.This was just a great great read - especially recommended if you can stomach Dickens (as a touchstone for your ability to handle 19th century English language, wild characters, and narrative darkness). Pick this up and just read the early chapter \\"Brest\\" out of context. It works brilliantly as a stand-alone short story. Then just see if you can put it down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've been listening to Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in the car for a week or two now -- and I'm only half way through! Yet, the really amazing thing is this: I wish it was four times longer.I don't know if the Man With the Thistledown Hair has enchanted me, or if I'm just held enthralled by Clarke's narrative (or both), but I know I'm going to be incredibly sad when I've finished this extraordinary audiobook edition of the 10 pound novel.Describing Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is probably best left to other reviewers (as well as Amazon's own staff). Suffice to say this is a historical novel of English magic in the same way This is Spinal Tap is a \\"rockumentary\\" about a British rock band.Which is to say it's a fantastically detailed fake. From start to finish. But you'd never know it. It contains footnotes, sometimes in exquisite detail, of published books that never were...of lively conversations held between people that never existed...combined with historical references (such as to the Napoleonic wars) that serve to give the book an uncanny air of verisimilitude. Like it's a book of history, rather than a novel.All of which is remarkable enough on its own. But when viewed as part of an intricate tapestry that weaves together stories about fairy kingdoms, England's two best known magicians (the titular Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell), servants, dukes, ladies, wars and every day life in Britian in the early 1800s...well, it's almost overwhelming.I used to think Neil Gaiman (who heartily praised Clarke's novel) was the king of dreamscapes and enchantments. I often thought Clive Barker had a corner on writing books so involved, detailed and engrossing that it literally felt like stepping into another world upon opening their pages. I even considered Tolkien to be the master of creating magical lands and creatures.But Susanna Clarke has them all beat. And I say that with all the reverence such a statement requires.She has a command of the English language that makes listening to her book (which, by the way, is narrated by British actor Simon Prebble) a delight. Honestly, I run the risk of sounding hyperbolic when I tell you that this is the most engrossing, enjoyable audio book I've ever heard in my life. And I include Jim Dale's outstanding narration of the Harry Potter series among those I've heard. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, as narrated by the remarkable Prebble, offers a world that's deep, rich and real -- despite the fact that the subject matter is (a) made up, and (b) about magic, fairies and magicians.I can't praise this book -- especially in its audio edition -- highly enough. As I said, I'm only halfway through listening to it. I have no idea where the story will take me. But I'm enjoying the journey like never before.This book belongs on the shelf of every lover of superb storytelling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"When I bought this book all I knew about it was that it takes place during the Napoleonic Wars and was supposed to be \\"the Harry Potter for Adults.\\"The book is long. Let's just get that out of the way. The print is small. This book is very daunting when you first pick it up.However, it is very good. It does take a while to get going, but it is very engrossing once you are into it. The character are rich and well described. Susanna Clarke has a definite talent for describing settings and people. She doesn't use the same old tired cliches.In many ways the book is like a Dickens novel. There are a wide range of characters that in one way or another are related to each other, but it takes most of the book for us to figure out how.I honestly loved this book. It is not the Harry Potter for adults because it does not relate to that book other than the fact it is about wizards. This book should be considered a fine classic and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading a good novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a series of contradictions. It's a magical tale about the mundane, an alternate history nearly identical to our own, a comedy of manners that is itself as affected as a smoking jacket and meerschaum pipe. It's at once refreshingly new and hugely derivative, a mashup -- \\"The Prestige\\" as directed by Tim Burton and produced by Merchant Ivory. Deserved or not, it is a phenomenon.\\"Jonathan Strange...\\" arrives like a Duchess at a royal ball, bedecked with \\"Best Novel\\" honors from the Hugo, World Fantasy and Locus awards. Its path was strewn with praise by fantasy's regining King of Cool, Neil Gaiman. The publisher reportedly paid Ms Clarke a seven-figure advance, a bet that paid off when the book peaked at number three on the New York Times bestseller list.So it's with great trepidation that I step in front of this lumbering bandwagon as it caterpillars toward me, and say, I do not like it.Sorry. I admire it, respect it, but I don't like it. However much I stand in awe of Ms Clarke's work, and I do, it is awesome in the same way that Stalinist architecture is awesome: the sheer scale takes your breath away, but it is hard to love the final product.In Ms Clarke's England, magic and fairies (think \\"Labyrinth\\", not \\"Peter Pan\\") are real but forgotten, and there have been no true magicians for centuries. None, that is, until magic stages a return in the persons of scholarly and Scrooge-ish Gilbert Norrell, and talented gentleman amateur Jonathan Strange. The focus falls first on Norrell, as he rises to fame after bringing back to life the fiancee of a leading politician, then on Strange, as he first becomes Norrell's pupil but then rejects his master's timid approach. In the third act, the two are thrown back together to face the deadly consequences of Mr Norrell's earlier act of resurrection.Ms Clarke's innovation is two-fold. First, she sets her tale not in some unpronounceable empire ruled by jockstrapping barbarians and pneumatic princesses, nor in a medieval kindgom of errant knights and distressed damsels, but in the stuffy drawing room of 19th century England. Second, the book itself is written in the Romantic style of 19th century literature. Ms Clark uses archaic spellings such as \\"shewed\\" and \\"chuse\\" in place of \\"showed\\" and \\"choose\\". The plot is episodic and the pacing not so much glacial as granitic. Finally, the nameless narrator is a keen observer of social manners and possessed of a positively Saharan sense of humor. The illusion of historicity is buttressed by hundreds of footnotes, some of them pages long, detailing an invented history of magic and folklore.Sustaining this style and tone over the course of a 1,000+ page novel is an act of endurance on par with running back-to-back marathons. Bravo. Sadly, what should be immersive winds up being distancing. \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" has been compared to the works of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, but frankly it feels closer to \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\", a one-line joke that gets carried on for an entire novel. What's worse, the slightly mocking tone invites you to ridicule rather than sympathize with the characters, and it is hard to find much warmth for either Norrell or Strange when the author herself regards them so coolly.As a work of imagination, too, \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" is a bit of a letdown. No, scratch that. It positively bubbles and froths with invention and ideas. A pity they are almost all buried in the footnotes. Ms Clarke presents us with a richly-detailed, colorful backdrop, then foregrounds a rather dull, grey tale. The first three quarters of the book are so singularly lacking in incident that the language becomes not sedate but soporific. The final break between the two main characters, for example, involves a mildly critical magazine article.Despite the hype, this is far too inaccessible a novel to merit the mantle of \\"Harry Potter for adults\\". Indeed, the book's highest accomplishment will probably to help move fantasy beyond Rowling and Tolkien wannabes. Funny that a book so rooted in the past should propel the genre forward, but hey, what's one more contradiction?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm plowing through this one, but it is a labor. Lots of cutesy period detail but an abundance of characters who drive me to wishing awful fates upon them. Technically very very throrough, but I need some positive feedback every now and then."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"At first I was a little hesitant having read so much praise for this book. The first 100 pages seem to drag along. Clarke seems to find her story after that rather long setup. I won't say the plot kicks into high gear, that doesn't really happen until about the last 1/3 of the book, but the characters and their interactions as well as the build up of the story make it a page turner.There's alot of humor hidden in this story, not the kind that grabs you and hits you over the head, but the kind of humor you get a little chuckle or say that was clever to yourself.As for the footnotes, I loved them. Some were stories within the story and were very entertaining. The others helped to go in to more details on things that you didn't necessarily have to know to keep up with the plot.I'll definitely be looking for more works from Clarke and hoping she decides to revisit this world."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: A Novel, by Susanna Clark is an odd egg to describe. It has been called a Historical Fantasy, and I guess that is a good enough summarization. It is historical in the sense that it is set in England during the Napoleonic Wars. It is fantasy in the sense that there are magic and fairies. That is about as far as it goes on both aspects.I've read my fair share of both historical and fantasy novels. I've read good and bad in both genres. This novel is the best of both without completely being either. Most historical novels or alternative history novels that I have read concentrate on setting. When reading these, the reader is given lengthy descriptions of foods eaten, clothes worn, architecture, customs followed, etc.. Too often in the weakest of this type of story, these elements overshadow plot and characterization. The fantasy novel tends to be re-hashed Tolkien. A group of unlikely heroes set out upon an impossible quest, only to persevere in the end against all odds, proving yet again that there is a bit of a hero in the seemingly unlikeliest of characters. Along the way, fantastical places are visited and amazing feats of magic are performed.Clark's novel is none of the above. She does not give lengthy descriptions of setting and customs; rather, she gives just enough that the reader knows solidly where she is. While there are elements of fantasy, she avoids the Tolkien re-hash syndrome and gives her reader a fantasy experience that they will long remember.Her novel is not driven by plot. For me, pages were turned quickly, but not to find out what happens next. Clark explores her two protagonists in depth. I found Mr. Norrell fascinatingly flawed. He comes across as jealous and petty. Many who have read this novel disliked it for they could not find anything likeable about Norrell. He isn't likeable, but he portrays those characteristics that humanity as a whole has within them. Strange is more accessible, but is no everyman character. He is flawed in his own unique way.A few words of warning, this is a long novel. Do not drop it on someone's toes, even your own, or you might break a few; however, the length did not detract from my enjoyment and I tend to gravitate towards novels in the realm of 300 to 400 pages, less than 300 is even better in my opinion. This comes from my preference for short stories and a belief that too often authors meander without focus. Clark does meander, but I willingly and joyfully followed her wherever she traveled. She uses footnotes throughout. These are pseudo foot notes. She has created them all, but they are so well done you'll find yourself searching the Internet for more information on the Raven King (I did). Again, the footnotes are a turn off for some people, but I found them enjoyable. The voice of the novel is Dickenesque, with intentional period miss spellings that may aggravate some readers. For me, a Dickens fan, the voice was a treat and the miss spellings heightened the denseness of the novel. I found her style completely satisfying.With all that praise aside, if you do not like long novels, or really want to know what the characters are eating and wearing ad nauseam, or are expecting more re-hashed Tolkien ala Robert Jordan, then do not waste your time on this novel. If you enjoy something original and are willing to be taken on a pleasant journey through pseudo-time, then pick up this novel, make some tea and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I read this book about a month ago and have been meaning to get my thoughts out about it for a while. First of all, I really enjoyed reading it. It was great. Great characters, interesting setting, creative and original dialogue and the layout of the book (with footnotes containing many tidbits of information that contributed to the backstory) was innovative and engrossing. The book just overall had a good \\"feel\\" to it, and some nights I put the book down truly feeling \\"ah well, back to reality\\".I couldn't give it five stars though because it did feel that there was something lacking from it. And I think that \\"something\\" was, funnily enough, plot. The characters are brilliant, the setting, the description, the ideas, but the actual STORY seemed to lack something. I had trouble putting my finger on what it was. Some books just grab you and drag you along for the whole ride without letting go. I think of books like Stephen King's Desperation, Yann Martel's Life of Pi, Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby, the settings and characters in these books are all stellar, but it's the story that keeps you up nights. That central compelling story was the element that was somewhat lacking in Strange and Norrell.It's as though the author (Susanna Martin) had twenty boxes of really cool ornaments, but a somewhat scraggly, undernourished christmas tree to hang them off.Nevertheless, I'd heartily recommend the book to anyone who wants a big juicy novel to lose themselves in at days end, and particularly those who enjoy science fiction/fantasy novels. If there is a sequal (no spoilers, but hard to imagine), I think this element would be improved upon and would make this book otherwise an instant classic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"first off, i have to point out that this book is quite a fun.the style of writing Clarke has is pleasant to the ear and mind.but what strikes me very peculiar is that the first volume of this book titled MR. Norrell is focused on a character that is rude, arrogant, snobbish, pretty much the most unlikeable character i have ever read about and i couldn't put the book down. people who complain about this book being too slow need to realize that this is not something like Harry Potter. Clarke uses much of her language in this book not to tell the story so much as to play and experiment with the form of English during the 1800's i feel this book says much about common day literature. the story does drag in spots of the first volume but i found that once Jonathan Strange was introduced the book picked up quite nicely.the story is original and has many twists and turns. her writing is fun and sophisticated.great book. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is quite simply the best work of fiction I've ever read. Ok, yes, I admit, Harry Potter is a very close second and yes, I do think that the widely used \\"Harry Potter for Adults\\" is accurate enough.This is a book that the reader may have to put a bit of work into - it is very long, heavily footnoted, and quite complex. The footnotes are a great enrichment to the world of the story, but they could be skipped I suppose. I personally enjoyed them. The payoff for the investment in time and attention is an immersion in a world that is at once historically accurate, but with an open door through which magic and the fairy world flows out to merge and change the nature of reality.I also enjoy the 'nonfiction' occult genre. I think this book will appeal to readers of that genre as well. It draws upon such a wealth of mythos and folklore that an occultist will recognize that Ms. Clarke is obviously well acquainted with magical practice, folklore, and history...could she at times be modeling some of the book after Doreen Valiente's Magickal Battle of Britain (an account of a real magickal battle) and could it be that her stuffy magical societies reflect a bit the Golden Dawn with A. Crowley coming in saying I don't want sit around and talk, talk, talk about it, I want to DO IT? Oh yes, I DO think so. :) So, if you have been studying the history of the occult, I really, really think you will enjoy this book even more with that knowledge.This lady has really done her research well. I look forward to the movie, which I understand is in pre-production now.I do recommend you get the hardback. It is a beautiful book and to me enhanced the read, as it is a treasure for me as I love the look and feel of this particular book. I'm not sure if a paperback could hold up, my experience with books this thick is that they do not for me.I'm on my second copy now. My first copy was borrowed, loved, and never returned."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Pros: Immerses the reader in the nineteenth century, but still manages the fantasy elements very well. Pulls off the writing style perfectly. Has well drawn characters.Cons: The pacing is a little off. Begins very slow, but has a rushed ending.If you are a reader who has to love a book from page one, then you may have a bit of trouble with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It is certainly never bad, but one is left with the feeling that the story hasn't quite picked up yet for the first 300 - 400 pages. If you are willing to stick it out, however, then this book is certainly worth the trouble.Once Clarke manages to get all the interlinked plots and subplots going, the story is full of interest. Magic, done up in a polite nineteenth century style, abounds. Clarke creates a rich alternate history complete with stories of magicians that stretch back to the middle ages. The scholarly Norrell is set on bringing magic back to England in his own very modern way. Norrell is a fascinating character, especially when juxtaposed against the much more vibrant Strange. The characters in general are very well drawn and even side characters like Stephen provide a good deal of interest.Somehow, Clarke has found the perfect balance between writing in a nineteenth century style and writing in a way that will please modern audiences. One gets the feeling that her book could be read by people from either time.Though the ending is a tad bit rushed, it creates a high degree of excitement. This book is recommended to anyone looking for something different in the world of fantasy. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There are few novels that can walk the line between the fantastic and the real, where the outstanding becomes inseparable from the common-place, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is one of these books. Susanna Clarke has succeeded in creating a 19th Century England full of magic and mystery, while still being anchored in the realities and histories of 19th Century Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. The novel can best be described as an alternative-history. In this world northern England was once ruled by a magician-king, referred to, among other names, as the Raven King. He is responsible for bringing magic to England, ruling for over 300 years before mysteriously disappearing.The novel opens long after the departure of the Raven King, magicians are nothing more than glorified scholars, pouring over books about magic, unable themselves to preform any. Magic is gone from England and no one really understands how or why. The great acts of magic performed by the Raven King and the other great magicians has long been sequestered to books and fables. However, an old man appears and performs an extraordinary display of magic, sending all of England into an uproar.The characters in the novel, on the surface appear rather stereotypical. Mr. Norrell is an old, scholarly magician bent on preserving tradition and pouring over his numerous tomes. His pupil, Jonathan Strange is young and brash, eager to push the boundaries of magic, to experiment rather than read about magical pursuits. However, as the novel wears on you discover each as a depth of character unlike their outward persona's. Each is driven by different fears and passions, and they both have much more in common than they realize.The novel's greatest strength lies in how believable and tangible the world Mrs. Clarke portrays is brought to life. The novel is littered with footnotes outlining interesting facts and fables (some of which span multiple pages). These are never tedious and all serve to annunciate the \\"believability\\" of the story. In this fashion she reminds me of another great English author, J.R.R. Tolkien who went through great pains to add color and depth to his world, expanding upon small details, evening creating a language of his own. Mrs. Clarke also has a keen sense of mixing humor with drama, adding the right touch of levity at appropriate times. Her humor is very much like that of Jane Austen, poking fun at the social dilemmas gentleman and ladies found themselves in during the 19th century, where morality and social acceptability ran counter to emotions.The novel is broken into three volumes, each segmented into many chapters, with few running more than twenty pages. This does a good job of making the 846 page novel easily digestible. This is Susanna Clarke's first novel and pacing is one issue she has yet to master. The novel lags during a few places (notably during the beginning and end of volume I), and the ending seems to flow in a torrent. However, it is very easy to get lost in the prose, which is succinct and well constructed. Her descriptions of magical acts are particularly well written, with metaphors that precisely illustrate the events at hand in perfect detail.In the end this is a tremendous novel, one of the best constructed literary worlds I've had the pleasure of exploring."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"...to the loads of excellent reviews here. If you've read Jonathan Stroud's \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\" (The Amulet of Samarkand, Ptolemy's Gate and The Golem's Eye), you will enjoy this book a lot, as it seems like the authors were working together to create a believable alternate British world structure. Clarke's world is easily seen as the forerunner to Stroud's modern British world, with their magics being extremely similar."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First of all, I have to admit that my mind has been mixed on this book. Actually, I started it a year or so ago and put it down. It is SOOO long and I was losing interest. Images, however, kept coming back to me and something drew me in with the resolve to slog through it from beginning to end. From that persepective, I have been reluctant to recommend this book to friends as it is a great investment of time. Therefore, I cannot discuss my thoughts with anyone but you, dear reader.I am not a fantasy fan but got entirely engrossed in this novel as it did not appear to be fantasy but history with an otherwordly air. I found the plot to be complex and even (do I dare admit it) plausible. Because of the length, the protagonists keep changing but everything gets woven into the end.The language was beautiful and the spells and prophesies sheer poetry. I thought the footnotes were some of the best parts of the book. They speak so vividly of other sources that I was actually Googling the reference works to see if they were available. Sadly, all were fiction.The lasting impression I have is that there are other worlds with which we only sometimes intersect. Faeries are definately more than the cute little statues in my garden and if I ever meet one, I will head the opposite way! Beware of men with thistledown hair and if you see a flock of crows/ravens, lock your doors as the king may be lurking about. Beware of any bargain that seems too good to be true, as the price exacted can be enormous - and those ancients can be so tempting and alluring!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Although I am neither a fan of Austen nor a devotee of Tolkien, I found myself strangely situated on airplane back to Los Angeles with a rather large and ungainly text whose author has been compared to both literary personages. Which makes sense, given the blend of English folklore, alternate history, and fantasy that fill Clarke's pages. Of course, there are footnotes too--sometimes pages of them--as well as frequent tangents and roundabouts. All of which are generally amusing if occasionally overlong.To call the text slow, however, is somewhat of a misnomer. Clarke is at her strongest when she indulges in historical interludes and careful, detailed studies; for example, the chapter entitled \\"Heart-break Farm\\" describes the origins of one of the two title characters in a fashion that is both illuminating and entertaining. In contrast, her action sequences, such as those depicting Norrell and Strange's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars, tend to be lacking in dramatic chutzpah. If you are undaunted by this, then you will be suitably rewarded by the fascinating and peculiar conclusion.Suffice to say, those who enjoy nibbling on bits of this and that will relish the opportunity to explore Clarke's richly decorated world while those who prefer leaner prose should best look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio book narrated by Simon Prebble. The narrator did an excellent job of giving a unique expression to each character, which really helped with the enjoyment of the book. His voice was perfect for the tone of the book and he sounded like a staid British scholar giving a serious lecture on the history of magic while narrating.The book starts out slowly and gains momentum over time as more and more interesting things happen with magic and the characters. The story is based in England in the early 1800's and intertwines existing history with a past that had magic that has dwindled until the time that the novel starts it is only studied as history. Mr. Norrell comes into the picture as a real magician who has studied magic his whole life and wants to slowly reintroduce the practice. Jonathan Strange shows up later as an apprentice to Mr. Norrell, who is much more adventuresome and wants to accelerate the introduction; this creates tension between the two major characters. The novel is presented as a scholarly history and even has faux footnotes referring to the events discussed. The unintended consequences of the magic performed were very interesting; and the reaction of the public and public officials to the reintroduction of magic was a fun part of the novel.I recommend this novel, but note that this is not for those that want a quick dive into magic. It fits more of the style of a 19th century novel in length and tone. The audio book is an excellent way to go through this novel. It made for a few weeks of enjoyable commutes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The book starts out much like an interesting history book of English magic, much of it told first hand. The book was complete with historical footnotes that were full of wit and interesting stories in and of themselves. The magic is fresh without all of the typical magical crutches and stereotypes. Also, the way magical \\"history\\" is woven into real English history was clever and super cool. The part magic played in Wellington's victory over Napoleon including the last battle at Waterloo is alternate history at its best. Still, it takes some time (like the first 600 pages) before the \\"actionable\\" plot of the book becomes clear, there is evil afoot in good ole England, at a time when the country's 2 magicians are at odds. The last 250 pages of the book make the first 600 worth the effort. The plot quickens and the twists and turns (after all, what kind of fantasy would it be, with out twists and turns) are unexpected and rewarding.The book is recommended, but only if you are willing to take the time to read the footnotes, and not rush the expierence."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"From first appearances this book appears as a bit of a tome, and to be honest it doesn't disappoint in that respect. An avid fantasy reader, I have never been daunted by 900 pages of delicious escape. However, this book, as suggested in other customer reviews, is by no means predictable with regard to content. I found myself, if not trudging, then at least wading slowly through the first half. I started to become anxious that the book would be no more than an expository British gentleman's account of political and theoretical magic. Creating the atmosphere and setting the stage are well and good, but I personally feel that too much ink was spent on what a person such as myself (i.e. not British) might construe as classical British niceties (i.e. gown and furniture descriptions, tedious exaltation of manners and custom, etc.).The tale seemed to pick up dramatically somewhere about halfway. Tucked in here and there I also found some perfect jewels of witty British humour, most particularly in association with Mr. Strange's sojourn in Spain. More use of colour and texture appeared, and magical things not intended for the \\"greater glory of England\\" became center of focus. Character development also took an upturn as Ms. Clarke very skillfully starts to explore hero/anti-hero aspects of both main characters. That characters go so quickly from being parts of a book to actors (in a manner) which provoke reaction from the reader was a very pleasant surprise.I wish Ms. Clarke might have spent more time developing the faerie magic part of the book, particularly with regard to the prophecy around which the magical tale of the book is centered (perhaps less about the gentleman with the thistle-down hair, of whom we learn critical details only at the very very end). Everything was neatly assembled and explained in the end, but its lack of lead-in momentum gave me the feeling that the big picture suddenly appeared and then disappeared without an appropriate and well-deserved climax.But nit-picking aside I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone with a desire to read something different. As another reviewer suggests, be patient with the first half and you'll get a special treat with the second half."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Firstly, I should point out that I listened to the wonderful Audible.com audio verion of this book on my iPod. Despite enjoying it thoroughly, I probably would not have finished the book by reading (I am a ponderously slow reader.) I am sure that many will find the book not to their liking, as a number of reviews on here indicate.I can't argue with anyone's taste, though I found it comical when Stephanie A Weiss wrote \\"most people have been afraid to say \\"it's awful\\" out of fear that they just didn't understand what made it wonderful. I have no such fear.\\" HOW BRAVE of you Stephanie A Weiss!Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell does develop rather on the slow side, and most of the characters do not fall neatly into the hero/heroine category. Some people may find this hard to deal with, especially if they are only accustomed to overly developed senses of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in their stories. I find this to be one of the more interesting aspects of the book.Susanna Clarke also tends to go off on tangents, which might turn off some readers. But if you are open to it, and have the patience, these asides add immeasurable depth and color to her universe.At any rate, if you are inclined to listen to Simon Prebble's reading on audio, I would HIGHLY reccommend it. Otherwise, I can only say that you will -probably- enjoy this book if you think you will ahead of time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I enjoyed the book beginning to end. Responding to some of the comments I've seen, comparing S&N to Harry Potter is like comparing Spaghettios (Potter) to fine Italian food (S&N) - both are tasty, but your expectations are vastly different! S&N is not an action/adventure thrill-ride of a novel, but the characters are interesting and the story is always twisting. Susanna Clarke has an incredible imagination. Nothing in the novel was predictable. If you find the footnotes a bore, DON'T READ THEM! They're footnotes because they're optional to the story. However, I found some of the author's most imaginative work in them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke spent a decade on this long fantasy novel (782 pages) set in England during the its struggle against Napoleon(1806-1817). Well-written with a dash of humor, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a Harry Potter-like book for adults. The illustrations by Portia Rosenberg are wonderful.Image an England where magic has faded away only to be revived by the two title characters who are a study in contrasts. Magic, like life, has consequences for choices made, even well-intended choices. Mixing in exploits against the French with stories of the Faerie & the Raven King, Ms Clarke has created a masterpiece. Every character is fully-realized and the plot flows without being tedious.If you enjoy fantasy novels, you will read this book straight thru and regret when it comes to an end. Do not skip her faux-scholarly footnotes where her gift for dead-pan humor shines. If you enjoy this novel, check out Lisa Goldstein's \\"Strange Devices of the Sun and the Moon\\" (1993) which is set in the England of 1590 with playwright Christopher Marlowe and the Faerie Queen."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I remember when I purchased Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell as soon as it came out, after reading some glowing reviews, but wondering if I would ever read it. Not just the length but also the subject matter: magicians in England. How could that be anything other than done to death? Much later, I actually started reading the book and was very surprised by what I found.First of all, the writing style is amazing. The novel has a sense of being effortless in the writing. This, I have learned from my own unfortunate experiences, is very hard to do. I have a sense from the narrative that it was more discovered in its completed form than painstakingly crafted. This is the rare mark of a great writer. The author's style is clear and crisp and because of this, the pace of the novel is brisk and the pages fly by.Second, the characters came alive quickly after being introduced. I found them all to be fully fleshed out and believable and I have a strong mental image of what each one looks like. I cared about them also, as the author infused each with a degree of humanity and complexity that made me want to explore further as they grew into the story.I'm afraid I don't have much in the way of negative criticism, other than the footnotes, which I realize were there for some comic effect (as was much of the novel). But I have always had an attention span problem with footnotes, and they are also harder for me to read so I had to hike the heavy volume on a different angle so my bleary eyes could focus. Quite hard on the thumbs, actually.Finally, I was in awe of the satirical aspect of the novel. The portrayal of London society in the 1810s was hysterical. For me, the novel was very much of a social commentary, but not in the style of Dickens (as many have compared it to because, I think, of the size). I thought it had qualities of Dickens, especially with some of the more fantastic passages. But the insightful dialogue and portrayals of social interactions of thecharacters reminded me more of Jane Austen. I have always found something cartoon-like about Dickens (sorry!), which is exactly what I did not find in this novel. Instead, the characters here seemed engaged in highly probable conversations, have highly probable human reactions.Do yourself a favor, have a look. As a converted skeptic, I think you will be pleased. And soon you can get the hopefully lighter version in paperback!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The only difficulty with this book is it's nearly impossible to recommend to friends, if only because any attempt to pin it down ends up sounding asinine, ridiculous, and vague.Your first attempt might be (don't worry, no spoilers, this is all in the first few chapters) \\"Well, it's this fantastic book about two English magicians during the time of the Napoleonic Wars who unwittingly become enmeshed in the machinations of a mad, cruel, and powerful fairy...\\"Then, met with raised eyebrows, you try again... \\"What it's really about is an alternative history of England where during the late middle ages Northern England was governed by magic; only it's written in a 'Tale of Two Cities' sort of style where late-nineteenth century grammar and style evoke events in the early nineteenth century...\\"But this is even less successful, so you finally just give up and say, look, read the darned thing.Why should you? At the very least, the Dickensian ability with language. There's a paragraph near the beginning where the character of John Childermass is introduced that's just about one of the loveliest pieces of English writing you'll ever run into. It'll give you chills, I promise.But more importantly, it's an adult-oreinted rumination on everything you've always known was frightening, cruel, and beautiful about the dark, strange places in the world. I haven't read anything that made me feel this good in a long time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Embedded in the title is a delightful foreshadowing of what is to come in Ms. Clarke's extraordinary debut novel: we are in very strange territory indeed. But this strangeness is treated so matter-of-factly that any disorientation we might be experiencing, any intellectual vertigo, must be a result of our simply missing the author's wavelength. To get onto that wavelength, however, requires only that we persevere, keep reading, and that, with our progress deeper in, as the fat block of pages in our right hand diminishes and become a fact block of pages in the left, we inch into a strange-but-familiar world that recalls - it slowly dawned on me - the matter-of-fact strangeness of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie, and other writers toiling in the domain of \\"magical realism.\\" Ms. Clarke does not call attention to the effect she is working; she simply writes, on and on, in a style that alternates between a straightforward, almost reportorial, mid-19th century descriptive clarity reminiscent of Wilkie Collins and an inventive and lapidary beauty that is wholly unique in its power of \\"observation\\" - for it observes things that in our much less strange world cannot be - and strikingly curlicued descriptions of the marvelous. The great possess such powers as Ms. Clarke displays and, in fairness, we must admit that Ms. Clarke dons greatness here.One has to marvel at the patience Ms. Clarke exhibits. She will not be rushed into her story (and, as a result, many impatient readers and reviewers have flung the dictionary-sized tome across the room, never to be lifted again). It is a pity that our reading culture no longer supports the serialization of long, segmented novels - except for a rare Tom Wolfe-Rolling Stone collaboration - to be consumed in bite-sized pieces. I'm surmising that readers who couldn't get through the first 200 pages would tool along nicely at a 40-page-per-month clip.And what would such patience gain? Above all, Ms. Clarke's marvelous, richly drawn and detailed characters. And apart from those of the title, whom I found wholly convincing, she has created the formidable John Uskglass, the \\"Raven King\\" who ruled the north of England for 300 during the Middle Ages and who has, in Ms. Clarke's hands, the sheer physical quiddity of a historical personality, whose name sent me and countless others off on library and Google searches for the real Uskglass . . . only to come up empty. He is purely Ms. Clarke's invention, and one more reason to be in her debt.And she has invented so much more than she had space to use. Hence the footnotes, and more footnotes, and still more, which one can either love or hate but will skip at peril to their own pleasure. Because Ms. Clarke is a fabulously funny spinner of yarns, and many of her funniest stories are loaded into long footnotes that sometimes stretch across several pages. The hilarious \\"Story of the Master of Nottingham's Daughter,\\" which begins on p. 240, could have been pulled directly out of Grimm, or an otherworldly Chaucer, but is found in an immense four-page footnote I'll bet many readers passed on. In truth, I found the footnotes exasperating; I read them all; but like the copious footnotes in Gibbon, you don't really need them - that's why they're footnotes. But they create the cumulative effect of an \\"alternate book\\" - in this case, The Great Book of English Magic - that should not be missed. I did, however, grind my teeth in the last hundred pages, when the story is hurtling toward its conclusion, each time Ms. Clarke throws a log-of-a-footnoted aside or two (or three, or four) into the road, utterly disrupting the momentum. (At these times, I skipped, and returned at an appropriate caesura in the main text.)But this is but a quibble in the context of the great pleasures this book affords. I loved Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, its bookish world, its swirling mists and vapours and diffuse light and soft edges, and I look forward to the sequel(s), resolved to follow Ms. Clarke through whatever door she cares to open for me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Norrell, a Yorkshire gentleman has spent forty years or so collecting and reading books on magic when he decides to go to London to revive the art of 'English Magic.' He needs to establish his reputation, and is persuaded to resurrect the fiance of a prominent minister who died a few short days before her wedding. He does, and the act vaults him into the highest circles of society. Before long he takes on a student, a much younger man, Strange, whose abilities far exceed his own.Soon we are following Strange around the Spanish, and the French countrysides where he performs minor miracles to aid Wellington against Napoleon. When Strange returns to England, things begin to go pearshaped. The woman resurrected by Norrell tries to shoot him. And Strange's wife disappears.Frequently the formula for success in a novel is to quickly put the hero in the path of danger and demonstrate how he heroically extricates himself. Or pose some moral problem for your hero and see how he resolves it. At very least, create characters that we identify with quite strongly, give them some knotty problem to work out and follow them around as they work on it. Until the closing pages Clarke exposes her characters to almost no dangers, only a couple off-hand moral dilemmas, and hardly any knotty problems. We are given insufficient information of the nature of 'English Magic' - its capabilities and its dangers - to make good moral assessments of the magician's acts. And it is hard to develop more than the mildest sense of attraction to the main characters.So why like this book? There is a kind of level-headed sensibility to ninteenth century English literature that many readers find attractive. Those who do, love Austen, Dickens, and probably this novel. I count myself with these readers. I simply enjoy living in the world Clarke invented. There is a kind of simplicity, a kind of clarity, a kind of level-headedness that the one we occupy today seems to lack. None of the characters is individually compelling; but the kind of warm, gentle treatment the author gives the people, places, and events just makes it an inviting world to visit. And if you enjoy being there, the 800 pages makes it a real value."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I know I speak for many readers when I say that the vast majority of novels written in either the Sci-Fi or Fantasy genres are rather formulaic, predictable, hastily written and contrived solely for the purpose of creating an endless stream of sequels. None more so then the usually pathetic attempts at creating \\"alternate histories\\". I am happy to say that Ms. Susanna Clark has broken through this morass of dullness by creating this wonderful novel of an \\"alternate\\" universe where magic is real, but only practiced by two rather diverse Englishmen.If you only want to read one novel this year, read this one. The writing style just jumps off the page at you. The characters are rich, detailed and have definite lives of their own. The plot moves briskly through different scenarios and through the course of a decade with not one bump in the road. The story is laced with a wonderfully sublime sense of humor and you get the feeling that the author wrote this for the pure enjoyment of the effort. It certainly pays off to the reader. The whole novel is just a PLEASURE to read and even though it's incredibly long at well over 700 pages, it leaves you wanting more. Please don't let the length of this novel stop you, nor the inevitable comparisons to the works of Jane Austen, from which the author does borrow heavily.This is evidently the author's first attempt at the novel and I can only hope she does not listen to the pleas of her publishers and attempt to create a \\"sequel\\", which would be both unnecessary and detract from the beauty of the novel. Again, please read this book and don't be ashamed to say you enjoyed something on the Best Seller list."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What if magic was real, and enjoyed a long tradition? And what if magicians only studied magical history and not magical practice? Then, what if someone discovered the practice of magic again, and brought it back?This hefty tome by Susanna Clarke explores those ideas, as well as the arrogance and failings of hubris. It's not a classic good vs. evil story, which is really what I expected when I bought this book at an airport (for the 800 pages of light reading). It's conflict of the establishment against progress, of innovation versus convention, of the young and the old both grasping for a valid place in the world.It takes place in early 19th century England, primarily in London although there are forays to the countryside as well as to the French battlefield when Napoleon becomes a nuisance. The author wrote in what she deemed the period style, but it was much more easily readable than, say, even Victorian (shudder) literature. She was quite liberal with commas, which certainly lent a degree of credulity to the period writing style. She also used footnotes throughout the book, and if I were the sort of person annoyed by footnotes, I suppose they would have annoyed me. But since I'm the sort of person who uses a second bookmark to keep up with even endnotes, and I kind of enjoy flipping back and forth (it burns more calories)I found the footnotes to be a humorous way to give the reader \\"background\\" without sacrificing the pace of the story.The pace of any story that takes 800 pages to tell will occasionally drag. I really didn't find that to be the case with this book, though, until very near the end, when poor Jonathan Strange spent entirely too much time in Italy and not nearly enough time arguing with Mr. Norrell. I liked their conflicts.I gave the book to my mom to read. I figured with her science fiction/fantasy inclinations she'd really enjoy it. Shows how much I know! She struggled through it to please me, but the last 100 pages never got read. How she could have left the story before it was resolved, I will never understand! But she got bogged down in Venice and just had to extricate herself before she suffocated, I think. Oh, well. Thankls, Mom, for trying. Now I really wish I knew someone else who had read the book so I could talk about it without giving away the many significant plot twists!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_ opens, we are introduced to a society of theoretical magicians based in Yorkshire. It seems that the practice of magic has disappeared from England in the previous couple of centuries. At one time magic was very common, and indeed the Northern part of England was ruled by a powerful magician, a boy raised in Fairie, called the Raven King or John Uskglass. The magicians who practiced during his 300 year reign were called \\"Aureate\\" magicians, and their successors \\"Argentine\\", but nothing remains of magical knowledge but a number of books of questionable authority, and occasional stories of the appearance of fairy roads and suchlike. Then a man named Mr Norrell makes a proposition to the Yorkshire society -- he will demonstrate to them that he is an actual magician. If he succeeds, they must all agree to renounce their claim to be magicians. Of course he does, quite spectacularly.Mr Norrell, it transpires, wishes to revive the practice of English magic. But in a very limited way -- he seems to want no rivals. He buys up and hides as many reliable books of magic as he can find. He actively tries to suppress other magicians by such means as his deal with the Yorkshire society. And he is determined in particular to denigrate the memory of John Uskglass, and to avoid the Raven King's sort of magic and especially any dealings with fairies. However, he has some difficulty in getting an in with the powerful men of England -- to whom he hopes to offer his services. Only be bringing back the fianc? of one influential MP from the dead can he establish connections. And unfortunately he can only do that by dealing with a fairy -- and dealings with fairies are indeed dangerous.Mr Norrell's bargain with the fairy works out very ill for the young lady he has revived, as well as for another couple of people. But other than that he is soon very successfully aiding the English side in the war against Buonaparte's France. Then another magician appears, a dilettantish young man named Jonathan Strange. Strange agrees to become Mr Norrell's pupil, but is soon chafing at Norrell's refusal to let him see many of his best books, and at his fears of dealing with fairies or studying John Uskglass. Strange also develops his independence by spending some years with Wellington in the Peninsula, aiding the Army by magic. After the war Strange breaks with Norrell, and threatens to publish a vast History of English Magic. But Norrell has his own ideas -- and more tragically, Strange's wife becomes a victim. The conclusion brings together, in a very satisfying way, Strange, Norrell, the enigmatic fairy that Norrell had summoned, the fairy's victims, Norrell's intriguing servant John Childermass, other magicians, and of course John Uskglass.I found it completely delightful. Readers have noted its extreme length (about a third of a million words -- nearly 800 rather full pages). It is true that the plot moves slowly, and one can readily see ways that the book might be cut without losing the essentials of the story. But I don't think I would like it better cut. Clarke's witty voice is ever a delight, and I enjoyed all the meanderings. Her descriptions of magic are very effective -- there is a real sense of otherworldliness, of caprice, and too the effects are quite imaginative. Her characters, if perhaps a bit thin in places, are still interesting. For all the plot moves slowly, its resolution is as I said quite satisfying, and somewhat surprising. I was moved on occasion, laughing quite often, and never bored. (Which is not to say the novel is a fast or facile read -- it is easy to put down, but you will want to pick it up again. It is a book to live with for a few weeks, not to gulp down in a few sittings.) _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_ stands as my favorite novel of 2004."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I found this 800-page monster of a book in a NY Times (or something of the sort) bestseller shelf in my local bookstore and I asked myself . . . how could a book with this heft end up there. And its about 2 magicians who lived during the Napoleonic Wars that's written in a style that only a Jane Austen/Dickens fanatic would love. There must be something to this book . . . I thought.If you are a Jane Austen or Charles Dickens fan (or like myself, a person who has been reading Regency Romances since she was 12) and you also love fantasy (which I do although I only use the term \\"fantasy\\" because there are \\"faerie\\" elements in this book-- like some of the reviewers say--this book cannot be pinned to any single genre), and you DON'T have the attention span of a sandwich . . . then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the \\"practical\\" side of magic. For example, Jonathan Strange in an effort to help the British win the war against the French, would move churches, and towns and make rivers flow in another direction but he could not be bothered to return them to their original state . . thus gaining the ire of the displaced townspeople and confusing mapmakers for decades to come.The writing is witty. The footnotes are droll. (If the author fleshed out the footnotes, they would make entertaining stories by themselves.) There are many characters but each one has a destiny to fulfill. The narrative was smooth. Imagination . . . boundless. And there's a pinch of horror too--here and there. In places you don't expect them to be.If I could string 2 sentences together . . . this would be the book I'd write."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Really, really good. I dislike the \\"Harry Potter for grownups\\" blather, because it's like comparing apples and oranges. True that it's darker than Harry, but it's also downright quirky in places, without becoming annoying. I found myself believing that the history was real, even to the point of thinking about it as I went through my day, as though I'd have to remember some of the facts for an exam or something. The footnotes are DENSE and would form a novel themselves. They make it very fun to read. It honestly took me awhile to get rolling on this book, and rightly so. At 800 pages, it's a daunting thing to lug around with you, let alone try to prop up on your chest as you read in bed late into the night. Brew a pot of tea, find a comfortable chair, and give it a try. The other reviewers are correct; the action doesn't explode off of the page the entire time, but you find yourself not caring so much. At its heart, the characters are real and engaging, and I found myself hating to leave them when I finished. If \\"intellectual fantasy\\" appeals to you, if I can call it that, this won't be a waste of your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a big thick book, with a very complete and wittily drawn world. It's basically an \\"alternative history,\\" set in early 19th-century England, but an England in which a former half-fairy king is accepted as part of the past the way we accept that Alfred the great existed.You'll enjoy this more if you've read Austen, Sterne and other eighteenth and nineteenth century writers, because Clarke has caught the style to a t-- even with archaic spelling. But the story moves along at an excellent pace.There is real magic at work-- it's delightful when Strange, one of the magicians (and at first, a student to the stuffy but rather dear, though pompous, Mr. Norrell) works for Wellington and ends up creating enchanted roads and moving Brussells around in order to confound the French, for example.Another lovely element of the book is the whole other world of Faerie. If you listen to old ballads you'll see that that world is often a very frightening, sad place, and so it is in this book-- the \\"gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\" is charming, funny and altogether amoral and bloodthirsty. Being stolen away to his world of \\"lost-hope\\" is to be forced to participate in dreary balls and processions-- part of the joke is that their dreariness and the humans' response to them is utterly missed by the Gentleman, who can only perceive that it must delight them as it delights him. The sad bells and mournful tunes of Faerie contribute to the atmosphere.The invention of John Unksglass, the legendary Raven King, is so convincing you find yourself forgetting at times that no such history existed.The ending disappointed me a little bit, but perhaps it means there's room for a sequel?Altogether a charming book. It really isn't \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" stylistically, but like that book, the book tells of the education of magicians. Wholly original and entertaining."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It is a bit reductionism to call the great \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" a Harry-Potter-for-grown-ups -- albeit marketing smart, this strategy diminishes Susanna Clarke's talent and skills. Her novel is much more than Harry Potter, albeit both are excellent books in their purposes. The size may bring fear to some readers, but those who don't care their reading being big will certainly find a lot in this novel.To begin with, there is more than one single plot, but in the end they all come together. The main story follows to magicians, Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange, throughout the course of ten years or so. Gilbert Norrell is a Yorkshire magician arrives in London with the aim of rehabilitate the reputation of English magic. After a couple of events, he becomes famous and soon the young and impetuous Jonathan Strange arranges to study with Mr Norrell. But later, after helping in the Napoleonic wars the two magicians will find themselves competing against each other. At the same time, John Uskglass -- a sort of King of the magic and other worlds -- is back to claim the throne of England.At some points, Clarke's text reads like the m&eacute;lange of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Ann Radcliffe and J. K. Rowling. And this mix delivers perfectly. Of Austen she brings the society watching quality, describing meetings, people and their attitudes with humor -- sometimes black-- and irony. Her dickensian element makes social observation -- mostly of the XIX Century society strata-- plus Radcliffe's gothic elements. From Rowling, of course, there is magic.But Clarke is a writer of attitude therefore, one can notice some references in \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" --some intentional, and others not -- the reader can also notice the writer has a voice of her own. She writes like her novel was an old book. The most strange thing is the spelling, the use of \`chuse' for \`choose' or \`shewed' for \`showed'. These devices only enhances the pleasure of the book, that while strange is still amazing, because sometimes we are so immersed in the narrative that we don't even notice these archaic spellings.To make the novel looks like non-fiction she brings footnotes from time to time -- some longer than one page, some are a story of their own. Most of them read like a parody to scholar material, what make them very funny. And sometimes she ironies even the novel format. A character, for instance, says he despises novels. Those who a different from him, and immerse themselves in this huge novel will never forget it. And the bad part is when it is over we start missing Jonathan, Mr Norrell, Mrs Strange and even Drawlight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is best described as a fantasy history. Suppose there were magicians aiding the Duke of Wellington in his battles against Napoleon? There are also several subplots including one about a particularly malevolent fairy.The book is well worth reading, and will especially appeal to fans of fantasy. It has been well-described as \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" I would suggest it for adults not because of cautions about language, sex or violence. There is no bad language, no sex and less violence than in the Harry Potter books.My concern for both children and adults is the book's pacing. The pace of the novel is frustratingly slow. It is not so much the footnotes (which are often delightful) as the author's style. The book is 800 pages and seemed longer. It would be a better book if it had been more tightly edited and been published at 600 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I never write a review unless I like a book very, very much. As my mother taught me, if you can't say anything good, keep your trap shut. Well, mother, I really enjoyed reading this book. Ms. Clarke has to be a real smart lady to write such a detailed book about a non-existent subject. She almost convinces me that practical magic really did exist in Englandand that Norrell and Strange were the preeminent practitioners. Too bad Peter Sellers is no longer with us as he would be a prototype Norrell and I can see Peter O'Toole as Strange searching the moors for Arabella, enchanted by the man with thistledown hair. Great stuff!! Being a Welshman (we're naturally humorous, you know.), I found this book highly entertaining and hated to see it end. I hope there is a sequel and that it doesn't take 10 years for Ms. Clarke to write it!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book will really appeal to people who enjoy early nineteenth century British literature (Bronte, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Rosetti...etc. The Romantics for the most part). A lot of reviewers have been comparing it to Harry Potter, but I think it has more in common with those writers. Byron even shows up in this book as a character for a while.This book is very detailed and I really enjoyed all the footnotes that delve into the specifics of magical history. It was written with such authority that I believed it, even though it was all the author's creation.The Napoleonic War chapters (the British use magic to beat Napoleon) were ok, but I was more interested in the bits that had to do with Faerie and the Raven King. The pseudo-history was interesting, but the magical history was superb.This book does take some time and dedication, but I think it is worth it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I just finished reading this book. To my great delight, it's neither \\"Harry Potter for adults,\\" nor a Lord of the Rings clone.Then what is it? It's a beautifully written, witty, and enchanting tale. It's full of deep and interesting characters, it's full of imaginative little anecdotes and fables, and it's full of adventure. There is more imagination and detail in this book than could possibly fit within its 800 pages, and so I can only suspect that it has been enhanced by the subtle use of magic that its main characters are more than capable of. So no, it isn't Harry-Potter-like, or Tolkien-like.However, if you dislike footnotes, be warned, for there are many of them, and they can reach impressive lengths. Similarly, if your attention span is only a couple of seconds long, then maybe Harry Potter is more suitable to your taste: In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, not every chapter ends in a cliffhanger. It is a compliment to the author's skill that no such cheap tricks are needed, and that the story is engaging and involving despite its (initially) leisurely pace.This book is hyped up to be THE book of the year (or last year), and having read it, I am quite willing to believe it. Don't hesitate to pick up a copy of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Three days ago I finished reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell (staying up until 3 and skipping some of the footnotes). For two days I wandered about missing the characters, replaying scenes and seeing their world more clearly than mine, until, like vivid dreams do, they lost their sharpness and turned back into people from a book.Like a dream too, filled with sudden diversions and turnings, the book mixes scenes of humaneness with the ugly and cruel. In fact, at first I feared I'd found a story brilliant in its setup of a magical England, perfect in its form - with writing that perfectly mimicked early 19th century literature, but with characters that I simply didn't care about. Then young (funny, hopeful) Jonathan Strange joined the story and I kept reading. But still I mistrusted the book until I realized that the author had not only created a world for us to look in on, but she had also created a world view, a syntax, through which to view it. And it was part of that perspective to experience a distrust and jadedness and to gradually warm to other voices who at first appear arrogant, weak, furtive, or greasy.At the end we see the two magicians as specks in the eye of their creator, their movements directed like puppets; but such human puppets we anyway must care for them. It made me laugh to realize this, and I felt that indeed my reading, my freedom to judge the book, had been directed by a puppet master too, a clever and gentle-handed one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I purchased this book at the beginning of January, and while considerably lengthy, I could have ripped through it in a few days. Yes, it is that good. But as a previous reviewer said, this was written to be savored. I've intentionally dragged the reading of this book out over the course of a couple months in order to enjoy it for as long as possible. I frequently found myself re-reading sentences and paragraphs to savor the words Clarke selects.Describing this novel as a Harry Potter for adults does a disservice to Clarke's novel. The Harry Potter books are wonderful, but in a different way. In brief, while the Harry Potter books are ABOUT magic, Susanna Clarke's novel INCLUDES magic. But that is only the tip of the iceberg; there is so much more in her book.Reading this book felt like I was discovering a treasure. Each chapter, each paragraph, each word is meant to be treasured.To those negative reviewers; learn to appreciate good writing. I can't help but feel that the people who gave this book one star are the same ones who love James Patterson."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I enjoy long novels that I actually have to read because I don't want to race through a book in two days. This book could be a bit tedious at times and I found myself counting the pages I had left as another reviewer did :). But I loved the book overall.Strange is quite a character and you root for him and his quest. You want him to succeed and you feel sorry for him when bad things happen. Mr. Norell is a bit stuffy and self-righteous but you come to love him too.The plot is played out through the whole book and while you might wonder once in a while what a particular chapter has to do with the book, it might actually be important later so pay attention. There are also little tid bits of information that seem triffle and they are important later - when the reader will know what is going on but not the characters. The supporting cast of the book was well written and you seldom got confused on who was who.The seperate chapters are short and nice so you can stop once in a while. The footnotes are okay - I could have done without them sometimes. Sometimes the footnotes were funny and helpful and other times I thought the footnotes were pointless. I think that she could have done without the footnotes and included the stories right in the text.This is not the next Harry Potter although I loved that series; this book does not move with that same pace. It is more historical fiction but has this fantastical element in 18th century England.The ending was a bit sad but I see hope for Mr. and Mrs. Strange in the future.If you want to take time and read a well put together story - then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What a spectacular read. the story is intricate and exciting. I particularly loved the crafty stories buried in the foot notes. I can't believe that this book held my attention so thoroughly. The only negative is that I sprained my back lugging it around."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is phenomenal. It is witty, it is inventive, it is imaginative, and it sucks you into the world so much that you come out of it half-thinking that this all really happened, at one time or another. It is absolutely extraordinary, although to some it might be a little slow-paced. The story is absolutely overwhelming with an ending to die for! There is good, evil, love, hate, magic (which is described with utter accuracy and visual ease), wit, character (a great variety of delights!), fairies, magicians, gentlemen, soldiers, Indians(!), and much more that could not possibly be described well enough without reading the book. The subtexts give the story extreme depth and add quite a bit of fun to the experience of English magic, since we are, of course, ignorant to much of the first dealings with fairies and such. Clarke is so kind as to put it all down without taking away from the main story. In fact it adds so much to the plot through understanding the backstories of various things, that it makes this more than just a novel, but a textbook on magic history in England. Excellent. I should be surprised if I am ever able to read a better book in decades to come."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A very charming book, written in the style of Jane Austin. The pace is fairly slow but the writing is so clever and polished that you'll want to read the book slowly (or even better, read it aloud.) The footnotes are a little distracting at times, and the ending is a little too pat; still, this is a gem."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I knew this day would come....I knew that one day, I would turn the page and find that there were no more words...I remember, like other reviewers, many times where I checked to see how many pages I had left....not because I wanted to be rid of them but because I worried their numbers grew too few...My only solace is that a sequel of sorts will be written.Jonathon Strange & Mr. Norrell stared at me from the bookshelf in every bookstore I encountered. I would pick it up, open it to a random page and find a spattering of seemingly dull dialogue. I would put it neatly back upon the shelf and walk on. Still I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something good. Almost as an afterthought, I picked it up cheap at Walmart. From the very first page, I recognized that Clarke is a master at her craft....imagine, this is only her first novel!This isn't a novel that is easily sorted into a particular genre. I've seen it placed in fantasy and fiction, and it won the Hugo award...most commonly awarded to works of science fiction. Yet most people have come close to describing Clarke's style when they compare her to Austen and Dickens. Clarke weaves a meandering tale over the social fabric of old England. Yet, in using the word meandering, a very positive connotation is intended. Clarke employs a series of long footnotes that work to secure the reality that she creates and foreshadow events in the tale. I've never read a fantasy novel that created a world and system as believable and concrete as Clarke's.True, this isn't a novel for the thrill-a-minute type. I dare say, however, that this is because Clarke has created something that truly lives up to the label of high art. As good as Tolkien's books may be, and as much as he may be the father of the fantastic, Clark has achieved something more difficult...hers is an exercise in wit and subtlety.In fact, JS & MN is humorous and witty from the very first page. In an interview, Clarke says that her favorite author is Austen; I dare say that Austen would look quite favorably upon the way Clarke uses the social fabric of her society to invoke irony and wit.At the same time, the plot itself is higly suspenseful to those that enjoy a good tale about human nature. Others have already written enough about the details of the plot, and as with any movie or novel, I always contend that one is best off not knowing any of the specifics of the plot. Be it enough to say that Clarke juggles a wide array of characters and subplots with such skill that it seems IMPOSSIBLE that this is her first novel.Finally, Clarke's general use of language is simply enchanting. She has a way of describing scenes that breath life into them. She is one of those rare writers that know precisely which couple of details will allow an entire picture to unfold in the mind of the reader.I could write a good deal longer in praise of this book, but A) others have done just that and B) I would undoubtedly repeat myself. Suffice it to say, I don't understand why this book isn't better known. Sure, literary publications cried for joy at its coming, but every person I've mentioned it to (at least 20 and counting) has never even heard of it. I can only hope that the book gains recognition through word of mouth, because it deserves to be an absolute classic. Upon finishing the tale of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, I have determined one thing: Whether Ms. Clarke decides to write about cherry pits or the anatomy of giraffes, I will read every word she publishes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I wrote a huge, long, extremely well thought-out review... but stupid me wrote it directly into my browser and it didn't post correctly... so here's the second (and much abridged) edition:JS & MN is perhaps the most intriguing and detailed representation of a fantasy setting I have ever encountered. The quality of the prose was extremely well suited to the subject matter as well, adding to the book's over quality -- that is, of a historical/literary telling of two powerful (but very different) magicians in Britain's past.All that said, I had a love/hate relationship with this book. It was masterfully written, and both characters (Strange and Norrell) were complex, sophisticated, and well-crafted. One was significantly more delightful than the other. Having a less-than-likable protagonist might irk some readers, although it didn't bother me.The \\"hate\\" side of my relationship (yes, I said relationship) with this book is that it was a very (veeery) long. Too long. It was also a book that demanded your full attention while reading it. At times I wished I that could stop reading it, yet I couldn't, because it really is worth it. I suppose it's like climbing a particularly steep and rocky cliff face - very challenging and very rewarding... just be sure you're in the right frame of mind before you start to climb!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was afraid that, at it's size, this book would be overly pedantic, but I was surprised to find that it was actually relatively engaging. This is a hard one to rate, really, because it doesn't fall into the star category very well. It IS engaging but the story sometimes seemed to take a while to get where it was going. I think I'd give it three and a half stars. The characters are well-developed and sympathetic, the story is interesting, honest, and believeable. I got a bit annoyed at the somtimes full-page footnotes, and the sometimes rambling plotline, but for the most part, I found the book entertaining and quite readable. Rarely does the story pick you up and carry you with it (I was usually not that upset if I got interrupted, and I didn't stay up til all hours reading as I have done with other books) but it is a good, well thought out, entertaining story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The term \\"thaumatomane\\" is referenced in Chapter 28 of Clarke's novel as coming from Samuel Johnson's \\"Dictionary of the English Language\\". It means \\"a person possessed of a passion for magic and wonders\\". This book is for those special, patient thaumatomanes who are bibliophiles with a refined sense of humor and who like to linger and savor the descriptive, literary alchemy in Clarke's prose, even when magic isn't the immediate topic at hand... and don't mind an occasional wandering into sub-stories. Many reviews have already given the general storyline, so I won't repeat that here. What I will focus on is the unusual, mysterious nature of the magic that Clarke portrays. When she was asked whether she believed magic really exists, she said: \\"The answer would have to be no. The magic in Strange & Norrell is purely literary. It's not based on the work of actual magicians of the time. (I read a book about eighteenth/nineteenth-century occult scholarship recently; it was very dull and rather hard to follow.).\\" Although it is true that the magic is only literary, there are short references to real historical figures who are implied to be magicians. For example, in a footnote on consulting dead magicians as a magical procedure, the Raven King supposedly had conversations with Merlin, the Witch of Endor, Moses and Aaron, Joseph of Arimathea and \\"other venerable and ancient magicians\\". Also, reference is made in a couple places to Valentine Greatrakes who, in reality, was an Irish healer who toured England in 1666 and cured people by the laying on of hands. Aside from these references, genuine historical figures such as Wellington, Napoleon, and Lord Byron play more notable, non-magical roles.In addition to the genuine historical figures that make an appearance, a genuine occult item does as well: the Marseilles Tarot deck. Childermass, steward to Norrell, owns a crude, self-created version of one that he occasionally uses for \\"fortune telling\\" to the dislike of Norrell who, strangely, despises them and actually believes that the future cannot be predicted. In fact, what Norrell has in common with theoretical magicians such as Segundus and Honeyfoot is the lack of belief in prophecies which they associate with charlatans. Yet, interestingly, both Norrell and Strange are essential parts of a prophecy (and spell!) of the Raven King, the founder of English magic! What makes the story even more interesting as well as comical is that Vinculus, a street \\"sorcerer\\" and charlatan who is despised by Norrell, apparently has the only magical book written by the Raven King and can quote the King's prophecies by heart. Significantly, it is Vinculus who plays the crucial yet seemingly haphazard role of introducing Jonathan Strange to magic as a profession.The magic in the novel is mysteriously, fantastically, even humorously portrayed (For example, in 1138, the Raven King himself is reputed to have caused the moon to disappear from the sky and travel through all the lakes and rivers of England. Hmmm... how big did they think the moon was back then? Perhaps some of the magic was illusory, like our modern-day legerdemain, but who knows.) Relocating landscapes (including buildings, towns, troops, etc.) is learned more quickly than other feats which some may think should be easier. Fairies (feet tall, not inches) have an influential, magical role. According to Richard Chaston (1620 - 95; yes, he's fictional), \\"men and fairies both contain within them a faculty of reason and a faculty of magic. In men reason is strong and magic is weak. With fairies it is the other way round: magic comes very naturally to them, but by human standards they are barely sane.\\" This footnote occurs in Chapter 25, over 200 pages into the novel. It partially explains why Strange later tries to use madness to contact a fairy. The influential role fairies play is seen in the fact that the Englishman John Uskglass (later known as \\"The Raven King\\") learned magic from fairies after he was stolen as a child and taken to Faerie (a.k.a. \\"The Other Lands\\" by magicians) where he eventually became a powerful leader. According to Strange, the Raven King is the most mysterious of the Mediaeval AUREATE (Golden Age) magicians. He came out of Faerie to establish his kingdom of Northern England some time ago, then several centuries later he \\"departed\\" (Norrell says \\"abandoned\\") England in 1434, going who-knows-where and leaving the influence and practice of English magic in decline.Scattered throughout the book, especially in the footnotes, are details regarding the Raven King and magicians/magic in general. One learns that magicians only applied themselves to writing books when magic was already in decline (the AUREATE magicians learned their magic experientially and with the help of fairies, not books). The AUREATE magicians included, along with the Raven King, Thomas Godbless, Ralph Stokesey, and Catherine of Winchester. Martin Pale (1485 - 1567) was the last of the AUREATES and he was tutored by Catherine of Winchester, a student of the Raven King, 200 years AFTER her death. Next in practical magic's decline came the ARGENTINE (Silver Age) magicians who were scholars first, magicians second. Some of the names given for these include Thomas Lanchester (1518 - 90), Jacques Belasis (1526 - 1604), Nicholas Goubert (1535 - 78), and Gregory Absalom (1507 - 99). When exactly practical magic left England isn't entirely clear, although the first thing a student of magic learns is that there are books OF magic, written before magic ended in England, and books ABOUT magic, written later. Norrell's 19th century claim-to-fame was that he's a genuine practical magician, not a theoretical one like every other so-called magician of his time. It is he who hoards all the books OF magic which forces Strange to learn practical magic primarily the way the AUREATES did: through experience. In fact, before Norrell decides to accept Strange as an apprentice, he is fascinated by a magical act performed by Strange who isn't entirely sure how he did it!The book implies that the greatest magic (used by the Raven King and some if not all of the other AUREATES) is innovative and rooted in a type of nature mysticism where natural objects like trees, stones, water, sky and even birds (incl. ravens, of course) can speak and be spoken to as spirits in a mystical way to form alliances, something that the rationalistic and book-dependent Norrell calls \\"mystical nonsense\\". Norrell can do some startling things, but how much of his magic is really based on his own innovations and alliances rather than those of others via books? \\"Shape-changing\\" is also mentioned as something generally employed by the AUREATES during their travels in Faerie or other lands beyond England, but it isn't given prominence in the book. It is said, however, that the AUREATES were aware of its liability to abuses.Norrell, unlike Strange, has animosity towards the Raven King, partially because he failed to magically make contact with him in his early years. Also, he doesn't like the idea of depending on fairies or the King to do magic, although he depends on magical books and secretly summons a fairy via a book (which becomes a nuisance to others throughout the remainder of the novel) to raise Lady Pole from the dead so he can make a name for himself as the one who will restore practical magic to England.Clarke has revealed some of the literary magicians that inspired her own. Included are the magicians in C. S. Lewis's Narnia stories, although she says her closest model was Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea stories. She liked the idea of a magician with no name such as Earthsea's magician: \\"the Grey Mage of Paln, whose magic was so dubious, his name was forgotten\\" and the magician in The Lord of the Rings, \\"right at the very end, who comes out of Mordor to do battle against our heros and no one knows his name because he himself has forgotten it.\\" However, since she wasn't sure what to do with a major character with no name, the Raven King \\"acquired more names than most people\\" such as John Uskglass, The Black King, the King of the North, and the fairy name no one can pronounce. Although Clarke doesn't mention Edward Bulwer-Lytton's magical English novel Zanoni (published in 1824) as an influence, I wouldn't be surprised if she read it since it involves two different-natured magicians like Norrell and Strange, both with longevity of life like the Raven King. I can see a few very general similarities between it and her novel.A movie of Clarke's magical tome is under production. Unlike Le Guin who didn't have much of a say in how the Earthsea movie turned out, Clarke has a hand in producing her book-based movie. I look forward to it and consider Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell one of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Enjoyable book, written in a very interesting style. A host of interesting characters, but written in a style that is like that of nineteenth century novelists.

I put it down several times before forcing myself to read that far. It gets much better 1/4 of the way through. I could appreciate the very dry humor, and laughed out loud several times, but it's definitely not a page-turner. I read a lot of it aloud to my family on a road trip, and actually enjoyed it a great deal more. There is so much hidden humor which is easy to scan over when reading silently. I loved the footnotes--very satirical of actual scholarly writing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I think the people who do not like this book do not like it because it is not a pure thriller or fantasy novel. This is an original and inventive work of fiction that draws on but does not conform to the conventions of the \\"fantasy\\" genre. It's a literary novel. Anyone who holds Tolkien as the end-all will not like Clarke's writing, but others will. She has intelligently combined a number of English novelistic tropes to craft her unique story. There is as much Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Makepeace Thackeray in this book as there is Victorian (or earlier) supernatural. It's smart and fun, in my opinion. I'm loving it. Susanna Clarke writes a book that is suspiciously new while remaining reverential of old English ghost and fairy stories.If I had to pick a book to compare this one to, it would be Michael Chabon's incredible ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY. The subject matter is different, but the modern and intellectual grasp of pre-existing fantastical material is similar.Which is a lot of words to say this book rocks."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"susanna clarke's jonathan strange & mr.norrell, which in a matter of fact manner recounts the rise of 2 magicians in early 19th century england, is a wonderfully told tale of magic, mayhem and madness. weighing in at a mammoth 900+ pages, this is a BIG novel in every sense - its size, scope, the breath of scale and the talent it showcases. it is quite hard to believe that this is clarke's debut novel. she shows tremendous skill in her prose, plot, narrative and characterisation. mr.norrell, jonathan strange & mrs.strange in particular are wonderfully drawn out characters whose escapades provide wondrous thrills.this is a wonderful read irrespective of whether one is a fan of literature or fantasy, there is lots in this novel to admire and enjoy and it will keep the reader captivated for hours while taking us through the magical lands of england, the other worlds of the great magician raven king and the battlefields of wellington & napoleon.it is no surprise that this book is causing tremendous excitement in the publishing world, and it looks like the publishers bloomsbury have hit upon another harry potter like phenomenon here.and one final tip, the book comes in two jackets, white & black. pick the black one, because the white jacket tends to get dirty after a whiel, and considering that this is a book that is going to involve a lot of reading and re-reading you might just as well ensure you get a copy of it that lasts the distance.happy magicking."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Hearing the book of the year and Harry Potter for adults tags, I grabbed this book with a lot of expectations. I've seen other glowing reviews here so I assume this is a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary).The old style of writing didn't put me off. But I think this could have been a good (but not great) 200-300 page story. The book set up an interesting premise and contained some interesting sequence. But inbetween is a lot of rambling.The footnotes remind of of Book of Leaves where the first 50 pages or so they come off as an interesting unique devise but by the 400-700 pages I began to find them very tiresome. If you have a two page footnote, maybe that story should be part of the main storyline.As someone else said, don't expect Harry Potter for adults. It is definitely not that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In the first pages of this novel we're introduced to an England of the early 19th Century, where though mostly the same as our own England, scholar magicians spend their evenings in the polite company of fellow gentlemen musing on the facts, though rarely the implications of the historical practice of magic on the isle. This status quo of scholarly men discussing scholarly things, but declining to actually experiment with their particular area of expertise is soon disturbed by a young upstart known as John Segundus. Segundus dares to ask a question to the effect of \\"Why don't English magicians actually practice magic anymore?\\" That question proves to be one of the strongest themes of the entire work as the reader is pushed, pulled, and contorted in many other ways as the two English individuals of the title take it upon themselves to revive the practice of magic.Ms. Clarke introduces us to the period's first \\"practical magician,\\" Mr. Gilbert Norrel through John Segundus' attempt to answer his own question. Norrel is depicted as snobbish, antisocial, reclusive, bookish, and of a refined, though arrogant demeanor. In short, he is the stereotypical English country gentleman. Clarke eventually takes Norrel and his truly insightful servant, Childermass, to London, where she lets us meet many of the luminaries of English politics and high society.The characterization of every person is brilliantly detailed. There is not a servant, politician, soldier, magician, or vagabond that isn't treated as a full individual and graced with quirks and idiosyncrasies unique to them. A pleasant effect of this deliberate attention is that while getting into the story it's not easy to ascertain who is a major player, who is a supporting role, and who is just there to take up space. In fact, no character is there merely to take up space, and one character's social station has no effect on their influence in the story.One would be remiss not to mention the undeniably English feel to the story, prose, and characters. This is a story about English characters in England. Even when the characters are most certainly not in England, they strive to transform their environment to one more like England. They seek out the company of other English people, they arrange their things to a more English sensibility, and in some cases the fact that the land around them isn't English leads the characters to regard that land as a minor annoyance as opposed to an actual place. However, being away from England has a special effect on those characters that alienates them from their contemporaries that have stayed on the island. They take pride in being English, but the condition of being so far from anything that they can identify as English warps what that means to them, and thus those characters who remain in England are eventually less likely to identify with the travelers as they're gone and after they return.There are, of course, exceptions to all of this. There are major characters that are not English, but the condition of them being in England or interacting with the country and its people is a strong part of their character.Just as much as England is a character, magic is a character in this story. For most of the story magic is not only a character metaphorically, but literally, in the form of the fairy gentleman with the thistle-down hair. His nature betrays the nature of magic and offers insight into the answer to John Segundus' question, \\"Why don't English magicians practice magic anymore?\\"Finally, though the pacing could possibly be improved, the flaws therein are smoothed over by Clarke's satisfying resolution. Clarke brings the story to a fulfilling end, not tying up all of the loose ends, but finishing the story in a place well suited for such a purpose leaving the reader space to imagine."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Like Susanna Clarke, many of the reviewers here take too many words to get to the point: \\"a book to savor, not devour,\\" \\"will reward the patient reader,\\" and the like.Here's the short course: boring. Some decent fantasy larded with lots and lots of genuinely second-rate Jane Austen. I can't believe this author is also an editor -- if there was ever a book that needed a red pencil, this is it.If you want riveting fantasy, read Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy.

Honestly, new readers be warned, it's a mess, with no clear storyline and a wandering, episodic, unengaging structure. What is this book about, really? Where is the story? It feels to this reader that the author, over her 12 year struggle to put this on paper, came and went, ideas wandering here and there, adding chapters and characters and half-considered plot turns, without much purpose and with no clear sense of how to construct a narrative. She writes with charm to be sure, there are clever moments and a dry wit, and a handful of nicely realized magical moments -- but most are rendered 'practically', as an ordinary part of life, and consquently have almost no dramatic effect. Character development is poor. The coming together and then the splitting apart of the two main characters is not dramatized well and comes across as vague and spontaneously imagined. I suspect most of what was put down on the pages here was thought out in the moment and not previously outlined or considered, and that, for an 800-page manuscript, is deadly. If you like a good, clear, forward-moving story, avoid this novel at all cost."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Let me say two things about Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell:1. This is one of the finest novels I have ever read. Ever.2. You might hate it.Okay, let me say more. I listened to this book on audio and, because of the language and humor, I was delighted from the very start. I listened for 32 hours and approximately 25 of those hours are rather slow. Interesting stuff happens, but nothing that's going to put you on the edge of your seat. It's leisurely and teasing. It's not clear how all of the characters and plots relate to each other. If you're ready for action, it's a bit frustrating. But the action finally does arrive and all of the characters and plots finally come together in an unexpected and satisfying way. Looking back, you realize that the plot was clever and quite tight all along.What kept me going was that the writing is absolutely glorious. Susanna Clarke writes like Charles Dickens or Jane Austen or one of those other 19th century English novelists who we love because of the insightful and subtly witty social commentary and the plain but elegant writing style. She's right up there with the best. In fact, I can't think of anyone who writes better than Susanna Clarke. Not Tolkien, not Le Guin, not Bujold. And for this reason, I must give the book 5 stars. It is a superb novel.Particularly fun were a few devices that I really enjoyed such as the intrusive narrator somewhat reminiscent of Thackeray's Vanity Fair, fictional characters interacting with real historical figures (Lord Byron was my favorite), and a few little alternate explanations of how some historical events in arts and literature came to be (I won't give you any examples because discovering them is the fun part).The audiobook is also superb. The reader, Simon Prebble, is English (in case you couldn't tell by his name), and his diction, pace, and voices are perfect. I love the voice he uses for the more uncouth characters -- it just sounds slimy. This was a great novel to listen to--Mr. Prebble's voices add to the dry humor--but keep in mind that it will take you 32 hours. It's quite a time investment, but well worth it.So, I recommend that you read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell when you have the time to be patient and when you're in the mood to be delighted by a long elegant English novel. If you're in a hurry, or if you're in the mood for quests, orphan boys, sword-fighting, or dragons, don't bother.This is the perfect book for the right reader.

Likewise, if the notion of reading nearly 800 pages written by Susanna Clarke channeling Jane Austen sounds hard to bear, wait for the movie.But for those who find either of those bearable -- or, better yet, an exciting prospect -- \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is a strange and wonderful novel that you will live in for longer than you expect and shorter than you will end up wishing.One of the first truly adult fantasy novels -- which is to say, it emphasizes real emotions, subtle and conflicting motivations and genuine love over special effects, gore and sex -- Clarke's novel is full of characters who can be both repellent, attractive and pitiable, sometimes all in the space of one paragraph. The novel, even if one has given into temptation and read too many detailed reviews, is full of surprises, both of the large plot twist sort and or the small character moments sort. The ending, in particular, is a bittersweet wrench, perfectly in keeping with the rest of the novel, and yet slightly surprising and heartbreaking despite that.With the love between Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the scholarly passions of Mr. Norrell and a host of \\"theoretical magicians,\\" the strange and eventually fascinating Childermass, the various cloying toadies, the sweet and in-over-their-head Greysteels, Clarke creates more delicately detailed and compelling characters than most novelists manage in a whole series of novels. And it is as much the love between Jonathan and Arabella that drives this novel as it is the love of magic of the two protagonists. But there is magic a-plenty, including spectacular magic wrought on the battlefield against Napoleon, whom one feels almost sorry for as Strange gets more and more comfortable in his role as Wellington's magician.But the plot is longer and more complex than that, and Napoleon is mostly a stepping stone for the magicians in their quest to return English magic to its rightful place, and their real enemy is subtle and devious, and more than a little insane. Their enemy is one of the most interesting antagonists in fiction, and Clarke successful makes him a mythic sort of villain. At the same time, she also manages to create a great deal of mystery around the ancient Raven King, creating a mystique around a totally made-up character that has the weight of real world myth and legend.Despite the novel's historical period and many ties to real world history, it's not necessary to know anything about the British fighting Napoleon, the poetry and life of Lord Byron or anything else of the sort. Clarke provides more than enough to understand and enjoy the setting, although the more one knows about history, the more Clarke's very low-key winks at it are revealed -- Byron's and the Shelleys' legendary Swiss vacation that, in many ways, gave birth to the modern horror genre gets a dismissive reference from Strange at one point, who obviously does not yet know the historical significance of the house on the lake and those who stayed there, for instance.I normally whip through a novel this size, particularly if I love it, as I did this one, in a weekend, or a week at most. Instead, I found myself putting the book down and not wanting to go further, wanting to savor and digest the book in small doses. Now that I've finished it, I only have a small short story by Clarke (on the official novel Web site) left to me of it.If the initial description -- Harry Potter as written by Jane Austen -- sounds good to you, don't hesitate. The sooner you enter the 19th century England of Strange and Norrell, the happier you'll be. This is easily one of the best novels, of any genre or literary merit, I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What a novel! I read a lot and reading experiences such as the one I had reading Clarke's novel just don't happen very often. I'm so very, very thankful that a novel such as this was even published given the light, shallow, fast-reading novels that dominate most publisher's list these days.JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL has it all: memorable and richly drawn characters, vivid setting, poignant atmosphere, action, adventure, humor, horror, and writing that is pitch perfect on every page. I also liked the fact that it's long. When a story is this enchanting I want the experience to last a whileI really think this novel defies comparison to any other novels; it's in a class by itself. But if someone were to compare it to something else it'd probably be most accurate to compare it to something written in the 19th century, like Dickens.The story ends in a satisfying way and in one that's true to its internal logic, but Clarke leaves just enough unfinished to provide the perfect premise for a future novel. I've heard rumblings to the effect that she is planning a future novel with some of the same characters, and I, for one, can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I do not have much to say except this book is glorious. As an avid sci fi fantasy reader this book ranks in my top 5 books of all time. It freaking rocks!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is literally on my top two books of all time, right after Pride and Prejudice. This book is incredibly well written, and like an earlier review I agree with saying this is NOT Harry Potter. This book much more closely resembles the writing of Jane Austin. It will make you laugh and cry, it's actually the only book that has ever made me cry. I tell everyone I know to read this book. I LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I reserve 5 Stars for the 10 best books ever written. I think if I didn't, this would rate 5 stars. The ideas behind this book are a little different. While it may appear to be historical fiction, it is not. It is well written, mostly interesting and slyly humorous. If I were an annoying high school lit teacher I would make this required reading - lots of allegory, double entendres, stylistic stuff to test on!Bottom line, though a good read. (Some of the side stories become tedious and if I reread the book, I will skip them. Unfortunately, on a first reading you can't tell what's a side story and what is not!)Truly though, if you read for entertainment (and not for assignments!) this book is very much worth buying!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke has the ability to mimic writers of a bygone age while creating an interesting alternative history/fantasy story. Long, but if you are willing to lose yourself, we'll worth the read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this book from beginning to end. It is not a conventional story and may require some persistence, but I think it is well worth the effort. The intermixture of myth and fantasy is delightful. It made me want to understand more about Celtic myth."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is strange. And marvelous. And truly weird. This story is a steampunk computer put into words. Compelling, fascinating words. I read this when it first came out (this copy is a gift) and there are still images that live in my brain, years later. Mind you, it is not for the faint-hearted. It's a challenging book, so if you pick it up, don't expect light reading. This is brain - baking, imagination-stirring complexity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"So this book is way cool! It is a long read, however. A very unique story line based on characters in the 1800s trying to sort out conflict between magicians and nonmagicians. It's deeper than that, of course. A bit boring in the middle, but so many cool foot notes and story arcs. Check it out!!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I received this book from my son on my Kindle Fire. I didn't t want to read it. I only borrowed it for 2 weeks. When the time was up., I was so interested in it., I had to purchase it. I would suggest this book to anyone who has an imagination. It definately keeps you reading to find out what will happen next."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A slow read for the casual reader. Too much detail on the magic spells and the textbook stuff. Didn't like"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Every once in a while a book comes along that goes on the list of Books to Read Again. This one is one of those; it's just that good. I almost wish I'd never read it in the first place, so that I could have the pleasure of reading it for the first time once again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke may be the sort of book which can't find a wide audience. It's really well written, but in a style which is more Victorian or Edwardian, rather than modern (figures; it's about magicians in the first decade of the 1800s trying to find out why magic isn't done anywhere in England...any more). I personally like the style, having been poisoned by English Literature early in my formative years. Really, you would have thought that Thomas Hardy would have made a lot less of an impression on an impulsive teenager, but you would be Very Wrong. I'm hardly started and I can tell already that I am going to really, really enjoy this, especially since it's been forever since I swallowed an entire Victorian novel, even if it doesn't contain unlikely suicides of young children.Anyway, the windup to this story is about the juxtaposition of two magicians and their faery servants fighting more or less alongside England's army/navy against Napoleon until their clash of styles reveals rather different motivations in each, leading to a wider war than merely all of Europe."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a startlingly original fantasy. No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As I am not an native English speaker, it took me a while to get used to the language in this book, in the end though I really wished I could go and speak like they do in this book :) Susanna Clarke has written it beautifully in excellent English.I do not usually prefer books in the fantasy category but this is definitely a fantastic book ! I would recommend! (could not put it down)!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Reading this is like assembling a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. The details are all there but it takes quite a deal of work at the start; And like a jigsaw puzzle, it picks up very fast a little halfway through as more pieces are put into place. I like how the author instills imagination and speculation yet still give quite an ending that almost left nothing unanswered.I would recommend this book but you will need patience to appreciate it. The magic here is not what you might expect. Magic feels too ordinary in this book because that is what this book was all about - An alternate history where magic is part of the common everyday life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm only 100 pages into it and just have to say it is probably the best written, witty, and interesting piece I've ever read. It is just magical.As many have suggested I would suggest reading the first chapter because the way this book is written might be very unexciting for some people. Not that anything is wrong with you but it might be downright weird for some. It doesn't necessarily mean you are stupid or can't understand good books. It is just that there is a definite style, and style is in the eye of the beholder I guess.The setting and the characters are really entertaining, but might seem dry to some, with all their gentlemanly rules and such but that is what makes them entertaining to me.Overall, I highly recommend you at least try the first chapter!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clarke's novel, though winding at times, is superbly written. Her style (and even spelling) mimics Regency-era writing, making you feel as if this book were not only set in the Regency era, but written during or slightly after it as well. Her imagination, turns of phrase, and characterizations are wonderful. If you are looking for a quick read, this book is not it. It takes some dedication, but is well worth it. If, on the other hand, you are used to making your way through thicker, older books such as The Count of Monte Cristo or Jane Eyre, and are craving a new, intelligent novel that delivers both excitement and humor (I chuckled my way through every chapter), this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I personally loved this book. However, as many others have said, it's not a book for everyone. I don't know why anyone would compare this book to Harry Potter, though. It's nothing like it, either in content or style. A better comparison would be to Gregory Maguire'sWicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of th (Wicked Years). Both are heavily character driven, both deal with the struggle between free will and destiny, both have beautifully written prose, both are purposely ambigous at times to allow the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps. Overall, in my opinion, a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"For those that enjoy escaping to a world of magic and mystery, as well as experiencing some history, I would highly recommend this book. This recommendation comes with a warning though, in order to fully appreciate the book, you will need to read fairly far in, but once you do, the beginning really makes the wait worth while."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Unique, clever, witty, richly detailed...TOO detailed. While the history of magic is important for the reader to truly grasp the world Clarke has created, her fantasic story gets lots in all the backstories, footnotes and slow-moving narrative. It wasn't until chapter 40-something that I actually started taking interest in the story and the characters. By chapter 50, I was riveted until the conclusion when the story unfortunately loses all momentum and ends with a whimper. Overall, the book would have been great, if only it were about 400 pages shorter!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell combines a lot of influences which I really dig - you have 18th century history, you have fantasy, and you have writing which makes it feel like a crime novel written by JK Rowling. This won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like the Harry Potter books and fancy something a little more adult, then try this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It would be silly to pretend that anyone could like this book. Not true. You MUST have an affinity for language (Jane Austen-style), quirky, memorable characters, subtle humor, history and, above all, the supernatural. Susannah Clarke spent ten years crafting this novel--and it certainly shows, as she has created a world unto its own--a colorful, eccentric, macabre world in which fairies still keep humans enthralled and a man might save his wife by entering a perpetual Darkness.Clarke's much-maligned long footnotes are actually quite fantastic. Frankly, you do NOT have to read them to \\"get\\" the story--and in fact, they probably make up a good third of the 800+ pages. But to \\"get\\" the philosophy of Jonathan Strange's world, the history of the Raven King's England, the world around the characters, you absolutely MUST read them. The footnotes are where Clarke creates the magical background, so important to the story.Clarke skillfully entertwines real historical events and characters (Waterloo, Duke of Wellington, the mad King George) with dragons and fairies; her language is incredibly rich and evocative and subtle; she stays true to regency-style English, and does, in fact, read like Jane Austen. But the story told in that gorgeous, subtle language is not a little disturbing, though riveting; nothing like Jane Austen, who wrote mostly happy endings. Clarke explores man's essential evils through her characters: greed, vanity, obssession with an idea, neglect of another. Moreover, though she delivers her innocents, she does not always punish the guilty. You cannot be assured of a happy ending...This book is by no means an easy read, as it cannot be skimmed through and requires thinking. But as such a meaty book, it is very enjoyable: by the end of it, you will find yourself looking for ravens everywhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Do you like to read fiction on magic but are tired of hormone charged teenagers worried about who's \\"snogging\\" whom? Do you enjoy scenes where magicians cast spells, but are dismayed with simple, one word spells that seem too easy to be really magical?Have you had just about enough of one dimensional \\"dark lord\\" with nothing better to do than to kill an 11 year old?Or may be your experience with magic has been full of dragons and dragon slayers and dragon orbs in a far away planet (Tribunia or Shannarra or some other place you can never visit!) with human like but not quite human civilization.Don't fret! Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (JSMN) will end your sorrows!JSMN is set in early 19th century England where Mr. Norrell, the only practical magician in England is looking for a career as a royal magician, helping His Majesty fight the French and restore his own version of practical magic to England.Mr. Norrell has only 2 desires: 1) To be the only magician in England and 2) To rewrite magical history and wipe the Raven King out of existense.For his goals, Norrell is prepared to go to any length.However, as fate would have it, even he can't prevent another magician to come forth and experiment with Raven King's magic.As Jonathan Strange bursts into the scene, he gets tired of performing simple magic tricks to help the British army and decides that magic is more useful and several times more powerfull if King's ancient methods are employed.There begins the tale of Strange's thirst for knowledge and Norrell's attempts to stop him.But by no means Strange and Norrell the only people in the story. There's a Lady Pole brought back to life by Norrell (to advance his career in politics) and Arabella, Strange's wife and Stephen Black, a black slave serving Sir Walter Pole (Lady Pole's husband).Finally, an evil fairy, a gentleman with thistle down hair and master of Last Hope provide us with the complex villian that every good story must have.The omnipotent and mysterious Raven King is not revealed till the very end but when he comes, he brings the rain and wind and the sky with him.You will love JSMN for its rich charachters. Each and every person, from Duke of Wellington (general of British army in Spain) to Drawlight (a conniving socialite) has been given his true share of words. Enough time and effort has been spent to make you see what they see and feel what they feel.Since the story is set in Europe , you don't feel alienated from the location. Streets of London, dusty roads of Spain and villages of Belgium are fairly easy to imagine.Finally, the magic performed by magicians sounds real. No childish single word spells to unlock doors or fly. Magicians in JSMN actually wake up the dead, conjure up objects from rain and wind and make stone statues talk! They build roads to let their troops pass and venture to Otherlands where no one has set foot in over 300 years!By far, JSMN is the best novel I have read in a long time. It is long, very long, but sumptuous! You will love the little historical information at the bottom of the page each time a new magician or his magic is mentioned. You need patience but believe me, it is so worth it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The minute I read this book I immediately recognise Jane Austen and Charles Dickens' style of writing - to be expected of course since Susanna Clarke declares both to be her favourite authors. So in this sense, I find the book familiar and a delight.Many a review have labelled \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" as Harry Potter for adults. I've read all 6 Harry Potters, so I will have to disagree and say an empathic no.There is no fast paced magical action in this book, certainly no hair raising manouvers on broomsticks, dramatic pronouncements of spells, severe wand pointings nor bubbling potions in magical couldrons. Everything takes a much somber, grey and deliberate mood - as befitting English Victorian sensibilities. Next to Harry Potter, watching magic here is like watching donkey carts racing! Yes, you have to be really committed (or desperate) to find it exciting. But the results can be quite dramatic! If only Harry laid his hands on that raising-the-dead spell!The book is heavy on the history of magic - sometimes the book reads like a history book (zzzzz.....). Details and more details. Beware: tons of page notes! However I can see the point - they serve to make the story very excitingly rich. But the writer has managed to create a fine line between that and being mindnumbingly boring!The excitment comes really from the many interesting plots that are built layer upon layer of each other. The author is big on details and in the beginning this makes the book enjoyable to read. However as the plot thickens (not as thick as the book), this incesant detailing by the author just becomes plain irritating. Clarke can't seem to stop herself and I only wished the editor would've done a better job here. Despite the similarity in style Clarke is nowhere near Dickens' league as a skillful storyteller. Why do writers keep forgetting that restrain is a virtue!The book ends with a cliffhanger and thus setting a possible sequel. Despite the tedious slog at the end, I would read the follow-up if only to see the tale of these hapless magicians through to a happy conclusion. But I hope the editor does a better job next time 'round."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Although lengthy this book is enchanting and funny, truly an adult Harry Potter type book for adults. The satire is so seldom found in today's books: religion, formality endeavors, career jealousy and so forth.

A truly fascinating experience. emme06bee@entermail.net"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"this book has all the sweep and richness of cryptonomicon, all the imagination and grotesqueries of gaiman, and all the narrative drive of the foundation series. rarely have i been so caught up in a book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I adored this book. With so many glowing reviews already here there's little left for me to say; I just want to add my voice to the chorus of appreciation._Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell_ is a complete delight from beginning to end: vivid characters and a rich alternate 19th-century setting are wrapped up in smooth, confident prose. There are definite shades of Austen in the narrative voice - arch, witty, clever, self-aware - but it's much more than just an intelligent pastiche. It's a tightly-controlled novel with an absorbing plot that simultaneously manages to evoke interesting themes from both its historical (social hierarchy and its discontents, rationality vs. spirituality) and its fantasy (the morality of magic-use) aspects. 'Real-life' characters turn up, but are used carefully and sparingly - and, in the case of Byron, hilariously.Those who like their books rapid-fire and dare I say a little more obvious may rail against its apparent lack of 'action' - but to do so is to miss the point. This is a book about rather more than just plot (although, frankly, it has plenty of that, too...). It is a character-study and a period-piece, and any dissimilarities with contemporary fiction in terms of pacing are entirely in keeping with the style and form the author intends. You're unlikely to find a more elegant, amusing and intelligent fantasy novel this year. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"...on Harry Potter, this would be the book. Although magic is the central theme, it's really heavier on the parodying of early 19th century British society than on magic -- faux footnotes and all. Occasionally a bit of a slog, but worth it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"No this is not Potter, this is something better... Here you'll find a world that will place an enchantment on you, and never leave you the same. Think of Austen wielding magic in her fiction, only with a flavoured taste of Gaiman's dry humor, combined these and magnify it times...for me, this is what Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell was.A never to be forgotten classic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book came highly recommended. I was told it was an adult version of Harry Potter and was interested. After all, I read the first Harry Potter to my sons when they were younger and both liked the series. However, one should define what is meant by \\"adult\\". If it means using mind-numbing descriptions in the most flowery language possible with arcane spelling (I know it's suppose to be \\"authentic\\") then this is an \\"adult\\" tale.Any decent editor would have snipped a good third of the book away as excess verbiage - writing for the sake of accumulating letters. The story - as other reviewers have pointed out - moves at the pace of a crippled snail; the mind wanders as the brain fights to wade through still more dreary descriptions that seem so unimportant. Once again, the idea was excellent - magicians arising in England, the interplay between government and magic, the late introduction of the titled \\"Mr. Strange\\", his fascination with magicians of old. I am not the only one I've talked to who thought the tale overly long, underplotted, the characters too numerous and shallow. The magic is, how to say it, underwhelming.Mr. Norrell is, without a doubt, one of the most boring - and forgettable - characters in modern literature. He seems to be a caricature rather than a character. The work, which requires much concentration getting starting, is written in the \\"Old Style\\", that is odd lettering, idiom, manner, names, places. It reminds one of one of those incredibly boring plays about Ladies and Lords (no lower clases are present) of pre-Victorian England whose action alternates between drawing rooms, friendly pubs and darkened corridors. The cover is impressive as are the blurb, recommendations and author's bio. I only wish the story had been half as good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's okay not to like this book. It's okay to be disappointed or bored by it, because it's just not everyone's cup of tea. And it's okay not to like the language or the slow pace...I found the book a little slow going, myself. What's not okay, to me, is when someone gives a book a one-star review having read only twenty pages and then whines that it wasn't Harry Potter. Of course, the person who called this book a \\"colossal bore\\" has written 1200 reviews about oldies music, so I suppose that gives him a unique qualification to judge, simply by virtue of being the very personification of the concept \\"colossal bore.\\" But it doesn't excuse denying the book any merit at all or calling it the \\"flop of the century,\\" just because it was too difficult a read for him. The bottom line is that this book is an example of phenomenally talented writing. Clarke's evocative prose got me through an entire book whose story I found only marginally interesting, and for that accomplishment alone, I give this book three stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first hundred pages of this book, are the sort of writing that makes me want to file a lawsuit against Susanna Clarke for one's life wasted and the trees desecrated to print.The end part becomes slowly worhty of a novel, but at that point I really couldn't care less about any of the characters.It's written in a style from 19th century. With all the lovely 19th century bigotry and self-righousness of the pompous English (fat off her colonies in Asia and Africa) the sort of gentelmen that financed slave ships during the day and spent hours in ballrooms of London the rest)If you actually want a WELL written work in that style, I suggest and actual work from that time, Dickens, Austin etc...If you want to see a brat of writer try to re-imagine and re-do an imaginary place (English History with all the ugly little moral discrepencies tucked away), then this is the book for you.There is a deserving writer somewhere being denied her/his chance because this garbage was done by a publishing industry insider (she managed the cooking catalogs prior to this!) and pushed through.If you are an English lord who has thousands of guineas off your colonial holdings and plantations and have hours upon hours to waste, this might be a lovely diversion for you. If you fancy yourself an intelligent person, this book will waste your life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This was a LONG LONG LONG book that didn't engage me the way I thought it would. There are 26 full CDs to listen to, and the worst part, by far, is that there is no break/pause/music to let you know when you have reached the end of a CD and need to switch to another. The Cds were extraordinarily long, and I often found myself listening to the CD almost to track 3 or 4 again before I realized - \`hey, I already heard this!' It would have been helpful, especially with a book/CD set this lengthy to have the reader let you know that you need to switch CDs. The storyline was very hard to follow as well - there was an extensive cast of characters and a lot of action taking place, and it was hard to capture all of it through listening. I wasn't thrilled by this book at all, and I'm glad I opted for the CD instead of the actual book - it was a waste of time, really. The \`magic, Harry Potter story for adults\\" was not there - it was a character driven book and not fantasy or magical by the definition of Harry Potter. The book far exceeded the length it should have been and left me with a bad opinion for this author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't usually come across books that I don't like or have no interest in finishing but this was/is one of them. Now granted, I listened to all 26 cd's but there were more than a few times when I just wanted to bag it and stop listening. I am quite surprised at all the positive feedback this book generated as I feel it easily could have been half as long. I think it was a good long time before Jonathan even got introduced in the story.As it is I really can't recommend this at all. I did like the premise of the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After reading the reviews by others, it seems as though this might be an exciting book. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The author seems to lose focus of the story and characters. You might find yourself rereading passages to figure out if you are missing something, only to discover your disoreintation is the book's error and not your own. The character development is lacking and as well as the presence of magic. To even make mention of Harry Potter in any review of this book is demeaning to J.K. Rowling. The use of language is distracting (using the word 'shew' representing 'show' etc). This reviewer is not familiar enough to know if this is representation of english in the 1800's or not. None the less, it only adds more distraction to the pace of the story. Anyone who has read the Masters of Rome Series will know of challenge Colleen McCullough places upon the reader to absorb the highly complex characters and events she writes of. I have read this series beginning to end, yet I could not find the fortitude to get past 160 pages of Strange and Norrell. I had this book for a flight from Kauai to Phx, a 6 hour flight, yet chose to stare at the bulkhead of the plane than suffer through this book.If your are looking for an exciting book on magic, which breaks out of the usual genre, I suggest Jonathan Stroud and the Bartimaeus Series. It is listed under Childrens liturature however I think this is a gross mistake by the publisher as the books fascinate all ages. This author has woven a tight story, filled with rich characters that make it difficult to put the book down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There is no good in opposition to evil in this book, every one and every place is evil. The whole book is very dark and there is no deeper truth to the fantasy. On top of that, it is a very loooooong and boring book. The characters are flat and unlikeable, you won't care if they live or die. It came highly recommended to me so I wasted hours."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I really enjoyed the author's subtle wit through out the story, but I think I would have enjoyed it much more if the book weighed in at 250 pages rather than 1000.I even found myself struggling to finish the book even though I had a 10 hour lay over in an airport."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I don't often write reviews of books, but I feel compelled to write one for this book. It is original, fun, exciting and well worth the time. Susanna Clarke proves that magic does exist, she herself is the magician. I would also like to recommend another wonderful book, A YEAR SINCE YESTERDAY by George Edward Zintel. The story is fresh and captivating, and will cause your emotions to boil inside of you. You will laugh, cry and be left with a wonderful feeling inside when you reach the end. I would like to point out that it is listed as paperback, but is actually a very nicely bound, high quality softcover. It is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is the most boring, wordy book I have ever suffered through. I have 150 pages left, and can only hope everyone is dead by the end of the book. I feel like I am already. Who nominated this as a great book? If you attempt to read this waste of paper, be sure to skip the hundreds of foot notes (yes there are foot notes in a book that is a complete work of fiction)They add nothing to the story and are never referenced again. This book has been a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first half of the book is devoted to Mr. Strange, who is a thoroughly unlikeable character. Well, I thought, once Jonathan appears on the scene,it will pick up. It didn't.Bottom line: it's just not enjoyable. Very little plot. No interesting characters. A few howling anachronisms in the characters' mouths that just break the spell (no pun intended)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"So several publications chose debut author Susanna Clarke's novel JONATHAN STRANGE & Mr NORRELL as their Book of the Year. Wow! Must have been a slow year for quality books.JS&MN; has been touted as the adult version of Harry Potter and with mass market paperbacks I see people snatching it up everywhere from bookstores to wholesale warehouses. Somehow I doubt they'll be impressed or even complete this massive tome.Now, don't get me wrong. The entire story of JS&MN; is incredibly original with some inspired moments. It would make for an exciting 250 page book. However the actual book is 846 pages! Clearly that's about 500 pages too many. Beyond that several other points should place JS&MN; mired in the \\"decent\\" category instead of the \\"Stellar\\" category that so many people wish to place it into. These would include:1 - Both lead characters are NOT people that you can root for. One is a selfish bookworm who wants things his way. The other is a selfish man who thinks everyone else is below him (and if they're not) then he labels them as pompous. Most books would require at least 1 protagonist that the reader can bond with.2 - The use of magic is not clearly imagined. In the Harry Potter books we have spells and wands. Here we have thousands of books on magic (with few actual wizards) and when some form of magic is conducted it's a very gray area...almost as if the author wasn't 100% sure how she wanted this world of magic to be presented.3 - There's a good villain. However, he may be too good for the \\"heroes\\" of this book. It takes over 600 pages for the heroes to even suspect that something may be amiss. Ouch! Now I don't want to root for JS&MN; because they're also too stupid to spot magic that is enchanting the people around them.4 - Footnotes. Sometimes footnotes and research can add alot to a story (see the phenomenal HOUSE OF LEAVES) and other times they just get in the way. JS&MN; has footnotes that drag the already wordy text to an almost complete halt. I've read other reviews that praise the last 200 pages...you know why...the footnotes disappear completely near the end of the book.I did read JS&MN...completely.; It was quite a chore. The reason it gets 2-stars is because I am an avid reader and I rarely say that reading a book is a \\"chore\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I enjoy big fat books, Dickens, fantasy, a wide variety of books of all kinds. Somehow this book was beyond strange, it simply had no point, no tension, it was almost a documentary on 2 made-up magicians in a fantasy world. Worse, I kept expecting it to get better, to go SOMEWHERE with all of this other than just random imaginings with no real connecting theme. After all, so many critics raved about it. So I read about 600 pages before I dumped it in the garbage, a fate that very few of my books ever suffer."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I won't try to write a clever review of this book discussing the range of the characters and so forth. I am going to be honest and straightforward. Simply put, this was a very long, boring book that went off on tangents with footnotes galore. The author might have thought this quaint, but it only added to the tedium. I only mildly enjoyed the last 100 pages of the book and forced myself to finish it.There are many more books out there worth the time and effort, but not this one. Too bad too...the storyline had potential."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'd read such enthusiastic reviews of this novel that I wondered, as I started to read it, why I wasn't enjoying it more. I persevered until the end of the first part, which at over 200 pages is longer than a lot of complete novels. I just couldn't go on.This is a dry as dust novel about English magicians during the Napoleonic wars. Mr Norrell is a magician who wants to use his magic to help with the war effort, but finds himself using his magic to restore a dead young woman to life. Then he finds that she has fallen into the power of the Fairy folk, as has her black manservant. I suppose one eventually gets to find out what will happen to the lady and her servant, but I just couldn't be bothered to wade through another 600 pages.I did not find the characters or the plot at all interesting. The men are dull, the women insipid, the plot boring.If you want to read a really fun novel about magic in the Regency period, I recommend 'Sorcery and Cecelia' by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer, it's a lot more fun than this."}]`),J={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],C={key:0},H={key:1};function j(n,e,r,c,s,i){const g=f("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(t(!0),o(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(g,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(t(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",C,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const R=u(J,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-5d6a86fe"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/13.md","filePath":"glossary/13.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/13.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,r)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{q as __pageData,G as default};
