Set in the 1850's, this story tells of Captain Ahab and his passionate quest to get his revenge on the whale which severed his leg on a past sea-voyage. The story is told by Ishmael, who along with his newly-found friend Queequeg, embark on this most fateful journey.This book really expresses the heart and soul of men who spend many years of their lives away from their loved families and friends to pursue and kill the proud sperm whales of the deep blue. When reading Melville's description of life at sea, you really get a feeling of a sad dignity to the whaleman's life as he travels the globe. This novel isn't so much about a whale, but about one man's intense sorrow and desire for vengence and the lengths to which he'll go to acheive his victory over a foe which seems almost to exist solely to torment him. It's a book rich with commentary on the depths of one's soul.Although this story is told by Ishmael, much of it is written more by an omniscient narrator. Certainly, there are many scenes which are described in detailed which Ishmael's character certainly couldn't have been present for. In fact, Ishmael himself hardly seems to play much of a role in the events within the novel. But, he does spend many chapters describing the sperm whale, such as it's dimensions, eating and travelling patterns, the various goods its body produces, etc. He speaks of this so much at certain points it's almost a little too much. But, he gives wonderful details which suggest Melville really did some in-depth research for this novel.I can certainly see why this is a classic. It's so very well-written and reading it made me wish so much I had this type of literary talent. The descriptive language is very beautiful. The characters all seem so real, particularly Captain Ahab, who's seems to be burdened with a good nature, but heavy heart. Although the novel may seem a little slow or long at some points and the lengthy description of the Sperm Whale can become tedious, it's well worth wading through these low points to enjoy this wonderful tale. I think this is really a great book and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book surprised me. I mean, I knew it was a classic, but it isn't structured like any other book I've read. It starts out as a conventional story about this guy names Ishmael, it turns into a recasting of the whole whaling tradition in terms of American enthusiasm and resourcefullness, and then finishes as pure drama. Yes, there are some slow parts, but they seem real. As if Ismael/Melville is trying to convince the reader, a landlocked American in 1851, that being a whaler is interesting, understandable, and as stark a struggle with nature as the life of any frontiersman or explorer."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Quite apart from, some might say in spite of Moby Dick's label as &quot;a classic,&quot; it has become one of my favorite novels. It breathes with a life that the rest of Melville's work (with the possible exceptions of &quot;Bartelby&quot; and the &quot;Lightening Rod Salesman&quot;) lacks.The reason I'm writing a review of the book (my voice has little to add to what others have already written about the text) is to encourage readers to pick up the modern library version. The illustrations add so much texture to the story. They are not imagination robbing images, their semi-surreality expands rather than narrows mental freedom. Get it.

I particularly enjoyed the one about you have to be &quot;uncouth or un-intelligent&quot; if you don't like this book. Now, that's not absolutely true. It's only mostly true. For those of you that were wondering, the biblical references and the protracted prose are all parts of a much larger, grander scheme, and if you wail and knash your teeth at these alone, it just shows you didn't really understand what the book was about. If you don't try and enjoy it as both poetry and prose, you will fail miserably at enjoying it - it is an immersion completely unlike anything else. And if you spend a lot of time at it and eventually put it down without finishing, thinking it stupid, you obviously didn't try very hard to understand it. Maybe we can blame people's inability to understand the book rather than blaming the book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The characters of Moby Dick are at the very least Shakespearean, because the common distinction in literature of &quot;good guy versus bad guy&quot; is absolutely annihilated. Captain Ahab is both King Lear and Iago incarnated together in one body, there is a part of him you dislike, and a side to him you love, and he is neither hero nor villain, and ultimately human.

The story is fantastic but the book itself can be so boring that you end up skimming through chapters. Give me a break, how many chapters should be devoted to the differences between the types of whales? It is an old classic though and prior to Hemmingway many writers, not all, devoted a multitude of pages describing minutia but Melville goes beyond that. He is like Dickens.

Now I'm in college, and I think it's great. So here are some fun facts about this book. When Herman Melville first published this book, it was a flop. No one bought it. They said it was... too deep, no pun intended. Back then long books weren't popular, short stories were, so his publisher told him to stop writing books like this - books that are full of allusions, metaphors and all that good stuff. Melville said, in essence, screw you guys. I like writing like this. And so he was all but kicked out of the literary world. He stuck around, don't get me wrong, but no one would read his works. Now of course Moby Dick is considered the greatest book in American literature. So should you read it? Yes. It is a great book; very well written; well planned. Of course you need to understand that books were written a bit differently back then, so be prepared for... well, something completely unlike Hunger Games.TLDR, if you like literature you will love this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"My order for Moby Dick, Second Edition, Norton Critical Editions, arrived in a timely fashion.

Morgan, M.D."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"An absolute must read...this is an American classic that holds your attention until the last sentence of the book. I think that every student in the school system should be required to read this before they can graduate."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I have been re-reading some of the classics recently, and decided to read Mellville's masterpiece again. I last read it when I was seventeen, and it's even more wonderful than I remembered. This is action-adventure at its best. I think every fiction reader and writer should take a trip with Captain Ahab and his crew. I hope at least some of us writer wanna-be's can reach his level."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I can't believe I reached my 30's (even majored in English) without reading Moby Dick. I was turned off on Melville during college when an overzealous teacher assigned us what he called Melville's &quot;worst book,&quot; Pierre, Or the Ambiguities. I still don't remember WHY he chose that one, but it was not particularly good. So, while I hunted down many classics, this was not one of them. Then, after finding an old edition in a library sale for $.10, I decided it must be a sign. I was completely enraptured from the beginning. The opening chapters that describe Ismael and Queequog's relationship are stunning. Then, the focus shifts and like the crew, we become accustomed to life on the ship. In fact, the process of reading Moby Dick mirrors the process of getting your sea legs. The years at sea drag on almost as long for us, but I don't mean this in a bad way. I found the whaling chapters fascinating although I did expect to be bored by them. Looking back, it's interesting that Ishmael becomes so secondary in the middle of the book we feel a kind of literary illusion that he disappears until the end. Instead, we take on the characteristics of the crew watching with horror as fixation takes over Ahab. My favorite scene takes place when Ahab is so crazed in his single minded pursuit that he turns down the captain of the Rachel's request to look for his lost son. Though reading Moby Dick is a struggle, lots of great literature doesn't come easy (Magic Mountain comes to mind) -- if you're up for the challenge, go for it. It's infinitely rewarding for a strong reader. Plus, you can always rent the movie with Gregory Peck which is pretty damned good and much shorter!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Many of the so-called &quot;literary&quot; types will scoff at the title of my review, stating that anyone who doesn't appreciate Moby-Dick must be uncouth and un-intelligent. But I beg to differ. Any novel, no matter its reputation, should be challenged rather than be blindly accepted as a masterpiece. I proceeded to do so with this novel, and I was surprised by the outcome. To be blunt, this novel was hard to follow, with its numerous mythological and Biblical references, along with its difficult vernacular and extremley long sentence length. The story underneath all the surface is interesting, but even that couldnt overcome the weaknesses. I valiantly tried for two months to finish this book, but I couldnt get into it at all, so I finally gave up. Maybe somewhere down the road I will try again, but the point is that nobody should accept things because of what the status-quo say is correct. Give it a try and form your own opinion. You may agree with the multitude, or you may agree with me."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"When I first read Moby Dick, I'd already seen the movies that were made about it. I thought I knew what the book was about.I was wrong.Moby Dick is a great classic American novel about a whale hunter. Yet it hinted at some ideas that are not easily rendered, and many times can best be communicated with metaphors.On the surface, we have the story of Ahab, as narrated by Ishmael; Ahab was the captain of the whaling ship that was driven mad after the White Whale bit his leg off. A classic example of obsession. Yet if we look deeper, the book has very little to do with \\"monomania\\" and everything to do with understanding one's true nature and purpose in life - and doing it to the exclusion of all that isn't your own purpose.The whale itself is - among other things - the constant opposition that we face in order to achieve the fullness of our being. This struggle never ends. It cannot be defeated in this earthly existence. It is entropy which we struggle against, and only in dying do we conquer death. \\"And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know\\".Ahab wasn't so crazy as most people would have us think. His \\"monomania\\" was simply the focus upon a purity of purpose. Like when you throw a punch; you think of nothing but the punch - if you think at all. Zen and the Art of Face Punching!! The old Buddhist saying \\"Never whistle while you're pissing\\". But even this hints at a greater reality, that all that exists is the manifestation of God's Will. Not in some vague Christian sense, which can contain no real meaning. But in the sense of what it actually is. \\"Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I or God that lifts this arm?\\"And there is within this the inescapable truth that we ourselves must strive toward the purity of purpose. We cannot know anything unless we immerse ourselves in it. But doing so will always change us, forever. I am not the same musician I was 20 years ago. I am trying to face truths about music that I couldn't even imagine back then, and dared not contemplate at the time. So it is with all things we do when we're in this earthly life. The old jazz musicians; they pursued their own White Whales; at the risk of everything. And they paid dearly for it, and were rewarded dearly as well. \\"So there is no earthly way to know what the whale really looks like. And the only way in which you can derive an even tolerable idea of his living contour is by going whaling yourself; but by doing so you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore it seems to me that you best not be too fastidious in your curiosity concerning this Leviathan.\\"These greater Jihads, these inner struggles, are the only thing that truly make us noble creatures; for without them, we are less than primates. \\"From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop\\"Have you ever noticed how in may Buddhist paintings, the Boddisattvas are always standing in hell?If you look at the chapter \\"the Symphony\\", which precedes the Pequod finding the Whale, you'll realize that it was in that chapter when Ahab won his inner battle. It was when ultimate Truth finally came to him. It was the supreme moment of realization in the same way that Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita faced his own moment when he stood on the battlefield and fell to the ground because of the truths that Krishna had revealed to him. The greatest warrior in the world was defeated by a truth larger than his heart could contain. It was too much for him to bear; and he could only bear it when he went through that transition. His own soul had to evolve: and that evolution was not slow and easy: it was cataclysmic. An apotheosis. Same thing with Jesus telling his Disciples that he had many things to tell them, but they couldn't bear them yet. The last three chapters and epilogue of Moby Dick were the inevitable result of accepting that truth; and the Flow taking him through to the next phase.Ishmael! Strange that the narrator should have that name! Ishmael was one of Abraham's sons, as you know. And despite what Jewish and Christian fools claim, the Book of Genesis made it clear that prophecy and a mighty nation was promised to him. The Biblical Ahab was a king who was killed and dogs ate him. Again, going through a trial by fire, and emerging transformed.And here's another thought: could it be that Ishmael was not a member of the crew, and that he was actually Ahab who survived the encounter with the whale, and was transformed by the \\"transitional phase\\" of his death? He spoke rightly of Ahab in the second person because he was no longer that person. Ahab \\"died\\" and emerged a different person. You'll also recall that he used Queequeg's coffin as a boat to make his way to land. Why do you suppose that its; because it floats?The \\"old\\" self dies and a \\"new\\" self is born - another painful experience. The ego protesting against its own growing pains. And all this is driven by the soul's desire for union with Divinity: an act of love. The erotic is the same primordia as spiritual ecstasy vibrating at a lower frequency. All this, ironically, the base part of our being struggles against. \\"He knows himself and all that's in him, who knows adversity. To scale great heights, we must come out of lowermost depths. The way to heaven is through hell. We need fiery baptisms in the fierce flames of our own bosoms. We must feel our hearts hot - hissing in us. And ere its fire is revealed, it must burn its way out of us; though it consume us and itself\\"There are kinds and kinds of deaths! Have you forgotten the Sufi idea of \\"death before dying?\\" \\"Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore? But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God - so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing - straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\"Have you noticed that people often think struggle and suffering are the same thing? You think pain and misery are two words describing the same experience? Ah, my dear readers! Meet the little \\"whale\\" hidden within linguistic constructs that bites off our legs again and again!Ahab's place in the flow was to meet the whale and conquer it. To face that \\"whale\\" was the only right choice he could make.Do not think Moby Dick was only about a whale that bit off Ahab's leg, then he lost his mind, and went fishing. Killing the whale in a mad act of revenge is the last thing Moby Dick is about. People have been making that mistake for a century and a half. The obvious is in front of them and they miss it. They see only the surface; and are blinded by what they see. Its no wonder Moby Dick was unknown for decades and Melville died in obscurity. To this day, only a handful of people understand the books' real message."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"When one looks over the vast array of American Literature, there are but a few books that are ranked in a class by themselves. They include such novels as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"The Jungle\\". In any \\"greatest list\\" I've seen, \\"Moby Dick\\" always shows up. In fact, only Huckleberry Finn draws more support as the Great American Novel. With this in mind, I decided that it was high time I read \\"Moby Dick\\". In doing so, I was prepared to appreciate a classic with my only misgivings being my tendency to get bogged down in the tedium of the 19th Century style of prose.I admit that I was fairly satisfied with the first part of the novel and I was proceeding along fine until Ismael turned into the world's greatest authority on the subject of whales and whaling. I may have missed a point or two but I was sure that Ismael's self-introduction identified him as a merchant marine who was embarking on on his first whaling voyage. He must have been doing a lot of reading on the voyage because he proceeded to tell me more that I ever wanted to know about whales and whaling.I read \\"Moby Dick\\" to enjoy a story; not to engorge myself with, for me, uninteresting trivia. The facts overwhelmed the story and I was losing interest fast. I finally started to speed read my way through the final 50 pages and all of the accompanying \\"Billy Budd\\". I have seldom been so happy to finish a book and I even entertained the thought of just chucking the book and not even finishing it. I realize that there are many thousands of people out there for whom the sea is an enchantress. I also understand that Captain Ahab's maniacal search for the great white whale has allegoties about ourselves (although I wasn't all that motivated to dwell on that subject).\\"Moby Dick\\" is not the first classic to fall short in my estimation and I'm sure it won't be the last. I mentioned above that I don't care for 19th Century Literature in general (Henry James \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" put me to sleep). However, Mark Twain is my favorite author and he seemed to be able to communicate his stories in an enjoyable yet profound way. Oh well, to each his own."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Seen through the eyes of one Ishmael, this is the story of Captain Ahab's obsession with the white whale, Moby Dick. Having lost his leg to the whale, Ahab is now on a mission of revenge upon this mighty leviathan. The whale exhibits odd intelligence and ferocity, having evaded hunters and taken many a man's life. While the book is exquisitely written with intriguing characters, the author tended to slip into page upon page of explanatory notes. This breaks up the story line and is a distraction. The story itself however, keeps you reading. Complete with all the gory descriptions of the whaling business, Moby Dick is a good book, but a slow read. Call me what you like, but not Ishmael..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I first read \\"Moby Dick\\" many years ago in high school and hated it. I thought I would give it another shot to see if time and age had changed my perspective. Well, sort of. I had always liked the basic storyline - that of Ahab's relentless pursuit of the great white whale and how (his) obsession, taken to extreme, ultimately destroys. But there were still a few things that kept me from fully appreciating \\"Moby Dick\\" as a great novel.I am still not a big fan of Melville's writing style. I found his writing to be erratic - very slow in some sections then very rapid in others. And the manner in which he switches from Ishamel's first-person narrative to third-person narrative was somewhat awkward. Then throw in a couple of chapters that are scripted like a stage play and you have a book in which I could not find any true cadence. I found myself battling (then and now) through the chapters futilely trying to get into a flow where the pages would just sweep me along.Secondly, as noted, many chapters were devoted to describing the whaling industry and the whales in great detail. I understand that in Melville's time it was common to write novels that educated as well as entertained. But the extent to which Melville elaborated in those chapters really disrupted the storyline's momentum which had to be kick-started in later sections. The transition from a fictional narrative to a lengthy non-fictional discourse was a little too stark.Finally, Ishmael's/Melville's continual philosophical meanderings were somewhat stretched. As Ishamel stands upon the mast-head relating the operations of whaling with the whole history of mankind or when during a thunderstorm Melville draws parallels between the unrest in nature with the unrest on the Pequod.....well, those seemed to be a bit of an overreach.There was much about \\"Moby Dick\\" that I liked and there is much about this Melville work to be admired but I still found it to be a labor to read. Better the second time around. For me, \\"Moby Dick\\" is good novel but one in which I could not find greatness."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is a story of a man with a painful soul who hunts god/whale and the sacrifices made by fate to save this one soul. It is amazing writing, I was surprised in the begining with the sense of humor, and I love the struggle to understand something higher in this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Let me open by saying I am usually quite skeptical of \\"must reads\\" from the literary canon by \\"dead white males,\\" so much so that when I started this book, I fully intended to not like it at all. This book truly belongs in the top five of most important novels in American Literature (as an aside, I would put Beloved, Scarlet Letter, Huck Finn, and probably Invisible Man as the other 4.) One of the things that I did not expect is how downright funny parts of this book are. Look for the scenes when Ishmael meets Queequeg, and the truly lowbrow humor in the discussion of the bishoprick and the pythagorean maxim (why high school teachers don't focus on these parts to get students interested is beyond me). The novel also speaks to America as a nation at a time when we were still trying to figure out just what America was in 1850; it also makes subtle references to how the western world interacts with non-western people (e.g. the name of the ship they were on). It also speaks heavily to psychological issues, mostly involving Captain Ahab--not only his obsession with the whale, but how he keeps his hold over the crew when other crews would have mutinied. The middle parts of the novel, where Melville lifts pages whole cloth from whaling books, are the only reason I couldn't give the book 5 stars. It truly is a must read--and I don't say that lightly--both for its own intrinsic value and for its role as one of the core metaphors for our society."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The story of Moby Dick, the elusive whale, and Captain Ahab's constant quest for him is one that has been around for a long time, and it has been assimilated into our culture. The book is more than just a quest after a big whale. It is a complex tale that Melville brings a number of disparate elements to. It is an adventure romance, an epic quest. A Faustian bargain and a psychological tale which delves into the mind of Captain Ahab. We see how this quest affects his mental stability, and we see to what extent he will go to achieve his goal. I did find the novel rather long though. Perhaps there was too much moralizing and philosophizing. But it is still an important novel, and should be included in the list of classic literature that should be read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book moves along at a pretty slow pace but at the same time manages to keep you stuck to the pages somehow. If you've got the time and the vocabulary then i suggest picking up this classic novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Herman Melville's Moby Dick stands in relation to the American idea as Virgil's Aeneid does to the Roman idea. In this epic masterpiece, Melville tells the story of the tormented and obsessed Captain Ahab's pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick, who maimed him once on a whaling voyage and has since come to represent to him the whole unresolvable problem of evil, human suffering,and the heartlessness of nature, the universe, and ultimately God. Ishmael, the narrator of the tale, follows Ahab's doomed quest and interprets philosophically the story of which he has become a part, seeing in the search for the white whale a microcosm of the state of humanity in general, and of modern, naturalistic America in particular. The beauty of the language mirrors the beauty of the world which Ishmael sees and interprets, and which so often seems deceptive in its promises of peace, friendship, and certitude."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This classic story is one of the best books I have ever read, but not the best. This story didn't blow me away, but it isn't the average book (it's better)."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Beyond a questionable doubt, Moby Dick is Melville's and American History's Greatest Literary Achievement. No other novel questions our existence as living, thinking human beings better. Though true that the plot chronicles the quest of a mad captain seeking vengeance upon a beast that maimed him, the book's deeper meaning of our relations to the universe cannot be ignored or the literal magic is lost. The novel addresses themes our of souls, relationships with each other, religions, morals, and ideas with such purity and genius that no other medium but the written word can convey it so beautifully. Moby is God, Ahab is Man, Starbuck is caution and religion, Stubb is ambivalence, Queequeg: trust, Fedallah: the devil. Read it or lose out on the best thing that you ever could."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is my candidate for the Great American Novel, and this is a reprint of my favorite edition. Initially designed by Andrew Hoyem for a limited release by Arion Press, with illustrations by Barry Moser, this was reissued for mass market by University of California Press with illustrations and special page and type design intact. I and several of my friends have found reading this edition especially enjoyable, as all of the small aspects of design work to please the reader without detracting from the text.

His pseudo dialect is almost beleivable, however he is way over the top emoting and blustering through the dialogue. Then he continues on in the same monotonous bombast to read the prose sections as if they were also dialogue. The problem with this is an extremely irritating sing-song pattern, combined with his squeeking, yelling, and mumbling. It lacks all respect for the dignity of Melville's prose. Buy the unabridged version read by Bill Bailey. It is not exciting, but it is not irritating and does not get in the way of Melville's prose."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This review pertains more to this particular edition of Moby-Dick than Moby-Dick itself. The story needs no summary or introduction. It's great and I would assume that by browsing here you have already expressed interest in the book, and so you should!However, the Modern Library Classics publication of Moby-Dick is subpar when put side by side with Penguin Classics, Oxford World Classics, or the pentultimate Norton Critical Edition. The particularly nice part of this edition is the original woodcut illustrations of Rockwell Kent. While this is certainly a nice touch, it does not help the reader as much as better explanatory notes would. Moby-Dick is a book saturated with symbolism and copious references to Biblical works. While there is a very sparce selection of explanatory notes in the back of the book, many difficult passages or more obscure references go completely unnoticed by them. The introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick is really no help at all and comes close to approaching the incoherence of rambling enthusiasm.Much of what makes Moby-Dick the amazing work of literature that is will be missed by a casual reader if he or she selects this publication. It's a truly American novel and one of the first to come out of the American Renaissance that asserted American writers were of equal, if not better, ability with their European contemporaries. It's an experience that should not be missed, but should be experienced with a better publisher."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Skimming some of these reviews I see a lot of descriptions of 'Moby Dick' as being \\"grueling,\\" \\"confusing,\\" and even downright \\"boring.\\" I don't deny that Moby Dick is all of these things, at times. Conversely though Herman Melville's masterpiece also contains some of the most beautiful writing that one is ever likely to come across. This is no doubt at least a small part of why this novel is one of the most divisive in American literature and why there are still such widely diverging views as to its meaning. Either way you don't get to just cop out and write this one off simply because there are sections that are difficult to sift through.The cast was, I believe, intended to be symbolic of the American idea, the American dream. The crew of the Pequod is sort of a rag-tag hodgepodge of folks from all corners of the globe. It's a ship where folks who had maybe gone bankrupt or previously experienced failures and hardship earlier in life can come to start over again. Ishmael perhaps representing the archetypical American \\"cowboy,\\" joining the Pequod without any real purpose other than for the adventure, the freedom afforded by the open seas, and the excitement of venturing out into the unknown.More than this was intended to be symbolic of the changes going on in American society the Pequod's expedition was, I believe, intended to be deeply representative of the issues that are at the heart of man's place in this world. While ostensibly the story is about whaling, it is more symbolically a story of each man's personal odyssey to give purpose to his own existence amidst sneaking suspicions (brought on by science and philosophy) that this life might ultimately be meaningless. The frequent encounters that the Pequod has with other ships reminds me of what Karl Barth called \\"sign posts\\" which are more or less symbolic events in our lives that point to something further, that beckon us to continue on our path. The captains of other vessels mention having heard of the \\"White Whale,\\" so there are signs that the Pequod should continue though the general sense amongst all with the exception of Ahab is that they're chasing a phantom, a myth, nothingness. With God in exile and religion out of most peoples lives there has been a similar feeling by many that life might be pointless. That all of our daily toil and efforts might be for nothing all the while never falling quite so deep into despair as to give up on this world completely.Ahab shows the most obvious manifestations of some people's growing mistrust of technology. Of how science can quantify our world without really telling us anything meaningful about it. His rage at having lost his leg is a reflection of the growing sense of despair over what seems to be the sheer randomness of events in our lives, at the way nature seems to act without reason, and how the most terrible tragedies can befall us without any provocation. Ahab's futile attempts to kill the White Whale are violent lashings out at the world, at nature; they are frustrated and misguided attempts to push back on the forces acting on him. This is an intrinsically human reaction, namely we seek to destroy whatever we can't bring under our thumb.Obviously this book is just loaded with symbolism and allegory so there are many ways in which to interpret this book. One shouldn't forget this fact because Moby Dick is a book that was meant to be read more than once. I personally have only read it once but it is a book that begs to be gone over repeatedly in order to get the most out of it and I do sincerely hope to read this wonderful book again someday.What probably prevents alot of folks from going over it again are the seemingly endless descriptions about whales and the 19th Century whaling industry. Like, about half this book is a treatise on whaling. It's difficult to understand exactly why this is done. I'm guessing one reason could be that this was written at a time when alot of folks didn't have things like \\"Free Willy\\" or the Discovery Channel that would allow them to truly appreciate the majesty of the whale or even what a whale was or looked like. Another reason could be that this whale chronical may have been another way to show how we can quantify nature, we can describe it, but we still end up powerless against it in the long run.Whatever his reason's for adding this I don't think Melville made his novel any more compelling or meaningful with all the whale talk. To be perfectly honest it can be a real chore to get through some of those parts. Still, I'm giving this book a 5 because of it's exquisite imagery and because of its incredibly insightful look at humanity, at our contradictions, and how the intensity of our desires seems to blind us to how fragile and vulnerable we really are. Melville is able to express modern man's confusion and despair without leaving the reader in a state of hopelessness. Quite an incredible accomplishment really, something few philosophers seem capable of. Also, I would think the collective weight of the world academic community outweighs alot of these negative reviews.Classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"There are aspects of this story that are awe-inspiringly brilliant. \\"To the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee!\\" What a line! Khan would have been so boring without it in Star Trek II.On the other hand, the chapters about knots and ropes, etc. are extremely tedious. Unfortunately, that accounts for most of the content.If you take on the challenge of reading this book, you should understand that the novel itself may become your own white whale. Completing this book can become a nearly impossible task.Remember, though, that Moby Dick's close affiliation with Trek's Khan has inspired many young trekkers to slog their way through this book. If you can't finish it, you might just become known as someone with less intellectual fortitude than a Star Trek fan. Do you really want that?Finish the book. It'll be good for you....like brussel spouts.Note: No offense is intended to Star Trek fans.

It includes Melville's &quot;Reviews and Letters&quot; as well as numerous critical essays. Though at times rather elementary, the footnotes are nonetheless occasionally insightful."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick by Herman Melville stands as one of the greatest American novels ever published.Bleh!How often have we heard that syllogism in classrooms and critic's circles nationwide? It's statements like this that actually turn people off to reading great books. As Mark Twain famously said, \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read,\\" a good majority of the American public approaches literary classics like taking strep throat medication. It might taste awful in your mouth and it might be a challenge to get through, but it's good for you so don't argue. Moby Dick has gotten a fair amount of flak because a lot of people are forced to read it. Of course, I'm no different from thousands of English teachers in the sense that I made my students read it. Of course, most didn't like it. Melville is hard to get through at times.What makes the book a challenge is sadly what makes it a great read: the author's wide vocabulary. Moby Dick and Shakespeare's plays have a lot in common in the sense that they are extremely dense. When you're used to reading Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and Stephanie Meyer, Melville's language can feel like being dropped into the Amazon after a week at Jesus Camp. You're totally unprepared. But there's a richness here that's unparalleled in contemporary fiction. One facet of Melville's writing that he excels at is metaphor and simile. If you want a crash course in how to write good similes and metaphors, read Moby Dick. Also of note is the extreme attention to detail, which effectively creates an authentic setting. This is the quintessential novel of \\"write what you know\\" since Melville was on a whale ship earlier in life.As part of my personal preference, I also appreciate the consistent allusions to history, philosophy and theology. This book is so symbolic, it's as if the author is creating a contemporary Bible story.The characters are extremely deep and complex, not to mention unforgettable. Captain Ahab stands in my book as one of the most interesting and morally ambiguous characters in all of fiction. But there I go again with hyperboles.Read this book. Slog through it slowly if need be. Put it off till adulthood if you're being forced to read it now and don't appreciate it. Yes all the critics and teachers praise the book, but for all it's worth, they're right on this one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Rereading Moby Dick after several decades is an extraordinary privilige.

This is a marvelous edition that brings all the context and allusionsfrom Melville scholarship right to the reader in footnotes and appendices.It is no small triumph.George Rosenbaum"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is one of the great American classic novels. Although it sold very poorly when first published and damaged Melville's established reputation as a writer of exotic novels it has rightfully assumed its place in the canon of great 19th century novels. I won't repeat the story here. Who doesn't already know the plot (which is based on a true story of a whaler rammed by a whale and sunk)? Check out Nathaniel Philbrook's In the Heart of the Sea for that. But the atavistic battle between the monomaniacal Ahab and Moby Dick is unique in fiction. The Nantucket whalers are among the great American heroes in Melville's vision and the voyage of the Pequod is a microcosm of the world swept by fate along treacherous seas. Yes there are boring chapters about the details of whales and whaling. But even these contain tidbits of humor, and are the basis for both the heroics of the whalers and the magnificence of whales, especially Moby Dick.This edition is beautifully bound with quality leather. The paper is thick and the text large and readable. The illustrations are good. For the price this is a fine edition of this timeless novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"My title might imply that I didn't enjoy this... certainly Moby Dick is a daunting book to pick up, and it's very easy to catch your eyes skimming rather than reading... but I would have to say, once read, it is easy to figure out why this book is a classic.Sure it took me a while to get past my knowledge of whales, the fact that they aren't fish and that they are intelligent animals. And having been out of school for several years now, it took a bit to knock the cobwebs out of the brain to read the writing style of the time. But in reality this is a fantastic story on so many levels. The meaning and the subtext are brilliant. For those of you who have spent your life under a rock...Moby Dick is the tale of Ishmael, a teacher turned whaler who joins the ship the Pequod to sail in search of whales for the oils, blubber and meat they contain. If you are not sure how whaling works, don't worry - Ishmael is going to give you an entire tutorial on the topic. You will also learn the history of the whale, and all about it's anatomy... or what they perceived these things to be at the time the book was written. So Ishmael sets sail to learn that his new captain - Ahab, is a little bit on the OCD side... you see he's recently lost a leg to this huge white sperm whale the sailors call \\"Moby Dick.\\" And well, Ahab took this as a personal slight so he's out to capture and kill Moby Dick.Because this is a review and not a term paper I am not going to go into the deeper meaning of everything, instead I'll just say that yes, this is a daunting book to pick up, but it is also a wonderful read.So why not 5 stars? Well mainly from personal taste... I liked the story of Ahab, the ship, and the hunt... but Ishmael won't stay on topic and keeps going on and on about the size of a whale's jaw or how the Kracken was actually a whale, or that St. George actually killed a whale and called it a dragon. I found myself wanting to shake Ishmael and tell him \\"Enough of this, get back to the STORY!\\" But as I said... this was just personal taste, egged on by the fact that I REALLY liked the story part of the book. Now I had read the childrens version of this back in the 3rd grade, and it was my favorite classic for years. I had always dreaded reading the full version, but in reality it didn't take me more than a week, and I wasn't trying all that hard. I would highly recommend that any avid reader at least give this a try. It is truly a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A few years back I made a conscious decision to read (and in some cases re-read) a number of books that fall into the category of \\"classics.\\" The books that stand the test of time the best have an uncanny ability to feel modern and relevant no matter how long ago they were written. It's almost as if there is a certain current that runs down through the years that flows with a permanence that most don't. If a writer can tap into this current, their writing can be timeless; a classic.Herman Melville tapped into that current in spades in this story. Despite this book being over 150 years old, the themes Melville selected from many obviously available to him are themes that are just as relevant an engaging today as they were in 1851. Further, Melville somehow had a handle on using language that would not seem outdated even after a century and a half.What you get is a great story about a revenge-obsessed man, characters to whom you can easily relate and colorful descriptions of the life of a whaleman. It all comes together beautifully.Any drawbacks? Sure, Melville's story slows in the middle of the book as he goes into a deep examination of the physical characteristics of various whales, but it's still interesting and it's just not enough to take away from the rest of this novel.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Though you'd probably never guess it from reading my reviews, I'm actually an English major, and I've read quite a bit of 'literature' in my day. As an English major I've lost the natural adolescent tendency to denigrate and despise the supposed classics, though I'm generally not 100% sold on them either. They're usually pretty good, interesting, though probably not as deep as they're made out to be. 'Moby-Dick' is one of the few classic novels I've come across that's truly deserving of its legendary status. Now I'm not gonna lie to you; there are a great many portions of this novel that I don't understand, or, more precisely, don't understand why Melville chose to include them. His virtual lectures on whales and whaling and whatever are generally reasonable interesting, even though I don't necessarily understand why they've been included. How the novel really works for me, however, is just as pure story. Most significantly, Ahab is just the greatest character in American literature. He's the archetype of the vengeful man, imitated countless times but never matched, much less surpassed. The major passages where he speaks are just spellbinding and he's just such a great tragic figure, particularly in a late chapter where mourns his long life on the sea and all that he's left behind in his quest for revenge. All this combines to just make the final few chapters of the novel unbelievably intense despite the fact that it's pretty much impossible for a contemporary reader not to know the basic events. (And Ahab's final monologue is sheer brilliance.) I dunno what else to say. It's just all got an amazing impact."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is the greatest novel ever. Of course, I can't be sure of that, because I haven't read every novel ever written. But Herman Melville's book is an epic masterpiece, and one that kindled an interest in classic American literature for me...even if it took me 5 months to finish it.I think the basic plot is very good, Ahab searching for the whale, and all...but I never got to deep into wondering what Moby Dick represented or what Ahab represented. But I got a lot out of the middle section, which examines Man's place in the grand scheme of the world.This novel is really great--I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I just picked up the book one day and said &quot;why not?&quot;.What it comes down to is this: The first few chapters are incredible. Much of the middle reads like an outdated whaling textbook, but there's also a lot of symbolism, philosophy, and once or twice I caught some humor. Then from chapter 99+ it returns to the vivid characterization of the early chapters.These early and later chapters are what make the book truly great, and some people tend to miss the subtlety of the middle sections . ."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"To ask someone who has never read Moby Dick what they think it is about, they would probably tell you what I used to think, &quot;It is about a white whale.&quot;. Surprisingly, very few of the numerous chaptors were devoted to that particular leviathon. Instead, Moby Dick himself is the climax of a book that puts you on the ocean in the mid-19th century with a rather interesting crew and captain. You do not only read about a singular chase of a brutal (not all white) beast, you learn what whales are made of (at least what they knew back then), how the crew was hired and paid, the complete workings of the ship from the owners down to the carpenter, and how dangerous a vocation this really was. Symbolism abounds, and quite honestly I ignored most of it and chose instead to just enjoy the scenery. Take what you will, but Moby Dick is well worth it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A while ago I made the decision to read my way through the classics of Western literature, and for a while the going was relatively easy: Austen, the Bronte sisters, Dickens and Thackeray were all enjoyable, though time-consuming. Then I hit Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\". With its long complicated sentences, huge digresses away from the main plot to discuss seemingly irrelevant material, chapters made entirely out of dialogue, characters that are introduced only to disappear and a climactic moment that lasts one paragraph, it was with more relief than relish that I completed the challenge of reading this one-hundred and thirty-five chaptered novel.But read it I did, and I'm glad I did, and perhaps one day I'll even read it again with a greater appreciation for its quirks. Till then however, I have to base this review on my own experience this time around, and the truth is that I found it an incredibly difficult book to read.Ishmael is a young man who has taken it into his head to travel aboard a whaling ship and in doing so explore the oceanic parts of the world, joining the crew of the Pequod. Exploring the island of Nantucket and meeting the heathen Queequeg (who carries his god around with him in the shape of a small idol), Ishmael is soon on board and under the captainship of the infamous Captain Ahab. Ahab commands his entire crew with an iron fist in order to fulfil his obsession in killing the legendary Moby Dick, the White Whale.It all sounds more exciting than it actually is. In between these fast-paced and interesting \`action-sequences' are entire chapters that discuss the apparatus of the ship, the different species of whale and its usable parts, and the representations of whales in art, literature, history and science. Truth be told, it is quite tedious - though at times little nuggets of information that emerge can be both enlightening and fascinating.The centre of the novel is undoubtedly the somewhat deranged Captain Ahab (Moby doesn't show up until the end), and the best reason to endeavour to read \\"Moby Dick\\" as he's one of the most famous characters in literature. He is nearly driven mad by the thought of Moby Dick, given that years ago he lost his leg to the mighty leviathan and now must do with a whale-bone leg in its place - a neat conceit considering Moby Dick still carries the Ahab's harpoon in his fin. Ahab's quest is what drives the crew into deeper and more dangerous waters, after the commercial venture in whaling for blubber and oil gradually turns to one of vengeance. Despite being described as \`monomanic', Ahab wields enough power and charisma over his crew to override the protestations of ship-owners Starbuck and Stubbs when his own vendetta takes over the ship's mission, steering them through storms, pods of whales, ill omens, deaths and pleas for help from other vessels in the hunt for the White Whale. He's an unforgettable character, and one that you're likely to have heard of even if you've never picked up \\"Moby Dick\\".Ishmael is an amusing first-person narrator, youthful, eager and more nave than Melville himself, and it's a shame when he \`disappears' halfway through the novel, making way for a more omnipresent narrator who we can only assume is a more detached Ishmael. More amusement stems from the fact that Melville is the king of the understatement (often he discusses raging storms as if they're everyday occurrences) and of grim irony (at the same time he describes the sentimental sight of mother-whales and their calves, he adds as a footnote how good they taste when cooked).\\"Moby Dick\\" is often considered the first - and only - American Epic, and for that historical literary importance I am glad I read it. But it is a struggle, and so this review should serve as both encouragement and warning for those approaching \\"Moby Dick\\" with no idea what to expect, as it's a tricky book to complete."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book is not for the faint hearted, but if you truly want to learn to read, this is the book for you.Melville starts with the bones of a good story, adds the meat of interesting characters, and then augments that with layer upon layer of detail and symbolism, each of which is as rich (and as hard to bring home) as the whale oil the characters seek.If you love MTV, you'll hate Moby Dick; it is not easy to get through and find the plot. But if you like poetry and enjoy searching for symbolism in deep details, you will ultimately enjoy this book.My advice to those who are looking for quick gratification and have been assigned this book for an English class: read the first hundred or so pages, then skip to the last fifty. This will give you the basic plot and let you enjoy the action. Then go back to the center pages you skipped (if you don't you will be doing yourself no favors) and read those pages as you would poetry. I must admit that I wish I had done this the first time I read it: I spent a good long time wishing Ahab would please hurry up and catch his silly \\"fish\\" instead of listening to the language as I ought to have done.So read this book and savor it. It isn't the action-packed adventure about a man and a whale that one might expect from the movies. Instead it's a thought provoking work about the nature of man."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Few modern characters can compare with Melville's creations in Moby Dick: Ishmael, Starbuck, Queequeg, Stubbs, and of course, Ahab. Each one is a work of art. The story is gripping and Melville's use of foreshadowing is masterly. From the early chapters as Ishmael reflects on the inexorable pull of the sea and finds himself in Coffin's inn, The Trap, bunking down with an unkown cannibal, to the very end as each character realizes that he is caught in the grip of Ahab's unrelenting monomania, the book has an hypnotic power that keeps readers immersed in its spell. Anyone who thinks they know the story of Moby-Dick but has never read the book should think again. Reading it is an incredible experience that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"About a year ago I was talking with a good friend about the books we'd each been reading recently, and the topic of Moby Dick came up. &quot;What!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You've never read Moby Dick? You've got to read it! It's great! And it has all kinds of geeky stuff about ships and whaling that you'd like.&quot; I made some excuses about it being archaic but she browbeat me into agreeing to check it out.I found a number of editions at the local bookstore but this edition, with the Rockwell Kent illustrations, caught my eye, so that's the one I bought. As I was paying for it the clerk at ther register said &quot;That's my favorite book!&quot; Maybe my friend was on to something after all.I started reading it that evening, and you know what? This *is* a great book. The language may be a bit flowerly and long winded for those raised on post-modern New Yorker short stories, but it's a very vivid language that makes characters and scenes come alive. Melville's narration of both the external world of the shop and the internal world of the characters is compelling in a way that few if any modern authors can acheive.Moby Dick is a classic for reasons that go beyond having been assigned as school reading since the beginning of time. If you never got beyond reading the Bartlett's Notes when Moby Dick was assigned to you in high school, this is as good a time as any to dive into the real thing."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Run -- quickly --- jump aboard!

Off with you now!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"&quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;. With these words so begins this epic tale. Melville's words are many, rich with meaning and flow from his pen in torrents, using the character Ismael as the narrator. The plot surrounds Captain Ahab who is obsessed with killing the white whale, Moby Dick, who has cost him his leg on a previous whaling expedition. But this book is much more than this simple plot.Moby Dick is about whales. And there sure is a lot about whales --more about whales than I ever thought I wanted to know. It's as if every single legend, every single description, and every single fact ever known about whales is included in this book. Melville writes in a wordy archaic style; his sentences are long and complicated, his references are often obscure, he goes off on tangents that are hard to follow. But yet I found myself getting caught up in the complex rhythms of his language as I would pure poetry -- just for the sound of the words.Although the character of Ismael is forever in the background, we are treated to a long line of lively characters. We meet the tattooed Pacific Islander Queequeg who Ismael thinks of as a cannibal and who is one of the three dark skinned harpooners. We meet the First Mate Starbuck who is a voice of reason. We meet the carpenter and the cook and the young cabin boy who loses his mind after of act of cowardice. And of course there is Captain Ahab in his madness.But even though all the characters are richly drawn, I felt they were mere players, creating the stage setting for the detailed grueling descriptions of the whales. The reader joins the men on the whaleboats for the kill. We feel the highs and lows of joy and disappointment and fatigue. The danger frightens and intrigues us. It is an adventure as well as a gruesome murder of the whale.Most of all, I felt sorry for the whales. Melville does a lot to humanize them. They become more than just beasts of the sea which will bring wages to the crew. By the end of the book I was rooting for the whales. Of course by this point I had struggled through hundreds of pages of excruciating detailed descriptions. I knew all about the oil, the blubber, the bone, the brain, the skin, the eyes, the sprout, the tail. I knew the different smells of different parts of the body from perfume to rot. I admired their strong fighting spirit. And I deployed the brutality and wastefulness of their slaughter.The pace of the book is very uneven. Sometimes it's even hard to remember the plot. And in addition to all this whaling lore, Melville goes off on long wordy philosophies on the nature of man and the meaning of life. His themes are repeated over and over and sometimes it seems that he never gets to the point. By the end of the book, the actual search for the white whale and the inevitable conclusion is simply a punctuation mark to finalize Melville's thoughts.

But it is certainly not for everyone, especially if you like clarity, conciseness and focus in your choice of literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, where visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it. --Chapter 41 (Moby Dick)The awesome power of the written word to conjure in the mind a reverential awe for a world you've never experienced is nothing short of miraculous. And nowhere is the wizard's wand better wielded than in the pages of Moby Dick. I agree with many of the reviewers in stating that for those uninitiated in the reading of classical literature, this is going to be arduous, and simultaneously the most superlative literary experience you will ever know."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Ahab chases a whale. That's my plot summary. Really there's not much more to this book plot-wise. The narrator takes aboard a whaling vessel and goes off to sea and learns that his captain is obsessed with killing the white whale that took his leg.You don't read Moby Dick for the plot. You read Moby Dick because of Melville's complete command of the poetry of language, his mastery of the subject matter and his ability to inject philosophy and humor into the strangest places.I find Moby Dick to be more of a reference book than a novel. I'll pull it down from my shelf and flip through it and enjoy a page or two about the morality of different kinds of chowder, or immerse myself in a page-long sentence describing the skeleton of a sperm whale.Ahab chases a whale, that's really all that's going on. But that doesn't convey how spot on Melville's musings about man's connection to the sea are or how you can feel the harpoon rope draped across your shoulders when Ishmael takes to the long boats.Sometimes, when Melville breaks for two chapters to give you a history of the biology of various whales, you might think, like Ishmael, that you're in the hands of a madman. But at no point do you doubt that you're in the hands of a poet."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"From its 'Great American Novel' rep I expected Moby Dick to be stodgy and slow: I was thinking 700 pages of Henry James (ugh). But Melville's book is anything but stodgy. Insane, maybe--passionate, surely--original? Well, very similar in style to Scots Enlightenment, let's say Carlyle's romantic musings plus Stevenson's adventure plus a working-class ethic. But, yes, American. And damned original.Passages in this book are written as a play. Passages are written as a history of whaling. All the characters have the same ecstatic inner monologue, and this is only intermittently broken by Melville writing directly to you without the subtext of a plot. The book is constructed in a way that makes Faulker look tame: it sprawls. No wonder it didn't make a dime when it was first published--if it were published the month after Ulysses, it'd still raise eyebrows.This book isn't stodgy. This book is revolutionary. This book is very, very strange.For those kids having to write book reports on Moby Dick--give up. Read Jack London's Sea Wolf. Come back after you've tangled with the Leviathan."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive \`readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and please don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is a tribute to craftsmanship; Melville's writing craftsmanship's drawing from his former experience in the whale fishery to paint a vivid picture of the lives and toil of thirty men in a deranged quest for revenge on a \\"dumb brute\\".Each one of the crew members holds a special pride for its own mastery of the many trades combined to make Nantucket whaling so dominant. We see the pagan harpooners, the cook, all the mates, the oarsmen, the carpenter, the blacksmith... The only crewmember that takes pride in having no pride is Ishmael.Towards the end of the book Ahab cries at the height of his 58 years, 40 of it dedicated to whaling. He thinks of how little he has enjoyed of life, thinks about his young wife whom he seldom sees, thinks about how much more he could have reached if he only could have aspired less. Isn't this the age old paradox of capitalism? Till you get to be captain, the higher you rise the harder you toil, and after you become captain things do not improve much.This is why Moby Dick is so hated by high school students. You have to toil away on your monkey-ropes before you can truly appreciate it. I just finished reading Moby Dick for the first time now that I am 37 years old. Thank you Herman Melville.Leonardo AlvesBelo Horizonte MG 2009"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is a long, wandering read to be sure, but also beautiful and rewarding. But I couldn't stop wondering how much of this book, if forced to adhere to the more streamlined conflict/resolution editorial standards of today, would've been left on the cutting-room floor? In its pared-down form, would this still be the classic we hold it to be? Probably not. The Sperm Whale might be an endangered species, but books like this one are altogether extinct."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I am one of those who firmly believes that Melville's non-fiction is superior to his fiction. &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot; are more to my taste. &quot;Moby Dick&quot; contains any number of memorable characters, scenes and philosohpical speculations, but, unconfined by the autobiographical incidents that formed his early work, Melville's mind and his syntax here ramble all over the place.

I never realized how much symbolism there is in this narrative. It is extremely moving. Queequeg can represent Christ and Ishmael the common man. Many biblical/Christian themes are represented here--salvation, redemption, resurrection. Everyone should read this book at least once!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"&quot;Moby Dick&quot; combines a rouser of a good adventure story, deliciously laden with profound symbolism all over the place, with many amusing digressions about cetology and the science/art of whaling. Some modern readers are not too taken with the latter, but I think each little jewel of a chapter is almost like its own essay, as Melville's thoughtful misungs paint a vivid portrait of things we can only imagine today. One should also not imagine that this is a humorless book, for Melville's wit is often prevalent among the perfundity."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The whale. Herman Melville's whale. The whale of Ahab's tortured monomania. The appalling white whale that confronts you, tears your limbs, terrible in his wrath, imposing his power, his beauty, his wickedness, his divinity. Of course the whale is a symbol. But of what? So many things it is impossible to pigeonhole. Ishmael says several times that &quot;the whale has no face.&quot; The whale is like looking at a blank wall. It is a tabula rasa, a mystery, and throughout the tale affixed so many explanations that in the end he defies definition. Subjectivity reigns. Just examine &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot; and &quot;The Doubloon&quot; chapters. Myriad ambivilant meanings abound. And this is what makes Moby Dick so great.Stylistically, the rhetoric soars. Contorted and ornamental, sentinous and profound, Melville's dark prose is masterful. Towards the end of the book the descriptions of the hunt, the chase, the horror, the madness, the violence, the destruction, the death, all transcend to a fury of grand, operatic scale. The prose moves like the Catskill eagle in &quot;The Try-Works&quot; chapter &quot; that can dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.&quot; Mellville's prodigious creation is realistic and romantic, turbulent and symbolic. It will last. Moby Dick is an epic of the sea such as no writer has equalled."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Having reached the mid-life point, I didn't \\"get around to\\" reading MOBY-DICK until just recently. I'm certainly glad that I finally stopped putting it off. Herman Melville's work is truly one of the most amazing books I have read. As others have pointed out here, it's not always an easy read, but it is well worth devoting time to. Indeed, I approached it as if it were an artisan cheese or a fine glass of wine; I ingested it slowly, savoring it over a period of months.MOBY-DICK is told (mostly) through the eyes of a seaman (\\"Call me Ishmael\\"), beginning with his journey to Nantucket to find a job on a whaler and then continuing with his voyage on the Pequod. The initial chapters (minus the introductory matter) are somewhat misleading in that they employ a traditional narrative structure--quite amusingly describing Ishmael's first encounter with the cannibal harpooner Queequeg--and the unaware reader who enjoys this initial rollicking ride may be disappointed with the \\"digressions\\" that follow.Once the Pequod sets sail, the narrative adopts the rhythm of a voyage, i.e., long days at sea, labor-intensive with respect to the upkeep of the vessel, but otherwise dull, interspersed with heart-stopping whaling and welcome encounters with other ships. This pattern of life at sea is reflected in the book's structure in this way: the long, uneventful days lend time to the narrator to present the history, science, and art of whales and whaling, while the whaling and ship encounters brings the narration back to a more-or-less (and often less) traditional narrative structure.The core story is well known, and would be familiar even to those who haven't much other knowledge of the work. (Anyone who's seen or read JAWS would recognize the story.) A psychologically scarred and physically mutilated man, Ahab, the captain of the Pequod, is obsessed with exacting retribution against the highly dangerous white whale that made him a cripple, not to mention killing many other men. His loyal first mate, Starbuck, tries to reason with him, but Ahab is unable to respond to reason; Ahab feels that he is acting out a preordained role.MOBY-DICK, which was first published in 1851, is a surprisingly modern work. Melville explores the story using multiple perspectives and various literary devices, most notably inserting chapters written as scenes in a play. An example of this can be observed beginning with Chapter 36, \\"The Quarter-Deck\\": This is a seminal chapter in that in it Captain Ahab explains the Pequod's true mission--to kill Moby-Dick--and his personal motivation for doing it: \\"Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby-Dick that dismasted me...\\" Chapters 37-40, which are given sequential temporal titles (\\"Sunset,\\" \\"Dusk,\\" \\"First Night Watch,\\" \\"Midnight\\") provide reflections on Ahab's speech to the crew from the perspective of three of the main characters, Ahab, Starbuck and Stubb; these are followed by a chapter written like a script of a musical play and which involves a number of crewmen. There is, in short, considerable exploration of and experimentation in narrative forms.What I found particularly moving were the small, almost painterly touches in Melville's writing, such as the image of a hawk in the far distance dropping Ahab's hat into the sea (Chapter 130, \\"The Hat\\"). Also delighting the reader are the intensely cinematic moments, e.g., Starbuck, standing outside Ahab's door and full of angst, ponders murderous thoughts while handling a musket (Chapter 123 \\"The Musket\\"). MOBY-DICK is a fabulous piece of art and is veritable literature worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick by Hermann Melville is considered by many to be the greatest American novel ever written. To come up with such credentials is no meek achievement for a novel, that was floating in wilderness for the first sixty years of its existence. The 1851 novel was at best ignored by readers and critics alike, till in the beginning of twentieth century, D. H. Lawrence declared it to be \\"An epic of the sea such as no man has equalled.\\" Thereafter two critics, Carl Van Doren (1921) and F. O. Matthiessen (1941) managed to convince the generations that followed that Moby Dick was not only a great novel, but perhaps one of the greatest work of fiction ever written.My only intention to quote this history before I write my own review is to point out that this whale of a book comes with contexts and content that make it a remarkable study. If I were to judge the book with dead objectivity, I think I would have sided with the reception this book got in the first sixty years of existence. Now I am burdened by the biases created by people in the last hundred years. But in what follows, I will speak my mind, in spite of what impressionists, critics, symbolists and literary hoi-polloi might infer due to an imposing reputation that this novel has begun to acquire.Moby Dick is an encyclopedia on whaling. It is an almanac about how the products that can be extracted from the body of a whale. It is a tome that contains endless entries about ships, whaling, oil business and zoology of a whale. As an epic, which it is touted to be, it cannot light a candle to the epics of the ancients, say Homer or Ved Vyas. There is an obsessive Ahab, captain of the ship Pequod, whose only motive is to kill the white whale, Moby Dick. He sets out on the journey with a set of \\"barbarian\\" harpooners. The book presents the imperialistic (White Man's Burden) thoughts of the age in the portrayal of the non-white races. The ocean roars in the background and there are sharks that chase dead whales. The hunting of the whales is described without creating much sense of adventure. There are innumerable notebook entries about this or that.The story in itself can be told in a few lines, but Melville choses to take us on an endless journey. Every now and then interlocking ships converse to fill in the interminable sailing time. For all the diversions and digressions into the plethora of facts and rumors Melville manages to supply us with, I would have liked him to put little more effort into those celebrated elements of novel as a form of fiction: plot, characters, story, climax and drama. The characters are \\"flat\\", i.e. they don't get altered by experiences. If I would wish to read a fable, I will always prefer the ones by Aesop or the ones by Vishnu Sharma (Panchtantra).On the whole, Moby Dick is a readable book, for it does contain some remarkable passages. With some editing, it could have risen in my estimation, and fared better in the era before symbolists explained that what is presented is not as important, as what metaphors, what allusions, (what illusions) it can inspire. Since the book is sold as the battle between the whale and Captain Ahab, I must add that the face-off between these occurs only in the last thirty pages of a six hundred and fifty-five page version I read. The build-up to the battle begins so far into the novel, that by then most people would give up. By the end of it, the reader is as exhausted as maybe Melville was when he brought his epic struggle of writing this to an end.Surprisingly, while I did find that I had marked at least hundred pages as worth revisiting (and that in my typical estimation makes it an awesome novel), I was more disappointed than not, after finishing the novel. Even in translation, the Russians and the French find favor from me and I feel transformed after reading them. I prefer and prescribe Lawrence, Maugham, Hemingway, Nabokov, Victor Hugo, Virgina Woolf, Dickens, Joyce, Marquez, Tolstoy, Tagore, Dostovesky, Prem Chand, Pamuk, Gogol, Austen, Forster, Rushdie, and many more over Melville. Be it for entertainment, word play, historical or mythical content or for sheer imagery or all together, I will recommend at least a hundred novels that must enter your reading room before this Whale rams its way there."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Melville's Moby Dick tells the story of Captain Ahab and his unwaivering obsession with finding and slaying a gigantic white whale of almost mythical proportions. Throughout the story, the reader is emersed into life on board the whaling ship, the Pequod, told through the eyes of Ishmael.The story goes from Ishmael's befriending of Queequeg to their trip to Nantucket where they are hired for whaling on the Pequod. They eventually learn that Ahab's agenda runs further than the usual run of the mill whaling expedition; he wants to find and kill the great white whale, Moby Dick. In response, the crew of the Pequod are coaxed and almost hypnotized into joining his dangerous hunt for the reward of a gold coin. Will the crew and their driven captain succeed or will their own greed and stubbornness yield an unfortunate fate?In my opinion, the early and end chapters are the best part as well as Father Mapple's sermon. While the tone and setting established by Melville certainly pulls you into the world of whaling, the middle chapters are full of side stories, whale lectures, and transcedentalist self indulgence which grows a bit old after a while. There is even some racial intonation: characters such as Queequeg, Daggoo and Tashtego at times are subject to racial commentary by Ishmael (who at times can be mistaken for what I believe to be Melville writing through himself). But, wheher Melville is a racist is honestly neither here nor there.The book can be interpreted in alot of ways such as the tragic consequences of man's greed or the relationship to God and man and nature. In fact, everytime I ponder it, a new interpretation emerges. Perhaps, that is the book's real beauty.There is really no other book like it. Some chapters for instance are literally a sentence long. Others don't seem to end. Melville even changes his style from time to time within the book. I guess, in the end, you not only read it, but also experience the book for what it is. A memorable read which anyone who finishes it should be awarded a medal for. Save a part of this country's history and read it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Perhaps no other great book suffers to the degree that Melville's classic does from the tendency to abridge the Great Books for easy consumption by High School students. Sure, when you read it, in 10th grade or whenever, you get that essential tale of Ahab's monomaniacal pursuit of the White Whale, but you don't get much of the fascinating detail of the whaling industry nor much of the symbolism that makes the book one that rewards repeated readings.In fact, Melville's fiction is so densely packed with symbolism and allusions that it's sometimes hard to believe that he has any central message. This is particularly noticeable in the great short story Bartleby, the Scrivener. One finishes the story with no idea whatsoever why Bartleby has stopped working and given up on life, but the story is so open that you can give it any number of meanings and argue them all plausibly. Moby Dick is similarly amenable to many different interpretations. After initially being understood as a tale of the struggle against evil, it is now taken, mainly in the academy, to be an indictment of capitalism and industrialization.Personally, I like to think of it as a joyous answer to the dour Existentialists, with their insistence that life is meaningless drudgery. It is a curious thing that we should so admire men like Ahab, clearly grown demented in his pursuit of Moby Dick, or even a character like Don Quixote, whose immersion in the fiction of chivalry has obviously left him brain-addled. What is it we find so compelling in such figures ? I think it is their unalterable sense of purpose, however deranged. What after all is Existentialism but an expression of the desire that they too were guided by such a singular vision of the purpose of life ?We easily recognize that this is not the vow of a well man, but it's awfully hard not to get caught up in the passion, and the absolute conviction, that he evinces. To me it suggests that any man's life can be made heroic by his devotion to a noble purpose; though, as the tragedy that ensues makes clear, this devotion is best tempered by some sense of perspective.In the end, perhaps what Melville is best at isn't conveying a conventional moral or a message; perhaps what he does best is to tangle the reader up in the psychological mood of his central characters. Though the novel incorporates many classic themes--particularly the Biblical themes of crucifixion and resurrection and the great American theme of men fleeing the suffocation of civilization--it is truly unique. If you haven't read it since you were a teen, give it another try now; you'll be surprised at the complex and multi-layered tale you'll find in these pages."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This review is written for a young person who either has been assigned Moby Dick in school or simply has heard or read about it and thinks to read it.I want if I can to help convince you to read this work.Like all great works of literature it works on more than one level. In one way it is an adventure story about whaling .In another way it is an encyclopedia that will tell you more than you want to know about the whole business of whaling. In a third way it is a story of revenge of the main character Captain Ahab's desire to ' revenge himself upon a dumb creature' who in a previous voyage was responsible for the Captain's loss of his leg. In yet another way it is the story of the whole human race as Melville gives descriptions of a great variety of characters of different nations and races. It is still another way it is about the whole question of the meaning of the universe, a question which is really investigated in the subject of \\" The Whiteness of the Whale\\" It is yet another way it is the portrait of American society at a certain time of its development. It too is many other things, including a drama in which conflicting characters play out their own special roles. One of the major delights of Moby Dick is its language which is so rich and so filled with interesting metaphorical language .The book is very long and it has long boring stretches and at times you may wonder what has happened to the plot , and if there is any really. But in the end the great adventure story does come to a remarkable and in some ways enigmatic solution.It is a challenge to read Moby Dick as it is to read all great literature. But in taking on you will develop your own powers of understanding and observation. So I suggest you go with it all the way to the end. And once you have done that maybe ' War and Peace' is next."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Reading this book made me realise why such books are called classics. They survive time and all kinds of changes in the world because they are forever. The language style, the content is just awesome. It is like seeing a video on whaling in the olden times. Excellent book though it could be edited to take out portions that get too informative and lengthy. Otherwise a great reading experience."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I am in my sixties and had never read Moby Dick. When I finished, my friend said, Did Gregory Peck really get swept away by the whale? Shows you how some people think they know what a book was about by the movies or what they had read in a review. I had no idea that Melville was so funny, so ironic and it makes me want to investigate what else he wrote. I loved the first-hand experience of what it was like to be in a fragile little boat racing with sail and oar to stab a whale upon a heaving sea! The technology of whaling was every bit as intriguing as the tale of the mad Captain Ahab pursuing his nemesis. Was fun to research what we know today about whales and compare it with Melville's accounts."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"If two novels should be taken apart as the highest achievements of the 19th century American literature, I'd choose Moby-Dick and Twain's Huck Finn.Herman Melville's tale of the White whale and Captain Ahab is not just a great American novel, but one of the greatest novels of the whole World literature. Still, I would not recommend it to everybody, as it requires quite much from its reader - mostly patience, as it can be even quite tedious at times. But the same goes also with Russian great novelists, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoi. In the end, though, with this kind of literary giants, you get the feeling that you have just finished a great work of art.Considering that Moby-Dick was written over 150 years ago, it's astonishing to find out how Melville has understood and foreseen the mechanisms of the 20th century totalitarian societies. For that's what the ship Pequod, with its strictly organized hierarchy and the complete despotism of its lunatic leader, Captain Ahab, represents. Completely ignorant to the opinions and wellbeing of his crew, Ahab, with his obsession to kill the White whale, is destined to take everybody along with him to total destruction. And this is, of course, exactly what happened in the Europe some 90 years later.There are so many levels within the text of this novel that it's impossible to put it all here. You can read it for its beautiful, poetic language, for the symbolic meanings that Melville has embedded in the story, for its highly exciting and tense storyline, culminating in the final battle between the Whale and Ahab (minus the long chapters that Melville concentrates on telling of the facts of the whale-hunting business, which aren't so exciting...).Moby-Dick is definitely NOT a book for you, if you like light and easily digestible prose. But if you want some heavy literary stuff of the highest class, you may try it out. Like all the greatest art, Moby-Dick is a work of a genius mind. As such it's a rare treat, even more so in today's consumer-like literature business."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is much more than a novel about a whale hunt; ultimately, like the mysterious designs on Queequeg's body, it becomes \\"a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth\\" since, as D. H. Lawrence suggested, its hero Ahab represents \\"the human soul seeking the last self-conquest, the last attainment of extended consciousness - infinite consciousness.\\"If you'd like to understand why - in depicting the gigantic struggles of Ahab to break out of the prison of duality, the prison of self or ego, and reach the ultimate truth of our existence - Moby Dick becomes what may well be considered \\"The World's Greatest Spiritual Classic\\", check out Jed McKenna'sSpiritually Incorrect Enlightenment, a book that devotes 9 of its 32 Chapters to a striking analysis of Moby Dick that brings out more fully, especially in its discussion of 'The Break-Out Archetype', what D. H. Lawrence meant.McKenna sees Ahab as a man driven, despite himself, to engage in a gigantic struggle to break free of the bonds of ego and reach ultimate truth. Of the numerous interpretations of Ahab's heroic quest for the White Whale, McKenna's seems to me to be the most convincing of all.As for the present handsome and wonderfully readable University of California Press 1983 paperback reprint (ISBN 9780520045484) of the famous Arion Press edition, it offers a beautifully printed text on excellent paper with generous margins and with 100 interesting wood engravings by Barry Moser of places, sea-creatures, whaleboats, and the processes, implements and tools of 19th-century whaling life. As such, it becomes a book for those who want to enjoy an uninterrupted experience of the text without being distracted by notes.

Anthony Heald has an archaic-sounding voice, which suits the material well, and his general tone of conscious intellectual superiority leavened by self-deprecating lampoonery is also appropriate.Two minor caveats: after establishing two distinct voices for Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad, Heald mixes the two up at one stage; and the sound is foggy and a bit indistinct."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It's Moby Dick. How are you going to start a review of this book? \\"Despite being a recognized classic for more than 150 years, I don't like Moby Dick because...\\" :)Actually, it is the version of the book that I am recommending. This one comes with the classic Rockwell Kent woodcuts for the book. These beautiful images just add a certain touch that make it that much more of a delight to read. Do yourself a favor and spend a few bucks to get the hardcover with these images. This is one of the indispensable books for any good home library and, while I love my Kindle too, I'm old enough that holding a thick chunk of a book brings a real satisfaction that the Kindle can't just quite capture."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I just finished Herman Melville's Moby-Dick yesterday. I read the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, which I found to be fine and had no complaint.As far as the work itself goes, I think it is most adequately summed up by a passage from Roberto Bolano's 2666, which I read over the summer and which inspired me to read Moby-Dick:\\"Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.\\"This truly encapsulates the experience of reading Moby-Dick. It is not at all what you will have expected, neither the linear whaling narrative nor the reductive \\"pursuit of the white whale\\" allegory of which you have always been told. Its excellence is far more in how different it is from other works, and in the continual meditation that it inspires on whatever it might have been that Melville's true goal was. Bolano is right, and the reader can truly see Melville struggling with something, which puts in place that rare feeling one gets when the author becomes a vehicle for a message that is not his own, but grander than he is.The narrative starts off in a straightforward manner, and lasts as such for the first 100-150 pages, at which point 5-25 page asides concerning the inner workings of the whaling industry begin to punctuate the story. Many readers consider these passages to be boring, frustrating, and beside the point, which at times they are. However, they offer to the inquisitive reader an easy opportunity for a fascinating long at an otherwise foreign and uncontemplated subject, especially in today's world. These passages can be viewed, on one hand, as simply moments of learning, in which the old adage that everything one must know can be found in literature still rings true.On the other hand, these passages also inspire that feeling that made films like There Will Be Blood great, and I think that any man today will feel a nostalgia for the time when physical frontiers really existed, and men abandoned civilization for that same pursuit of something dangerous and grander than themselves. So the book evokes that notion on two levels, which is part of what helps to create a veritable world into which the reader can step and, for a couple weeks, feel that he too is a strong armed member of the whaling industry.This book is, like Bolano says, a struggle against something dangerous, and the reader feels that throughout the entire, boding work, even if they might never find exactly what that something is. Don't be too quick to buy into the psychological interpretations of the book, for they are relevant but, in the end, i think severely underwhelming. The greatness of this book is not in the message, but in the body of it itself, and the way in which it must have been written."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It really is an amazing novel. True, it takes time, dedication, and a vast vocabulary to read it. However, it is funny, touching, engaging, and insightful. A groundbreaking work of fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Herman Melville, the author, shares many witty and serious insights about life and the foibles of human actions and beliefs in Moby Dick. It is not just about whaling, but a commentary in general about humanity. The description of whaling processes give the reader an insight into not only the methods of whaling, but the cruelty and savagery of killing such beautiful creatures. Even a person such as myself, who is against any whaling in this day and age, can appreciate Melville's commentary about whales, their personalities, their rights as fellow creatures to live on this planet!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"What can you say? It's Moby-Dick. The Barnes and Noble edition of Moby-Dick comes with a handy dictionary for all of us landlubbers and Carl F. Howde's footnotes flesh-out the Melville's esoteric references."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is THE edition of Moby Dick to buy, if you have to buy just one. The type is large enough to read (unlike some other Modern Library volumes), the binding is sound, it's small enough to take anywhere but looks good on any shelf, and it contains original illustrations by Rockwell Kent. This is a REAL bargin for the price. This book will last you a few generations, unlike those disposable paperback versions with dense introductions by academics looking to pad their resume. This is the way an American masterpiece should be treated. This is as good as American literature gets, and this volume does it justice."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"In the first two pages of getting to know the Pequod, the description has circled the world, with references to (in order) France, Egypt, Siberia, Japan, Germany, England, Iceland, Ethiopia, Cannibals, Tartar, and the New World. Like the crew that the Pequod carries, the ship itself comes from all around the world, like the composition of the American demographic.This description leads to the \\"ship as state\\" of \\"ship as society\\" metaphor. If Melville did have the metaphor in mind, that makes the name Pequod even more interesting. He gives the name of a Native American tribe to the ship. By putting the white men, Ahab, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask in charge of the ship, the whites have taken control of a ship that really doesn't belong to them. Also interesting, the grizzled ship, aged \\"more than half a century,\\" (67) is the same age of America as a nation when Melville wrote Moby Dick in 1850. Using the ship of state metaphor, the destruction of the Pequod would mean that the state destroys itself by its own ambitions and values. The implication is the self-willed extinction of the state. Like Starbuck, even if the destruction is obvious, men will not mutiny against the likes of Ahab or Captain Mason. Starbuck struggles but ultimately follows: \\"I think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it\\" (148). The leaders are too powerful to stop. Even with awareness, the dutiful state will sail on to destruction. This image of destruction appears again in Chapter 96:\\"Then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul\\" (354).This passage conjures the image of a ferry descending into hell. The \\"rushing\\" Pequod seems to plummet instead of sail. \\"Freighted\\" gives weight to the ship. All hands on board get bundled into one word, \\"savages,\\" as if the ship has a bill-of-lading or manifest for when it arrives at its destination. Like a fireball or meteor, the ship is \\"laden with fire.\\" The devilish activity of \\"burning a corpse\\" reinforces the notion of savagery. The ship rushes and \\"plunges\\" into darkness, with dark being associated with the unknown or unholy. The last part of the passage contrasts well, as Ishmael compares this damnable ship to Ahab's soul. As counterpart to his \\"soul,\\" the savages relishing in fire, death, and darkness, seem to move toward destruction.Melville uses a complex metaphor in this passage. He foreshadows the ultimate demise of the ship, but also creates an image reminiscent of the Pequot War, particularly the burning of the Pequot Indian fort. Captain Mason reveled in the terror of the burning corpses. Hell, Ahab, industry, and darkness writhe together like an unstoppable juggernaut toward doom. Also, the fact that \\"savages\\" carry out Ahab's madness shows that the Pequod, perhaps like America, requires mad workers to perform the mad will of leadership.The passage on the \\"rushing Pequod\\" comes from a chapter that focuses on fire and industry. Chapter 96, \\"The Try-Works,\\" reeks throughout with burning whale flesh, and this passage climaxes with comparing the harvesting of the whale with the madness of the commander. As a captain of the whaling industry, the intangible \\"monomania\\" of Ahab's pursuit for greatness gets compared to what the workers consider a normal day's labor. This could be read as part of the national allegory in Moby Dick, because a leader can order men to whatever ends he pleases. Collectively, the workers enjoy a kind of frenzied monomania, and will carelessly work toward self-destruction while losing themselves in the joys of labor and camaraderie. The fiery ship plummets and rages with such zest that the thrill of the hunt and the kill seems to unite the tribe of men on board beyond any notion of forced duty.When Melville decided on the name \\"Pequod,\\" he might have intended to create an epic name for a significant event in Western civilization, as the Pequot War has the unfortunate distinction of being the earliest Indian massacre on the mainland. Also, Melville spends a chapter predicting the extinction of whales. Chapter 105 is titled, \\"Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish? Will he Perish?\\" Ishmael frets while \\"comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies\\" (383). He adds morosely, \\"the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.\\"The word Pequod drags with it the millstone of colonialism and the history of violence in early America. In Chapter 24, while defending whaling as an honorable trade, Ishmael says: \\"Whaling not respectable? Whaling is Imperial!\\" (Melville 101). Here we can see the difference between the word empire in 1850 compared to today. Ishmael touts whaling as the scout of Western civilization. The whaleship \\"cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations\\" (100). With the Pequot War being one of the first brutal Indian removals, the progress of America and the cultural monomania of Manifest Destiny gets projected onto the ship."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Most readers of Moby Dick seem to praise it for the wrong reasons and some miss the boat completely.Criticize all you want of Melville's scientific inaccuracy, wandering themes, or even his improper punctuation. The guy wrote this thing in a year - not enough time to refine it, and it was a book he knew would not sell.Underneath a mess of useless whaling information and Ishmael's rambling are ideas and questions that most people don't dare think about. Unlike Charles Darwin, Galileo or the fearless Ahab, Melville hid safely behind his metaphors and guided the careful readers to draw their own conclusions without completely leading the way.Let me explain.While to Ishmael, Moby Dick is nature's wonder and to Starbuck is just a whale, to Ahab Moby Dick is God, with his infinite power.There are some disturbing things in the universe begging for an explaination, such as why one person is rewarded with happyness while another punished in suffering. There are feel-good answers, like the idea that the score will be evened in the afterlife and there are humble answers, like the book of Job, which suggests that man has no right to complain or question God. Melville's Ahab takes this to another level when he asks why man needs to be God's puppets. Ahab is insulted by God's creation of man, letting man live in suffering, &quot;with half a heart and half a lung&quot;.The bewildered God-fearing masses will not comprehend the depth Melville trys to take them. This most important theme was written for the pursuit of truth, not happyness. This book is not for everyone, and a lot of chapters are better off skipped, but those with enough empathy for Melville will find an emotional and intellectual adventure."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"i'm only 120 pages into this, but totally capitvated. my question is this- how could someone create this immense work at a mere 31 years of age?melville's use of language is initally a bit jarring, but once you get into the rythmn of things, it soars like poetry.structurally moby dick is easy to digest. yes there are almost 140 chapters, but they are mostly short and largely self-contained.crammed with... well everything, moby dick is a staggering work of imagination, intellect and insight."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Reading Moby Dick for the first time should make us realize that English is a real language, and not just a verbal substitute for flag-signals. I know how this must sound for an English speaker - no offence intended. People with a bilingual upbringing, with Russian, German, Spanish, French at the side, know what I mean. It is the gift the mono-lingual is taking for granted. Multilingual people probably can never grasp what it means to completely saturate your temperament and persona in the verbal magic of linguistic perceptions. But they may have traded it for a heightened awareness of the complexity of linguistic interfacing with our world and our ideas.Even people who introduce themselves as professional writers sometimes complain of what they perceive as Melvilles cloying style, especially in the chapter on the Whales whiteness. But there is a lot more in it than &Ograve;that, although white is frequently considered a good color, in the case of Moby Dick, it is a bad one, because instead of being reminiscent of purity, it is reminiscent of spectrality on no less than seven and a half pages, including a 469 word sentence.&Oacute; With all due respect, if cut and dry &Ograve;message&Oacute; is all there is to imaginative literature, than it would not be worth bothering about. Forget the lengthy reflections, forget about plot interest, the Anglo-Saxon readers favorite obsession, even leave the character cast alone, they are weirdos anyway, every single one of them - Moby Dick is not the kind of book where these things matter.Instead focus on the intensity of a dream. Accept the exotic symbols of an alien world, as alien as the Planet &Ograve;Shakespeare.&Oacute; Accept the warped logic of a nightmare. Yet this is not likely how the product of an American high school education is to receive Melvilles gift to his nation. Not before somebody points out the similarities between Melville and Kafka. For such reader, literature hasnt moved an inch since the Vikings had landed at the shores of Newfoundland. But should you feel ready to commit yourselves to Rabelais, then you are ready for Melville, because you have reached the point where opinions are no longer taken seriously. Only the mentally adolescent is opinionated, and literally billions of adolescents crawl this plants surface, like lice on a bald midget. Opinions are cheap, everybody can share from his haversack.However there are things even I rather not see in a book of this nature. Sensitivity, style, rhythm and visualizations are the meat of a poem, great ideas are hogwash. Moby Dick is a prose poem, not an investigative report on the whaling industry. But Melville does not always exactly know where he is going. We know from his letters and messages to Nathaniel Hawthorn, that at times this book had carried away the author. Automatic writing is not exactly my cup of tea, and I suspect, Melvilles absolutely stunning stylistic abilities, cover up a lot of this sort of thing, and I am troubled by Melvilles archaisms. It can be as irritating as in Kiplings &Ograve;Kim.&Oacute; I just cant see people talk like that, at least not people of that period. As a biblical flourish, this kind of rhetorics is just preposterous.So what is going on here? An Einsteinian time dilation between (former) colonials and motherland? Or a case of Shakespearean intoxication? And yet who fails to be charmed by: &Ograve;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled;&Oacute; (task: design at least two or three alternative and complete cosmologies to fit this sentence) or: &Ograve;All wars are boyish and are fought by boys, the champions and enthusiasts of the state;&Oacute; or the almost Virgilian &Ograve;Charmed circle of everlasting December&Oacute; that continues to &Ograve;going through young lifes old routine again;&Oacute; and notices that &Ograve;... on the heel of all this ... a cluster of dark nods replied&Oacute; to &Ograve;bisons with clouds of thunder on his scowling brow&Oacute; - if that can leave you untouched, go shoot yourself.If an entire universe can be captured between two book-covers, this is it. A fairy tale, cruel, heroic on the verge of the burlesque, full of hidden gateways to a different matrix in the configuration of things. The whale hunt and Ahabs hunt for revenge are really the least interesting aspects in this book. But of course one has to know where to look, and I am afraid few are prepared for such examination of the unexpected. Melville was not the type of writer who speaks in bumper stickers nor did he spew fortune cookies (apparently the language of democracy these days.) This accomplishment he left to giggle-peppered sitcoms and squeal-fests with a sprinkle of - whats the word? - &Ograve;spirituality,&Oacute; such as Oprahs show.Oh, and &Ograve;Call me Ishmael&Oacute; is the most perfect opening sentence of any novel. Nothing ever has surpassed it. Melville gave us the bible of symbolism, but when we try deciphering, we find ourselves confounded by tantalizing signals from deep space - sometimes garbled but always of an overwhelming beauty. This is the word BEFORE the beginning, and before it became flesh."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"If you care at all about this vital novel, don't purchase the audiocassette version of Moby Dick read by Burt Reynolds. I could hardly bear it after listening to the first tape. Reynolds' accents--often what come across as drunken rants--are sometimes impossible to understand, and he makes Ishmael sound like a silly old salt o' the sea. A great work brought low."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"There certainly seems to be a strong polarity on this page about whether this book is or is not deserving of its legendary status. Both sides have strong points to consider. If you watch MTV on a steady basis and think that Shakespeare guy was a dull card, don't even bother. If you are delving into the realm of classics and want a good challenge, this might be the place to start. But then again...Ignored or scorned upon its release in 1851, Moby Dick didn't achieve fame until the mid 1920's when professional writers and scholars 'rediscovered' the book and, impressed by the sheer volume of ideas and symbolism, gradually forced this monstrous text into the popular consciousness. Who doesn't recognize the words Moby Dick or Cap'n Ahab? -- though I'm sure the familiarity comes from watching one or two of the numerous movies based from the bare-bones plot rather than actually sitting down for a good breeze through Melville's incredibly convoluted prose. No one that I know of *really* reads a book like this for enjoyment; it's the academic masochist's delight, the forging ground of literature. If you can endure this, Faulkner and Dickens et al are cake in comparison.Well, OK, Moby Dick is not entirely without merit: several passages are extraordinary in design and achievement, notably 'The Whiteness of the Whale,' 'The Pacific,' and a few other random gleams of astonishing prose &amp; profundity. But then there are the endless days at sea described all too well. And the insomnia-curing Cetology section. And the character ambiguities and obscure symbols and layered subtexts all drained of power by a turgid style and a general inability to get to the point. Seriously folks, I'm an avid reader who averages 10-12 books a month...Moby Dick took me five months to slog through.This isn't quite as unfathomable as, say, the last works of James Joyce-most everything here is understandable. But, as has been proven time and time again, intelligent writing is not necessarily great, or even good, writing. To be blunt, Moby Dick is overwhelmingly boring, a self-indulgent mess.Is it worth it? If you are simply interested in the story, that of a man driven to insane lengths by an unfulfilled passion, go rent one of the movies. If you are interested in learning about human existence, I could recommend a thousand other classics to start with. If you love whales, I mean if you are _endlessly fascinated_ by the mysteries of the abysses and its myriad denizens, go ahead and give Moby Dick a try. If nothing else, finishing it is certainly an accomplishment to be proud of."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The recent television film of MOBY DICK has fired an interest in Melville's classic, and that is a good thing.The unfortunate reality is that the book itself is a mixed bag.Never Melville's most &quot;popular&quot; work in terms of sales, MOBY DICK or THE WHALE is now his most famous, a reputation based upon (at least in part) John Huston's classic film version...AND the Patrick Stewart remake. Distilled from the novel in both versions is the exciting story of Ahab, maimed by the infamous White Whale, and bent on revenge.Readers coming to the book after seeing the film(s) are often disappointed by the fact that this story is almost incidental, buried amidst chapter after chapter of whaling minutia, outdated science, fractured drama, and long-winded philosophy. Fully three-fourths of the book is over before the actual story REALLY begins. And the titular whale himself, for all his fame, has something less than a cameo appearance.And yet, Melville's detailed descriptions--even in the most painstaking recreations of sailing life--are often quite beautiful and allegorical, though tedious. The fact that they stop the story dead for chapters at a time is sure to annoy the modern reader.In short, MOBY DICK is an &quot;important&quot; book that should be read, but the parts are far more interesting than the whole."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book, quite simply, is the greatest American novel ever written, and a contender for the greatest novel ever written. I defy anyone to read just the first chapter \\"Loomings\\" and not be caught up with the book's incredibly profound meaning, which is already evident there in the first 3 pages. Truly a masterpiece and worth every bit of fame it has."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"'Call me Ishmael' - thus begins a novel that the author describes thus: 'It is the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it.' Perhaps the first sentence is better known than the novel, perhaps not, but either way, Moby Dick is a sprawling epic on life in the 19th century, whaling, religion, good and evil, and more.The story is familiar to even those who have never read it: The whaling ship, the Pequod, led by the obsessed, monomaniac Captain Ahab, are searching for the Great White Whale over the oceans of the world, in part to avenge the loss of one of Ahab's limbs, but also because some other force drives the Captain, a dark force to his mates, but to him, the obsession that pushes him to chase the whale over half the world is nothing short of divine.The novel is broken into three rough sections. The first introduces us to Ishmael, and for the first hundred pages or so, we are firmly ensconced within his head, seeing what he sees, doing what he does. We meet Queequeg and board the Pequod, and for a time, all is calm, serene. The second section - called boring by many - focuses on the day-in day-out life of a whaling ship, with lengthy discourses on whales, how to kill them, the spermecetti that they produce, etc. In this day and age, with whaling illegal in most places - and even if it wasn't, the call for sperm oil has markedly decreased with the discovery of crude oil - the essays (as essays they are) on the facets of whaling life were interesting, if only because it is a life that neither you nor I will probably ever experience first hand.The third section, the final hundred pages or so, is the final climactic struggle with the whale. Moby Dick himself does not actually appear until the last forty pages, but he hovers like a spectre throughout the entirety of the book, always there, present, waiting. For the more aware crew he is a shade over their heads, a folly they cannot understand. For the pagans on the ship, the whale is an adventure, a rollicking good time that could very well net them the gold doubloon Ahab has nailed to the main mast. But for the captain, it is an obsession that overshadows all else, often to the exclusion of another man's life. The final section of the book in punctuated with lengthy monologues from Ahab, detailed, insane ramblings of a man who believes that his ever action is foredained, that the clash between the whale and his harpoon has been decided a 'billion years ago'.An interesting writing technique that Melville uses is having Ishmael slowly disappear over the course of the novel. At the start, he acts and reacts to events, speaks to people, visits places, but once the whaling begins, he assumes the task of learned scholar imparting his wisdom, lecturing on the ins and out of whales. By the time the hunt really begins, Ishmael hasn't been mentioned in hundreds of pages, becoming more of an omniscient narrator than a whaler on board the Pequod.Many, many biblical and historical references are littered throughout the book. Many things have obvious symbolism, and with a greater knowledge of the Bible, I wouldn't be surprised if I would've picked up on more. At times, Ishmael will discuss the impact of whaling, the virtues of good and evil, the horrors of the colour white, and more; this is no simple book about a man chasing a whale. It has staggering depths and dizzying highs, and while only a very few characters have been fully fleshed out - though I dare say Ahab is one of the better characters I have read in recent memory - the book transcends a mere ship adventure, instead trying to - and in some ways, succeeding - encompass the entirety of morality and logic. Tremendous."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I read this many, many years ago in school, and tried to get into it again but couldn't.

I like this book very much. I enjoyed reading it. This book is written using the 1st person point of view. It's like reading someone's journal.

You have to think about it and even maybe you have to learn them carefully.This book I recommend to everyone to read because I think this book is suitable for youngsters and also for adults. For those youngsters, you guys have to be patient during the reading because this book is somewhat heavy for us.

All other symbolic books or classics are held up to Moby Dick and normaly receive an unflattering comparison. Hearing all this wonderful dogma, I went out to read Herman Melville's MOBY DICK. I found it dry and inconsistent.Moby Dick is a sea-faring tale by an author who adamently denied any symbolic inflection whatsoever in his book. I found it very jumpy, whereas Ishmael would divulge his thoughts on many and varied subjects such as the nature of whales. Suddenly, you find yourself a month ahead of where you thought you were. The insigts on Ahab are masterful, however, as well as the symbolism. (Melville would kill us all.) That is the only thing that saves this book.If you will take some advice from a fellow bibliophile, don't bother to read this &quot;book to end all books.&quot; It's not worth your time."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A group of diverse men risk life and limb and are required to commit morally suspicious acts to provide for society's energy needs.Sure, this work is a classic for a number of reasons, but I don't have the credentials to speak to that. I do however find the parallel between whaling and our current energy situation to be poignant. Slaughtering a species to near extinction for candle oil was only a precursor to pumping the world dry of crude oil.Also, while Ahab's war on Moby-Dick and George W. Bush's against Saddam Hussein don't line up perfectly, one clear message from this novel is that unilateral decisions based on vengeance usually don't work out so well.I'm taking a star way for that whole middle section with the blubber.

Ah, Melville, that great artist who aimed so high and found his mark with this awesome tale of the seas. Sure, it's an adventure tale, filled with action, danger, mystery, but strip all of that away and what do you have? MAN striving to get GOD to acknowledge HIM. Ahab(man), crazed by the injury caused by the Whale(God), his whole life reduced to the manic pursuit of that which eludes him. What a stirring metaphor. What a grand, operatic, messy, sometimes-overwritten, yet never boring novel. Great works are not perfect. Their very imperfection renders them great, for in the attempt at the sublime, the metaphysical, the ALL, they achieve an awe that stills the soul. And in the end, we have Ahab, glorious Ahab, unbowed, enraged, shouting his impotent rage at the Whale, as his life is swallowed away. Who's listening? Who's there, but the solitary narrator to witness the cataclysmic waste of it all? It's a difficult book. It's a slow book. It's a book that builds towards its climax with a stolidity that implies overwhelming confidence. But it rewards unlike any other book in American history. It's a matter of degrees, of first among equals, between this and LIGHT IN AUGUST, but MOBY DICK is the greatest American Novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"the modern library classics version is far superior !!!! for the amazing illustrations by rockwell kent truly enhance the experience (as does the font size and spacing)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"&quot;Call me Ishmael. Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world...&quot;Captain Ahab is among literature's most tragic figures--the peg-legged whaler who forever bears the physical and psychological scars of his first encounter with nature's leviathan, Moby Dick. These elements are amply present in themes exploring man's battle against nature (and fellow man), the self-destructiveness of hatred, the bounds of loyalty, commitment to family and the need to revere God. The richness of Melville's prose pours out like thick cream from an iron pitcher. Haunting phrases and word-painted, wild scenes are mixed with weird images and symbolic poetry. In that wild, beautiful romance, Melville seems to have spoken the very secret of the sea, and to have drawn into his tale all the magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters. It stands quite alone; it strikes a note no other sea writer has ever struck.

Like many people who tackled it with an open mind, I loved it. But the first time reader who approaches it without warning will often abandon ship before they get very far on the voyage. Its easy for readers of modern fiction to make the relativily easy transition to the 19th Century literature of Mark Twain or Charles Dickens, but woe unto them who are unprepared to navigate the rocks and shoals of Melville's oceans! To appreciate Moby-Dick you must love the English language with a passion, for no other book demostrates better what can be done with it. Moby-Dick contains an ocean of ideas, many of them so subtle you won't see them on a first time reading. So, plan you voyage carefully, or else you might get stove in by Melville's whale and abandon the hunt for truth and beauty far too early."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This a challenging read, but with film, audio and interpretive editions there are an embarrassment of riches that make it a lot easier. Here is the strategy I followed: 1) As background readingIn the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex(2000) recounts the real-life story that inspired Melville to write \\"Moby-Dick\\", and gives a good background on Nantucket and the whaling industry. It provides needed historical context for the modern reader, it was after reading this that I was inspired to read \\"Moby-Dick\\". 2) The2005 audiobook version narrated by William Hootkins(25 hours unabridged; also on audible dot com for much less) - Hootkins should win an Oscar for his performance. I'm an audiobook junkie but this is one of if not the best audiobook performance I've heard, his reading is perfect for the book. I never would have picked up the amount of humor, satire and sheer emotion without his professional interpretive skills, every character sounds different. 3) Read along the audiobook version with theNorton Critical Edition(2002), which contains plentiful explanatory footnotes and other material such as contemporary reviews, pictures, maps, criticisms, etc.. 4) See the1956 John Houston movie. It's 90-minutes and is a spoiler (save it for last); the sets, acting, costumes, accents all bring it alive in glorious Technicolor, the film is a classic in its own right. For example Pip and the tambourine seems incongruous in the book but makes sense in the film, and the preachers pulpit visualized with Orson Wells delivering \\"The Sermon\\" is as good as it gets.The novel is written in the Romanticism tradition (cf. Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, \\"Les Miserables\\") and the language is full of symbolism and subtle layers of meaning. Yet, strangely, Melville turned this emotional, poetic style to a near documentary treatment of what is otherwise a fairly dry subject in minute detail. It's like writing poetry about the details of the nuclear power industry from backhoes to graphite rods to cooling ponds. Yet somehow it worked, the immersion is so complete, the details so real and \\"true of the thing\\" (Melville) that the main storyline becomes all that much more credible and powerful. The story its self is not that complex or even original (it's based on a Shakespeare tragedy) but the symbolic depth of the language, truthfulness of the details, and mythological power of the characters (Moby Dick and Ahab in particular) combine to make this \\"strange sort of a book\\" (Melville) a canonical work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Readers say it's far too long, the cetacean history is tedious, who the heck cares how to best prep a harpoon line? Well if you're one of those folks who likes a good harpoon-prep scene, you're in for a treat. If not, you might learn something, and, failing that, the singular dexterity with which the author lays the words on the page will not only awe you but carry you into the very whale boat. You will feel in your guts the rush of the sleigh ride, you will breathe the sea air and taste the mist, you will feel the salt hardening on your hands and face. Don't like any of that? Unless there's no place you'd rather be than your rocker, this is escapism as good as it comes. And don't even get me started on timeless themes, unforgettable characters and a plot as fine as they come...."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Beginning with the narrator's famous humble request to be known only as Ishmael, and ending with his life being saved ironically by the buoyancy of an empty sealed coffin, &quot;Moby Dick&quot; introduces its reader to a world of monstrous proportions, both literally and figuratively. Its subject is whaling, of course, but its theme is the much broader topic of man's motivation to do desperate and destructive things.Ishmael is a seasoned sailor who decides to try whaling, so he goes to Nantucket Island with a companion, the noble savage Queequeg, to look for work on a suitable whaling ship. They end up on the Pequod, which is captained by a badly scarred old salt named Ahab. Ahab has one obsession: to find and kill Moby Dick, the legendary great white whale that bit off his leg in a vicious melee.The 135 chapters of this novel are divided between narrations of the Pequod's whaling voyages throughout the world and technical discussions of cetology. Ishmael tells you everything you wanted or needed to know about whales and a lot more -- skin, bones, jaws, eyes, spout, tail; swimming, feeding, breathing, mating, nursing; the hunt, the harpooning, the towing, the uses of the whale carcass and its oil -- every conceivable aspect of whale culture is covered, until you start to feel that the book itself is somewhat of a whale. However, these extensive lectures are necessary in order to lull the reader under the book's spell; Ahab's hunt for Moby Dick wouldn't mean anything unless you felt like you were part of the crew.Ahab's fixation with the great white whale can only be described as monomaniacal, as Ishmael refers to him many times. For much of the story, Ahab remains in the shadows, silently nursing his hatred and anger. There is always a creepy foreshadowing of impending doom, that he will stop at nothing, not even the death of his crew and himself, to achieve his bloodthirsty goal. The Pequod encounters several other whaling ships, and on each one he feverishly inquires of the captain whether Moby Dick has been spotted. At the end, he finally does get the chance to meet his natatorial nemesis, and his fate is an example of what can happen when a man lets himself be consumed by his hatred.&quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a classic because it has a haunting insularity -- it seems to exist alone in a world of its own creation, one that no other novel is able to penetrate, although many have tried. Consider the originality of its characterization: Its titular antagonist is a silent, elusive demon, and its protagonist (Ahab) is a bitter wretch, someone we don't ever want to be even though we all have felt his level of anger at some time. In the world today, there are plenty of Ahabs chasing great white whales; those who are innocently trapped in the middle, like the crew of the Pequod, are often the ones who suffer the consequences."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I've read Moby Dick twice. The first time, no one forced me to, I just picked it up and read it [I was in eighth grade]. I hated it! It was one of the most aggravatingly tedious books I'd ever read. I didn't have anything good to say about Melville after that. I was required to reread it as a senior in high school, and then I began to understand my earlier frustration. Melville tells an excellent compelling story which draws the reader in. He also, however, gives an in depth description of every obscure detail of whaling. So, while the first 70 pages or so are interesting and even amusing to most readers [Fr. Mapple's sermon, Ismael's befriending of Queequeg] once the voyage gets underway, Ishmael drops out of the story, and the story itself is continually abandoned in favor of a description of the finer details of turning blubber into oil. But most aggravating of all was the fact that nothing was seen of Moby Dick for the first 500 pages. While this is supposedly building suspense, and preparing the reader for the predictable, but unexpeccted ending, it can be nerve-wracking at times. If I weren't so interested in the story, I wouldn't have minded. Basically, Melville is a brilliant story teller, but reading the whaling scenes in Moby Dick is like reading the lists of fish seen in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I do think the story is worth reading, though. So, if anyone can tolerate three chapters of &quot;whales in art&quot;, then, well, they willl be rewarded by 25 pages of wonderful action and suspense in the end. Whether this is worth the time or commitment, I leave to the reader. There is much more in the book than the movie, but essentially all the action has been carried over into the movie w/ Patrick Stewart as Ahab. Nevertheless, the book is still, strangely better. No one should ever be forced to read Moby Dick. Most people hate books they are forced to read and it's easy enough to hate Moby Dick w/o that. If you are interested, try it, and remember that the story really picks up on page 500. Also, the themes are very interesting, adn some scenes, such as Starbuck's debate w/ himself over his duty to dispose of Ahab, and some of Stubb's monologues are very memorable. I don't like reading abriged versions of anything [except Princess Bride]. Some people consider this book a classic, for the content and the poetry, but I completely sympathize w/ those who have difficulty wading through the volume of unrelated matter, such as why whales are fish, not mammals."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It looks as if the free Kindle version of Moby Dick has been improved. Earlier reviewers remarked that the free version lacked a working table of contents, and/or the etymological extracts about whales prefacing the text. Also, Fr. Mapples' sermon passage was reported to be missing from Ch. 9.Thanks to the Project Gutenberg volunteers, for as of when I uploaded this six weeks ago, the text looks intact. Of course, without footnotes being a public domain text, this will remain daunting to newcomers. Melville's range of references and his style may not please today's impatient readers. I recommend using a free version in tandem with a volume with more guidance, such as the Norton Critical Edition.Still, it's convenient to have this to dip into and search within on a Kindle platform, gratis. I had to read this in college and grad school, but I found myself returning to it for the pleasure of it a while ago. Now I am also starting \\"Redburn,\\" one of his now overlooked, but more accessible, earlier tales. That free text was not directly downloadable via the Amazon link when I tried, but go to gutenberg-dot-org and you can find that file easily transferable for a Kindle device. So are all of his stories and his novels, so enjoy the easy search for your seabound quest."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"What a completely weird book this is. Moby Dick seems like it could have easily have been just a conventional sea-faring adventure, it's full of really cool set pieces and (surprisingly to me) a really keen sense of humor. It can be a very boisterous book, which is good because when it isn't it kind of scared the crap out of me. Melville is just so fixated by whales, by their size (huge), their behavior (impenetrable), and by the arcane, terrifyingly violent history that humanity has foisted on them (We boil their bodies down into oil. OIL.). He's able to weave this bizarre, pseudo-mystical rumination around them that reinforces the narrative and at the same time gives it an inscrutable, portentous sense of menace. The two main aspects at work in Moby Dick slowly bleed into each other, so that by the end the human beings are trapped in a... what exactly? A Trajectory? A Plateau? A Downward Spiral? At any rate, some kind of primordial doomed place. And the whales, the sharks, the ocean, hell, even the seagulls, just sort of become something else, lurking and attacking out of some other creepy aesthetic/naturalist dimension that might be totally sybmolic or might be totally real, or might be both. Or neither. I wonder if H.P. Lovecraft had this in mind when he wrote some of his tales. Because the weird, metaphysical terror vibe you sometimes get from his stuff is out in full force all over this book. Forget the Great American Novel. Moby Dick is the Great American Freak-out."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Call me Horseman. Some years ago I took a job managing a group of editors at a corporation. In order to make a point and to check out my qualifications to manage him, half seriously - half jokingly, one of these individuals asked whether I had ever read MOBY DICK by Herman Melville. Surprised by the question and what it had to do with my qualifications, I forthrightly answered in the negative. Very quickly the editor said, \\"Well, get back to me when you have and we'll talk.\\" I went out that very day, bought the book and discovered what I have come to believe is, arguably, the greatest novel ever written. I just completed another reading of this wonderful book and found it as intriguing and enchanting as ever.But what is so great about a book about whales? Aren't some of Melville's statements and observations dead wrong according to modern whale experts?Doesn't it drag on and on in boring writing that has no appeal today?Remember that most of us usually encounter MOBY DICK as students in high school or early in college. As such it's difficult to remain truly objective in our views. The major mistake that most readers of MOBY DICK make is looking at the book as some sort of a scientific or zoological treatise on whales. Yes, Melville based much of the book on actual personal experience and on the accounts of others. But the beauty of this book lies almost totally in its wordsmithing. Melville is the master of putting together sentences, paragraphs and chapters that beautifully and eloquently draw the reader into his world. The author employs an extensive palette of words to paint a picture and to express a message about life. In the latter there is no greater allegory of life than Melville's masterwork.And isn't that what reading a book like this is supposed to be about? One does not read LES MISERABLE to get an engineer's view of the network of Paris' sewers; neither does he read A TALE OF TWO CITIES to learn about the mechanics of the guillotine.MOBY DICK, then, is more than a story about whales and whalemen. It is, in the end, a statement about the destructiveness of out-of-control obsessions and of vengeance run amok. It is a masterpiece that speaks to every man or woman in whatever walk of life they might pursue. Indeed, every one of us has chased or is chasing our own white whale or whales. And the truths taught here haven't changed much in over 150 years. As such MOBY DICK is as applicable to today's society and its concerns as it must have been to Melville's antebellum nineteenth century America.In short, if you're looking for a quick, entertaining read, try one of the Harry Potter books. But if you're looking for an experience or statement...THE HORSEMAN"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"MD is beyond all rating, far beyond. This is simply the greatest work of American fiction and one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Of course, that said, it is not a simple read, a mere entertainment. It can best be compared to reading Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; You've got to get ready to take your time, think carefully, study a lot, read slowly and with the intent to savor, be humble and receptive. The prose is daunting, but Shakespearean in its greatness. No one short of the great Willy Shakes himself has approached the brilliance of Melville's poetic style. The novel is a quas-allegorical epic tragedy, if that makes much sense to those who haven't read it yet, and you must come to it ready to put yourself through such a monumental task as grappling with it. Ahab is the great madman pursuing his blasphemous goal, Ishmael the gentle searcher caught up in the terror and attractions of that purpose, and Moby himself the great mystery of evil and God and nature, &quot;the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them til they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung&quot;. Hey, I could go on and on about this, about symbols and meaning and fate and evil and God and revenge and madness and hope. But what's the point? There are so many facets to this book, from farce to fate, that it would take me days to cover it all. If you want to read something great, this is what you should take in hand. By the way, the &quot;message&quot; of MD is extremely important in our day and age, in my opinion. This is not just an empty academic read, but a profound exploration of the meaning of life and the broadest, deepest questions of moral and spiritual purpose. The same themes haunted Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Camus, Satre, Becket, Graham Greene, Shusaku Endo -- the list could go on and on and on. But none of them reached as high as Melville in this work. You are welcome to write me to discuss MD any time, or to get pyshced up about reading it, or about unlocking some of its intricate and dense symbolism."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I became interested in Moby Dick after watching \\"Star Trek: First Contact.\\" Toward the end of the movie Captain Picard refuses to let go of his anger with The Borg and another character compares him to Ahab. This leads to an emotionally charged moment where Picard quotes Ishmael, \\"He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a [cannon], he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.\\"Naturally, I had to look up the quote on the Internet, and in the process I began to read some comments and reviews about Melville's classic. From what I was able to glean, many people consider Moby Dick the greatest American novel ever. And I respect Melville for his accomplishment through hard work as a self-educated man. Another of his famous quotes from this autobiographical novel is, \\"A Whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\\"This book is filled with intense drama and action interspersed with large chunks that are essentially non-fiction about whales, the logistics of whale-ships, and the whaling business. These non-fiction sections can be tedious, but it is well worth it to trudge through them and to read this tome as a whole, in order, cover to cover. Unfortunately, contemporary publishers would not print a novel like this one. They opt for shorter, fast-paced books.I actually bought several versions of this book from several different publishers and sat down and had a go at them each to see which one I could best sit down with. I chose the Penguin Classics paperback with the introduction by Andrew Delbanco and notes and explanatory commentary by Tom Quirk.I spent a week or two reading Moby Dick, several hours at time, and I ended up so engrossed in it that I took notes in the margins, bracketed some of my favorite sections, etc. This novel is the best work of literature that I've ever read and my recommendation is in the form of a comment: If you don't read it, you'll do yourself a great disservice."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Now in my fifties I'm slowly cycling through various classics I was assigned to read in high school. Moby Dick was one such beast. I remember \\"reading\\" it in cheap paperback edition as a sophomore. I was a better reader at that age than many, but still it was completely beyond my capacity to appreciate it. Why do they assign works like this to teen-agers! At this stage in life though, it's another story. What a difference. What a magnificent novel.So I say this to the kids assigned Moby Dick, who take their anger out on the book--it's BORING, too much about whaling, it goes off on tangents, too many words! Et cetera. I have sympathy--but don't blame the book! Get through your class with SparkNotes or whatever, then have another look at this when you're old. It may still be a drudge, but at least you'll have a fairer shot at it. If you've spent a lifetime reading, and accumulating experience with older texts (it's like building a mental muscle), you may be able to appreciate it. The language that seemed only boring can take on a power and grandeur like none you've encountered before. Maybe, maybe not. But keep an open mind about the possibility. Write a note to your future self saying, consider having another look. Also, reading it with a group of people also interested, can help a lot. Of course Hemingway could have written this as a short story, but it's not just about the \\"story\\".Coincidentally I heard Wynton Marsalis recently on a documentary about Jazz, talking about the difficulty of appreciating Be-Bop. He said something like, great art, Shakespeare, Picasso, Mozart, doesn't come to you. You must come to it.Finally I was going to agree with reviewer Jake Barnes (1/9/2007) who said \\"buy this version of Moby Dick\\". But the edition I read wasn't the one he read. Note that these reviews are listed under the same title regardless of the edition, so it's not apparent which edition you are talking about. I had the Everyman \\"cloth\\" edition, that had no footnotes. After the fact I looked at the footnotes in the Norton edition, but if I were only going to own one, I'd prefer the Everyman. Good paper, clear readable print, strong binding and cover, looks great--an excellent value."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This may be the most difficult review I've ever written for Amazon.com. I mean, this is Moby Dick, after all. So many have already written about it, and so many people have preconceived notions about this book, even those who know little about this masterpiece of literature. I will say I tore into this book with an Ahab-like vengeance, and finished it in a mere four days. I broke away only for sleep, food, and work. I actually started this book before I made my final assault on Oswald Spengler's \\"Decline of the West\\", a book that has provided its own difficulties. As usual, while taking a break from one difficult book, I decided to read one of the most difficult novels ever written!There is no denying it; Moby Dick is a challenge, albeit not as severe of one as some would make you think. Since almost everyone has a general idea of the plot, let's focus on what people detest about the book. First, many seem to have a problem understanding Melville's symbolism. Symbolism is often difficult, and I'm under no illusions that I picked up even half of Melville's symbolic usages. What is important to remember about symbolisms, however, is that only the author knows for sure every symbolic stroke of the pen. The rest of us have to do the best we can. Take Queegqueg's harpoon, for instance. He carries it with him wherever he goes, so it must mean something. Since Queegqueg is non-white, and this book was written as the United States was embarking on its last hurrahs over slavery before the Civil War broke out, is Melville trying to tell us something? Maybe Queegqueg's harpoon is his defense against any threats he may receive as he makes his way through white territory. Or is it a phallic symbol? Who knows? Don't be intimidated by the heavy symbolism. It is still possible to get so much out of this book without worrying about arcane references. Many times, Melville hits the reader as hard as he can with symbolism, so that it is easy to get the reference. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the substitution of the coffin for the life buoy means. I do hope any who read this book are at least somewhat familiar with the Bible, because scriptural knowledge will help immensely.Secondly, some have criticized Melville's prose, claiming it is \\"turgid\\" or overly wordy. This is such a wrongheaded criticism that it makes me wonder if the people who make these claims have ever read anything written before 1980. Quit trying to superimpose modern literary style back into the 19th century. Instead, try and get a feel for the time in which the work was written. Life moved more slowly during the 19th century, and brevity was not considered a necessity in writing. I'm often saddened when I read modern literature, which is such a vacuum of description that most of the books churned out today lack the majesty that the English language can often summon up under a brilliant pen (such as Melville). Melville's prose is eye candy, although I do think that Thomas De Quincey is even more spectacular (a quick plug for \\"Confessions of an English Opium Eater\\"!). Take this quote from the final showdown between Ahab and the whale:\\"Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! And since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the spear!\\"This is brilliant stuff! I get chills by just rereading this! Does it not show the absolute depth of hatred that Ahab has for his foe? It sure beats, \\"I'll be back\\" any day! Moby Dick contains some of the best prose work ever written. Learn to appreciate it!Finally, I'm now at a loss when I read reviews that say the 400 or so pages in the middle of the book are boring, useless, or just plain unnecessary. This is just wrong. Many argue that these pages are loaded with scads of cetology and minutiae on the whaling industry. While there is some of this to be found, Melville often takes us back to the Pequod. Who can say that the Town-Ho story is boring? Or that Tashtego's mishap in the head of the whale is totally without interest? I just don't get it! I say it clearly so all can hear: most of the 400 or so pages that make up the centerpiece of this book do not concern whaling minutiae or useless description. There is some, but it is important to know it to understand the unfolding plot. Personally, I found his descriptions of whales interesting and I loved his historical examinations of the whale. Can Moby Dick be read without reading this central section? Yes, in that you will get a bare bones account of a whale hunt led by a crazy old coot named Ahab. What you won't get is why this hunt occurs, and you won't see the gradual disintegration of Ahab as he drags the Pequod and all on it to their doom.I see Moby Dick as a universe, a total macrocosm in which only those who lead the life can understand this universe. This world has its own laws, its own religions, and its own meanings. Melville wrote this book so that the outsider, the \\"landlubber\\", can get a glimpse into this world. What most saw as a somewhat seedy profession, Melville saw as an all-encompassing worldview. Even this short description does not do this book justice because there is so much here. Maybe that is why teachers force this book on students. It is easy to take any method or system and find evidence of it here. I pity those who are forced to read this book. Forced reading is always a chore, and Melville should not be a check mark on a laundry list of literature. Read this because you want to read it, because you want to see into another world, because you believe your horizons will be expanded. It will make all the difference!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It was interesting to read the number of reviews on Melville's work, credentials unknown, as a piece of literature. There is no question or debate about whether this book is one of the great classics of American literature, or literature in general, of all time. There just isn't. So the 1-star or 2-star, or even 5-star reviews of the book as literature are not actually pertinent. It's like a debate about whether the Hope diamond is a really big jewel, or Handel's Messiah is an important piece of music. You may or may not like or appreciate Melville's work as a reader, but the only way to really find out is to read it. As far as this edition for the Kindle, it has a working table of contents and very readable formatting, and I recommend it as an addition to your classic Kindle library."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I had heard lots about this book: some said it was 600 pages about whales, others said it was their favourite novel of all times. The first usually were teens and the latter were usually my literature teachers, or writers I read.To be fair, yes, there is a lot about the whales; but that is not boring, Melville always manages to connect that to many other things (example: the head of the whale and the face of God) and whatever happens, his style is always witty and fun. I can never quite believe what I read in Amazon reviews; honestly. Some have said this novel is dry. I'm sorry but this book is so thickly rich of everything that I can hardly perceive how it could ever be dry. As to being boring or slow-paced, the fact that the whole novel is divided into over 100 short chapters does speed up the dynamic as short chapters always do.It is true that you should not expect a \\"classical\\" novel in the classical sense of being \\"usual\\", for Moby Dick is not your average novel. It has a narrator who is a character in the story, but he is nearly inexistent as such, and seems to melt in the universe he describes for us. The text itself moves from the story to encyclopedic entries on whales, and back to the story proper. Personally, I never minded that, and quite enjoyed every chapter of it; but it's likely that some don't appreciate that sort of narrative freedom.It is beyond me, too, that one should \\"need\\" a year to read this book. I read it in two weeks, and was by no means reading everyday. The first chapters are really funny, I thought. I was expecting something terrible, given what others had warned me of, but really it was fun. It sure is a demanding book, but then, great books require great readers. And by demanding, that can mean just being curious and/or interested.This novel is a true hybrid of sorts, combining elements that aren't usually thought to cohabit very well; you could perhaps consider it a patchwork, but for all one can say on it, it remains a cool read! I don't suppose I'm in the majority, but that's really how it felt to me: quite a cool read. It made me curious about the whaling industry and how exactly humans did to kill those sea giants; it may not sound thrilling to some, but if you pause and consider the animals concerned and the sea, and all that, then you realise (I think) how deep this all is. I believe you probably need to be on the same wavelength as Melville to enjoy his book; if the sea evokes nothing to you but tons and tons of water, then you may not revel in the reading of the novel. On the other hand, if the sea seems to you some metaphysical poem, then you will most likely appreciate Melville's grand effort."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"As a reader who loves History, I go through phases..

So I figured 'Hey why not'?After finishing it, I was left with a feeling of wanting more, yet wanting less...I wanted more.. more of the final battle between Ahab and his demon (Moby Dick).. More of the beautiful writing as in the case where Melville describes the 'whale's eye view' of the shadows cast by the whaling ships... More of Melville's almost prophesizing about the hunting of whales to extinction (when he compares them to the buffalo).. although he predicts that this won't happen to the whales..But yet I wanted less... Less of the frustration caused by Melville elluding to things, and then not answering them until later, or not at all. For instance when he writes about the size of whale fossils and skeletons that have been unearthed. He mentions one found in Mississippi without giving its size, yet he does it in a way that has the reader pleading to know the demensions.. Finally a chapter later, in an 'Oh boy the way' remark, he tells us.I also wanted less.. Less of the characters that he introduces, only to ignore for the rest of the book.. I wanted less, less of the descriptions of all of the various species of whales. Less of Melville wanting to be a historian, a biology expert, a whaling expert, a psychologist and a novelist all rolled into one.The book is essentially hundreds of pages of build up to an ending that encompasses 40 pages. This book was NOTHING like I thought it would be. If you are looking for an action packed book of man vs whale, this isn't it. You can do better with other books on the above list. This 'novel' is however, a detailed, if not sometimes tedious descritption of the whaling industry wrapped around a man fighting his demons.Will you like it? It depends on what you're looking for. If ou want a lot of action, see the list above, if you want a sometimes beautifully wriitng book, based somewhat on fact, containing a lot of detail about the whaling industry, this is it.Oh yeah, and I agree with the reveiwer who said that there are better editions. Once again, Penguin doesn't treat its classics like a classic. The notes in the back of the book are pathetic, and aren't even alluded to in the text. You literally have to page back to the notes once in a while and see whether there are any notes for what you are about to read.. This is inexcusable. If you want to read this book, don't get the Penguin edition."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Easily one of the greatest novels of all-time. Ignore the stereotyped responses by reviewers who complain about Melville's odd writing style, the length of the novel, or its circuitous nature. And don't get caught up in the \\"symbolism\\" of it all either. That'll come later. My suggestion is that you read Moby Dick for the shear thrill of the hunt. Melville has created a very strange and surreal book, which is a must read for anyone serious about American literature. In my case, I don't think I'd have been able to get through it before now (I'm in my early thirties) and I'm very glad I came back to it. That said, Melville's many chapters on early 19th Century whaling, and the whalemen themselves are interesting in and of themselves for both the historically curious, and the adventure seekers among Melville's readers. On the whole, Moby Dick is constructed like a great tile mosaic; or more precisely, it has the \\"counter-pane\\" structure of the Quaker bed-quilt he describes in Chapter 4 (there are many references to cross-hatched patterns & weavings throughout the novel). Moby Dick, the White Whale, is Ahab's bane. We meet neither Ahab nor Moby Dick until we've been taken far out to sea. This slow build-up is Melville's divine plan. He entices us throughout with brief essay after essay on all subjects and objects and personalities related to the Pequod, whaling, and Nantucket whalers, and whales themselves. If at first you have trouble with Melville's writing style, read on and you will find yourself soothed by his unique poetic sermons. The combination of these many short, sometimes non-sequential chapters all forged together, creates a rhythmic ebb and flow of diverse ocean tides, rising and falling waves, and rapidly changing weather. There are squalls, rushes after whales, followed by dead calm and placid tranquility. One forgets what and where he is going on this strange voyage. It becomes difficult to tell whether or not the story is beginning, ending, or somewhere in between; or, if it's a \\"story\\" at all! Very odd indeed (unlike any other novel I've ever read). And then we hear a voice; a harsh voice. It is Ahab, stumbling on deck, reminding us exactly what we're in for: vengeance and hate. Pure and simple. Forget \\"Cliff's Notes\\" or lame \\"abridged\\" versions of Moby Dick; listen to Ahab speak himself: \\"He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the White Whale agent, or be the White Whale principal, I will wreak hate upon him . . . I'd smite the sun if it insulted me\\" (Ch. 29). These are some of the most amazing lines in all of literature. Ahab continues: \\"For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!\\" With this Ahab avoids mutiny. With this he binds First Mate Starbuck and the rest of the crew to his purpose. Who's over me? Who and what exactly is Moby Dick? Who is Ahab? Read, enjoy, and go with the flow, like Ishmael following his passion out to the intrepid sea and away from mundane land-lubber life. Let yourself drift with Melville for a few weeks, slowly absorbing his amazing prose, letting yourself dissolve into his infinite, timeless ocean, watching, listening, and observing old, mutilated Captain Ahab, peering out to sea, and up into the three tall mastheads at us - his crew - all on the look out for . . ."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I am alternately overjoyed and dismayed when I read the reviews of _Moby-Dick_ here. It's wonderful to see that people are still reading it and even better to see that they're enjoying it and it affects them in such a way that they feel compelled to share with the rest of the world how great a book it is. To fellow Melvilleans and Dick-Heads, I say: right on!I can't help but feel disappointed, though, when I see reviews that fault it for being too long or having extraneous details in it. It kills me when people advise skipping the cetological passages. If you read the book and feel this way, then you've missed the point completely._Moby-Dick_ is much more than a tale of the whale-fishery. It's an epic. There's a reason behind the cetological chapters. As Van Wyck Brooks wrote in an article about his third time through the book:&quot;It seems to me now less chaotic, better shaped, than it seemed at first: nothing surprised me more than to discover how conscious Melville was of what he was doing.... It seemed to me intolerable that he had not removed the chapters on whales in general, on whaling, whales' heads, pitchpoling, ambergris, the try-works, etc., and published them separately: they were glorious, but I could not believe that they had been deliberately introduced to retard the action. It struck me that the action should have been retarded as it were within the story. I do not feel this now. The book is an epic and an epic requires ballast.&quot;Many people are put off by those very things. Try to imagine, though, where _The Iliad_ would be without the large catalogue of ships, or where _Paradise Lost_ would be without the large detailed list of all the fallen angels. Without the encyclopedic passages (which are well-written to boot, and a shame to skip), _Moby-Dick_ becomes nearly as banal as every other sea-story that came out at the time, saved only by Melville's extraordinary talent with a pen.Melville had a reason for doing everything he did in the book. Earlier in 1850, in his essay &quot;Hawthorne and his Mosses&quot; (easily one of the most wonderful examples of a writer writing about another writer -- find it using Google and enjoy it), Melville bemoaned the lack of a national literature and said that he would stand by Pop Emmons' &quot;Fredoniad&quot; (a so-so American epic poem, modeled after European epics) until a better epic came along. By casting _Moby-Dick_ in such a manner, it seems to me that Melville was making a deliberate attempt to create that &quot;better epic,&quot; and in doing so helped to establish American literature as a separate entity from English literature (for more on this, read F. O. Matthiessen's _American Renaissance_, the Bible of American studies).In creating this epic, nothing is expendable: the cetological passages are just as important as the soliloquies.Besides the critical aspect as to why they're important, they also serve a commonsense function. Recall, those of you who have read the book, the chapter entitled &quot;The Town-Ho's Story.&quot; Ishmael is telling the story of the Town-Ho to a bunch of guys in Lima, Peru. A number of times, he mentions things they're not familiar with: the Great Lakes and canallers (the men who work in canals). Each time such a topic comes up, the narrative is interrupted and Ishmael has to explain to the audience what these unfamiliar things are. By the time he gets to the final digression, he decides to have fun with it, and rhapsodizes on canallers, figuring that even digressions can be an interesting and artful way of telling a story.That chapter provides the layout for the rest of the novel, with Ishmael as the storyteller and YOU as the audience. Each time he digresses about the various species of whales, or their heads, or their tails, it's for YOUR benefit, so you get a more complete picture and aren't left in the dark as to what's going on when the men are &quot;trying-out&quot; the blubber or when Tashtego is working with a &quot;pitch-pole.&quot; Beyond their explanatory function, they are also beautiful passages of writing (reread the chapter about the tails, if you don't believe me; Ishmael's love for the beauty of whales is dripping off the page).Yes, it's a long book, but it's anything but boring. If you find the cetological passages boring, try a few things: 1) keep in mind that they provide the &quot;ballast&quot; for our first indigenous epic; 2) try to appreciate the beauty of the prose, and don't get bogged down in its being solely focused on whales and whaling; 3) see it as a story being told to you by a very conscientious narrator who is intent on having you understand everything about whales -- this last point is quite important, especially when you contrast Ishmael with Ahab. They are both obsessed with whales: Ahab through action and Ishmael through words. The cetological passages are Ahab's monomania wearing off on Ishmael, save for in Ishmael it manifests itself in worship for the beauty of the whale; 4) think of the above 3 points and appreciate the skill and artistry it took to weave all of that into seemingly innocuous passages about whales and their parts.When I finished the book, I only had two questions: &quot;How did he? And why can't I?&quot; I was consumed with jealousy(!) that Melville could pull something this amazing off, and I later learned that William Faulkner felt the same way: &quot;Moby-Dick is the book which I put down with the unqualified thought, \`I wish I had written that.'&quot;I am amazed that everyone doesn't feel that way."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"MOBY DICK is a great American novel about whaling in the nineteenth century. It is a very long book which contains almost too much incidental information about whales but it is fully redeemed by its intriguing characters and realistic descriptions of whalers in action.The two main characters are Captain Ahab of the Pequod and Ishmael who is the narrator of the story. Ahab is obsessed by a desire to hunt down the giant whale Moby Dick which cost him his leg during an earlier voyage. Ishmael is an experienced young seaman who is new to whaling. The tale focuses on the Pequod's long hunt for the huge sperm whale.Melville is an elegant writer. I recommend MOBY DICK mostly for that reason. The book has so many strengths that the lengthy treatises on whales and whaling are really a small price to pay for such a worthwhile reading experience."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby dick is an interesting book and I just love the beginning. Although I thought it was difficult to read it turned out to be very interesting. Anyone in middle school grade level or higher should read this book and in high school you will probably have to read this anyway. ALthough I do not suggest this book for someone who does not enjoy reading because it is difficult to understand at sometimes."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is a tough book. I will not for a minute pretend that I understood much of what lay below the surface of this story, because I was reading it for pleasure and did not bother to give it the time necessary to truly appreciate Melville's genius. On the other hand, even giving it only half my attention, the book was still entertaining. Ahab's obsession, the action on the high sea, and the battle with whales were all intriguing and griping. I also learned a tremendous amount about the whaling industry and life on the sea in the 19th century. There is tremendous depth to this book, but even if you only scratch the surface it is worth the time and effort to do so once. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who does not like 18th century literature (it can be extremely wordy and dull at times), but for anyone who has an interest in maritime novels, Melville, or is just curious why there is so much talk about Moby Dick, I would advise you to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is one of the great novels I have ever read!In the middle of a suicidal depression, Ishmel (Ishmael means \\"outcast\\") embarks on a spiritual voyage of self discovery (\\"some men look at a ball and pistol- I take to the sea\\"). The sea represents the \\"ungraspable fantom of life- and this is the key to it all\\"- The key to Moby Dick at least!One other blunt hint- Ahab does not hate the White Whale because it bit off his leg! Rather there was a later, more brutal injury that occurred when Ahab's new whale bone leg shattered and he fell on the jagged shard and it peirced his groin- you have to be sharp to catch this, but it is a key to understanding Moby Dick that almost no one spots. During a long miserable fever that followed, Moby Dick became the material emobiment of evil.This book is truly a stunning excursion through the world of ideas and understanding. It will draw you back again, again, and again.Reading Moby Dick was one of the great experiences of my life- If you cannot afford a trip to Europe, you can get much of the same horizon expanding experience by reading Moby Dick.Try to get an edition that offers footnotes to understand the mulitude of levels that Melville offers."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"There is so much to say about this book,it has everything and to say anymore will perhaps just add to the clutter.However ,this work is above all ,is one that has to be savoured.This is the literary equivalent of the three course meal,it needs time but it will reward you many many times over.I read this as a boy of 16 and was captivated I read it some 15 years later and there was much more on offer.In a world of clunk click entertainment Melville will take you on voyage of discovery.It's all there waiting,just for you,go for it................and bon voyage."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Such a hard read? Yes and no. This is not a book to be skimmed through as if it were the a new Grisham novel or the latest &quot;Left Behind&quot; installment (I confess I stopped reading &quot;Left Behind&quot; after the first). No, its words are poetical and poetry does not reward the skimmer. Don't just read for the story but for the prose itself. It is beautiful. That being said, I do appreciate the difficulty of the read. It took me about 10 weeks to finish. There are some bits maybe Melville could've trimmed up a bit. Six (count them, six) chapters comparing the heads of the Sperm Whale and Right Whale are more than enough. Also, the chapter or two devoted to different paintings of whales seem a bit much. The Reader's Digest version would, no doubt, keep the first fifty and the last seventy-five pages of the novel and hack away vigorously at the middle four hundred. But despite all this, if you do read this book, please finish it. It rewards the constant reader with a spectacular conclusion. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"After writing many works that discredited him, such as Typee, Omoo, Mardi, Redburn, and White-Jacket, Melville wrote Moby Dick as a way to redeem himself. Hawthorne roughly stated that Melvilles' writing of Moby Dick was a last attempt to regain his popularity with the public. However, many people took him as a fool. He would be doomed to spend the rest of his life as a failure. As previously stated, Herman Melville was discredited by all of his writings before Moby Dick. As a way out, he wrote Moby Dick, a story about whaling and a possessed man named Ahab. Ahab was the captain of a whaling ship named the Pequod, and seduced the crew into his twisted ways. This actually happens today with employers and their employees. Ahab lives on this quote from the 35th chapter titled the Masthead, &quot;Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain&quot;. The hatred of Ahab that drives this ship will also lead to the death of it and its crew. Thrusting his steel into the whale for three days at different times led to his death. On the third day Ahab thrust the steel into Moby Dick and the whale &quot;flew forward; with igniting velocity&quot; and the rope &quot;caught Ahab round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.&quot; Turning to leave, the remainder of the small boats' crew turned to return to the ship &quot;and now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Peqoud out of sight.&quot; The story line of Moby Dick was rather spelled out. Man meets man, they become friends, depart on whaling voyage, and one of them dies. Reading this book these days, might bring the younger less educated reader to the conclusion that this book is useless and is of no other purpose than to read for a class project. This is actually a well-written book by a well-lived man. Hawthorne states that &quot;When he pleases, Mr. Melville can be so lucid, straightforward, hearty, and unaffected, and displays so unmistakable a shrewdness, and satirical sense of the ridiculous, that it is hard to suppose that he can have indited the rhodomontade to which we allude.&quot;"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"About 200 pages into the story, it is thoroughly enjoyable.

There are many biblical, historical, and mythical allusions in this book so I didn't understand alot of it. Herman Melville was a very intelligent man and I think one of the most accomplished writers in history. For someone to really enjoy this book, I think that one must be a big fan of literature and open-minded. If you're far from this, this is still a somewhat enjoyable book.

Certainly some of the most beautiful imagery and language since Shakespeare. But what else? A poorly drawn main character (Ahab) with whom I feel no pity whatsoever.

An exasperating tale - yet one worth reading in the final analysis."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book opens our eyes for different views; for maritime landscapes as well as for observations into the the darkness of the human mind and soul. There is a lot about agony and pain in this work, but never in excess, it simply belongs to the trade and the trip. Through the whaler we get insight to all the contemporary navigation, well to that of days passed, too; and through the spermacetti whale we get insight to the maritime life in general. The voyage goes more or less round the world, the crew is international and meets ships wearing different flags. In due course the reader perceives the inevitable final catastrophe but remains spellbound because he cannot guess how it is going to happen. Sometimes the book seems to be too demanding, asking too much of the reader's - but then one has just to remember how much it must have required from its creator. In a book like this there is a danger of repetition but quite as no day at sea looks like some other pelagial day, no passage of the narration is in any way a copy to some previous one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick was a wonder to read.

Read it slowly, like poetry. An epic tragedy that is either loved or loathed, it may speak best to those who have known obsession, those who divine the many biblical allusions scattered through the pages and those who have an ear for the dated cadences of 19th Century prose.The reader can't help but be awed by the maniacal Captain Ahab, who challenges God and nature, casts away all navigational aids, forges his own compass and ultimately relies only on his own cunning and instinct to search the untracked seas for the one thing in the world that consumes him, the White Whale.The imagery is rich. At one point Melville describes a deathly still sea as a great magnifying glass and the sun overhead as the searing point of light gathered and focused by that glass.A gold mine for the imagination, this book can be read once as a tragic quest, once as a work of poetry and once again as a huge metaphor or allegory.

But I can't believe that. The message of the book is not handed to you on a plate, you have to figure it out. The author speaks with lots of voices. This book left me deeply confused. I can't pretend to have understood most of it, but I want to read it again"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"On one level, \\"Moby Dick\\" is a story about a monomaniac who sought to wreak vengeance against the whale that took his leg. However, on a more symbolic level, the book is really about a man who became tired of being pushed around by a supernatural force that would not be retaliated against. Well, as Melville shows us, Ahab wanted to reverse that situation by settling the score.Ahab thus states his position to God while watching a beautiful sunset over a calm ocean (Chapter 37): \\"I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies, - Take some one of your own size; don't pommel *me*! No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but *ye* have run and hidden.....Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me.\\"Those are mighty big words, considering whom Ahab was daring. And if you consider in the first place that Moby Dick bit off Ahab's leg as an act of self-defense, then it would seem that the real bully in this situation was the captain himself. But he had it in his head that Moby Dick was a supernatural agent carrying out God's divine will. So, Ahab's real vendetta was not with the White Whale, but with God. As we find out in the story, this was a battle that he could never come close to winning.If you really think about it though, Ahab really wasn't such a bad guy. After all, he was attempting to champion Man's rights before God and to protest the way Man seemed to suffer from God's unpredictable will, and these are all ideas that we as human beings can identify with. Nevertheless, such a challenge undertaken by Ahab was too much of a burden for him to handle, and in the end it consumed him spiritually.I really thought \\"Moby Dick\\" was an outstanding read. It was unsettling at times, especially in describing the practices of a mid-1800's whaling ship, but which made it all the more brilliant for how Melville used this material to fuel his metaphysical exploration. If you decide to read this book, be sure to have a dictionary handy, because Melville exercises the English vocabulary in all its diversified glory."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"What in our own lives is a monster whale? What would we foolishly die for?Those and other ponderous questions are the drive of Melville's message.Summed up? Big whale. One man chases whale, bringing others with him. Catches whale, but not until after whale rips apart boat. Problem is whale is stronger than the man and drags him into the sea.I've given away nothing. The suspense is not in not knowing what will happen, but in how Melville tells it.Readers without the patience to enjoy an active psychological drama will be bored, but try to see past the drudging of sea life and into the souls of each character.Man vs. man? Man vs. nature? Man vs. God? Hard call which this is, but it is all of those conflicts wrapped into one.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Quite simply this is the greatest book ever to come out of the USA, and none has matched it since. In some ways it can be read as a tragedy or a gothic novel. It can be hard going, with in depth chapters on various details on the lost art of whaling and whales themselves. Melville worked on whaling ships for many years and had first hand experience of what went on, so too he heard the stories. Although some people I know don't like this approach to novel writing, I think it fits very well into the whole.Melville's novel is almost manichean in its nature. Ahab is a blasphemer, and a Cain like wanderer in quest of the monster that took his leg. It shouldn't be forgotten that Ahab was the king in the Bible who helped lead his people into idolatory against Elijah. Many of the epic motifs are here- the futile quest and dangerous obsession, man's struggle and sometimes hatred of the force's of nature, the danger of following the mad leader and so on. There is also a hint of almost black magic in parts. Most of the book is concerned with the ship and its crew and the sea and the White Whale, the two are pitted against each other. It is a book of the Elements. But whereas Ahab does not forgive the white whale, the sea &quot;forgives&quot; Ishmael, who survives to tell the tale symbolically by holding onto a coffin as the ship goes down.I think its message about leadership is important. Ahab's obsession is what kills his men. Moby Dick is merely defending himself. But his men could have easily prevented their deaths had they taken the step of mutineering early on.There's a lot I can't say here, because I'd just be repeating what other people would say better. Don't forget this isn't the only book Melville wrote- his short stories are amongst the best in early US fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Some books need to be read in hardcover.

On entering the fantastic ( I use that world advisedly - eg, as in visionary, extravagant)world of Mr Melville's version of 19th century whaling on the one hand, and the mind of Captain Ahab through the eyes of Ishmael on the other, one is driven relentlessly forward to the inevitable battle between man and nature and man and himself.

Most of these facets are covered in other reviews that you'll read at Amazon and other places. But one aspect that is not really touched on in much detail by other reviewers is how very GAY it is.I assumed before reading it, that there might be some homoerotic overtones to a book about men who spend a year together out at sea. But what I didn't expect was how much the mythological aspect of this odyssey is tied to the philosophy that men are most fulfilled and find greatest meaning sharing their lives, bodies, and souls exclusively with other men. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But as a heterosexual, I was stuck by how much of the art and psychology of the book seemed to be cryptically but persistently gay-oriented.By the end of the book, after reading about Ishmael sleeping with and then ritually marrying a fellow whaler (admittedly without any sex explicitly mentioned), and chatting excitedly in the same bed together all night with him; and later seeing how much Ishmael notices and comments on other men's bodies; and culminating in a later chapter that describes Ishmael's near-ecstasy while running his fingers through the Whales 'sperm' while touching the fingers of other whalers doing the same with Ishmael gazing into their eyes, it made me wonder what Melville might have been trying to imply.When I finished and closed the book I thought that the artful and fantastic philosophizing of Melville, along with the originality with which he picks up the style and substance of Shakespeare's soliloquies to make his own points, mixed beautifully with the building adventure story to make a great statement about human beings' tragic universal struggle against fate and mortality. In the end this superseded and redeemed any distracting subtexts, and turned a rambling tour de force into a great work of art. But those subtexts are such a huge part of this book, that I cannot help but wonder if at its core -- at the emotional level -- the book is nearly as much about struggling with one's sexuality as it is about man's search for meaning in the highest sense."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick was yet another shocker, the story was so much deeper than I expected. Even in areas you would not think, here is an example:-And Heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if it's vast tides were a concience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.-You just don't find that in most modern writings! Every word has power and meaning. Every characters action has purpose. So if you want a deep book, and have a little time on your hands -the mountain of pages can intimidate some- sit back and enjoy a great story."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is not at all the book I thought I remembered from high school, when even the short excerpts we were assigned seemed over-long and intimidating, and the English teacher encouraged us to see the book first and foremost as an allegorical work. Reading the book now as an adult, I'm surprised at what an easy, engaging novel it really is.The most striking thing is how funny the book is. This completely escaped my notice in high school. (And the humor is certainly absent from any film adaption I have seen.) Ishmael's thought-provoking narration is full of droll, gallows humor, coupled with witty and erudite references to everything from the Bible to classical Greece. At times the action on-board the Pequod borders on slapstick (for example, Queequeg's rescue of Tashtego), yet the narration maintains this dryly humorous air that in all is much closer to Mark Twain than to Nathaniel Hawthorne. Imagine John Houseman giving the play-by-play to the Three Stooges, or Nicholas Cage's voice-overs in \\"Raising Arizona.\\"I could go on and on, but the basic point is that Moby Dick in the hands of an adult reader is a treat: exciting, interesting, thought-provoking, and often funny. Forget that you were ever subjected to it in high school. Pick it up again and give it a try."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Anglo-American character actor William Hootkins gives a passionate and wholly intelligible reading of some six hours of great passages from MD.

Quite funny as well."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The last 50 pages of Moby-Dick are undoubtably the most exciting 50 pages ever written. It's the 750 pages you have to read first that are the problem. Long chapters about rope, on why the whale is a fish not a mammal (huh?), repressed homoerotic imagery and the monomaniacal ravings of Ahab, blah, blah, blah. But, just when you're getting ready to give it up and read a book where something happens, you know, like Emma, they finally see the great white whale and all hell breaks loose"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick could easily be broken into parts and studied over a full semester in a college class and still that would only break the surface - and that is how it should be approached by the reader as well, I think. This is not like a Steinbeck or Dickens novel which can be thoroughly enjoyed without necessarily interpreting it. The whole point of Moby Dick is the search for the deeper meaning - by its characters and by its readers. Let me put it this way - if only the \\"action sequences\\" of the actual search for the whale where cut out and put together as the only part of the story, it might be 50 pages instead of over 500. Maybe 150 pages, but you get my point.Told from the perspective of one of his crew, the Pequod sets off on a whaling voyage under the enigmatic Captain Ahab. Ahab, maimed by the white whale on his previous voyage, has sworn himself to vengeance on the whale. He proves an inspiring captain in the beginning and the crew takes an oath to find Moby Dick with him. But as the omens mount up and additional reports of the whale's ferocity, it becomes clear that this obsession could take everyone to their grave and that Ahab would have his vengeance even at that expense.There is no doubt in reading this that it is a masterpiece and, overall, I enjoyed it. I found it very slow going though. There are a couple of reasons for this, I think. One, most of the chapters are very short - maybe one or two pages in some cases - so I stopped reading more often than I normally would. Secondly, Melville digresses from the actual story line of Ahab numerous times to go into depth on the types of whales there are, what pictures/paintings of them have been made throughout time and how close to reality they are, why the industry of whaling should be considered more glorious and honorific, how the whale line is secured, and specific anatomical descriptions of the whale's head, spout, flukes, etc. This occurs more in the first half than the second so, naturally, the first part seemed a lot slower (I also nodded off quite a bit in the first part). However, all of this is necessary for the proper interpretation and experience of the novel - they aren't side rants!I was surprised to find so much humor in the book, both situational comedy and literary sarcasms. On the allegorical level, I don't think I can fully grasp the whole scale in one reading. There is a whole chapter on the significance of Moby Dick being white but there was also a sentence in there poking fun at those that would attach too much meaning. Amid constant references to the deity like qualities of the white whale, I at times was not sure if the whale personified God or the Devil."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It took me three tries in as many years to finally settle down and read this book, but I'm so glad that I finally did it. I have two copies of this book - the luxurious and delightful Arion Press edition, which I must recommend to anyone who loves the look and feel of a good book, and the Norton Critical edition. The Norton helped me get through the rough spots (and made toting the book around much easier), and the Arion Press edition reinforced the fact that Melville's Moby-Dick is pure poetry, a cerebral treatise on the nature of man, the state of 19th century society, and the meaning of madness. It's more than that, though - it's also a hilarious and engaging tale, as anyone who has read of Ishmael's first meeting with his savage friend Queequeg could tell you (I laughed until I cried!). Melville wrote with excellence on so many levels that I could continue to expound on the virtues of the book for days... but I won't. A great companion to this book is Ahab's Wife, which adds an emotional richness and helps a floundering reader sympathize with (or at least, reflect upon) Ahab's dangerous and heart-breaking quest to find his whale."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It is like if it were scanned from book with a very bad recognision of the text.

Moby Dick is an exciting adventure story about a man named Ishmael who wants to go out to sea. He's a very poor man and he finds this hotel and he shares a room with a hooper. Hoopers are people who kill whales. Ishmael becomes friends with the hooper. One day the two friends found a boat owner and they asked if they could go to sea with the captain of the ship. The owner said, \\"why should I let you go?\\" Then the hooper showed the owner a target and used a rock to show how he could aim. The owner was so amazed at how good the hooper's aim was that he told them they could come on the ship. He said they should be there the next day. Later that day a man came up to them and he told them that the captain only wanted to kill one thing - Moby Dick.In another part of the book, the crew killed a whale and they made oil from the whale's blubber, or fat. Another time Ahab, the captain, and his crew saw another boat that had no oil and they lended them some oil. Captain Ahab asked the captain of the other crew if he had seen the great white... The other captain said she had not seen anything. Another time, Ahab's crew saw another boat and Ahab asked them the same question. The captain of the other crew said that he had seen him in the east. Ahab told the crew to head eastward.This book was one of the most exciting books I have ever read. Before I read this book, I didn't really like reading at all. After I read this book, I totally changed my mind about reading. This book should be a great book if you like adventure and the sea. This book keeps you very interested and you always want to know about Moby Dick or Ahab's crew.This book is similar to other books that tell adventure stories. Some of these are written by the same author who wrote Moby Dick. Some of the books are Treasure Island, Ten Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Peter Pan.If you read this book, you will learn a lot about Moby Dick, Ishmael, the hooper, and Ahab. You will also learn what you do when you go out to sea and are hunting whales and living on a boat with your crew. I suggest this book for young and old readers of any ages. They might find the book interesting or find it a little boring. To me, I would think they wouldn't find it boring. It was a very exciting story."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Without question this is one of the strangest books I've ever read. Its sureal writing style, and dream-like atmosphere left me speechless. And the philosophical and scientific content is truly mind-stimulating stuff.

That aside, this is truly an American masterpiece."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Melville's Moby Dick is not only a philosophical treatise on the nature of the soul and the meaning of life, but a damn-good story to boot. There's never been another American novel like this. The Pequod contains all we know of the world, and the sea itself contains all that lies beyond our senses. That is the grand 'stage' of Moby Dick, which Melville fills not only with existential searching, but rich, colorful characters, and ever-increasing dramatic tension. It may sound grandiose, but I believe that a good reading of this book can you a more intelligent, more thoughtful human being. That is, if you believe that literature is capable of such a thing..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book is the single greatest achievement of American literature. It is the one work that stands alone &amp; can go toe to toe with all other countries' greatest authors without flinching. Moby Dick can hold its own against the likes of Homer, Goethe, Dante, Milton, Shelley and Virgil and take its place as one of the great classic literary epics of all time. However, as one of the other reviewers put it, it is not for everyone. Even some people who are really &quot;into&quot; literature may not care for this fine novel. That is simply because never has a book been written that has pleased absolutely everyone, without exception. But, I think the biggest reason many people don't care for Moby Dick is due to the fact that so many these days have short attention spans &amp; prefer fast-food type novels whose plot can be summed up on the back of an envelope. If that is your type of book, carry on, sailor - this book is NOT for you. On the other hand, if you have an inquisitive mind that enjoys powerful allegories, then this book is for you! I like to think of Moby Dick as an Americanized re-telling of Milton's Paradise Lost. However, the best thing about the novel is not whether I'm right or wrong so much as the extraordinary range and scope of interpretations that are possible. If you read one single novel the rest of your life, read Moby Dick. If you read more than one novel the rest of your life, read Moby Dick first."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is the best book I've read in my nearly 40 years, with the possible exception of the Oxford English Dictionary, and easily warrants a ***** rating.

Many of you who are reading this are at least familiar with the title \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"The Whale\\", and if you have read this incredible and penetrating book, most of you (I hope) will be in awe from its memories: fearful, heavy, and strange. For those who say the book is too \\"wordy\\", then you simply don't understand style and taste. Melville manages to go from an incredibly tight narrative at one page to something distant and spacey the next page. Indeed, it is a magical novel or as many call it a \\"masterpiece\\". Since most people - from what I have gathered here alone - review this book splendidly, I will not spend much time writing about it. In fact, it is best one digests this book arbitrarily, otherwise its weight may not be as profound. There is much speculation one may collect, I imagine, when thinking of this book in deep introspect.\\"Penguin Press\\" did an excellent job compiling this book.

Herman Melville's, Moby Dick captures the audience from the beginning with a dark cast on an ocean adventure. The setting is old fashion and language is old-time mariner speech bordering on pirate lingo. Melville carries the audience through this strenuous adventure, an American classic in many respects; Moby Dick is filled with much dialogue and character interaction. This tragic filled adventure speaks to those who enjoy long encased novels. There is much devotion to the main characters such as Captain Ahab, while being narrated by character Ishmael, the thoughts and first hand accounts of whaling and the culture of whaling is well detailed."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"it, a masterpice that needs to be collected by anyone outher it is one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Wow, what can I say, this book is a classic!

From such words as &quot;trash&quot;, &quot;Call me Ismal..call me boring&quot;, and &quot;too much&quot; I am shocked. This work has been around for one hundred years! If it's so boring, and Trashy how can it still be around? We have become a country of TV and Movie Theaters, we used to be a country of books. See way back when..belive it or not....there we no computers, no radio, no movies and people used to read, Moby Dick is a pure example of how people got their entertainment. This was one of the ways people learned things, went places and enjoied themselves. Melville wanted to take them on his adventure, let them meet the people, get to know them. The only way people could understand what Whale Hunting was all about was to experence it, the only way most people wanted to experence it was through reading. This book is a clissic and it should be treated as such, it has earned it's place as taking us places before TV, Movies or computeres. Have some respect."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is an amazing metaphor for good vs evil, one of the best I've ever seen. The insane drive of Ahab, his refusal to listen to Starbuck or anyone else who tried to turn him away from the darkness of the water, his moment of tragic truth and his final destruction are all elements that make Melville's masterpiece's consideration as a classic deserved.My favorite aspect of the book is Fedallah, Ahab's Psychic Friends Network, who is always just standing around, saying something foreboding or looking at us in a way that foretells Ahab's doom."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This edition of Moby Dick is so beautiful! The first copy I owned had tiny print, narrow margins, and small pages. Luckily, I lost that copy and bought this one. The creamy pages and hand-set type do this story justice! It is an expansive tale, so richly told, and dense, and this edition gives the words SPACE. Usually I am more content oriented, but I gasped when I opened this edition. The care and love for the story is obvious. Well worth a few extra dollars for a nice edition."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"On one level, this is &quot;Everything you always wanted to know about whales but didn't know enough to ask&quot;. On various other levels it's the story of man consumed by avarice and vengefulness (Ahab), another who finds himself struggling with his religious beliefs (Ishmael), as was the author himself. This is NOT the &quot;Greatest Novel of the 19th Century&quot; (Bleak House, War and Peace and others are better), but it is right up there. The prose is at times beautiful, although there are many chapters devoted to whale science (cetology) which some might find tedious. I thought they were interesting. The book's real merits are on an allegorical level and for someone who's not afraid of &quot;Big Books&quot;, this one is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is obviously a rich and complex novel, a hallmark in the American literary canon and an important evolutionary step. That is why I recommend (unlike a previous reviewer) reading this book in an academic setting so that background and context can be elucidated for you. I am not one to wax pedantic, but serious books deserve serious reading. If you want to let loose, pick up Mary Higgins Clark.The book may have something for everyone, though perhaps not for me. Melville was doubtless a pioneer in his bold digressions from such banalities as plot and dramatic buildup to such quirky and informative sections as a detailing the sperm whale's sperm or the individual anatomies of the dozen better known varieties of whale. There is only so much whale I can take. It matters little that the whale himself is perhaps not as important as what he represents or what the human characters see in the whale.Still, there are enough beautiful passages full of poetry, adventure, and vitality to enchant your mind in between the tedious whale biographies. There is indeed enough weirdness in Moby Dick and Shakesperean structure to celebrate the beginnings of serious American writing. What most interested me in Moby Dick was the language, the inaccessible songs, monologues, and various allusions made in the darkness on the ocean waters. So wipe the spermacetti off your face and do a close reading of the text."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A challenging novel, MOBY DICK is considered a so-called classic. Melville's musings on morality and depiction of man's search for the un-attainable, certainly, redeem this novel--as much as it can be redeemed. Were it not for his sophisticated style, this piece would virtually disappear from bookstores' bookshelves.For a novel to be considered a classic, it must contain universal themes; while we can relate to man's helplessness in the face of nature's cruelty and ultimate power, we struggle to relate to Ahab's dedication to defeating Moby Dick. Even more, we suffer through tedious passages about whales' physical traits, locations, lifestyles, etc.I am a patient reader and even enjoy the writing of Nathaniel Hawthorne--the man to whom this book is dedicated. I enjoy intellectually stimulating books and purchased this book for just that purpose. However, when it takes 495 pages (my edition was 521 pages in total) for the climax to unfold, I lose all interest--and hope--in a story. I was committed to finishing this book, and now that I have, I can declare--honestly and sincerely--this book is overrated. I respect others' admiration for this work of literature, but I believe bookstores need to move aside MOBY DICK and make room for more riveting literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"What a terribly dry book. I cannot concieve how this book has become a classic. The author could not have written a more boring book.The action is slow if existant at all, and written in a way that you would think if it was narrated you would think a sermon was being given.I picked this book up with the greatest intentions. I never read it in High School. Now I know why, my English teachers were sparing me the trouble."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Through these readings of Melville's Moby Dick, I find the study of human development starting with the ardent and aggressive male and finally when age advances, the older but wiser male remains to teach the young to avoid his pitfalls and follies. Even in the whale families, nature seems to follow a plan and sticks to it; and the young eventually follow the same path as their older and wiser teacher followed when he was young. All of the community of nature evens out in this process and the survival of the race continues. Men react differently to situations compared to women. Melville illustrates this in the whales by suggesting that if a male whale is attacked, his fellow mammals quit him and leave him to his fate; but if a female reserves a blow, all her female mammals gather around to help her, even to letting themselves be put to risk. In human society, men are usually more self-centered and independent while women can be nurturing and caring. But new ideas change the world and these features become universal in both men and women. Still I believe that qualities of independence coupled with nurturing combine to make a fully-rounded individual. I can see how my own children and grandchildren adapt innovative attitudes in husband and wife chores. Today both the husband and wife work and each one shares the tasks of caring for the children and the home. Usually the woman finds herself still being the central figure in nurturing and household work.Melville examines the whales and laws concerning them, and compares them to us. In this world, we have givers and takers. The Law protect the givers from the takers. But sometimes the two get so intertwined, the Law can be interpreted to let the takers take all and the givers end up with nothing. When Rights can be denied to one person, what can we do to protect this person? When do Rights become wrong? We must examine our lives and determine how we can help to make this world a better place and develop laws to protect the weak who can be left without succor.I enjoyed the trickery employed by Stubbs and his interpreter to the &quot;Rose-Bud.&quot; And I see the irony in finding the treasure of ambergris in the heart of the decaying fish. In life, we find treasures when we dig deep into our inner souls and bring forth truth and spirit. Our lives can be filled with treasure if we throw away the decay of sin and dying thoughts and expose ourselves to the light of higher aims and goals, to our ultimate destiny. Corruption of spirit can hide values that we need.I found so much hidden meaning about Life when I read the &quot;Castaway.&quot; It seems to tell such a powerful and moving story. First of all, the story centers on a lower class young black boy who ends up cut off from his boat, along in the savage and unfeeling mother ocean. When we feel that we are alone and deserted in Life, we know the pain that Pip must have felt. What helps us keep centered and sane when we are lost in the oceans of trouble here? Do we have an anchor and keep ourselves focused or do we aimlessly bounce around and end up lost and castaway? God helps me in my time of troubles and prayer keeps me anchored on the ocean of Life. When &quot;Pip&quot; turns mad, he becomes filled with heaven's sense, celestial thought free from mortal reasoning. He reaches out for God and finds Him indifferent to him. How sad this belief can be? I wonder if Melville sometimes had these same thoughts as his &quot;Pip&quot; does. This chapter made me think of how many times in my Life that I have seen people as castaways and I hope that I can say that I turned to them and helped them find their way back to security and love.I find a kinship to the chapters that Melville writes about human feelings and cautions us about being aware of our surroundings. . I feel that he wants us to know that we should be in control of our inner resources, giving love and warmth to our fellow men and he shows us the way through his mini-chapters on caring. When words fail, human actions make better communication. A hand held in warmth and companionship makes a lonely, forgotten human ready to participate in the circle of human kindness. I happily agree that squeezing can be fun, and it can also release stress! I have a little soft toy by my computer and when I get the tightness in my fingers from typing on the computer, I squeeze the little toy and what a difference that makes to my whole body. When he writes about squeezing the warm globules of spermacetti, I can understand exactly how he felt. Everyone needs hugs and squeezes!Melville exhorts us about being grounded and not looking too long into the face of the fire. We can get blinded by our own ambitions for gold and power and material things. We must search for understanding or become as dead wood, ready for the fire. Like Ahab, who centers his search for the white whale, he focuses on light, the gold doubloon. Only &quot;Pip&quot; says that &quot;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look&quot;(475). What could he be saying? But we all look and do we find what we are looking for? On the Pequod, the men are looking for the white whale and the golden doubloon stands blazing in their eyes to remind them. The doubloon remains a symbol of their pledge to Ahab to follow him in his monomaniac search. So who will get the gold? No one knows; but they are all looking. Pip speaks the truth from his madness; he forecasts the ending of this mad search.What an interesting allegory in the skeleton of the great whale found covered with Nature. Melville again uses the weaver in this story. I think that he wants us to look around and see how God covers the world with beauty. He creates a lovely paradise for us when Spring comes and surrounds us with blossoms and grass. He covers the dark and dreary world with new growth. He weaves for us a tapestry of Artwork unrivaled by any artist. Even in the skeletons of death and decay, he can recreate Life and flowering fields."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A few years ago I spoke with one of the historians at the Mystic Seaport Museum of whaling abourt the Robert W Morgan, the ship used in both of the epic Moby Dick films. He explained to me that particularly for the 19th century man, a whaling voyage was one of the most horrible experiences anyone could imagine. The historian confessed that except for the top echnlon of ship's officers or highly skilled sailors who received significant portions of the voyage's profits \\"no one with common sense who had been on a whaling voyage would ever do it again.\\" Yet, Melville sailed several times as a common sailor on whaling voyages!Besides the personal and existential issues that this book poses, we have to also look at this as a book about the first invasions of the global personally indiscriminate capitalist economy into the early 19th century world of Ishmael. The New England villages which he comes from are small collections of independent producers who know each other, following trades or farming earth their parents have passed down in. Barter on most things was just replaced in the crisis of monetization of the New England economy that followed the American revolution which led to the armed revolutions and state civil wars in New England that forced Washington and the other \\"founders\\" to establish the constitution and a strong federal government to crush the rebels who wanted to go back to the demontarized past.Melville's character comes from a world where by and large everyone works for themself, their family, or perhaps someone they know.Yet, Ishmael is thrown into a new world, where he is simply an employee in one of the first world industries, the whaling industry. Rather than his own master, or learning to become a master in a trade, or learning to run the family farm, he is thrown into a new world where the world market for whale oil, whale ivory, and other products command him. Instead of the regular unfolding of crops on the season and trade activity reflecting that, Ishmael's voyage follows the whales around the globe, and its end is not regular.The author's use of Ahab and his arbirtrariness and the device of the great white whale, impose these new conditions in a way that emphasizes them and makes them stand out. Beyond the person issues, they represent the subjection of Ishmael and more and more of the world economy to blind, irrational to the average person, forces that will continue to conquer the world from Melville's time to ours, throwing us into periods of boom and bust, depression, recession, unemployment, insecurity, and world wars and rivalries.Melville's fascination with whaling is also shown by the many chapters which simply relate the many traditions and experience from the ancients until his day of whalers."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This &quot;classic&quot; book was not what I expected it to be, it was very boring and kind of hard to read.

The narrative is confused and rambling, often all at sea. Thus we have a first-person narrator (Ishmael) who is somehow able to tell us what Captain Ahab is thinking when alone in his cabin, a harpoon, without a rope attached, which is thrown into the sea and has miraculously reappeared in the next scene, and so on. Whole books could be written, and indeed have been, detailing all the errors in this story. Apologists have contrived elaborate and unconvincing excuses for what is clearly simple carelessness on the author's part.As for the characters, they never quite make sense. If the whale represents Evil and Ahab Good, why is the latter such an unsympathetic person? What are we to make of the livid lightning scar down his side? The book is full of such presumed symbolism but it all remains vague and unfocused. Ahab having a young wife and newborn child also does not fit the man and his motivations. Queequeg, the most interesting character, is abandoned and forgotten by the author near the end.Melville attempts humor but it is embarrassingly weak. Sometimes, as when he discusses the nature of whales and decides they are fish, not mammals, it is hard to know if he is serious or joking. Either way, it would be such a poor joke, who cares?\\"Moby Dick\\" has such an iconic place in American literature that anyone with a serious interest in the subject will want to read it. Please do so unprejudiced by the conventional view that this is a masterpiece. Ask yourself honestly; is it really any good?"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I must admit, somewhere after the 400th page, I was getting mighty impatient for the great whale to rear its ugly head. Majestically descriptive as to give life to planks of wood and historically fascinating, \\"Moby Dick\\" is god-like in its ingenius narrative of man and whales and sometimes tiresome in its detailed descriptions of everything under the sun and aboard the whaling vessel, The Pequod. More than being a great book, I came away with a hunger to learn more of its fascinating author who remains a marvel of history and literary wizardry."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is a tough book. I will not for a minute pretend that I understood much of what lay below the surface of this story,because I was reading it for pleasure and did not bother to give it the time necessary to truly appreciate Melville's genius. Onthe other hand, even giving it only half my attention, the book was still entertaining. Ahab's obsession, the action on the high sea, and the battle with whales were all intriguing and griping. I also learned a tremendous amount about the whaling industry and lifeon the sea in the 19th century. There is tremendous depth to this book, but even if you only scratch the surface it is worth the time and effort to do so once. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who does not like 18th century literature (it can beextremely wordy and dull at times), but for anyone who has an interest in maritime novels, Melville, or is just curious why thereis so much talk about Moby Dick, I would advise you to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"After getting through this monumental work, I was amazed at the rather blunt way Melville got his point across. The foreshadowing was less than subtle, and the characters almost transparent. But I guess the point was not about the characters, but about ourselves; the real monster is within us, not outside. I found the commentaries on the whalers world view to be quite entertaining, as was the layman's taxonomy. The book lived up to its reputation as a true classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I give this book a rating of seven because it is well above average, but it is certainly not close to being the best novel I've ever read. From the memorable first line, &quot;Call me Ishmael,&quot; the tale and quirky characters hold the reader's attention; but parts of the book are SLOW (including a very long and dreary chapter on cetology.) It's a good book to read once, but it doesn't encourage repeated readings."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Full of vivid desciptions and symbolism, this book has earned its reputation as a classic; however, this is actually the revised Moby Dick. The first draft was never read because Herman Melville burned it in a fire after inspiration from his neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne.Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote many classic short stories but the one that inspired Melville to completely rewrite a novel was \\"Young Goodman Brown\\". This is a very short story packed with hidden meaning....for starters the SEVENTH word is sunset which was not an accident. Anyway, this short story reveals itself many times in the style of Melville's Moby Dick and in fact a whole chapter is dedicated to answering Hawthorne.Read Young Goodman Brown, by Nathaniel Hawthorne and then read chapter xcvi, THE TRY-WORKS. This will help you understand it Much better."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"If you can't bear to hear someone say bad things about an alleged classic of American literature, do not read this review.This is, without a doubt, the single most overrated book in the English language. Granted, this doesn't mean that it is completely valueless, but considering its exalted reputation, it's amazingly close.On the plus side, the basic plot is certainly a classic plot; &quot;normal fellow sails with compulsive maniac of a sea captain in hunt for killer denizen of the deep, and is the sole survivor of the experience&quot; is, after all, essentially the plot to &quot;Jaws&quot;, as well, so clearly, this novel has had major, long-lasting literary effect. And Melville starts well; the first 3-4 chapters are a delightful bit of lighthearted scene-setting and character development as we meet Ishmael and his new buddy, the harpooner Queequeg. And the penultimate three chapters, &quot;The Chase, days 1, 2, and 3&quot;, are exciting enough. And I won't deny that there are some interesting literary devices applied between these bookends; periodically, Melville interrupts his attempt at writing a treatise on whale hunting in the ninteenth century to slip in a bit of character development or plot foreshadowing. But only occasionally; most of this book is only of value if you're interested in knowing all there is to know about the technical aspects of the whaling industry in the ninteenth century; then it's absolutely invaluable. Meanwhile, Melville's style is horribly obtuse, over-wordy, and convoluted, to say nothing of pretentious. As an example, in the chapter, &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot;, Melville spends 7 1/2 pages, including a 469 word sentence that takes up just ONE of those pages, saying nothing more complex than that, although white is frequently considered a GOOD color, in the case of Moby Dick, it is a BAD one, because instead of being reminiscent of purity, it is reminiscent of spectrality. Seven and a half PAGES, to say what I, a mere reviewer, can say in 31 words. The whole book is like that; he never uses one word where ten will serve.Mind you, I'm not some high school student forced to read this book for a class, unable to appreciate classic literature. I'm a very well-read 42 year old, who read the book on my own initiative because I felt that I wanted to make my own decision about it. I believe in speaking my mind; if I was any more complimentary about this book than I have been, I would be being intellectually dishonest.Astonishingly, there are those who consider this &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;; if you like pretentious writing and writing that can't keep to its topic but rather keeps wandering off at tangents, I suppose it is. I suppose it IS rather amazing that he was able to keep his syntax unscrambled in the above-mentioned 469 word sentence, but that hardly qualifies it for the title of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;. For my money, that title should go to &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, but there are certainly any number of good candidates for the spot. This book is NOT one of them."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is one of those classic books that is actually several simultaneous books rolled up into one; each a level below the other. At the most superficial level, Moby Dick is an adventure - drama about a male albino sperm while of the same name that roams the open oceans while being chased by a crew of whalers on a sailing ship named the Pequod. The ship is captained by Ahab, a man who has lost one leg in a previous encounter with the great whale. The book progresses thru various chapters. The initial and final chapters are the story itself; the chase of the whale across the oceans. The middle chapters provide a thorough and detailed examination of various facets of whales, sailing and the whaling industry.If this book was only an adventure story on the high seas; it would probably be unknown today for it is long and quite boring with a lot of pages devoted to dialogue and description. But, at a deeper level this book is a careful study of the vast range of human emotions. The terror of the sailors facing the great whale, the agony felt by survivors of crashed boats, the vengeance that drives Ahab, the comraderie between members of the harpooning team, the rivalries between the different harpooners, the suspense of the lookouts trying to get the first glimpse of whale or land... the vast range of emotions that man can experience are experienced on the Pequoud's journey. Key to this study is the fact that the ship's crew forms Western literature's first, truly multi-racial cast of characters. Names like Queequeg, Ishmael, Starbuck, Tashtego, and Daggoo represent the various races known to white man during the time of this book's writing.At the most basic level, this book, like all other classics in the western genre, is a commentary of human society. Here, the theme is mankind's destructive behavior, its attempts to control nature, and the ensuing wreckage that nature can bring forth onto man. Interestingly enough, the two leaders of the great quest are Ahab, an American, and Flask, an Englishman. At the time of the book's writing, America and England were in the throes of the Industrial Revolution. A visitor to the cities of either country at that time would be repulsed by the smokestacks, pollution, dirty streets, and factories. Both countries were undergoing large-scale transitions from societies that lived with nature to those that destroyed nature. The four harpooners are from native tribes in various parts of the world. As harpooners, they are the ones who will kill the whales. As an allegory, the represent the fact that in many lands, it was the natives who first showed the encroaching white man how to feed of nature's bounty. Ishael of course is Jewish. And it is the sole Jew on the boat who survives the onslaught of Moby Dick. This parallels the Bible, where the Jews are those chosen by God.I read this book when I was in my late teens and found it quite challenging. I only finished it with the help of reading aides and study guides. I would not recommend attempting to read this unaided, for it can be quite boring and challenging."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby-Dick is one of my favorite novels so, no, I'm not taking issue with that.

Just before the Civil War, Herman Melville wrote this book. But what may this have to do with Moby Dick? If you examine each character and event closely, you may see that they are parallels to the actual times of right before the Civil War. There was much question of what would happen to the United States and Herman Melville wrote his prophecy of the it through this book. His thoughts of what would happen to the US were all hidden as different characters and events in the story. For example: Captain Ahab could have represented the Radical Abolitionists trying to demolish slavery, which was represented by Moby Dick, the great white whale.

What does it do? Why, it tells you how to gain happiness and eternal fulfillment, and illustrates the consequences of those who follow those rules. Yes, it examines the state of those who disobey, but its focus is on the reward for action.Now look at Moby Dick. What does it do? Why, it tells you how to destroy your life. Page by excruciating page, it dissects and exposes the annihilation of Captain Ahab, a man destroyed not by a whale, but by his own consuming hatred and obsession for revenging himself upon his perceived &quot;enemy&quot;. The final state of Ahab is no surprise; indeed, with his carcass lashed to the monster, Ahab merely assumes in reality the position he had occupied already for years.Horrific and powerful. If the Bible doesn't convince you to return good for evil because it's the godly thing to do, perhaps Moby Dick will persuade you to abandon your revenge fantasies out of simple self-preservation.PS For those who throw hissy fits over Melville's classification of whales as &quot;fish&quot; -- get over it. The book is not a scientific treatise, and in any case the specific definitions of &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;mammal&quot; weren't well-established or recognized when Melville published the book. So, using the definition of the time of &quot;fish&quot; as &quot;sea animal&quot;, Melville was correct. Your criticism is anachronistic"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby-Dick may be American literature's most famous work; only The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn even rivals it. It is the kind of book with such a reputation that it is impossible to read without a host of preconceived ideas. One need not even care about it, much less have read it, to know the outline and perhaps much more. Many judge it before reading, if they ever read it, based on what they know - or think they know. This inevitably carries over to reading, often making a self-fulfilling prophecy. Though perhaps inevitable, this is unfortunate, as it prevents nearly everyone from reading critically and seeing it on its own terms; since it has been called a masterpiece so long, most feel compelled - perhaps even subconsciously - to agree, regardless of what they really think. Its near-unquestioned status is in large part a corrective reaction to the contempt in which it was held for the first seventy or so years, but the pendulum has swung too far the other way. Moby-Dick is good, arguably even great, but does not belong with literature's best works. As nearly always with extremes, the truth resides between its superlative current and former wretched state, and it is easy to see how both arose. Another reviewer notes that the consensus about Herman Melville is that he was a flawed genius, and so it is with this. If anyone ever needed an editor, it was Melville. Moby has moments of true greatness comparable to literature's greatest heights and at least as many moments that are superfluous and borderline plodding. The book has the potential to be truly great and perhaps would have been if trimmed somewhat. Melville seems to have known this as much as anyone but, like some of the truly sublime writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, his genius is simply unimaginable without rough edges. We must take him as he comes, for better or worse. Lack of perfection may bother some, especially those who see what could have been, but most seem willing to take Melville with proverbial warts and all. Everyone should of course read Moby - and practically everyone does who reads literature at all -, but the day when both its strengths and faults are admitted is still not even foreseeable.Moby does many things well. On the simplest level, it is a rollicking sea adventure of the sort that made Melville's name. Anyone who likes the picaresque sea tales in which the nineteenth century was so rich can easily appreciate this. It also has much historical interest. The first part in particular is steeped in contemporary New England life, giving a good idea of how those in the region lived and thought in the early to mid nineteenth century. The rest of course does the same for sailors and particularly whalers; we learn an astonishing amount about ship life's pros and cons. It was very different from shore life and almost literally a self-contained world. This way of life is now gone - was indeed gone to a large extent even at publication due to steam power's rise -, making the historical and cultural value all the greater. Melville also goes to considerable lengths to ensure that we learn much about whales - but more on that later.The book is also important, interesting, and influential on more technical levels. The first person narrative, complete sailing jargon and some distinctly American touches, is an important milestone in the development of a truly American voice. Ishmael's narration is distinct and unusual, a curious mix of erudition and vernacular - often imitated but never equaled. Moby was not popular enough to have the kind of influence that writers like Mark Twain soon had, but it has since become an American classic, influencing untold numbers of American writers and becoming an important part of the country's world canon.Perhaps more notably, Moby can be legitimately seen as both an exemplary realist novel of the kind made famous and immortal in the nineteenth century and as an ambiguous, highly symbolic work that in many ways anticipates Modernism. The former is achieved via narration and a generally documentary-esque style. Much of Moby reads almost like a diary, a near-exhaustively personal account of a whaling expedition and the events leading up to it. We get not only the high points but also detailed descriptions of mundane things like eating and sleeping. The book has a grand, epic sweep and does a very convincing job of vividly and memorably portraying a world unknown to many at the time and to all now. It is almost as if we lived it ourselves, always the mark of great realism. Melville wrote in part because he thought whaling's wonder and excitement of had never been adequately conveyed, and he succeeded so well that further attempts were unnecessary.But the book would be little more than a historical curiosity without the other aspect. Moby is one of those works that nearly everyone agrees is profoundly meaningful though few agree on the meaning. Melville was an inveterate allegory lover, and most of his works are clearly allegorical even if the allegory is not always clear. Moby on the surface seems a great exception, but we must not be fooled. Melville was not just writing an adventure story or a historical romance; Moby is indeed one of the most densely symbolic pre-twentieth century works. The most obvious allusive layer is Biblical. Many characters have Biblical names, and there are several story parallels - some well known, others more obscure. Names often give a clue to the characters and are important in foreshadowing, while parallels serve various functions. The Jonah parallel is the most explicit, even forming a sermon text; one may think Melville pushes this too far, but the point is well made. Many annotated editions are available for those who may miss the references. The most detailed versions will be too much for the average reader, but getting one that at least has basic footnotes is essential in order not to miss what Melville is trying to say.This raises the inevitable question - just what IS he trying to say? I recommend getting an edition that has only brief, explanatory footnotes restricted to facts unless one wants an exhaustive critical edition, because critical approaches are so many and various that it is easy to be overwhelmed - and, more importantly, all should decide for themselves. In my view, Moby-Dick, especially the title whale itself, darkly symbolizes the vast percentage of existence that is not only unknown to mankind but beyond its control. Though not misanthropic, the novel has little faith in amelioration, and the ending shows a very grim view of our ability to make any kind of meaningful change. All human endeavors to conquer the unknown and truly become the masters that we have long thought ourselves seem doomed. Some see the whale as a symbol of evil, but I feel this misses the point. It is not that evil triumphs over good; it is that the vast unknown forces that are immensely more powerful than us - whether we call them luck, fate, chance, or whatever - are forever beyond our reach. I think it is best to think of them as simply neutral or indifferent. We continually strive and alter; they are eternal and unchanging, which is why we cannot gain on them. As all this suggests, there is a large fatalistic streak. This runs counter to the existentialist element dominating later literature and thought, but Melville makes a powerful and dramatic case for a concept that held much sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers. We should keep it in focus even if we can do little or nothing about it in any case.The biggest reason for Moby's continuing popularity, though, is probably its unforgettable characters. Characterization is not one of Melville's top strengths, but these creations are so picturesque and finely drawn that few can forget them, and many have become archetypes. They are interesting enough to carry almost any book. This is all the more remarkable in that none are really sympathetic, especially in conventional terms; we essentially get a cast of eccentrics who fascinate almost against our will. Ishmael is a memorable narrator but perhaps the least interesting major character. His friend and partner Queequeg is certainly unforgettable, one of American literature's most distinct and evocative characters. One can easily find elements of racism and ethnocentrism in his depiction and he is an important early entry in the dubious American tradition of ethnic sidekicks, but the truly notable thing is the essential sympathy with which he is drawn. He is the most likable character, the most talented and able, and probably the closest to sympathetic. Despite attributes - including cannibalism - that the Western world finds shockingly primitive, his many admirable qualities are on full display, and his multiple advantages over condescending and supposedly far more enlightened Westerners are undeniable. He has the genuine sincerity and selflessness virtually non-existent in the West, and his true friendship with Ishmael is a striking instance of hybridity so rare in an era where American slavery still existed. It is startling to realize just how cosmopolitan ships were in contrast to the lands that sent them, especially considering the remarkable harmony and coalescence. Ishmael at times has a near-sociological view of Queequeg, and though he is not meant as a depiction of any single race or culture, the frequent contrasts between him and all he stands for on the one hand and Western culture on the other are engrossing and often insightful. The discerning will see some of Melville's darkest commentary here as well as some subtle satire.There are many other memorable characters, not least first and second mates Starbuck and Stubb, who show contrary poles of human nature and thought while their antagonism provides some comic relief. Even many minor characters, particularly the preacher and Elijah, are quite vivid and memorable. However, the most legendary and unforgettable is surely Captain Ahab. One of literature's most famous characters, he has been often and variously portrayed and frequently imitated, but the original drawing is still the best. It is curious that he is commonly depicted as thoroughly comic, aloof to the point of absurdity and a target for mocking laughter, because the original is darkly tragic. A brooding, foreboding figure, he is both larger than life and hardly of it - a highly eccentric man driven to obsessive frenzy and ultimate doom by a force he can neither control nor understand but is unable to resist. Ahab is a stunning instance of just how low human nature can sink - literally and figuratively. A warning to all, he shows the folly of letting hubris and ambition overcome the truly meaningful; there comes a point when we must let the unknown remain unknown, lest we end up like him.Then there is Moby-Dick himself. He is mentioned many times over the course of the book, and looms over the whole like a vast but unseen presence, but is only visible very briefly and remains mysterious. This has not stopped him from becoming world famous - indeed, has only added to his mystique. He is deliberately vague, which not only drives Melville's symbolic purpose but also, like the unseen aliens in 2001: A Space Odyssey, makes him more powerful and all-encompassing than he could ever have been otherwise. Melville sketches the outline, and imagination fills in the rest; this works perfectly, as we make him stand for our own fears and repressions. The novel thus successfully accomplishes one of art's rarest and most notable achievements - striking at human nature's dark heart by indirection. Moby-Dick may mean many things to many people, but his dreadfully imposing presence continues to haunt the collective psyche. Here, at least, Melville's artistry could not be bettered.All this is more than enough reason to read the book. It has plenty of conventional qualities to attract and keep a wide variety of readers, encompassing everything from pathos to humor: tragedy, adventure, suspense, history, philosophy, political commentary, and more. Some may be scared off by its fearsome reputation as a long and difficult read, but like much else about the book, this is greatly exaggerated. It is about four hundred and fifty pages long - practically miniscule by nineteenth century standards -, and chapters are very short, which keeps the pace fairly fast and makes for reading ease. The large number of sailing/whaling terms, as well as some regionalisms, can make the reading hard going, as can Melville's style generally. He was an autodidact and self-taught writer, and it shows; his prose is very unusual, full of rare words, unusual phrasing, and occasional rough-and-ready grammar. He was not an easy read even then, and dramatic style changes over the ensuing century and a half have only made him harder. However, as in nearly all such cases, this gets easier as one goes along, becoming almost second nature by the time one is well into the book - especially with footnotes. Those who have read Melville before will also have an easier time, as the prose is more straight-forward than in most of his major works.Yet Moby is far from perfect; indeed, it has faults numerous and significant enough to kill a lesser work. The main problem is sheer inclusiveness; Melville could easily have cut one hundred pages, or even half the total, without losing any actual story and very little else. There are many points where he seems to forget he is writing a novel and goes on long tangents about various whaling aspects. Virtually no dramatization is attempted here; it is almost like reading a textbook. Melville mercifully spreads this throughout rather than throwing all out at once, but it still becomes tedious and sometimes interrupts narrative flow, which is particularly annoying to many. Some devotees treasure these sections, and they are integral in a certain sense - Moby would certainly be a very different book without them -, but most readers will be highly turned off. Many will skip them, which will cost them little, but quite a few may give up altogether. This last is a true shame, not only because they will miss many positive qualities, but also because these sections do have a certain purpose, however overblown. They contribute significantly to the documentary feel and thus to the realism, substantially helping achieve Melville's goal of bringing whaling's ins and outs to the masses. We must also remember that scholarship is one of the book's themes, and the depth and breadth of knowledge is indeed impressive, especially considering that Melville had very little formal education. One can learn quite a bit in addition to the fictional aspects, giving unusual value and appeal. That said, nearly all will agree that some discursions are just too detailed and minutia-focused; only those who truly love the subject could really care for them. We can thankfully never accuse Melville of being didactic, a fatal flaw for most artists, but he can be pedantic. He simply did not know when to stop. Perhaps more importantly, the vast knowledge increase has made much of this outdated and/or inaccurate; some was indeed inaccurate even then. Most glaring are constant references to whales as fish; Ishmael mentions in passing the then relatively new idea that they were mammals and laughs! The fact that some will go away from the book thinking false things severely undercuts its value here, underscoring inclusiveness problems. There are many abridged versions, but it is probably best to read Moby as intended, for better or worse, and decide the merits for ourselves.There are some problems that editing could not fix, namely the abrupt jerk and overly marked contrast between the pre-ship section - about twenty chapters, eighty pages - and the rest. A good example is how Ishmael, despite being narrator and participant, fades into obscurity. The first section is all about him: his thoughts, views, actions, etc.; everything is shown through his eyes. However, as far as I can recall, no one even talks to him on the ship. He has very little interaction with the crew and relates many events, including lengthy full conversations and apparent monologues, without any explanation of how he has the information. Narration also switches to different voices on occasion; this does not come off as deliberate, like the Modernist narrative experiments that it pioneered, so much as if Melville forgot his plan. He seemed to write one book and begin another, tacking the latter on when the former should have been rewritten; the transition is messy and the whole ill-fitting. Most scholars think he drastically changed his plan, and it certainly seems so. The first part gives no idea what to expect from the rest. It is almost a comedy of manners, near-Dickensian at times, with some sharp social observation and more than a little humor. This is a stark contrast not only to the rest but to nearly everything else Melville wrote - interesting enough in itself in this but hardly inherently great. Even taken on its own terms, it is hardly his best writing; there is little art and none of the remainder's grand sweep and tragic overtones. It is unfortunate that he did not drastically rewrite or even drop this, as it is a significant stylistic limitation. Coupled with the many non-narrative tangents, it pushes Moby too far from the technical and stylistic elegance necessary to truly great literature in most eyes.Still other plot problems exist, though perhaps less important and arguably subjective. First, aside from the possibly excessive detail and focus on trifles, the initial section simply goes nowhere fast. One keeps wondering when the actual story will start, as popular depictions almost never use this section, and some will probably give up before the ship is even boarded. The section does have some value in adding to the realism and giving some now interesting historical background, but the fact that the rest is practically a separate novel truly makes it seem useless.Discursions aside, the book will pick up for most people once onboard, but even here the essentially episodic plot will bother some. The biggest surprise for most will almost certainly be that Moby-Dick does not appear until the last ten or so pages. Popular depictions often give the impression that the book is a series of Moby-Dick chases, but those who actually read it may well wonder if it will ever occur. It does, and Melville plays it up quite a bit, offering possibly more action in the last few pages than the whole book previously. Even so, it is hard not to see the long delay as anti-climactic; some may even be so let down that it significantly lowers their view of the whole, perhaps even ruining it for a few. It is indeed curious that Melville has the whale mentioned so many times but keeps delaying the inevitable. This was presumably mainly for suspense, and it indeed does much in that way, but whether it is worth the wait is highly questionable. Symbolically, of course, it works very well - is indeed inevitable if Melville's tragic vision is to be fulfilled, but this will do little to satisfy those let down by the narrative anticlimax.A final problem is the short closing chapter, which is necessary in order to show how Ishmael is able to tell the story but very perfunctory in execution. This is so much so that Melville may have been better off omitting it. The British first edition did just this by mistake, and this is the version read by D. H. Lawrence, who first brought Moby into vogue. Narrative implausibility was after all present in many prior instances, and a final one could hardly be fatal. Besides, one might add, if it did not bother Lawrence, who thought Moby a first-rate masterwork, why should it bother us? Either way, this is the kind of imperfection that will greatly irk some but that should not keep us from reading and appreciating what is a very good work in many respects.All told, Moby is simply one of those classics that everyone should read; it may run quite contrary to some tastes, and those looking for a true masterwork will surely be disappointed, but there is more than enough to make it worthwhile.As for this edition, it is ideal for most because it is not only inexpensive but has both versions of the story; an excellent introduction with substantial background on Melville, the novel, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; and useful notes. Some will want more supplemental material, but this is perfect for nearly everyone else."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick Moby Dick is a novel written by Herman Melville. Teenagers would be interested in this book because it's about killing whales and wierd people. This book is about how fishermen go out o sea to kill a big white whale that has been killing and eating people for years. The main characters are Ishmael and Quee-queg and the setting is in a bay. The main point of the book is the whale. Like tha time when the group went out to kill Moby Dick because he was causing many deaths toward innocent people and hurting children severely. One of the characters stabbed him in thye side and another, Ahah, stabbed him in the jaw with a spher. I think weak points of the book are that some of the scenes are unexplainable, like the times when Quee-queg gives Ishmael an embalmed head and sometimes what happens dosn't make sense. Strong points of the book are very good punctuation and descriptions on what is happening at certain times. For example, there really isn't much description with the giant squid that tries to eat the people. I would recomend this book because it's exciting and sometimes funny."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"First, let me tell say that I began this book with high hopes since it considered a masterpiece. However, not 100 pages into the book, I kept asking myself why this book is considered a masterpiece. After finishing it, I am still asking myself that very question. I don't have an answer since this book was certainly not worth the time and effort to read it.I entitled this review \\"Call me Ahab\\" since after getting 300 pages into it, I became obsessed with finishing the book. I was not going to let the White Whale beat me. I was not going to let that fish cause me to put down the book (even though that is what I wanted to do). I was not reading this book because I was enjoying it. I merely finished it so that I could say that I finished it and the White Whale did not win.There is a reason that the most famous line in the book is the first one. Of the 135 chapters, there are maybe 20-25 that are worth the reading. Of the 725 pages, maybe only 150-200 are worth reading. I was not too terribly concerned about knowing the anatomy of whales, the different types of whales, the skeletal system of whales, or knowing about whaling in general.Throughout the book, you may read one chapter with some action only to be followed by 5 or 6 chapters of tangents that are not necessary to understand the story. This also happens within some of the chapters that have some action. In the middle of a chapter with some action, Melville may go off on some tangent for several paragraphs and then come back to the storyline.If you like a story with nonessential information and an author that is entirely to verbose, then this book is for you. Also, if you have only one book and way too much time on your hands, this would be a good book. However, if you like a story that has some continuity to it and a good storyline, this is not the book for you.I think that Melville's plan was to have his writing be the White Whale and the reader as Ahab to determine if his writing would cause the reader to become obsessed just to get through it. If this was his thinking, then it worked on me.There are so many more books that are much, much better than this one. If you have many books that you want to read, read them first and always place this book at the back of the line and read it when you have no other books you would rather read.Take my advice - read another book. If not, then be prepared to become obsessed with finishing it since that may be the only way you will get though it.My apologizes to all those that I may have offended with this review."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Long, yes. Difficult to understand, yes. Good, yes. To those who rated it one and two stars, go read your comic books."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It's an allegory. No! It's an encyclopedia entry! Herman Melville tells a gripping, affecting tale of an obsessed Captain's quest for a white whale. Told by Ishmael, a member of Captain Ahab's crew, the novel recounts one man's obsession with a whale. However, the philosophical implications of his obsession soon become evident. Whiteness is equated with purity and goodness, as well as absence and death. Ahab's quest for revenge eventually causes his destruction as well as the destruction of those on board the Pequod. Did God send the whale to tempt Ahab, or save him? Is Ahab Jonah, waiting to be swallowed whole and reborn? Is the whale God? Is the whale Satan? Ahab and Ishmael grapple with these questions, and Melville challenges the reader to do so as well.All of this sounds like a compelling read; it is. However, it is only half the story. The other half, unfortunately, comes in the form of more information than anyone ever wanted to know about whales, whale hunting and whale habits. In one chapter, types of whales are chronicled. In another, the method of collecting ambergris from whales is detailed.The information, while presented well, is completely out of context. It would have been better suited as an appendix or introduction to the novel. Instead, it breaks up the flow of the narrative and pulls the reader out of Ahab's thrall. The story of Moby Dick hypnotizes and captivates us as surely as it does the Captain, but Melville is not content to let us drift along with the Pequod. Instead, we have to endure an Encyclopedia Brittanica full of information on whales.Moby Dick is a great novel and it is a fascinating factual chronicle. Unfortunately, the two do not peacefully coexist. I emerged from my reading experience frustrated. Melville could have easily given us the best of both worlds. Instead, he chops up Moby Dick and feeds him to his readers in bits and pieces, causing us to shift gears continuously. Keeping us on our toes, perhaps? Maybe, but it does not q!uite work. I only wish that great literature had a fast forward button."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I love reading and I love the classics and I love FREE.

Keep your dictionary nearby."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"While there are countless reports on this book, I will spare everyone that and try to keep my review simple. I had to read this book for school, and it could be because I was forced I found it a little tiresome. I have heard many great things about this book, and will take their word on it, I personally could never come to like it. I have read many contemporary books for classes and found many to be entertaining, but more often than not, the books themselves ramble on about a minor, insignificant point. For those books, I would only give them 1 star. Moby Dick deserves at least 3, primarily because the author is able to make his points despite many of the cultural conventions of writing of his time.One major aspect that helped me to enjoy it was the knowledge that the author had a personal struggle in writing the book, oftentimes not sure if his characters were good or bad, even remarking when finishing that he may have created something terrible. I urge you to look up other information about it if you do decide to read it, as it may help make reading it more enjoyable as it did for me."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It is an old story.

He brought out the wit and humor of the story - plus more irony and social commentary than I expected. I am sure many readers assume that Melville is wholly dark, sonorous, grave, and somehow \\"important.\\" There is that, of course, but on the whole I found the language of the story consistently lighthearted - even breezy at times. This narrator captured it all - the highs and lows, the humor and the pathos, plus a rich and diverse assortment of memorable characters. When I originally read the book, I eventually began to feel that finishing it, alone, would be the reward. There is a brightness and spirit in this audio version that was lacking in my own head as I read the pages. The story came to life for me, and I was rewarded with every chapter."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Is not the main character. You meet Ishmael at the beginning and at the end.

I just didn't believe the hype. When I finally picked it up in the summer of 2010 I was hooked from page 1. Melville was at the top of his game while writing this novel. And while i don't care for the whaling history chapters it doesn't detract from the sheer genius of Melvilles writing. His portrayal of a hysterical Ahab is brilliant and insightful!!! get this book and read this book!!!! and witness what it truly means to be driven by some \\"inner urge\\"!!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Even now, this novel rings true to the experience of the American way, but the wonderful thing is that it includes characters from everywhere in the world. The human inclination is to conquer nature, and this novel expounds on that theme. In the United States, as elsewhere, the exploitation of any resource (bison, passenger pigeons, cod, oil) is absolute. It is a miracle that we have any whales left, given the way they were hunted for so many decades."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This Herman Melville guy can really write!

Herman Melville invites the reader to plunge the depths into every facet of whaling, ships, mortal man, and beasts of the sea. Such details are found in no other novel.

The sea is his home first and foremost, and this most intelligent mammal will outwit man, in man's quest for revenge."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book is a timeless classic. Everyone should read the tale of captain ahab and the whale at least once in their lifetime"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is the greatest of all novels. Other works may be more refined, or ask less of the reader and perhaps, give more in return to those who peruse a book casually, but The Whale, is not that kind of work. It is a testament written in blood, and in turn, demands blood from the reader. You must devote yourself to The Whale, sign on to The Pequod and give yourself tooth and nail to an adventure without equal. Do not, be discouraged by the difficulties, but instead look for the subtleties. This is not simply a book about a man's obsession, it is more particularly, Ishmael's story, and he is a SIddartha to Ahab's vengeful old testament God. A man who finds himself in the mists and foam of the fitful seas rather than the whirlpools and harpoons of Ahab's longing. It is a work without equal, that rewards every reading with new insights into what it means to be human. Superb. Truly a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I've read MOBY-DICK before but never have I understood many of the underlying messages Melville attempts to impart until this critical and absolutely necessary edition. There are many footnotes and only a few are obvious padding; understanding Melville's inside jokes, asides and biblical allusions make this edition actually fun to read as opposed to just reading it straight through without any distractions. And yes, sometimes the footnotes will interrupt the flow but this is such an immense undertaking that it is like reading a whole new book with blinders off. We see Melville's taking jabs at religious orthodoxy and realize this is not a book just about whaling; it's about man's relationship to God in all it's guises. But there is alot to learn about whaling, man's relationship with different cultures and power structures. Many of the negative reviews see this as a long, boring book forced on high schoolers who never grew up to be adult readers. It is a book for mature audiences and should be savored like a fine wine or a single-malt scotch. There is much to indulge in after the text of the novel; whaling terms, drawings of whale-ships, lots of commentary and period and contemporary reviews, etc. to immerse yourself in. This is the most complete and authoritative edition I've come across and anyone trying to \\"get\\" the greatest American (and one of the top 10 international) novels ever written can't go wrong here.

My take on it then was that it provided a collection of proven tools and techniques, and a structured and straightforward approach to applying them. In its final form I stand by my original assessment.In less than 200 pages the author sets forth all of the key ingredients for successfully managing information technology. He starts by laying the foundation with well-written sections on the economics and psychology of IT management. These two sections clearly explain to managers and those who aspire to management how to think in business terms when approaching problems or starting initiatives, and how to bridge the wide IT-business chasm by examining IT's technology focus and what is important to business, then marrying the two together.The meat of this book is in Section Three, which introduces the IT management model - topics covered include business processes, tools, the relationship between processes and tools, instrumentation, management data and information, and action resolution. I especially liked the table on page 94 that summarizes the mapping between major industry models and the simple model proposed by the author. This table compares and contrasts the simple model to the ISO network management model's five management areas (FCAPS), the TMN model and the ITIL. I like this because the major industry models require a significant investment in resources to implement, and by starting with the author's simple model a foundation is established with less effort and resources, then when it is running steady state the more sophisticated models can be implemented in a structured fashion.Each of the subsequent sections augment the simple model by delving into details of understanding problems (framing them correctly within the context of a process), understanding change (which includes all of the key elements of an effective change management process), issues and special cases, and how to select management tools.Overall this book covers the basics in a balanced manner that keeps technology and business issues and requirements in balanced perspective. Regardless of whether you are a software engineer, IT manager, network or systems engineer, or a consultant, this book will give you a solid foundation of knowledge, and a recipe for success that are sorely needed in our industry."},{"Title":"Impacting Business: A Simple Model of IT Management","review":"The simple model that is described in this book is straightforward and represents a viable, effective starting place for establishing process-oriented management. However, in my opinion the best features of this book are found in the chapters on fundamental knowledge and background material.Section One, in particular, is one of the most readable and accurate summaries of the economics of IT management I've ever read. If this section alone was read and understood by IT managers and consultants, and then put into practice it would go a long way towards improving the way IT supports their business constituents. The material covers subtle and not-so-subtle aspects of investing in the right initiatives for the right reasons, and will cause any IT professional to alter the way they view their role in an enterprise.Psychology of IT management covered in Section Two is equally valuable. It accurately portrays the separation of concerns of both IT and business, then provides tools and techniques for aligning the two. Entire books have been devoted to this subject area, yet the author manages to capture all of the important points in a mere 26 pages.The sections on understanding problems and understanding change also stand out as exceptionally well-written recipes for managing two key elements of any process-oriented approach to IT management. The material in these two sections are directly applicable to anyone who is involved with implementing an operational model based on the ITIL.While the model presented in this book is not 100% consistent with the ITIL, it is close enough, and if properly implemented will give a solid foundation for an ITIL-based operations management paradigm.If you work in IT operations this book is one best investments you can make. It's short enough to be quickly read, and is rich in knowledge and techniques."},{"Title":"Impacting Business: A Simple Model of IT Management","review":"The idea from the book is great; approach a complex subject as simple as possible. Unfortunately I have missed theory and practical examples to prove and explain the matter. The author stays too superficial and needs more persuasion to convince the reader that the subject can indeed be approached in a simple way. Finally I would have preferred some real life situations instead of movie quotes."},{"Title":"Impacting Business: A Simple Model of IT Management","review":"This book took what would have otherwise been a complex subject and simplified it to my level of understanding."},{"Title":"Surprise Party (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","review":"Before beginning, let me make it clear that I am reviewing The Surprise Party by Annabelle Prager and illustrated by Tomie de Paola, which is a Step 2 Book designed to be read by children in grades 1-3. There are several books by this name that are quite different from one another in their stories and in their intended audiences.Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. The Surprise Party was one of her picks.Nicky, like many children (and adults), is really looking forward to his birthday party. But, alas! He doesn't have enough money to put on a party for himself. He persuades his friend Albert to enlist their friends to give Nicky a surprise party instead, so Nicky can have all of the presents and fun without the expense. The story develops humorously from there into many rewarding plot complications that revolve around the theme of trying to have your cake and eating it too.For a simple story, the book contains much to interest you and your child. I have noticed over the years that people have vastly different thoughts about whether they enjoying having and giving surprise parties. You will help you child develop a sense of what her or his feelings are on these subjects, as well as beginning to realize that others often feel differently. This has a broader lesson, as well as helping your child avoid upsetting others in the future with the best of intentions concerning surprise parties.I would particularly like to praise the illustrations in this book. They show lots of interesting children interacting in positive, friendly ways. Everyone is beautiful in his or her own way.Annabelle Prager has a witty sense of humor, and the book benefits from many little jokes that she includes.Although some children will be able to read this by themselves in first grade, I think it is probably better aimed at a second grader. Children younger than first grade will enjoy having it read to them.After you have finished enjoying the story, I suggest that you discuss with your child when surprises are good things (like parties for people who like them) and when they are not so good (like losing something and not telling anyone it is lost until the item is desperately needed). As a result, you can help your child develop a better appreciation for good communications as a way to make life more wonderful for all.Surprise someone! . . . nicely."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"Chris Irwin wrote this book after beating a mare named Stella at a demonstration. He'd been working hard and shouldn't have accepted the invitation that day; he had been pushing himself too hard. The manager of the event set him up by sending three mares that didn't pasture together into the arena, and a fight broke out between the horses. Chris fueled the fire by reacting to the situation and beating Stella after getting the other two mares out of the ring. He nearly ruined his career as a result. And this book of excuses is his attempt at finding a silver lining in that situation.If you want to hear about how Chris' life has unravelled... how a young man his age has been married four times in his attempts to overcome his dysfunctional childhood, then this story may peak your interest.If you want to see a picture of Chris skiing, and a photo of Chris teaching his son to ride a bike, and a photo of Chris playing guitar and singing at a wedding, and a photo of Chris in his cowboy cocaine days in the 80's, and a photo of Chris when he was 15 on the rowing team in high school and won the championship -- then this is the dark horse book for you.Every photo is \\"Chris this\\" or \\"Chris that\\" -- and most of the photos don't relate to the text. It felt egotistically motivated, and I began to realize that Chris' dark horse is his insecurity -- and he hasn't conquered it yet.I'm very interested in learning about the spiritual connection between humans and horses; but this wasn't the book for me.I respect everything that Chris Irwin has accomplished in his career, but he needs to forgive himself and stop making excuses, before he can stop dancing with his dark horse."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"Some have called Chris Irwin the Dr. Phil of equines. I guess I have always kind of thought of him as an equine profiler. His tremendous instinct for and knowledge of horse psychology is what makes him such an observant trainer and teacher. His second book opens with a humbling tale of a mare that brought him to his knees so to speak. A mare named Stella that bedeviled this excellent horse whisperer and sent him scrambling out of the round pen without his composure. Now if Mr.Irwin were a fictional character I would imagine Stella the mare would occasionally turn up at future clinics when he least expects her. Appearing once or twice in his videos and books. Squaring off with him in the tradition of Sherlock Holme's Irene or Bobby Goren's Nicole. But Stella is real and she forced Irwin to look hard at himself as a person and a horseman. That introspection weaves in and out of the theme of this book. Irwin's personal stories are combined with valuable training and riding advice. Probably some of the best guidance out there for equestrians. What I appreciated most about this book was the fact that spirituality and personal development were never ignored in the pursuit of excellent horsemanship. In fact it's vital. Read this book and discover how horses can aid you on your journey toward being true to yourself,toward healing, toward personal and professional achievement and better relationships. Someday I hope to have the great good fortune and privilege to ride in one of Mr. Irwin's clinics. Until then I have his book on my shelf as I strive to become worthy of my horse."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"Well known clinician, Chris Irwin, met his match in Stella, a dark mare who refused to play games. She challenged Chris, forced him to decide what was most important to him, and then Chris, in the form of this book, shares his lessons with us.Unlike most of the other books I've read, Mr. Irwin calls it as he sees it. He doesn't sugar coat the truth, that \\"natural horsemanship\\" is an oxymornon (there's nothing natural about putting saddle and bridle on the horse and forcing it to go counter to its natural instincts which tell it to flee), that somebody has to be the better horse, the boss, and that horses provide a mirror for our thoughts and fears. He provides food for the brain, stuff to think about, and in sharing his story, he brings the knowledge he's gained to others.I found this book to be very thought-provoking. I find myself thinking about my relationship with my horse in a completely different light. Could it be my inner fears (of falling off, getting hurt again) are mirrored in her flighty nature? Perhaps by facing my own shadow self, my dark horse, that it will help our relationship? Mr. Irwin, through his prose, seems to think so.I recommend this book for anyone seriously pursuing a relationship with their horse. From backyard ponies to professional trainers and riders, anyone can benefit from the information in this horse. And if you don't even own a horse, but am looking for a little soul searching, I'm going to recommend this book too. It is an amazing piece of work, and I am looking forward to reading Mr. Irwin's other titles."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"Chris is open but he tries unsuccessfully to convince the reader that he was humbled and knocked off his high horse during a session with Stella the horse. Seems to me that he wants to believe he has become altruistic and has written a book to try and convince himself.To his credit he has come a long way in life and conquered many demons. But, many irrelevant photos and self praise show that his ego is huge, and insecurities large.Sadly, I suspect this book was an insincere effort to try and save face in the business arena. It is highly likely that Chris will have another greater fall and the resultant book will reach sincerity."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"I'm an avid and life long horse-lover and owner and I love to learn more. This is my first negative review of a book in this area. Chris Irwin seems to me to be the kind of false prophet to avoid. He turned me off early in the book, but I continued reading out of some weird compulsion to see just how far he'd go to berate other author/trainers whose advice I've come to use and respect and replace it with his own sense of \\"I've got it right and they will ruin you and your horse\\". Additionally, he offered no practical difference in what he was saying. Simply, his belief that natural horsemanship is false and that he has a better way. Ok, what is your better way? Are you ever going to explain the details? I found one or two of his insights interesting and unique. So that's something I guess.Also, the book is full of literary fillers to make a book more than 200 pages. In one 3 page rant, he used a metaphor from zen-masters, Wayne Gretzky, and JFK. It was laughable. Do you have a coherent point to make here? The rambling just goes on page after page.The story where he absolutely lost me for good was when he told the story of his 2nd wife's horse. To be clear that's his 2nd wife of 4 wives. This horse aggressively went for his \\"carrot\\" when he was relieving himself. The horse was expecting his \\"carrot\\" to be a treat. Aside from the need to tell a story about his jeopardized penis, more importantly he showed that he took no accountability for the boundary issues of a horse living in his own barn??!! Surely, it's his 2nd wife's ignorance that caused this horses boundary issues... this horse that he was clearly working with and riding. Happy trails. I'm moving on to someone who has something helpful to say to me and who has some humility as a horseman.Better use of my reading time:Dr Robert MillerBill and Tom DorranceLeslie DesmondLinda Tellington-JonesSally SwiftMonty RobertsLinda Kohanov"},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"I loved some of the insights and it's worth reading. However, I thought the Author could have been more focused on the overall picture and less focused on himself toward some of the later chapters."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"I thought that whilst this book was quite fascinating it didn't really address the issues that the book began with namely an incident where a good horse trainer loses his cool with a recalcitrant horse and in front of an audience. He gets angry and actually uses his crop on the horse.For me it left a lot of questions which start to get discussed in the final chapters of the book but almost as an afterthought.If the book had been about how we deal with our darker feelings then it would have more satisfying and more reflect the title. A good read nontheless."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"I ran across this book in the bookstore and since I read almost any book about horses, I bought it. I found it hard to put down.The startling opening scene where the author, who is a natural horseman, ends up first heading for the bottom rung of a round penand then surprisingly whipping a mare severely (the antithesis of natural horsemanship) that most of his audience left. Hewondered if he had a career left and more than that, what could have possessed him to violate his own principles?He recovered his career and the book is largely an examination of human behavior along with some horse training examples. To thereviews who felt that he had two many references to himself in the book, you need to remember that he violated his principles,a very disturbing event for any one. And the mistreatment of Stella (the mare) indicated to him that underneath hisexterior existence was a \\"black horse,\\" symbolic for attitudes and emotions that can come to the surface and explode beforeyou realize that they are there.Much of the book is the author's attempt to deal with his black horse. Despite the use of his life as an example, he is trying towarn other people that they may be dealing with a black horse themselves and need to examine their actions. If they don't, itmay appear when they least expect it and ruin relationships, horse or human.I was associated with a talented natural horseman who bought copies of this book for all his trainers, calling it \\"the bestbook on horse training\\" that he had ever read."},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","review":"What a wonderful way to not only connect with animals but to all of nature.

Entertaining the way it was done in the 60's by the ladies who knew how to do it. Love it!"},{"Title":"These entertaining people","review":"Reggie Darling said of this book: Called These Entertaining People: A Guide for the Elegant Hostess, it was written by Florence Pritchett Smith, also known as Mrs. Earl E. T. Smith, and was published by Macmillan in 1965. It is a delightful, information-packed guide to entertaining and to life exquisitely lived along the New York/Southampton/Palm Beach axis back when people still dressed for dinner and when society columns still appeared in newspapers. In other words, before all Hell broke loose.Florence Pritchett Smith, the book's author, was quite the lady: a former model, society gal about town, radio and television personality, columnist, wife to America's Ambassador to Cuba during that country's revolution, onetime JFK girlfriend, and partygoer and giver extraordinaire. According to some of the accounts I read while researching this essay, Mrs. Smith and President Kennedy remained more than \\"just friends\\" long after each had married others, a dalliance eased at times by the convenience of having adjoining houses in Palm Beach, a town known for knowing how to have fun.But it is not for the Kennedy connection that I find this book interesting or recommend it to you, Dear Reader. No, it is for the merits of the book on its own. These Entertaining People is a delightfully chatty read and is chock-a-block with the author's excellent advice, observations, and helpful tips for throwing successful parties, from intimate informal luncheons to large black-tie dinner dances. The book also includes anecdotes about and recipes from a heady list of American and European society figures, fashionable decorators, and media personalities of the day.Although some of what Mrs. Smith writes in her book seems somewhat quaint in today's post-women's liberation world, most of what she has to say still resonates when it comes to the subject of being a thoughtful, generous, and caring host (or hostess). One can learn a great deal from Mrs. Smith, and not just about entertaining at the most elite level, either, but also on a more accessible one for today's readers, too. She writes with authority and clearly knows her subject intimately and thoroughly. But she is not just a self-appointed arbiter of such matters: the editors at Life Magazine considered her to have hosted one of the top 100 most-memorable parties of the twentieth century, the Cuban Fiesta Ball she threw at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1958, during her husband's ambassadorship."},{"Title":"Creators of the Jewish Experience in the Modern World","review":"This work edited by a devoted Jewish scholar Abraham Milgram tells of the life and work of major figures in shaping modern Jewish experience."},{"Title":"Rusty Wallace : The Decision to Win","review":"I only received this book yesterday, and as of this moment, I have about 15 pages left. It was impossible to put down, as it contained so many little-known facts about Rusty, Kenny, Mike and the rest of the people close to Rusty. Family and friends contributed many photos, old and new. There is so much about Rusty Wallace that you'll never know unless you read this book. The whole Wallace family was fully engulfed in the world of racing, and &quot;Rusty Wallace - The Decision to Win&quot; is a rare opportunity to take a peek inside the box of memories that was Rusty. A wonderful, wonderful read. The book's format is also very nice, and is a lot bigger in size than I expected. This book definitely will not be spending any time on a bookshelf. This book needs to be displayed on my coffee table! A must have for any RACE fan. Rusty Wallace fan, or not.

I bought it at the Gatwick Airport book store on my way back to the US and managed to finish it on the long plane ride home. It's romance, comedy, heartbreak, all in one. The characters were fun and interesting. The descriptions of the people and places were inviting. I've read it over a couple of times, b/c there's just something charming about it."},{"Title":"Wicked Japanese For The Business Traveler","review":"As the previous reviewer indicated, this book is not a serious study of the Japanese language, and yes, it is full of stereotypes. But Howard Tomb's take on Japanese society is often hilarious! The book is especially funny for those foreigners who have lived or stayed in Japan for an extended period of time, although that is not a prerequisite to understand the humor.Tomb divides the book into different situations with explanations and a number of phrases for each. The phrases start out innocently enough, but get progressively outlandish and funny. For example, in the section for &quot;Life in a Japanese Firm&quot; you will note phrases with Japanese translations like:&quot;I will always agree with my superiors, even when they are totally wrong&quot; or&quot;My dream is to be a tiny cog in a huge and honorable machine&quot;I had a friend who actually tried to use these phrases in Japanese while working for a Japanese company, but no-one understood the sarcasm (everyone took his statements seriously!). In short, the book is often hilarious in English, but not necessarily so in Japanese.Wicked Japanese is definately worth the [money] for the laughs that it generates, but be careful if you actually decide to use it."},{"Title":"Wicked Japanese For The Business Traveler","review":"This book is definitely not politically correct, but if sarcastic, biting humor is your thing, this one will have you rolling. As other reviewers have stated, the humor in this book is often lost on Japanese people, but if you've ever lived here, you'll probably laugh yourself to tears by the middle of the book. I use the author's explanation on why few people travel to Japan for tourism often, and it always gets laughs.Be very careful about using the Japanese in this book, as some of the phrases are quite offensive. Still, this is a good antidote when you've read too many boring phrasebooks, or you've had a nasty bout of culture shock."},{"Title":"Wicked Japanese For The Business Traveler","review":"This book had its moments, but it's certainly not to be taken seriously as phrasebook. Chockful of American stereotypes of Japan, most of the phrases, while actually Japanese, I can't imagine actually being used in real situations.Well, maybe the phrases to use if you're a female being groped on a train (&quot;Arrest this pervert!&quot;)."},{"Title":"Wicked Japanese For The Business Traveler","review":"if you become annoyed with your Japanese hosts and need a witty comeback, this book is for you.

Yes, after all that is imagined or can be sung, by angels or men, by seraphs or saints, in the church below, or in the choirs above; the charming subject will remain unexhausted to eternity. For the riches of Christ are unsearchable, and the grace of God is unbounded.\\" Amen to that!"},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"It has been 30 years since I have seen this book--I never owned it, and it was a non-circulating book in the local children's library-- but the summer I turned seven, I spent hours reading this book day by day in the children's section of the library at Lincoln Center while my parents did their graduate work upstairs in the adult collection. I still vividly recall the characters: Amy with hair the color of moonlight whose mother gave her a lambchop for lunch each day, Clarissa with hair the color of sunlight whose mother gave her spaghetti for lunch each day, Malachi the Bumblebee, and, of course, the make-believe characters Hannah and her baby sister and the Old Witch and the mermaids who lived in the Big Glass Hill. Back in those days, we did not have any super-heros (no female ones, anyway), no Wonder Woman, no Warrior Princesses capering across the TV in their undies, not even Sailor Moon and co., and so if you wanted to make believe you could fly, Hannah the Little Witch Girl was all there was. My friends and I used to pretend to be Hannah and Amy and Clarissa in a gem-studded forest landscape taken from James Thurber's The White Deer. On imaginary broomsticks, we careened around stuffy apartments full of couches and dining chairs holding loquatious, boring adults. The book also holds appeal for the child with a systematic mind--the sort of child who types out alphabetical lists of dinosaur species will also enjoy writing out alphabetical compendia of all the runes spoken in the story!"},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"For more than 30 years, I've been searching for a copy of The Witch Family. It's been in libraries but I couldn't remember the proper title or author until one day last year, I stumbled upon listings for Eleanor Estes quite by accident. I quickly grabbed up a beaten up copy (which was very comforting....it looked just like the one I used to repeatedly check out of the library back in the 1960's!). I stood there and hugged the book and then rushed home and tried to explain to my husband that I was 8 years old again and I had business with Amy, Clarissa and the little witch girl to attend to. Why is this book so special? I don't know...Maybe because I moved a lot and always had to make new friends, where Amy and Clarissa were inseparable best friends. Maybe because of the wonderful imagery and fantasy level: the fear and fascination of witches and the idea of a sweet baby witch girl conjured up by the girls' drawings. There was also a mermaid and baby mermaid...what little girl wouldn't be in heaven with all these characters? I think another attraction of the book is that it's virtually adult-free. There is a wicked old witch but even her actions are controlled by Amy and Clarissa. I believed in this book wholeheartedly. I could picture the girls trick or treating on Halloween, I could hear the effect their stopped up noses had on their voices when they had to stay in because they had colds, I believed that if I looked closely at the moon, I'd see the little witch girl, baby in tow, on her broomstick. I love this book. When I finally re-discovered it, I was returned to my childhood."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"When I was a little girl I loved all books having to do with magic, and especially witches. This book was my all-time favorite. I checked it out of the library so many times that eventually the card in the back was filled up with my signature on both sides!This book is about magic, but it's also about the power of imagination. The Witch family, all though very real in their own right, have been created out of the mind of little girl who's mother first introduced her to them. Amy appoints herself caretaker to the witch family, and through the pictures she draws of them she can keep tabs on all that is going on in their world &quot;up on the great glass moutain&quot;.A benchmark of good childrens literature, this book holds up under the test of time. I have re-read it as an adult and still enjoyed it very much. I can't wait until my own children are old enough for me to share it with them."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"...and a penchant for magically mysterious stories and fairy tales, of COURSE I read this book over and over again as a little girl. The first time I discovered it, I was 7. And it was dog-eared then, and worse after the 100th reading...it's a great book. Full of love, magic, and pretty thoughts. Of Halloween nights the like of which will never happen again...sigh. Are you looking for a fun birthday or Christmas present for a dreamy bookworm of a girl? If she loved the Harry Potter series, she will adore this one as well. May I also suggest George Macdonald's beautiful lyrical The Light Princess and The Golden Key (the Sendak illustrations).

This is the same premise as Pamela Dean's \\"Secret Country\\", and creates the same complications. But this book is easier for much younger children to read, making a good introduction to the concepts.This was out of Estes' usual territory, and she handled it with both silly fun and knowledgeable grace. Ardizzone's done his homework as well; look at the posters on the walls at Hannah's school. I would give this to any child six years old and up."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"As a child, I stumbled upon this book and absolutely loved it. The heroine is a little witch girl living with the Old Witch, the witch baby, and Malachi the bumblebee.

Glad to see it's still in print."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"This book captured my imagination as it has my children's. They love it as much as I did in the 60's, where I must have checked this book out from the library 20 times. I was delighted to find an old copy still in the library, and started searching to find my own so that we could read and reread the magical stories of Hannah, Weenie Witchie and Old Witch. Malachi was always my hero, and the two brave little 7 year olds, Clarissa and Amy reminded me often of my best friend and our adventures in fantasyland. Take time to cherish this book again and again. It is a book well worth the effort. Bless the publishers for putting it back in print."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"This was a favorite book for both me and my sister when we were little. I lost track of the number of times I read it, sadly our copy has been lost. I just recently found it in the local public library and have read it to my third grade class.

I would recommend the story to anyone, it's fun and written in a way that both children and adults will love."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"The Witch Family is about two girls who while drawing witches pretend to banish the head witch, also known as Old Witch, to a glass hill because she is very wicked. If you multiply the \\"Old\\" with one million, you get some idea of how old she was! The girls also let Old Witch do her abracadabra so that she can have a witch girl named Hannah and a witch baby. Old Witch gets to be wicked only on Halloween. At the end, the two girls take pity on Old Witch and turn the glass hill into a real hill with grass. After that, Old Witch is not wicked anymore except on Halloween. I think this is a good book to read on Halloween."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"I read this book when it first came out and I was in grade school. It was the one that got me hooked on reading. What a fun book especially for those who love the classic Halloween Witch."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"I'm almost done reading this to my 9 year old daughter (sometimes she prefers I read to her) and I must say we've had quite a lot of fun reading this book together. Every evening when I say \\"that's enough for tonight\\" she begs and pleads for me to read just a little bit longer.The books mixes the two worlds of reality and fantasy in a way that leaves you wanting more. Old Witch loves her two daughters, but, can't help being the one who misbehaves. Her older daughter, Hannah, must constantly be on the lookout that her \\"Gammer\\" doesn't break her promise to \\"hurly burly\\" on any other day other than Halloween.I'm a huge fan of Eleanor Estes and my daughter has read all of her other books and has loved all of them. Consider adding \\"The Witch Family\\" to your child's reading list and if he or she can read this just before Halloween I think you'll find it adds just the right touch to the occasion."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"Like many others, I too stumbled across this book almost 30 years ago as an 8 or 9 year old and have never forgotten it.

I hadn't read it for more than 30 years, but recently bought a copy to read to my children (girl 9, boy 7, girl 4) It hasn't lost any of its magic - I'm enjoying it as much as they are. It includes so many of their favorite things, magic, witches, mermaids, babies - and it blends real and imaginary worlds in the same way that they are blended in the minds of children."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"One of my favorite childhood books. I bought this for my niece. I'm sure she will love it as much as I did. A perfect book for young girls with big imaginations!"},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"I read it first as a child, and liked it, but wasn't really blown over by it; I couldn't really articulate why it was unsatisfactory.Re-reading it as an adult, I think I can articulate it:1. No real sense of menace or danger. Old Nobby the witch was mean and grumpy, but I could name several witches in other books for that age who were much more evil and dangerous. And children old enough to read such a long book are old enough to know that there IS real evil in the world.2. The rules of how the magic worked kept changing according to the needs of the plot. There wasn't the inner consistency that commanded belief.On the other hand, so many people like it that I suppose that the problems I had with it are just that--*my* problem. If reading the reviews make you think this is the sort of book you'd like, go right ahead."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"While searching at the library for a few good books to start off the summer with, I found The Witch Family by Eleanor Estes. I realized that one of her other books (Ginger Pye) had won a Newbery Award, so I assumed she must be a good author. I got started in the book immediately. At first it seemed a little boring, but I kept reading. There were some things that could've been improved. For expamle, I found it got annoying how the author almost always used \\"Old Witch,\\" Little Witch Girl\\", and \\"Weenie Witchie\\" instead of their real names. The plot line was a little strange, but unique. It would be a great book to read around Halloween time. It's basically about a witch who has been punished for her evil actions. Other characters join in and add to the plot. The book could've been better but I guess it was worth reading."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"This is my all time favorite childhood book. I originally bought the soft cover at the Salvation Army for a quarter. I read it so many times, that it's falling apart. I now purchased the hardcover and look forward to reading this book to my daughter (who, by the way, was almost named Hannah)."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"This is a book I loved as a kid, and was delighted to rediscover. In addition to all the details about how witches live, this is a great book because it combines all the scary elements of the traditional witch (including Halloween) but the little human girl Amy is the boss and the old witch has to follow Amy's rules. Nice combination of fantasy and comfort, plus a happy ending. A few very nice illustrations. Just right for a read-aloud for my second grader."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"My mother read this book to me the summer before I started kindergarten, and I still remember standing my ground to all evils of school, thinking, \\"Malachi, Malachi, you are a magic bumblebee....\\"The Witch Family is a classic to me because it is such and imaginative story for a child, and in my opinion, much better than the phase of the Disney princesses (not criticizing anyone who went through that stage)."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"I have been looking for this book forever! I have explained the story to friends, librarians and other bookies...as the years went by details slipped away but I never forgot the mermaid in the glass hill! I can't believe I have a name for it...will have it in my hand asap! Loved this book..."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"The Witch Family is nice, non-scary magical tale with more heft than contemporary \\"Color Fairies\\"-type books. It's a sweet, old-fashioned book -- but heavy emphasis on the sweet. It's the sort of book where things get called by kiddie mis-pronounced names like \\"noo-doos\\" for noodles, over and over again. When you're reading to yourself, or reading aloud, that can be part of the charm. But when your kids are listening to 5 hours of audio book on a long car trip, you have to hope that the narrator doesn't lay it on too thick.As it happens, this narrator lays it on triple-thick: syrup on top of honey on top of sugar. Every single sentence, happy or not, is pronounced with a huge, honey-dripping smile...for 5 hours straight. I grudgingly gave it 4 stars because my girls did enjoy it, and they're the target audience in the end. But as an adult, it was flat-out excruciating."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"This was my top favorite book during my early teens, we used to imitate everything in it, dress up, play at witches in the dusk, at mermaids in our mothers' cocktail dresses, &quot;floating&quot; through the common garage of the block of flats, etc. : there are the two girls Amy and Clarissa, who invent all those witches, the bad old one that gets banned on the glass mountain, Hannah, the girl witch, who - lonely up on that mountain - ventures into the inside of through a crack and meets a mermaid of her age. They become great friends. The mermaid has a tiny little mermaid sister and Hannah, overpowered by the loneliness of living with the grumpy old witch, tries to hex her own little sister. Eventually she needs the old witches help - and the little sister who makes sparks when clapping her hands arrives. The highlights certainly are when Amy and Clarissa on Halloween meet Hannah and join her birthday party. They join the games on two mechanical brooms that don't work ! for witches, and the night when the old witch is going to be bad again, leaving the mountain to feast on the Easter bunnies who are busy with their Easter preparations. Of course the girls Amy and Clarissa will not allow this... Part of the fascination to me then were the lovely drawings. I have been trying to find this book since and it seemed out of print for a long time."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"I just found my childhood copy of this book the other day and read it again. 30 years later pages yellowed the book is just as good as when I read it for the first time."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"What a delightful find! Although I grew up reading several books by Eleanor Estes, until recently I hadn't the pleasure of discovering The Witch Family. This book is a fun blend of imagination and fantasy.One day, Amy and her friend Clarissa banish Old Witch to the top of an \\"awful, high, lonely, bare, bleak, and barren glass hill.\\" At first, I wasn't sure if Old Witch was real or just a character in wild stories that Amy' mom would tell the girls. When Amy's mom tells about a particularly bad deed by the Old Witch, Amy and Clarissa started drawing pictures in which they banish Old Witch to the top of a barren glass hill. Having a change of heart, Amy later writes a note telling Old Witch that she could return once a year on Halloween. Estes writes that because Amy is only seven, her spelling isn't perfect but that doesn't matter because witches are used to doing everything backward and forward and backward again. See how it could sound like imagination?Yet the second chapter starts out: \\"One day, Old Witch was rocking in her wicker rocker on the creaky front porch of the witch house. She was not happy, and she was brooding. She did not like it up here on this bare, bleak glass hill.\\" In this chapter, we also meet Old Tom. He's a witch cat, who most of the time seems irrelevant to the story. The more important animal in The Witch Family is a bumblebee that Amy names Malachi. For reasons never explained, Malachi flies after the Old Witch on her banishment day. Old Witch inadvertently reads an incantation that bestows Malachi with many protective powers--and the ability to spell words. Yes, all of these characters are as real as our two seven-year-old heroines.After Amy banishes the Old Witch through her drawings, she stays in contact with her through letters delivered by a cardinal. Her next letter tells Old Witch to \\"sing an abracadabra, close your eyes, and then open them again, and you might have company\\". When Old Witch opened her eyes, what did she see? A little witch girl! Next, Amy and Clarissa draw a school. And then a picture of the little witch girl arriving late to school. Pages later, in another blend of imagination fantasy, Amy and Clarissa think they see the little witch girl fly by their window. The two worlds continue to blur, until our two heroines end up attending the little witch girl's birthday party and she ends up going out with them on Halloween. That isn't to say this is simply a fun romp in imagination. When Old Witch tires of her banishment, she brews up some very real trouble. Exactly what, I'll leave it to you to find out.As for me, I'm more anxious than ever to reread the rest of Eleanor Estes' books. She knows how to write about the daily adventures, along with the more unusual happenings, of young people."},{"Title":"The Witch Family","review":"I've thought of this book often in the ~25 (holy cow) years since I've read it. I haven't read it since then, so I can't comment on specifics, other than it has stayed with me as images of magic and imagination and humor.I'm so pleased I've found this book. I'm looking for good chapter books to read to my 5 year old son. I remember this book from our elementary school library. The copy seemed ancient (I read it in ca. 1984), and I didn't imagine I'd find it in print. Especially with what little I had to go on.

But the book deals mostly with Arab selfish ways of thinking. Luka falls in love with Alastair Forsythe, whom Arab sees as a monster. Dan and Juan visit Bombay with work from the Queen of England. During the book you will meet Phillip Winston, Dusty's look-a-like cousin. Is he really the nice guy he appears to be around Nell or is he hidding something. Luka also appears to have a capablity of talking to the people in the Wotherspoon Family Graveyard. She knows things about the past of this place that she couldn't possibly know. This book is filled with scandal, swindeling, hatred, love, marriage and most of all, family unitity. You'll either love the characters that appear in this book or you'll hate them. From the very beginning you'll be engolfed in this new main character - Luka. Once you have finished your stay in England, you can journey to California to visit the rest of the family, in Daughters of the Shining City."},{"Title":"Answer Without Ceasing","review":"Answer without Ceasing by Margaret Runbeck is a most inspiring book about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary situations during the worst possible times of horrific war with absolutely nothing - no shelter, no food, no possessions,- nothing except their willingness to pray to God, and to share their love and faith. Although this book deals with World War II, the strength of character displayed is appropriate for today. The need to turn wholeheartedly to God and help one's neighbour is just as imperative as it was all those years ago.I must recommend this book as a great read."},{"Title":"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge (The Gentle Revolution) (Gentle Revolution (Gentle Revolution Press))","review":"I taught in Japan in a highly competitive school for children under the age of 5. We used the Gentle Revolution and were amazed by the results. Not only did the children recognize words by the age of 2, but also they could read at the second grade ENGLISH level at age 3 - 4. Keep in mind these were children whose parents did not speak English, in a culture that was completely in Japanese. We only saw the children for a few hours a day and devoted only about 5 minutes per hour to the Doman method. I have nothing but respect for the methods in these books, and although reading through them is easy to understand but difficult to stomach, DO NOT disregard the method for the fuzzy writing. It is sound, and I hope everyone recognizes the potential for intelligence that every child is capable of.Yes, they are flashcards. Yes, sometimes your child won't look at them. Yes, you have to be interested in them too. Yes, you must be excited. Yes, there is a jargon but it's easy to learn and makes sense later. Yes, your child will learn faster and in the end, don't we all want our kids to be the best little kids they can be???"},{"Title":"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge (The Gentle Revolution) (Gentle Revolution (Gentle Revolution Press))","review":"First, since I know the Doman program must have defenders with strong feelings, let me say that this is a review of the book, not of the program the book describes. I do have a few thoughts about that, at the end.It has been a long time since I took the trouble to finish reading a book that was so far below my expectations. (I hadn't read that much about Doman and the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential before reading the book.) One main problem with it is that it is amateurishly produced and written. The print is large and the margins wide. Each chapter is preceded by a title page with the name of the author(s), followed on the next page by the title *repeated*--a pretentious a waste of space. There is also quite a bit of repetition of its rather threadbare and simpleminded themes. Apparently it's a collection of lectures, and nobody bothered to edit the thing into a coherent whole. Doman's writing tends to use very dramatic (and frequently tiresome, silly, or cringeworthy) short sentences; so there is lots of white space. The long and short of it is that you aren't really getting your money's worth here. You can read the whole 280 pg. book in an evening (if you skim, as I did, the sillier parts--as I'll explain).As to the style and content, it ranges from the pedestrian and banal (\\"Leonardo? Shakespeare? ... [overlong list of great men] Not one of them ever took an intelligence test\\"--as if that proves anything), to gross oversimplification for rhetorical effect (\\"Babies would rather learn than eat\\"--except when they're hungry, eh?), to the silly and preposterous (\\"You can teach a baby absolutely anything that you can present to him in an honest and factual way\\"--either trivially true or obviously false), to the puzzlingly and simplistically dogmatic (\\"High motivation is a product of success. Low motivation is a product of failure\\"--um, I think there's a little more to it than that).It is also remarkably navel-gazing, constantly referring to \\"The Institutes\\" (never enumerating the Institutes individually--do they need more than one?) as if it were some authoritative academic or research institution. Which it ain't. If it were, let's just say I'd expect to see in this book, well, some footnotes and a bibliography of research that The Institutes published. No, of that in this book, there is zero, zip, zilch. There is only a list of other books, aimed at the general public, which you can also purchase from the Institutes. The book also helpfully explains how people come to their various seminars from all over the world, and gratefully buy their products.Along the same lines, it is self-congratulatory. Doman fills up a third of the book with glowing self-praise and in-group boosting, rather vague stories of wunderkinder, and inspirational pablum that can appeal only to the converted. The whole production has the faint whiff of snake oil and cultishness. In fairness, his co-authors, Janet Doman and Susan Aisen, aren't quite so ridiculous.The latter two authors elaborate how to make the Bits of Intelligence--i.e., 11\\" by 11\\" laminated flashcards (but *don't* call these family heirlooms flashcards!)--which will give babies encyclopedic knowledge. They go into tedious detail--in fairness, it's no doubt useful for people who actually want to follow their precise instructions--about how to physically construct these \\"bits.\\" They also introduce various pieces of \\"in\\" jargon. Bits, you see, are filed under \\"categories\\" and categories are filed under exactly ten recommended \\"divisions.\\" They've got it all figured out, you see. Three levels of hierarchy are all that is needed to give your baby encyclopedic knowledge. A \\"bit\\" is, and I am not making this up, a picture and the name of the kind of thing that the picture is of. Imposed on top of the name-plus-picture is a \\"program\\" for each bit, which consists of exactly ten important facts, in ascending levels of complexity. Each level is called a \\"magnitude.\\" Exactly what *sorts* of fact are recommended to teach for which division are helpfully recommended. That is, there are 18 pages of topics/questions that correspond to the \\"magnitudes\\" for various popular and important categories of bits. For example, for \\"programs\\" about individual U.S. presidents (that'd be a \\"category\\"), the first \\"magnitude\\" fact is the state where the president was born.Oh, and then, in order to give your baby encyclopedic knowledge, you just have to flash a set of ten bits in front of the baby (while uttering the word or, later, the facts at greater \\"magnitudes\\"), one per second, three times per day. All told, you could go through the program in less than five minutes a day, it seems, and thereby give your baby encyclopedic knowledge. Among the daftest things Doman inflicts on the reader is the notion that, when a baby learns ten \\"bits\\" and has thereby learned ten discrete facts (never mind the ridiculous conceptual confusions in *that*), you have thereby given him 3.6 million \\"connections,\\" because there is that number of mathematical permutations of that number of facts. He takes a whole chapter to be impressed by this pedestrian insight, and never really answers the obvious question: so what?Now, I'm trying not to be too mean, but it's hard. For me, one of the biggest disappointments about this book is that it utterly fails to support its central assertion that undertaking the program described in the book will \\"give your baby encyclopedic knowledge,\\" or that the wunderkinder were made so by being flashed a lot of bits. I also am utterly baffled why one ought to use flashcards as opposed to good old books. That was never explained that I saw. Now, for all I know, the program works brilliantly and the world just hasn't woken up to it. I am open-minded enough to think that it might, and that Doman and his colleagues simply have not done their own methods justice in this book. Indeed, like any parent who wants the best for his children, I was rooting for the authors. After all, I already knew that very small children can be taught to read (search YouTube for \\"baby reading\\" for some remarkable videos).But I was very disappointed. I was prepared to do without research data (albeit very reluctantly). I was prepared to try to analyze individual cases and theories--but there really aren't any here, not of any weight. You just get some nice generalizations about smart children--nothing at all like a case study--and then an explanation of how to make and use \\"bits of intelligence,\\" without any explanation whatsoever of how using bits on babies will turn them into the wunderkinder.Suppose the program is as wonderful and brilliant as Doman promises. Suppose Doman's motivations are as admirable as he tiresomely portrays them (he says children have the right to be made intelligent, and says several times how certain wunderkinder are his favorite people, and how he tears up when their feats of brilliance show how his program works, to the astonishment of the unbelievers). And he's been at this for many decades; he's pushing 90. Suppose he firmly and sincerely believes his hype. Then why on Earth would he not go out of his way to test his claims scientifically? Or to let or encourage someone else test them? I must assume that there are no supportive studies, because they aren't reported on in this book. But that then makes the book utterly useless from a scientific point of view. Doesn't Doman and the staff at his Institutes know that if science proves him right, many more people will follow the methods? Wouldn't that further their inherently philanthropic mission?I mean no insult to any of the well-meaning mothers and others using Doman's methods--indeed I mean no *insult* to anyone at all. For all I know, you're doing the right thing for your children and you have given them a lot of useful knowledge. Bravo for that. Indeed I might try my own little unscientific experimentation with my own little boy and some online powerpoint \\"bits.\\" This review is not about you or Doman's methods, it is about Doman's very disappointing book.Two stars, for passing along a few interesting ideas about how to entertain kids, who definitely are like little sponges and who desperately want to learn."},{"Title":"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge (The Gentle Revolution) (Gentle Revolution (Gentle Revolution Press))","review":"I thought this book had great ideas and it really inspired me to try them with my child. However when it came to actually making the cards required (bit of intelligence cards) I am finding difficulty aquiring the appropriate pictures to use and as such I cannot get started.

I believe the princilpes in this book to be sound and that they would definelty help any child to aquire more general knowledge."},{"Title":"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge (The Gentle Revolution) (Gentle Revolution (Gentle Revolution Press))","review":"I was so lucky to read this book and 4 other books by the same author when my baby son was 9-mon, I spent 5 nights to read Doman's 5 books, and started to teach my son with Doman's method immediately. I started with 25 words and add 5 new words every day, 1 second per word, 3 times a day. Same thing with the bits cards and math cards. To my surprise, my son absorbed every thing so quickly and after 3 weeks, he started pointing to the right objects so often when I showed him the word!I attended Dr. Doman's \\"How to multiply your baby's intelligence\\" baby brain development course in his \\"The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential\\" in Philadelphia in order to meet those experts and little geniuses in person. The Institute is for both well babies and brain injured babies, which was founded by Doman 50 years ago. It is a non-profit organization. ([...])We saw all those 4-6 year-old kids and other 8-12 year-olds in their Institutes could read more than 3 languages, read many big thick books, do Math, science and encyclopedia, gymnastics, swim, play violin in almost professional high level!!! They were taught by their parents who most of them did not have any foreign languages and musical background and etc. Everybody in the class was astonished, thrilled and speechless; many were cried in the very formal graduation ceremony.I started teaching my son reading when he was 9 months old. And the result was amazing. Three weeks later he could point to his name word when I say his name; and point to my bellybutton when I showed him the big word card: bellybutton. However, he lost interest of reading completely in 2 months when he can walk around. I had to stop my teaching for a while and search for methods that can intrigue his interest.When he turned 18 months old, he can accurately name and read every part of the world map puzzle, he can read all other body and organ parts words and flower/tree parts words and other 1,000 words cards. When he is 21 months old, he can read dozens of children books. Now my son is 25 months old, I am starting teaching him the elementary curriculum for 10 to 20 minutes every day.My son is just an ordinary child, if you think he is a GENIUS, then every baby is a GENIUS including your baby, as stated in Doman's theory, because every baby is able to read and do math if you prepare such an environment and opportunity for him to learn. And babies love to learn, it is fun and it is their surviving skill...You do not need a college degree to be able to send your child to college or even Harvard, the love with all your heart to your child makes the real difference when you decide not taking the chance of winning a baby Einstein lottery that might be related to your family Genius Gene. Every hard effort you put to your baby, God knows, and your child knows.Do not waste your baby's precious first 6 genius years! I highly recommend this book and all Dr.Doman's books!It might be too overwhelmed to spend weeks to cut and write hundreds of words cards and math cards, you can buy a set of \\"Teach your baby to read within one year kit\\" for $9.99 on eBay. You can type the keyword \\"Teach Your Baby to Read within 1 Year Kit / Montessori\\" on eBay to search for the kit and the relevant subjects' material."},{"Title":"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge (The Gentle Revolution) (Gentle Revolution (Gentle Revolution Press))","review":"My family used Glenn Doman's program many years ago - my husband and I both attended the week long seminar in Pa. and our children were members of their off-campus program.

It is mostly composed of old/traditional hymns. The negative point I found on it is in regards the arrangements that don't work very well in the guitar and don't look very good on the piano either (I play just a little bit of piano so I cannot tell that for sure). I was able to re-harmonize and re-arrange most of the hymns so if you have a good theoretical background or can do arrangements by yourself it can be a good guide for you to start.

Iwould have to say that it certainly has many hymns I am familiar with and covers the \\"Living Hymns\\" hymnal we use in the Baptist church I go to fairly well. I gather if you are Anglican or Uniting your milage may vary significantly so check out the index first.The book is easy to use and well laid out. Chords are very good and have had no difficulty transposing them to the same key as the organist plays and playing along (this is not always as straigforward as it sounds as some of the chords you get off the free sites just don't sit well with someone playing from the music).If you recognise a reasonable number of the hymns from the contents page then buy it you won't be dissapointed. If you don't recognise most of the hymns then this is probably not what you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Hymn Fake Book: A Collection of Over 1000 Multi-Denominational Hymns, Melody, Lyrics, Chords","review":"Good, useful reference. If you don't know many of the hymns here, you may want to look them up in a traditional hymn book to learn the arrangement details; they're worth learning.\\"C Edition\\" means it's written for instruments that are in the key of C. It does not mean that all the songs are written in the key of C. Some instruments have their music written based on a different key. Alto and Baritone Saxophone are Eb instruments. Tenor and Soprano Saxophone are Bb instruments, and Clarinets are usually Bb instruments too. Trumpet and Cornet can be in B flat or C. English horn and French horn parts are usually written in F. Alto flute is in G. So any of those instruments would have to transpose this music to read and play it properly. But guitarists, pianists, and singers will find the C Edition to be just fine for their needs."},{"Title":"The Hymn Fake Book: A Collection of Over 1000 Multi-Denominational Hymns, Melody, Lyrics, Chords","review":"This book is amazing! More hymns than you can shake a stick at. Earlier people gave the book a lower rating because they didn't know all the hymns. That's silly. The book has almost a 1000 multi-denominational hymns, you can't expect to know every single one! I recommend this book to church bands, organists, and anybody who likes hymns or fake book music or both. A great tool to learn on."},{"Title":"The Hymn Fake Book: A Collection of Over 1000 Multi-Denominational Hymns, Melody, Lyrics, Chords","review":"An enormous collection of hymns, from many different hymnals. Many &quot;old chestnuts&quot; in easy to read and play format. This book was a lifesaver when I became a church organist, and I still use on occasion. It does what it does very well, but it has a fairly specific tareget."},{"Title":"The Hymn Fake Book: A Collection of Over 1000 Multi-Denominational Hymns, Melody, Lyrics, Chords","review":"I love this edition of a Hymn Fake Book! Anytime I decide to play a certain Hymn on my guitar for Church and choose a song out of my Baptist Hymnal, I pretty much can find that song in this book. The chords are easy and you have the melody to play along on the piano if you have any doubts. Absolutely love this book and I do not regret this purchase!"},{"Title":"The Hymn Fake Book: A Collection of Over 1000 Multi-Denominational Hymns, Melody, Lyrics, Chords","review":"Lots of great songs, only problem is the plastic binding makes it impossible to turn the pages w/o jamming the pages where they connect to the binding.

I know many, many of the hymns in this book and now I get to REALLY read and understand them better. I play them at home for my own enjoyment on either my piano or organ. I have directed and sung in many choirs and ensembles and have also done some solo performances. I \\"switched\\" to an evangelical worship style as an adult and learned an even greater repertoire of spiritual songs, and many of those are in this book too. I keep other fake books of praise songs that were written in the most recent years. But this is the book I return to for my private but often joyful worship at home. I even grab it so I can sing along to the same hymns when they are played on the radio! If your background is remotely similar to mine, buy it and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Hymn Fake Book: A Collection of Over 1000 Multi-Denominational Hymns, Melody, Lyrics, Chords","review":"As a leader of my church's worship band - and able to take just so many content-less praise choruses in a Sunday service - I was excited to learn about a book with guitar chords for 1000 hymns. I thought, this is just what I've been looking for to be able to add some good 'truth' to the great 'spirit' that the band was bring to Sunday AM worship. However, I must say that I was dissapointed when I got a look at the book. I've grown up in evangelical churches and this collection is not aimed at this background. I have been singing hymns for over thirty years now, (and probably have the words of more than one verse for over 300 memorized) but I can turn page after page after page in this collection and not recognize a one. My feeing is that probably only a fifth of the hymns with which I am most familiar are in this collection. I'm not sure where these hymns come from, but they're just *not* what's found in the mainstream evangelical hymnals I grew up with."},{"Title":"A Natural History of Raccoons","review":"This book provides more detailed information about raccoons than any other I have read. MacClintock seems to know an astonishing amount about these wonderful creatures, and she shares her knowledge in prose that is clear and insightful. My only regret is that the book offers drawings rather than photographs; the drawings are good, but photos would have made this book perfect."},{"Title":"A Natural History of Raccoons","review":"This is a delightful read. Anyone who has raccoons in their lives (or garbage cans) will gain a greater appreciation (and possible love) for these critters through Dorcas MacClintock's right-to-the-heart writing.I loved the drawings, some made me laugh as raccoon antics were masterfully illustrated.This book is a treasure..."},{"Title":"A Natural History of Raccoons","review":"I was looking for a more nuts and bolts facts about raccoons. Too much story telling and not enough study about the raccoons behavior for my needs."},{"Title":"The Radicals Behind the American Revolution: Six Who Spoke for Freedom","review":"Richard Horton's excellent volume \\"The Radicals Behind the American Revolution\\" is an engaging, very readable book that includes salient histories of six of the founding fathers. There is a chapter devoted to describing and analyzing the contribution of each of these heroes to the American revolution. Interestingly, four of them, Patrick Henry, Richard Lee, George Mason and Thomas Jefferson are Virginians, and contrast with Sam Adams who was from Massachusetts. Horton reviews the brilliant writings of Tom Paine, an English immigrant, who not only wrote Common Sense, but also wrote a series of essays called the American Crises in which he coined the name United States of America. The chapters contain quotations of the most significant writings of the six statesmen. Horton points out that each was a champion of states' rights and opposed to a strong federal government. This was an outgrowth of their opposition to the British rule of the colonies. Only Jefferson accepted the need for a strong federal government, and this was somewhat later in the evolution of the United States as an independent government. The volume contains an introductory chapter about the American colonies that sets the scene of the early days of the revolutionary era. It concludes with an analytic chapter that summarizes the trends and major political contributions of these founding fathers. Although it is a quick read, there is a great deal of interesting material in this volume. It is an excellent American history book for adults and college students who want to know more about the founding of the country."},{"Title":"The Radicals Behind the American Revolution: Six Who Spoke for Freedom","review":"A well written slice of history which helps understanding why the American Revolution took place. The presentation of the views from six influential individuals made the manuscript original and easy to read. This book is a must for any immigrant who wonders how the United States of America became such a land of opportunities."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I unfortunately haven't had the privilege to read the 2nd book in this series, though I do have #1 and #3 of the series. Very spellbinding, addictive as someone else have stated before. What attracted me to this series is simply the title - FORBIDDEN game. It's human nature to do what we're told not to - out of curiosity, or an insane bravery to see for ourselves? Anyway, my books are losing pages, I've had them for years now, figured it be a good thing to get a book with the whole series included in one.I see everyone's point - why would Jenny go for Tom instead? Julian is gorgeous, enticing, outrageous and powerful. Tom... well, he's our typical average male teen. I think Jenny made the right choice though - Julian is great and all, but if you come right down to the nitty gritty, he's not human and that should be enough to make your blood chill. Hell, I'd run if he tried to get me.Also, last of all - the Bible states that Satan/Lucifer was one of God's most beautiful angels. Completely evil, but beautiful. Now, doesn't that make you wonder?Ultimately a brilliant series, got me interested in runes and magic, etc. Has anyone been crazy enough to try out the runes in the books? Please let me know if you did!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I bought this book when i was 16. This was the first book to ever make me cry, and i have been reading since kindergarden. Julian was magnificent. Every page he was on just drew you further in.For a young adult series, which in this edition has all 3 books in one volume, it is still my all time favorite book. As much as i adore Susan Kay's \\"Phantom\\" this book still comes in before that one on my list of favorites.Someone already mentioned the fact that \\"labyrinth\\" was similar, but those of you associated with \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", in particular the 2004 musical staring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum will find a number of similarities. The symbolism of the rose and the ring. The love triangle. Jenny is very similar to Christine. She is 17 in the book, and i think that is around the age Christine was in the movie. Julian, who is the opposite of the Phantom yet the same in many ways, has been watching Jenny since she was 5. the phantom watched over christine in the film since she was 7. There is the boyfriend/lover of tom who is raoul in every aspect. And let's not forget the masquerade ball in the second book. Any Phantom phan should give this series a chance.Again, prepare to be devastated in the end. The book is in deed tragic, and though Julian was made physically perfect compared to the phantom who was hideously ugly since birth. They both are men who were born in to a life never meant to be loved, but inevitably do."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This is definetley the best book i've ever read. The carchacters were well chosen and the plot was wonderful. The only wrong with it was the ending. The bad guy Julian was my favorite caracter and well she shouldn't have done that to him. I really hope ljsmith reconsiders and rights a sequel."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This book is the best ever and you'll definitely fall in love with Julian (if you're a girl, that is). LJ Smith is an excellent writer and her villain characters are so gorgeous. They have such an appeal that u will easily fall in love with them. The story is great, so I definitely recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This is an awesome book. I read it not long ago. I think Julian is so hot and I wish that he and Jenny had fallen in love. I think that Tom is a stupid over-protective boyfriend. But I totally LOVED the book. I cryed @ the end of it. I hope L.J. Smith comes out with a fourth book of it soon! I love how she describes everything, like Jenny's dreams and every little detail. It is so romantic when Julian gave her the silver rose. The books were really well written, I didn't think that I would even like any of them, but I find myself constantly thinking about Julian and Jenny. I couldn't put the books down, I ended up reading all of them in two days! It was a fast but great read. I've read many of L.J. Smiths other books too. I think she's a great writer, and there isn't one of her books that I've read that I haven't absolutely loved. Look for my reviews on her other books."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I first read this when i was roughly 15-16. the dates don't matter, just the fact that its forever shaped my reading. it was the second series of L.J. Smith's that i'd read and forever cemented my adoration of this writer. Ever since, every six or seven months, i've pulled out these books and reread them, because as much as i know the series has ended i've forever waited for the possbility of more. this series has been the spark for most all interests i've had, be it demonology, norse mythology, and even ufo's and photography. the characters are amazing. each one finds a place in your heart, even (and sometimes especially) the djin/demon/devil of a bad boy, Julian. if you love any sort of supernatural romance, this will surely find its way in your all time favorites list."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I've had the trilogy for over 10 years now and to me, this is the most vivid and powerful of LJ Smith's writing. I've read quite a lot of books in my life time (thousands let's say) and still this one remains fresh in my mind--and for one reason. Julian.His yearning for something that was never meant to be his, the very direct opposite of what he is. He was her enemy but he loved her so very much. Like most of the readers here, I wondered what the heck Jenny was thinking in chosing Tom? I know LJ Smith made a good effort at pitching Tom as the right choice but I still don't think anyone could have been better then Julian.Julian loved Jenny more, and in loving her, became something other then the creature he was born as. He transcended what he was, risked all for a chance to love and for that, he is my all time favorite hero. He was never a villan to me, even when he was being cruel.I REALLY hope that LJ Smith will write a story about Julian and not make it a young adult or teen book. I think his story needs to be told. I think he deserves a happy ending. Now that she is writing again, I read in her blog that writing a adult story about Julian is a possibility. I urge everyone to write to her publishers and demand it. More then any of her other stories, this is the one that needs to be written.So overall - loved it! Loved it! Loved it!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"And even now that I would technically constitute as a real adult, I still love this book, and all of L.J. Smith's work.Smith weaves together a tale that is fantastic--in the old sense. Like fantasy--and suspenseful. She creates a Shadow World by taking pieces of legend from different mythologies and blending them expertly with her own ideas.Her characters, while at first seem a little flat or one sided (Tom the handsom, confident jock; Zack the withdrawn, introvert artist; Audrey the diva socialite), do grow through these three novels, and they become a little more multifaceted. Toward the end, even Julian the antagonist develops some. But most of the character development seems to center around Jenny. Fitting, I suppose, since she is the main character.Smith does have a problem with tags. Tags, for anyone unfamiliar with the term, is a word or phrase used in association with a character to help the reader remember who s/he is, what s/he looks like, or how s/he typically acts. Tags are great, but when overused, they tend to get distracting, and even a bit annoying. By the middle of the first book, it was drilled into my head that Audrey has \\"spiky copper bangs\\" and that Michael runs a hand \\"through his rumpled dark hair\\" a LOT. Smith could have improved her writing by coming up with a few different phrases for each character, and alternating between them so the reader doesn't come across the same ones over and over.I still gave this collection of the three novels five stars because its pros far outweigh its cons. The plots are original and exciting. I read the books maybe once a year, and it's a joy every time. In an age where teen fiction is rapidly turning toward the fantastic, influcenced by things like Harry Potter, L.J. Smith has provided today's teens and young adults with some outstanding literature."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I can't honestly say that this was the absolute best book I've ever read, but this was certainly the most addicting. I checked this out from the school library, and not even two threats of detention kept me from reading it all throughout my classes. I got it that morning, and I finished it that night in my closet with a flashlight. It's one of the books that literally compells you to read it. And Julian is the most addictive male character I've ever come across. If I were Jenny, I would've just fainted into his arms. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who's willing to read it under their covers."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I have never been so attracted to someone that i have never met and is completely fictional!! The way L J Smith describes Julian is incredible, no body could resist him. I originally read these books when i was 15 and i'm 24 and still reading them. I have recommended these books to everyone i know. Point Horror's illustration of Julian is so much better than this book cover i agree it does not do the Shadow Man justice! I cant wait to read more of L J Smith's books. I'm so glad to see that so many other people share my opinion! If you liked this style of book i urge you to read The Year of The Cat by Zoe Daniels. Take Care all Julian Lovers x"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This book is totaly awsome.Anyone out there who hasn't read it, my opinion is that you won't regret spending your time on it. The only thing though that I didnt really like was Jenny left Julian, and he died in the end. I was actually hoping that they would somehow end up happily together. Other then that ,I would also like to say that I personaly think Ms Smith is an excelent writer. Her imaginations are are so out of this world. Please do countinue to write your wonderful stories.And I really hope that there will be a fourth book on The Forbidden Game."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This book was so good! It was really sad, but it ended so good! If you read this book it will end with you wanting to read it again and again! In this book Julian showed he cared. If he hadn't threatened Jenny and her friends lives he would have been so right for her! When Tom finally showed his love he won her back. It was a desperate fight for a courages girl in which only one can win! Read this book!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I totally fell in love with this book. At first I got it because of the front cover and I saw how hot Julian was. But then I got into it and realized it's a wonderfully crafted mystical, magical, and suspensful book. The ending sorta sucked though but It's still my favorite book ever. I love L.J Smith's work. This book rocks!!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I like the 3 books a lot.I could not put them down. I think the l.j.Smith is a good writer.I hope she makes more love and fear books."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"It has been a while since I've read these teenage horror stories but Ms. Smith's Daughters of Darkness has started me up again. I finally read the Hunter and I think it was a great book and now I am starting on the second one. I think Jenny was a dork to leave Julian, and on top of that, for Tom! Oh, well, that's life in an LJ Smith book. I also want to say her vampire diaries and secret circle and her night world series are also very good and should be read, too."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"EVERYTHING ABOUT IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

JULIAN WAS GREAT SO WAS JENNY."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Julian, in my eyes, is the perfect guy. I didn't like him at first, until his sensitive side was shown. He's gorgeous on top of all of that. Tom seems to be a big, football playing, over-protective dork!!! If only Jenny had though twice and carved Julian's name back into the runestave and forgotten about Tommy. This book was excellent. It was the first L.J. Smith book that I have ever read and I loved it. After reading that I was immediatly hooked on L.J. Smith. I've read six of the Night World books and the 1st,2nd, and 4th of the Vampire Diaries. I LOVE L.J. SMITH!! I can't wait till she writes the continuation to The Forbidden game.END"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"First of all, I should tell anyone who hasn't read this book to read it. I have about 100 times, and believe me, I never get bored of it. My favorite character is Julian. He is so fine!!! He can shadow over me if he likes, I think he's devine!! I also think that no matter how good of book it is, it had a horribe ending! I think Tom is a stuck-up pig who can't stand up for himself and has a tantrum when his girlfriend kisses some other boy. But still, over all, it is an excellent book!!!!! A rating of 10 and a half.( Even though the ending was very dumb) Even though I have not read any other L.J.Smith books, I know that The Forbidden Game is the best of her writings!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"IT's one of the best books I have ever read and the people that write negative comments about L.J Smith's books shouldn't put in their review at all. Ms. Smith showed 2 sides of Julian, at the beginning I didn't like him but then as I read more it seemed that their were two sides to him. And I think he really loves Jenny to watch her for that long. I don't think he should have died. Jenny should have carved his name back onto the runestave and dumped Tom. He's just a wimp."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Ths is the most awesome trilogy except for the Secret Circle. Julian is sooo sexy but I wouldn't have stayed with him or Tommy, eh! They both weren't right for her. Jenny made such a bad mistake, L.J.Smith should really spice it up."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I'm a huge Fan of Fantasy novels and such, I read The Forbidden Game awhile back, and I still like to read it now. It is one of the greatest trilogy of books I have read since i picked up Lord of the Rings the first time. It's a series of books that you never tire of reading, and everyone should read them."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Wow! Reading the reviews i was amazed! i didn't think before i'd read them that anyone else had fallen for a character in a book but oh my, Julian! wow he's just the perfect man, and i did imagine myself as Jenny. How great it would have been for a shadow man to cross over to earth just to get you to love him. I would have gone with him, it's like L J Smith's words had seduced the minds of the readers into this extrordinary fixation with this beautiful boy, Julian.I absolutely loved the books to bits and sometimes when i'm out and i'll see something it reminds me of the book and i get this feeling and remember the fun i had readin them! So guyz, gals everyone. It doesn't cost an awful lot so why not buy it...you'll be surprised at how right us reviewers are about Julian!thanks for reading"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"As in all Smith's books (that I've read so far anyway) this suspense novel, too will mesmerize you. It'll send chills down your spine, you'll love and hate Julian at the same time. He's just so obsessive and sick minded, but his love is true. I recommend LJ Smith's Dark Visions series, the Night World Series, and the Vampire Diaries--Go read."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"First of all this is probably one of L J Smith's better trilogies. It's well thought out and all of the characters have full roles to play and real personalities to match (something the writer is sometimes guilty of leaving out-see Secret Circle.) The beautiful unearthly Julian is an immortal being, a shadow man who inspires nightmares and doesn't have feelings, until he sees Jenny Thornton and falls in love with her. Jenny and her friends are kidnapped by Julian and taken to the Shadow world, if she won't love Julian he will make her love him through a series of games using her friends as bargainning chips against her.The books are well plotted above average Young Adult fare that I still read at the age of 20. Smith draws on Norse mythology and the psychology of nightmares to make the books as real as possible. You can't help but feel for the characters as they face their worst nightmares:the loss of a friend, and the tangles of love to grow stronger. Typically of Smith's books Jenny must choose between the good Tom,the love of her life since kindergarten, or the exotic Julian a devil who has watched and loved her since she was 5, who desires her light for his darkness. I won't give the ending away, but six years after reading it for the first time I still grieve over the ending and the choice Jenny must make, now that's the sign of a damn good book. This is quirkier and less formulaic than some of L.J Smith's newer series but if you enjoy it check out Dark Visions, it's also a keeper!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"wow! what can i say?! i absolutely loved this book! julian of course is just sooo amazing (sorry, that word again, but he left me speechless!!) he is so gorgeous and i couldn't help myself from falling in love with him. i don't want to give too much away 'cause i hate reading a book when the ending is given away-it totally spoils my enjoyment of it. On that note, i read one customer review of fg3 and i was sooo annoyed that someone gave the ending away-it was all i kept thinking about the entire read-so please, have some thought for your fellow ljs fans and be considerate. Anyway, reading this book, my heart was constantly beating faster, i felt i couldn't breathe half the time...what was julian going to do next? ljs writes characters you can really believe in, and jenny was a great, strong heroine, although how she put up with tom i don't know...&quot;choose julian!&quot; i was mentally screaming at her many times. the supporting cast are great, too; a real mix of varied characters, just like you find in real life. all i can say is BUY IT - you'll never be happy unless you do!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"There is NOTHING I can say to match how I feel about L.J.

The characters seem real. It is romantic, suspenseful &amp; dynamic. The Forbidden Game had my heart slamming into my chest from the excitement!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"It's clever, odd, and eeriely romantic. The trilogy is based on romance between light and dark, or how Julian describes it, white and black. Julian is a creature you fall in love with, you can't help it. The wicked charm from the devil is his main use. Jenny is sweet and kind, but also brave, bold, and intelligent. It shows interesting facts, and the secrets of unconditional love, in a more wicked sort of way. And, no, it is not nasty:)."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This book is the best I've ever read. It keep me on the edge of my seat.

When a girl, Jenny Thorne, enters a mysterious game shop, she meets Julian, a striking young man. Later, Jenny learns that Julian is a &quot;Shadow Man&quot; and has longed for Jenny since she was 5. Jenny refuses him, and Julian draws her into a world of danger and magic. Jenny's friends acompany her on this mystical, dark journey.

It's still the most wonderful book in the world (shadow world included)."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Divine! This book is absolutely divine!

But as I read, I realized that this book is outstanding! I recommended it to all of my friends.

I also love the important moral of the last book, &quot;I am my only master.&quot;"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I will worship Julian until the day I die. The whole series (The Hunter, The Chase,&amp; The Kill)is awesome. Julian is the perfect combination of Ash and Thierry.(Anyone with the name &quot;Julian&quot; has to be sexy) The scene in the cave at the ShadowPark, was so well written. It was tender and moving, but not mushy and cloying. L.J. Smith has such a wonderful way of writing the romantic scenes so they don't end up overly dramatic. She is a wonderful author and I'm looking forward to STRANGE FATE:NIGHT WORLD 10). Oh, and Julian is not dead, he lives forever in my dreams."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This book only got a nine because of it's ending!! By the end of the story when Julian dies, I really felt like ripping Tom's throught out!!!!!!!

He did do everything for love!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I've only readn the first book in this series the hunter.

If you dont ever read this you will miss out on an extrodinar's work!! I simply must confess i was very sad that Julian had to die, he is like Ash the perfect guy ever!! As always she put a little bit of a twist on the story. For some strange reason(if your really into the book)you feel as if you are in the story going through this!! I wanted to go out and try to find a game like this one!! THIS IS A MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This series is one of the best I have ever read! L J Smith is absolutely brilliant when it comes to suspense and romance. I myself cried at the end and I definitely would recommend this series to anyone. The books were so intense."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This is a great book and one of her best books yet! Remember to grab one now before all the copys are sold out! If you like her Night World books, you must read this too! In my personal opinion, Julian is a mix of Quinn(The Chosen), Ash(Daughters of Darkness) and Theirry(Soulmate). He is one of my very favourite characters. So, this is a MUST-READ!!!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"The Forbidden Game is the best set of books I have ever read. (And the Night World rulz too! Please read my review of Daughter of Darkness and e-mail me if u like it) It is wonderfully written and draws you straight into it so you can feel the emotions of all the charcters. I had always loved the Night World. I remember one day looking at the back page and thinking about all the times I had seen an advertisment for the books. Since my bookstore didn't carry it, I had to order it. I recieved the large book complete w/ all 3 stories. From the opening page I was unable to put it down untill the end. Throughout the book I found myself falling in love w/ Julian. (Just like Ash in Daughters of Darkness) Julian was a cocky, smart mouthed trouble maker, but like a hurt child underneath it all. A hurt child that could strike out w/ lethal accuracy. Handsome and slick as a cobra, he lived a life full of excitment, and sadly, etched w/ pain. He was amazing and loveable despite his hard exterior through most of the book. The chacacters were great and well formed. Jenny is a strong herione and that makes the book great. Dee was a great charatcter w/ her goddess looks and strong mind. In real life she would go far. Audrey was of course was the fashion diva, but it went deeper that that. She was a young lost women w/ a heart of gold. Micheal was a wonderful character. Cuddly like a teddy bear and completly lovable. Audrey has good taste. Zach sounded like a wonderful artist and a terrific abstract thinker. A brain as fast as a whip and a heart that was warm underneath all his protective ice. Summer was the sweet flower, and the poor child was small but had a heart w/ the determintaion of a little lion just learning to be brave. And of course how could we forget Tom. The arrogant Tom Locke who was taught a very important lesson. You never no what you have untill you lose it. I have to say my favorite part is in the last book, in the cavern after Jenny almost drowns. How she resisted Julian then, I will never know. It was the most amazing transformation of Julian throughout the entire book. I could see his haunted eyes in the firelight as I read that part over and over again. This was also the first AND ONLY book to ever make me cry. The end was very sad, and as I look back, I see it was enevitable. Like Jenny said, Julian was too dangerous to live. But he was a spirit of fire that would live on forever, even after death. I laughed, I cried, I was amazed. The Forbidden Game are the best series I have ever read. Each time I read it, it's like the first time. An emotional rollercoaster all over again. A true masterpeice. My best regards and wishes to L.J. Smith for the excellent series."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"It is truly amazing... this series blew me away when I first read it. I had heard fabulous things about it, but never expected them to be more then true! It is a darker side of the fantastical realm, but it is sheer genius in concept. Who hasn't had that tingly feeling they are being watched or feared that some day their worst nightmares may come true. Julian is an flawless demonstration of an unforgettable villain who is desperately struggling between his natural corruption and his love for Jenny. Jenny, the innocent heroine, who is pulled in two between her morality and Julian's ruthless attraction. Both trapped in a deadly game of dreams and nightmares. You cannot read this and not be challenged, rethinking your standards and questioning your strongest beliefs. So who made the right choice? Only you can decide. So take time out to read this book and just let your imagination soar and your fears come alive. The World of Shadows and all it's wonders await..."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"First of all this is probably one of L J Smith's better trilogies.

My friend, a great fan of L.J. Smith, had bought it, and she told me to read it. I don't usually go for fantasy tending towards horror, which was the genre I gathered this book to be in. However, I started reading it, figuring that if I didn't like it, I could always put it down. Well, as it turned out, I could barely bring myself to put it down to go to sleep. From the first page, I was enticed into the lives of Jenny Thornton, beautiful and innocent, though with something about her that attracts darkness; Dee, a lot of brawn but with a brain, though she doesn't want to admit it; Audrey, smart, chic and cosmoplolitan, grounded in reality; Summer, somewhat confused but with a great heart; Zach, artistic and cynical, who prefers to live in the worlds he creates; Michael, sarcastic and practical, outwardly a coward; and Jenny's boyfriend, Tom, handsome but somewhat arrogant, who takes Jenny for granted. The darkness Jenny has attracted is Julian, eerily and devistatingly handsome, with no gentle emotions to speak of...at least, on the surface. Cruel, but in love with Jenny. He leads her and her friends into a game where the price is their lives, in the hopes of winning Jenny. However, the end of that game is just the beginning of Julian's pursuit of Jenny. I found myself falling in love with Julian, the bad boy, but with a soft side to him, though it's hard to find. Reminiscent of the Phantom in The Phantom of the Opera, he simply wants a little beauty in his world of ugliness. L. J. Smith's writing is, in my opinion, flawless, and though I didn't like her ending in an emotional sense, that as well as the rest of the book had me spellbound, wishing for more. This book is a great read, whether or not you're already into fantasy."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I have to say, this is one of the best books I've read so far...L.J. Smith is a great writer and this is one of the best examples of her talent. This wonderful trilogy is both scary and romantic-a definite must-read for all who love danger and romance. You'll definitely fall in love with Julian, the nicest of the Shadow Men, straight from beginning to end. Sweet but tragic ending(hopefully Ms. Smith will realize the mistake she made with it and write a 4th book with Julian's return =).)"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"These books are totally out of this world, I just can't put it into words, I didn't know there was anyone else who felt this way about the books! They're spellbinding, you find yourself being totally wrapt up in Jenny's struggles, and you can't stop wishing it was you! I would SO have stayed with Julian, he's one of the only characters in a books like these that I've fallen for completely!The other characters are totally three dimentional too. My favorite is Dee. She's a real roll model, model beautiful, strong and confident, Michel is seriously, loveble like a nicer version of Tom, and Audrie is perfect for him. I wish Lisa had said more about Zach, he was really puzzling, and Summer made things interesting, being so innosent and sweet but ending up the way she did. But I have to say Julian is a real heartbreaker, if you read these books, you WILL fall in love with him, and you will want to read this book again and again. Julian's a bit like Ash, from the Night world books, only a thousand times more impossibly gorgeous! Lisa, this is an amazing trilogy, I won,t say it changed my life, but I find myself modelling the guys I go out with on Julian! I think I probably read this book-well 13 or 14 times a year and have done ever since I was 12 (NOW 16). I never get bored of it, and never will! Lisa it would probably make me and a lot of other people really happy, if you could find time to write another one about these guys, I promise you EVERYONE would buy it!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I came across L.J. Smith's name on one of the Twilight forums. Her books were regarded very highly, so I decided to give one of her series a try. My first available book happened to be The Forbidden Game trilogy. A little bit about each of three books.The HunterIn a few words, this is a story about Jenny, an ordinary good girl, and Julian, a \\"Dark Prince\\" who is in love with her. To lure Jenny in his world, Julian tricks her and 6 of her friends to play The Game, where all of them have to face their most horrific nightmares. If they win, they are free to go. If they lose, Jenny has to stay with Julian forever.This is a very well written book, characters are very real and relatable. Like many other reviewers, I found Julian extremely attractive in a dangerous way.The ChaseJulian is out and lures Jenny into another Game - \\"Lambs and Monsters,\\" in which her friends are caught one by one by the Snake and the Wolf. Jenny has to find the Shadow Man's base in order to free her friends and to be released from the promise she has given Julian in the previous game.I found this book less entertaining than \\"The Hunter.\\" It took almost half of the book for Julian to appear, the game itself was much weaker, we didn't learn anything new about the Shadow World, and there was too little interaction between Jenny and Julian.The KillSeriously, what a comeback after a snoozer the second book was!Jenny, Dee, Michael and Audrey are playing the final game to save their friends. Only this time they have to find an entrance to the Shadow World to be able to play.This book is everything I expected and more. We find out more about the Shadow World, about Julian and experience emotional growth of all characters.The book is scary, intense, and romantic at the same time. The ending is sad but you know it couldn't have ended any other way...Overall, a great YA fantasy series which I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I would be hard pressed to pick one of L.J. Smith's leading guys as my favorite, but Julien was and still is one of the most intriguing leads in all the books I have ever read. This book has it all, romance and intrigue, drama and suspense. But best of all, unlike a lot of the YA fiction that is out there it actually will keep you up at night wondering about who might be standing over your bed. The antagonist/protagonist(because by the end of the book, your rooting for our boy)is a wonderful mix of persuasion and force, and the Shadow race is enough to send chills and goosbumps over every inch of your back. And though the ending is sad and not what you might expect, it is not your same cut-and-dried happily ever after. This book leaves you with that question you always thought after you read a book that really strikes a cord in you \\"What happens next?\\"And I don't know about you, but that is what makes a great book for me. Lets put it this way...the first time I read this book I was fifteen, and I am now 25 and buying it here on amazon. Ten years is a good reference for a book I'd think!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This story attracted me to it at the age of 9 yrs. old, especially since of my love of vampire stories and such which comes from feminine figures drawn towards a dark power and other types of evil. I liked it because the girl \\"Jenny Thornton\\" was able to overcome \\"Julian's\\" grasp on her. She was able to overcome the evil thrown against her even though at times he seemed unbearable. Even though Julian loved her and tried almost everything to have her...still Jenny was able to succeed by the power of good. This story definitely stated the power of good over evil. In a way, she stood as an example for me: a symbol for all those, especially feminine, to stand up for ourselves in times of unspeakable evil and the \\"bad\\" in our lives. I hoped this review proved useful."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This is the phatest book i ever read and i cannot wait to read it again. it was one of the most beautiful stories of love i have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"These books are totally out of this world, I just can't put it into words, I didn't know there was anyone else who felt this way about the books!

Smiths' fans!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I think anyone who hasn't read this book needs to get their head examined. This was, and still remains to be the best book I've ever read. I also think anyone who's read this book and didn't cry is insane. L.J. Smith has a way with words and she knows how to move her readers, and I think this series is one of her best. Every person who reads this book will fall for Julian, no matter what, and I think L.J. Smith for the sake of her fans, should write another triology about Julian. Ya know someone hears about the Legendary Julian, and carves his name back in, and he comes back. Or something like that. I just want him to come back. When I first saw this series and read the back of the book it didn't seem that great to me. At first it seemed to unrealistic, but after you meet Julian you don't care about the reality of the book, you just can't put it down. I highly recommended this book to everyone!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I, and my sister both loved this book and fell in love with Julian. Every part of this book was great. The writting was great. The characters were great. L.J. Smith is great. Everything about it was great. It even made me cry. You've got to read this Series!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I have loved this series ever since I first picked it up four years ago. Whenever I read it, I can't put it down until I'm done. Julian is one of the most intriguing characters I have ever encountered. Jenny is a very strong heroine, even if she didn't make the right choice in the end. Everyone should read this book, and also Dark Visions by L.J. Smith."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This is the most incredible trilogy. The characters seemed like they were real people, and they captured my heart (especially Julian). This story has an incredible plot that makes you read on and on. Julian is stunning, with his mix of gentleness and power. If he was a real person, I would fall for him in a heartbeat. Or I may have already fallen for him. I read the books over and over, and the plot is just so real, it makes it seem like it's almost happening. This is the best trilogy in the world. L.J. Smith, this is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"The Forbidden Game trilogy is as real as you can get. While it might not be based on subjects that one encounters every day, you actually live it as the story unfolds. Even people who hate to read can not put this book down. L.J. Smith is an absolutely amazing writer, and this is the best of her works, matched only, perhaps, by The Secret Circle trilogy. If you haven't read anything she's written yet, I recommend starting here. After you do, you won't settle for anything less! This is the most wonderful, haunting book in the world."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I have read this book more times than you can imagine. I love how L.J.

Definately a must have, and now it's all in one volume!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Did anyone else find Julian as sexy as I did? I thought sheshould havegone with him, and I didn't like how the Shadow Men deteriorate from &quot;physical perfection&quot; into hideously ugly creatures.

Creepy horror with thought put into it, maybe there is hope for the young adult horror genre."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This is the collecter's edition of the triology The Forbidden Game, incorporating all three novels, The Hunter, The Chase and The Kill into one book. The cover art isn't very pretty and doesn't do Julian justice, but I do like the way Jenny looks on it. Anyway...The plot has been written out several times and I'm pretty sure that no one wants to read about it again. So I will just tell you what I thought of it.I read this for the first time when i was probably ten and i have loved it evr since. I was the only one who ever checked it out of the libray I think. I was glad to come to Amzon and find that over people liked it too.I just wish Julian and Jenny could have been together at the end. He did care about her more than Tom did. Julian would never snap at her or be arrogant, like Tom. I know it had to end the way it did, but why? Why? C'mon if you were in Jenny's shoes who would you pick? Arrogant Tom or ... Julian.BTW, whoever wrote that LJ Smith must have had a thing for the king of the Goblins in Labyrinth, right on! Julian DOES sound a lot like him, now that it's been mentioned."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Theese are well cool books i hav read them HEEPS of times fae the library &amp; theyr well cool L.

But as the game goes on Jenny's will grows causing big trouble for Julian.When I first started reading this I found myself pondering about Julian, why couldn't he touch Jenny without her permisson?

GREAT TRILOGY!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"these are really great books and i adore julian because he;s hot. in my opinion, jenny should of picked julian instead of that whiner and crybaby tom i didnt like him he's too chicken. i liked these books because they had information on runes and mythical worlds and all that stuff and it gives the readers a feel on fantasy and mythical things like the shadow men and all. julian is a great character but the ending in book three is really sad. i recommend this book anyways. excellent book"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I loved Julian!! I keep wondering what if the ending had turned out differently. It's beautiful, a story about a demon man who falls in love with a human, not exactly original, but always a good plot. How sad that he can have everything he would ever want, except human love. Tom is so boring compared to Julian, but then the ending couldn't turn out any other way. If it had turned out the way I wanted it to, I doubt I would like it half as much as I do."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Out of all of L.J. Smith's series I think this is the best one. I was totally in love with Julian halfway through the first book. By the third, I would so have stayed with him.

In a nutshell, BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT. IT'S ONE OF HER BEST VOLUMES YET.

I was not much into reading as a teenager. It is a great series, 3 part! It pulls you and and keeps you hooked! If you love Fantasy you will love this!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This series emerged when I was in middle school, nearly 15 years later, I still love it! Despite the fact that it's very dark and sexy, there's still a whimsical, innocent nature to it that no longer exists in teen novels. The author had a very interesting concept that was decently executed. To tell you the truth, however, I only read this series over and over again because I'm in love with Julian. He's like the Goblin King. (to all you Labyrinth lovers out there) If I were Jenny, I would have made different choices. =) Reading this again makes me wonder why Twilight is such a hit. I guess everything has it's time and place. LOVE THIS SERIES!"},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"Book 1: Has anyone ever wondered about the things in the shadows?

They only have till dawn to get out...otherwise, Julian, the shadow man that brought them there will keep Jenny forever.In Book 2, Julian is back again. But this time the game is lambs and monsters...In Book 3 the game continues, but as a treasure hunt.This is such a great series. One of my favorite parts of the series is seeing the characters grow and become stronger as time passes. It is interesting too, to realize that the strongest is also the weakest, and that there are some things that can quickly change your life forever."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This book made me love L.J. Smith. It's so wonderful. It has adventure, love, and excitment! A perfect book for teens and young adults. The whole set is nice because you read straight through. You pick up exactly where you left off. You can't put it down, you want to read and read until you get to the end! You just have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"This author has been my fav. for a long time. Even thouh her writing is somewhat repetitive and almost always has the same plots, I love her books nevertheless! Julian (of the forbidden game series) is totally smashing-evil, sexy, experienced and very, very well-described and developed. No offense, but I didn't like Jenny that much-she sounded like a goody-goody. In this trilogy, the sidekicks have much more of a role, and their personalities are different, which totally compliments the books. If you love an intriguing, fun, and absorbing flick, with just the tiniest tinge of romance, u will love this author. I recommend you start with this trilogy if this is your first time."},{"Title":"Forbidden Game, Collector's Omnibus Edition","review":"I think that this is probably one of the best books that I haveread in a long time...L.J. Smith's books are the best! She's a greatwriter! I couldn't put the book down after i startd on it! Like her other books, this one shows off her talent. She really makes the characters come alive...All I have to say is that it's a great book!"},{"Title":"The girl who sat by the ashes,","review":"This is a fantastic book for those who love faerie tales. The story of Cinderella is expanded upon, giving her an actual personality. It's especially heart-warming that the prince has to do more than match her up with a glass slipper to earn her love and her hand in marriage. I highly recommend this book to anyone who ever wished their beloved childhood faerie tales would never end (or at least, weren't so darn short!) If you can't find this book, I would also recommend &quot;Deerskin&quot; and &quot;Beauty&quot; by Robin McKinley, and &quot;Briar Rose&quot; by Jane Yolen. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Shih Tzu (Re Dog)","review":"Apart from the history which was interesting, the contents covered the other topics in a very cursory fashion. The book was long on emotion as to &quot;how marvellous your wonderful new puppy is&quot; but gave little practical information on what a new owner wants to know as far as puppy care is concerned(first night at home, house training etc) which were glossed over in a couple of sentences. Far more space (and lavish photos) taken on showing the dog and flossying it up - a lot of owners just want an everyday pet, not a prima donna."},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Shih Tzu (Re Dog)","review":"This book is great if you're looking to figure out whether your shih tzu is showable and can participate in competitions. Other than that, there are far more helpful books out there in terms of puppy care, how to work with and train a shih tzu, etc. I didn't learn anything from this book since I don't intend to show my dog.

Unfortunately, this book delivers instead a lot of language that is confusing and unclear to the stated age group (4-8 years) (\\"Cheiloschisis (cleft lip and harelips) is possibly linked to nutritional deficiencies in the dam, or stresses or drug/chemical exposure.\\" p. 50), and information that is downright shocking and not quite what you want to be explaining to a five-year-old at bedtime (\\"As late as 1937 there was a common belief that, although the Chinese were at least willing to sell their Shih Tzu, they did not want them to leave the country and would put powdered glass in their food before they left.\\" p.5) If I had to recommend this book for an age group, I would suggest 9-12, but frankly the book is so poorly written that I suggest you look around for books with several good reviews and read or acquire them for your youngster instead of this one."},{"Title":"Picture Bride (Yale Series of Younger Poets)","review":"This book was, I believe, the first book by an Asian American to win the Yale Younger Series of Poets Award. For that, it deserves to be read and respected.My mood changed, though, as I read this book. Initially, I found it very beautiful - well composed, clean, and pleasant. As I kept reading, though, I found myself a little annoyed by all the \\"asian-ey\\" elements. Bamboo, shakuhachi, jacaranda, Utamaro, etc. Now, I think there's nothing inherently wrong with Asian imagery, it just felt like I got too big a dose of it here. All so idealized, stereotyped and archetypal. I can't recall reading much shadow in her lines - but this was written when she was 27. Perhaps I should read her more recent work to see how she's evolved.I found this book through Hyphen Magazine's Winter 2011 profile of poetry. They wrote PICTURE BRIDE is \\"infused with rich painterly imagery and a contemplative, quiet tone...Song's poems tell stories about her ancestral and artistic roots. 'I am not surprised / by how little the world changes' she professes, as her poems capture the timelessness of memories in their continual influence on the present.I can't argue with that rendering - this book is well worth a read, and perhaps a re-read. But on this first read, I was only somewhat satisfied."},{"Title":"Picture Bride (Yale Series of Younger Poets)","review":"I first read this collection while in college in the early 90's. I'm also an Asian-American girl from Hawaii so I could relate to many of her themes, but you do not need to be Asian or from Hawaii to appreciate her lovely poetry.

I thought those crazy cats at Harvard who wrote this guide were witty and insightful. If you are under 26, and especially if you are traveling alone, its very helpful. It would have been nice if they included more detailed historical backgrounds on each country, but considering they packed information about 20 or so countries in that fairly small book, I'll forgive them.

Its what Frommers &quot;Europe on X $ a day&quot; used to be, a good source of factual information and bargains. Contrary to what you may believe this book is useful to people above 26 as well, not just the backpackers. The let's go publishers do need to realize its not just the kiddies that read the book, its for everyone who wants to visit Europe without going broke. My only criticisms are is that they dont seem to realize people over 26 read this book so they dont hunt bargains for them. It also is filled with irrelevant information and the Northern Countries get far less coverage than the southern ones.An example Spain gets almost more coverage than all of Scandanavia and the baltic states put together.Overall Id say the book was a must buy but id also say that if you want more in-depth info you would want to also get either the Lets go country books or Lonely Planet series."},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"Over the years Let's Go Europe has attempted to add more countries to their Europe guide, at the expense of detail about more traditional destinations. In the 1998 edition, there is so much information on Russia, The Baltics, Poland, Bosnia (yep!) and the East Mediterranean that Western Europe is left with only half the book, and not enough detail. Since relatively few travellers venture into these areas, I question their decision to include them in a Europe book. I ended up buying their UK, France, &amp; Germany books to provide enough detail to plan my trip. I'll still take Let's Go Europe with me, since it's a valuable resource, but I wish they had left Eastern Europe to its own book."},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"Let's Go: Europe is a good guide for people who want to have fun and save money, but it shouldn't be the only guide. The book's attitude is fantastic: funny and positive, with a budget focus, but not afraid to call bullsh*t on tourist traps. The listings, on the other hand, leave a lot to be desired. Many are incomplete, wrong, and/or out of date. Actual prices in the off-season were always at least 20% higher than the ones listed. I ran into big trouble trying to book a room in Amsterdam with this book and I thank my lucky stars that I also had the Rough Guide, which saved my life. There have been lots of exposes lately on how it's impossible for budget guidebook authors to see and evaluate everything on their skimpy budgets (not to mention the temptation of complimentary meals and hotel discounts), and this shows in Let's Go.In a nutshell: buy Let's Go if you want a basic travel planner, but make sure to get a Rough Guide, Lonely Planet, etc. for backup."},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"I just picked up the Let's Go Europe 1999 and am planning my trip to France and Spain.

First off 80% of the phone numbers are innacurate, a problem that could be easily fixed by the editors by double checking their data. Secondly 90%+ of the prices are WRONG! They're all much lower than they actually are, either inflation is much higher in Europe, hostel proprietors raise their prices after they are featured in the book or Let's Go's writers don't do their homework. Lastly, Let's Go provides you with little to no facts about the sights, cultures or other information that travelers might be interested in. Backpackers have often told me that you can spot a Let's Go traveler because they're the ones who've been everywhere but don't know where they've been. For a better guide try Lonely Planet, or better yet just go to the tourist office of where you're visiting for free information and maps (which are always more accurate than Let's Go)!"},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"I am currently living in Italy, traveling Europe with 20 other students.

On the road the book was absolutely useless. Any and every place that they recommend such as youth hostels and restaurants were completely booked and filled just about entirely with Americans. The book gives very little detail and information on the historical and important sites that litter every city in the book. We ended up using other books we had brought and tourist information booths located in just about every train station. To get information such as complete listing of youth hostels, maps, and what to see and do in the city. You are better off picking up separate guides for every country/city that you visit. That way you can know something about what you are looking at and can appreciate it.

I travelled through Europe myself with Let's Go, Lonely Planet and Rick Steves - and found that Let's Go was the best book all around. Lonely Planet had the same unoriginal review for everything, they say everything is &quot;Don't miss&quot; which gives a traveller no insight whatsoever. It's only redeeming value was better maps than Let's Go - however if there is a map in your guidebook (meaning it's a big enough city to have a map in the book) then there is a free map at the train station, airport, hotel/hostel etc... Rick Steve's book was good, but even Rick says to take a Let's Go with you. His books are filler for people with more time. But don't expect his suggestions to be any less crowded - everyone I met in Europe had been to Cinqoterra (only listed in Rick Steve's Back Doors).

It is very obvious from the introduction to the countries that both authors would have rather been traveling in southern or western Europe. The chapters are filled with snide comments and indirectly recommend that the readers do not waste their money traveling in such expensive, boring countries. This is completely opposite of what I found traveling in either of these countries. For Scandinavian countries, I would recommend either the Lonely Planet, Rick Steve's, or Frommer's guides depending on the type of travel you want to do. If I could still return this book I would!!"},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"When I was in Europe over Christmas '97, I traveled almost entirely with Rick Steves, whom I highly recommend. But one of my friends had a Let's Go, and so we combined forces.After this experience, I have a few things to say about Let's Go. On the positive side, everything is cheap. However, often times it isn't only cheap in price but in quality. Because it is so popular, the hostels tend to fill up fast. Also, the directions are foggy at best and the information is not always accurate.In short, if you are going to Europe alone, don't let this be your only guide. You will wind up in trouble, and your guide book won't help you out of it. Go with Lonely Planet or Rick Steves--much more helpful in tight circumstances, and 98% accurate. If you're traveling with friends, take along a Let's Go because of the prices, but go to the last hostel listed first so you have a place to stay, and make sure you have a complimentary book with you."},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"I am currently in Holland and nearing the end of 7 months in Europe, 3 of which I have been non-stop traveling using &quot;Let's Go&quot; as my reference guide. Let me start by saying that if you plan on traveling in Europe, a guide book is key. Choosing the right one is the trick. I rate my experience with &quot;Let's Go&quot; as average. It told me what to see which was good but didn't tell me why to see it which was bad. It told me where to stay which was good but when it gave directions, they were either very vague or just plain wrong which was bad. Hence, the new title my friends and I have given the book, &quot;Let's Go Nowhere.&quot; Directions such as; Turn right outside the station, then turn right again. When you see the brown sign turn left and you can't miss it. Well more often then not, I missed it. Either don't give directions at all, or if you do, please make them specific and accurate. I must say it gave great reccomendations on bars and pubs and clubs. So, my rating for the book is 3 stars. Talking to other travelers, it sounds like &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; guide books are better, but I can't say from personal experience. My friend had a &quot;Rick Steves&quot; guide book which we found very good, although limited coverage compared to &quot;Let's Go.&quot;"},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"Tear the book up. No, not because you've just bought Let's Go Europe and have only now read all the comments here and have given up hope. Rip it up because it's easier to manage when stripped to the essentials: namely, only take with you the sections on the places you actually intend to go. To do this, open the book wide enough to break the spine and carefully pull out sections from the glue binding.Believe me, the 1st time I tried this I blessed the friend who'd suggested it. Unless you intend to go to some 30-odd countries (whew!), you'll find it easier to manage. Or, if you can't decide at the outset what to leave behind, take the whole brick, but tear out the sections of the places you're departing and leave them behind in your hostel/hotel for other travelers. Your back will thank you for it.In other news: LGE is a decent book, but people here are right - supplement it with other general guidebooks (Lonely Planet-Europe on a Shoestring or Rough Guide-Europe). And for more history coverage, if packing space is limited, do your history reading BEFORE you go (for the quick n' dirty overview, I really like Rick Steves' Europe 101: History and Art for the Traveler), and take notes in your journal on stuff you want to remember later as you go along."},{"Title":"Let's Go 98 Europe (Annual)","review":"I traveled for one month in Europe with only Let's Go!

At times it seemed as if the author was simply trying to waste paper by filling in with miscellaneous banter at times with things which were not even relevant to the material. This book was required reading for a class I took in a university. I would have been better served by learning about the different models and then independently applying them to the given issues without having such a wild perspective.Oh, and the pictures too really need to be updated.

The book actually goes further than this, and makes the claim that the \\"mark of the beast\\" is Sunday worship. How does that work out? Well, apparently there's going to be a Sunday law passed in order to resolve the economic crisis. (No, I don't know how doing that is supposed to help in the first place.) Other claims are that the beast out of the sea is the Papacy, the beast out of the earth is the United States, and that the image of the beast is Protestant America.How does the author support all this? Very badly. Passages from the Bible are given interpretations with little to no support. For instance, the author writes, \\"The lamb-like horns indicate youth, gentleness, and represent civil and religious freedom.\\" There is no attempt to justify this interpretation.The author also mangles history, claiming that Sunday worship arose by an act of Constantine. However, patristic sources prove that Christians worshiped on Sunday long before the time of Constantine. The New Testament evidence about this is dealt with incompletely and unsatisfactorily. Also, the book claims that when Constantine became a Christian, Christianity became the state religion. This is false.The author has a rather irritating style, and has the habit of exclaiming things like, \\"Incredible!\\"In short, if you don't want to be treated to bad writing, incorrect history, and silly interpretations of the Bible, avoid this book."},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"well.. many of us choose to reject the &quot;TRUTH&quot; as it is and turn to ignorance. we know that the law of the sabbath is still binding toady as it was FROM the beginning. if we look at &quot;LUKE 4:16.&quot; we see that the sabbath was still being kept. some of us say that it was nailed to the cross but if we study &quot;LEV 23&quot; carefully, we'd see what was nailed to the croos. we also claim that everything God made is &quot;good&quot; for eating but i chose to say that everything that was created is &quot;good&quot; for it's &quot;PURPOSE.&quot;"},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"Would like to know some information about the author.What denomination or religion she is associated with.What god does she worship?Did she do her own research her self?Is she still alive?Will she write another book?Has her belief's changed?"},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"This book has amazing insights into the hiden agendas that the media neglects to reveal.

This book will either cause the reader to at once love it or attack it with all vehemence.Seeking corroboration on the facts presented I found many of the subjects in this book could not be proved out of modern texts and had to rely primarily on antiquated books. For instance, I found on the subject of 666 referring to &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot;, a title of the Pope, no such title could be found in modern literature, however numerous instances could be found in much older references. (See Lucius Ferraris, &quot;Prompta Bibliotheca&quot;, art., &quot;Papa,&quot; II, Vol VI, p.43.)I commend the writer of this book for sticking his neck out and speaking on subjects that have become controversial in such a politically correct world.

It's crappily written in addition to everything else."},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"This book provides an interesting look at the world from a Seventh Day Adventist point of view.The book focusses on the identification of the beast descibed in Rev. 13; you know the one who prevents buying or selling by everyone who is not marked by the number 666. It identifies the beast as none other than the pope (actually all popes), based on a numerical calculation of &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; which it claims is a papal title. It goes on to say that the Catholic Church changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday (it in fact did) and re-numbered the 10 commandments.The entire aim of the book is to convince the reader that world leaders will conspire with the pope to pass a &quot;National Sunday Law&quot; that requires all to worship on Sunday and therefore submit to the beast. Then the Second Coming?The book is chock full of Bible verses, footnotes, diagrams, and calculations. I really was about to become scared -- but then something struck me from high school Latin; &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; didn't look right. It is supposed to mean &quot;Vicar of the Son of God,&quot; but wouldn't that be &quot;Vicarius de Filium Dei?&quot; Heck, that's 1169 not 666. Suspecting a rat, I checked a list of papal titles, and the only title resembling the one sited is &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot; (Vicar of Christ -- adds to 208 if your counting).Needless to say, I didn't buy the author's other arguments either.I recommend reading this book to gain an insight into the beliefs of the Seventh Day Adventists, and to understand why they dislike the Catholic Church, most other Protestant denominations, and especially the papacy.Save yourself the 4 bucks though, the Adventists hand these out like candy in major airports!"},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"It was to the point, exact and deserves maximum respect.

One had to read pretty much the entire book, a feat consuming about 12 minutes, to determine what it has to say:1. The Catholic Church is illigimate.2. In fact, the Catholic Church is the \\"beast.\\" It is shown pictorially that the Pope's name is associated with the number 666 in what looks like a mathematical algorithm arrived at after many painstaking random tries.3. Sunday shouldn't be the Sabbath.Here's what my friends in the UK get out of the book:1. Yep, Americans are still wackos, and ignorant ones at that.Here's what I get out of the book:1. We have to take the bible literally,2. except when it is more convenient not to. Then \\"beast\\" becomes \\"nation,\\" \\"risen from the Earth\\" means \\"settled, not conquered,\\" etc. There is some adherence to the New Testament's alteration of concepts from the Law of Moses, such as the anthropomorphism of \\"angels\\" resulting because the concept of one unseen God is basically beyond the grasp of authors.Finally, this book is refreshing to me because it shows that certain Christians having bizarre, non-scientific world views and an inability to write clearly can be at odds with other Christians having other bizarre, non-scientific world views, effectively leaving the Jews alone for a change."},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"The edition that I read was copyrighted 2007.This book subscribes to the historicist view of prophecy and Revelation.The author does an excellent job documenting the origin of Sunday worship.The Catholic church in it's own literature admits to changing the Sabbath to the veneral day of the Sun.This is explained in detail in this booklet.There is no scriptural basis for changing the Sabbath! On this point the book is correct.Dan.7:25 contains that prophecy.The book re-hashes some dubious history of the Catholic church;the Waldenses,strict penalties for owning a Bible,the Inquisition,etc...The definition and identification of the \\"Seal of God\\" and \\"Mark of the Beast\\" are interesting.The theory that the \\"Seal\\" is linked to the Sabbath makes sense when reading the Scriptures.The identification of the mother of harlots is not new,the identification of the \\"image of the beast\\" is a new one for me.Some of the points in this book are debatable however.Sacrificial law was indeed fulfilled by Yahusha's sacrifice. But that doesn't neccessarily translate into the seven Biblical festivals \\"no longer being required of us now\\". Zech.14:16 is an interesting passage regarding the Festival of Booths.The 666 math with the pope is highly questionable also.This book has a lot of Scriptural references and heavy quotations from Catholic literature.

PLEASE."},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"A book suggesting a hyper-Sabbatarian interpretation of Revelation.The author declares that it is evident that the first beast in Revelation is Rome, and by extension, the Roman Catholic church. The second beast is the United States of America, which has a great Constitution and Declaration of Independence, but will soon bring forth the apocalypse.The author then goes through a particularly slanted view of history in which the Roman Catholic church unilaterally changes the day of assembling from Saturday to Sunday and begins killing everyone who disagrees with them. OK, so the church did kill those who disagreed with them, but there's second century testimony to Christians assembling on the first day.Regardless, the author then returns to Revelation, declaring that the mark of God is the Sabbath observance, and therefore the mark of the beast is to worship on Sunday. He is convinced that forces exist in America to establish a national Sunday Law which will lead to the persecution of anyone who does not worship on Sunday.The author maintains Evangelical positions on faith only and salvation but is hyper-Sabbatarian in outlook. He attempts in an appendix to dismiss the many examples of Christians assembling on the first day of the week and insists that Paul's custom of evangelizing in the synagogues among the Jews is evidence of Christians observing the Sabbath. No mention or comment is made regarding Hebrews 4:1-11 and its relevance to understanding the Sabbath. The author also promotes the suggestion that the Law of Moses can be divided into \\"moral\\" and \\"ceremonial\\" aspects, despite the fact that (a) the Bible never makes such a delineation of the Law, (b) the Law explicitly says that it's all or nothing (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:2), and (c) Hebrews 7:12-14 is hard to reconcile with such a view. He also suggests that the \\"sabbath\\" of Colossians 2:16 is really the seventh year Sabbath for the fields despite having no evidence whatsoever to show how Paul's declaration should be so limited, especially since Paul mentions the new moon, which is normally discussed in parallel with the seventh-day Sabbath observance (e.g. Isaiah 1:13).It's a sad little book, really; I'm sure the author will chalk this up to further \\"persecution,\\" but the suggestion that forces will combine to re-establish Sunday as a day of rest, especially in our secular world which loves the money made through people working on Sunday (and Saturday, for that matter), is quite hard to envision. I have no doubt that some people would like to see legislation mandating Sunday as a day of rest; it would also not surprise me if there were people who would like to legislate Saturday as the day of rest and be as guilty of persecution and intolerance as the author claims those who insist on Sunday would be.I have to agree with the author in that Sunday was never declared a day of rest, either; the Hebrew author makes it clear that the Sabbath rest for the Christian is in heaven and the resurrection (Hebrews 4:1-11). Ironically, his insistence on maintaining Old Testament legislation can be seen as a holdover from doctrinal developments promoted by none other than the Roman Catholic church so demonized by the author in the book. How often people condemn in others similar things of which they have swallowed themselves!In the end, the book is a great reminder of why it is so important to read the Bible in its context, to allow one's understanding of the New Testament to inform one's view of Revelation, not vice versa, and as a warning against making one's own pet issue *the* major issue in Scripture...because it's probably not the major issue of Scripture, and it just makes you look foolish."},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"I am greatful to God for Jan Marcussen.

It's message is just like the apostolic revival sermons: confrontational,powerful,conscience awakening,Biblical and spirit filled.

I had the fortune to attend a non-church oriented prep school in my teens and was given the opportunity to delve deep into ancient history and western civilization...from what is considered Ancient and Medieval History,continuing forward through current modern history. I also learned the languages of Greek and Roman times and learned much translating from the original text.Interestingly enough, Dave's review is totally off-base. If you have never picked up just a real honest to goodness history book and read it to learn, I challenge you to try several available on Amazon among other places.History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, all six volumes, with active table of contents, improved Oct. 26, 2009, stay away from abridged modernized versions) that spans the time from the reign of Marcus Aurelius to the fall of Constantinople in 1453...a real eye opener for the unlearned. Another good book to read,The New Complete Works of Josephus...which gives one a much better understand of times after the death of Christ and the early Christian era. Usher's Chronology, Bible/Biblical Time Line & History is an excellent resource (find the original if possible, not the revised version that is on Amazon) for the unlearned to take history and the Bible and see if the Bible is accurate or not applicable as many \\"Christians\\" think of the old testament. The Bible is consistent from Genesis to Revelation, and doesn't contradict itself, but people do.In all my studies, coming from a skeptics approach to learning, I found that everything in the Bible ties exactly to historical facts and timelines. Prophecy have been filled with 100% accuracy. Example, the fall of Babylon and Nebechanezzar's dream...the image of many materials... head of gold was Babylon (currently in what we know of as Iraq). The arms and chest..Medo-Persia, brought down by Cyrus (who was predicted to do so by name long before his birth). Medo-Persia was the time of Xerxes and Esther.Next came major ruling power were the Greeks, represented by brass. Alexander the Great's empire fell as predicted by prophecy.Next came the Roman Empire (the iron age). Any scholar of Roman history will acknowledge and know what the rulers did to the Christians, and how by decree the day of worship was changed by Roman leaders, then later by the church in Rome. Those are historical facts. The Catholic mirror publication about this is on Amazon... it is calledRome's Challenge.After Rome fell, ten kingdoms came in what we know today in Europe. Only 7 survived to present day.My point is this...read the book. But ultimately one must depend on THE BOOK we call the BIBLE as the only source of truth. History backs it up 100%. That being said, the author does have the prophecies in line with scriptures. I challenge each of you to read and study (as directed to do by the Bible)and by doing so we will know what is true or not. Don't take any preacher's word for it...read the book for yourself. We are living in the very last days of Bible prophecy and things are going to happen fast just before Christ's second coming."},{"Title":"National Sunday law","review":"The concepts presented in this book are difficult for many people to believe and accept.

Even if you don't believe what is written in this book, there are many people who have recieved it, in one way or another, and changed their lives. People in prison have recieved Christ because of this book. People have been brought out from Satan worship because of this book. To a Christian, that alone should make the book valuable. If this book causes a person to begin to study the Bible, then God has used it for His will. Daily study of God's Word (the Bible) and prayer changes lives. It will show anyone the way to salvation.

It's only about 150 pages, outlining concepts, running through examples and pulling together things you've already learned in arithmetic.

This is not a textbook and it's not a workbook; it is a basic introduction to the subject. Asimov is a great writer and he actually uses English sentences to explain the formulas.If you are taking algebra for the first time or brushing up some rusty math skills, this is a great book to have. You'll definitely come away having learned a thing or two. If you are a publisher, please resurrect this book. It deserves to be in print.

By the time it was due again, I had learned algebra all the way up to solving the quadratic equation.The book reads more like a story than a textbook. I didn't work any homework. I didn't memorize anything. Mr. Asimov simply told me the story of how algebra developed and what real life problems it solved.In fairness, I have to admit that I was a nerd in school.

Accessible to the beginner in this interdisciplinary field, Snyder takes effort to introduce musical concepts and terminology before moving to higher level analyses. However, the expert in this field will still find many interesting bits of information regarding current papers on music and memory in these introductory chapters. As the book progresses, the scale of the ideas becomes more grandiose, but Snyder manages to support his tenets about the brain and music well. The chapters are sometimes divided by topic (like rhythm, or syntactic hierarchy in music).

It shows that war itself can become the vehicle of a far-reaching reorganization of political allegiances and life-styles, which at last consolidates the state apparatus by helping it to reach out to new sources of wealth. Army-backed criminal business ventures in border-zones and the use of private militias to help secure ressource-rich territories are seen as a defining feature of contemporary African power-systems. The authors, who all are leading european political scientists already well known in the field of African Studies, aptly show how these current transformations of war and state-sponsored criminality lead to the risk of region-wide violences. The relationship between petty thugs, professional mercenaries and state officials is highly unstable, but also extremely efficient as far as the reaping out of natural resources (such as diamonds) is at stake. The authors also demonstrate that the International Monetary Fund so-called &quot;structural adjustment programs&quot; didn't manage in getting rid of corruption practices, but that, on the contrary, they helped local and overseas financial crooks devise new schemes of underground economic transactions. The whole book is full of gloomy details about state-terror and financial mismanagement practices in Sub-saharian Africa. It is also very well-written and therefore remains accessible to a wide readers' audience. It is a necessary reading for those who are interested both in African politics and in the analysis of Third-World post-colonial states."},{"Title":"Criminalization of the State in Africa (African Issues)","review":"The best essay in the book is Beatrice Hibou's, on the nature of the African state. She terms the 1980s as Africa's \\"lost decade,\\" and views development strategies of economic growth that ignore social and consequences as being politically destabilizing. But her conception of the triggering mechanism for this destabilization is much different from that of most traditional political scientists (like Samuel Huntington's, for instance) perhaps owing to the different historical contexts in which they write (the institution-building of the 1960s versus the institutional decay of the 1990s).Huntington and other past scholars posit that under conditions of economic stimulus in a modernizing society, social mobilization is the trigger for destabilization. Hibou, however, points to the nature of the African state itself as being responsible for political instability under conditions of economic stimulus. In other words, neoliberal market stimulus fails in Africa not because of mobilized citizens whose demands cannot be met, but because of the complex nature of the African state.What is Hibou's conception of the African state, and how does it differ from Huntington's? Huntington tends to see the state in terms of how \\"institutionalized\\" it is, with a well-institutionalized state presumably having well-functioning formal political institutions that are adaptable, complex, autonomous and coherent. Hibou, however, goes far beyond a conventional political science view of institutions, by conceptualizing the African state as a \\"shadow\\" state:\\"the relationships, institutions and people most prominently in public view are not necessarily the most powerful. Elements which at first sight appear to be obstacles to the functioning of the state may turn out, on closer inspection, actually to belong to the state . . . via a web of informal concessions, carefully negotiated privileges - notably including impunity for economic offences - and personal and political relationships\\" (88-89).Accordingly, Hibou argues that neoliberalism has failed in Africa because it fails to take account of the state's informal shadow as an economic actor. In seeking to tie the hands of formal state actors to prevent conventional \\"rent-seeking\\" behavior, neoliberals have given more power to the informal sector, which tends to engage in economic activity that may not only be \\"rent-seeking,\\" but also \\"criminal\\" by many standards. Neoliberalism thus destroys formal institutions in Africa, and encourages \\"the development of personal networks, of informal or even illegal practices\\" (93).Thus, unlike Huntington's theory that social mobilization coupled with economic inequality destabilizes developing polities, Hibou posits instead that the nature of African states should be given prime explanatory weight in showing why economic stimulus might produce results opposite to those intended."},{"Title":"Criminalization of the State in Africa (African Issues)","review":"This is an extremely well-written book and a superlative translation that ably describes the dynamics of kleptrocracy.

To Macaulay and his ilk, Charles I's Archbishop of Canterbury was a stock villain, culpable for the royal policies that provoked the English Civil War.Hugh Trevor-Roper's biography (first published in 1940; Phoenix Press reprints the very slightly revised 1961 edition) cannot be called a rehabilitation, but it does correct, and has largely superseded, the Whig caricature. (The Britannica entry on Laud, for instance, reads like a precis.) Instead of a Wolsey-like grand prelate, Laud is shown to have been an honest, hardworking man, notable both for extensive charities and for fostering Greek, Arabic and Persian studies. His most conspicuous faults were personal rudeness, excessive severity as a judge (even by the severe standards of the time) and political maladroitness. Though he left behind many volumes of writings, he never grasped the importance of propaganda or public opinion. His immediate reaction to opposition was clumsy suppression, an instinct that led him to advocate the forcible imposition of episcopal governance on the Scottish church. From the failure of the &quot;Bishops' War&quot; followed the disintegration of Charles' personal rule, the Short and Long Parliaments, civil war and Laud's own murder by Act of Parliament in 1645.Trevor-Roper recounts Laud's career in, as one would expect, a lively and opinionated, yet thoroughly scholarly, fashion. He emphasizes high politics and ecclesiastical conflict but also directs attention to Laud's achievements as Chancellor of Oxford University, where his impact may have been more lasting than on either Church or State. There is little speculation about the Archbishop's private life, for which hardly any evidence survives. He never married, apparently kept no mistresses, lived unostentatiously and left behind almost no purely personal correspondence or anecdotes. Trevor-Roper surmises that he tended to have allies rather than friends, but the truth is unknowable.Excellent though it is in most respects, &quot;Archbishop Laud&quot; suffers from distortion in one key area. The biographer takes it as a fundamental truth that 17th Century men were as secular in outlook as his own 20th Century circle of acquaintances. Therefore, religious principles must have been mere masks for social and political content. Men adopted Puritan or Arminian or Roman Catholic theology because they liked the political doctrines associated with those labels.That premise is no doubt true of many figures of the day, but Trevor-Roper's own narrative exposes its dubiety in this particular case. The tenet that Laud advanced most persistently, in the teeth of massive opposition by both clergy and laity, was the importance of preserving continuity with the pre-Reformation Church. He was not sympathetic to Roman Catholicism but would not abandon traditional doctrines and rituals simply because they had been labeled &quot;popish&quot;. In these views he followed Lancelot Andrewes and Richard Hooker, and it is largely because of his efforts that their species of &quot;Anglo-Catholicism&quot; lasted beyond the lifetimes of their personal disciples.None of the distinctive issues addressed by the Andrewes-Hooker school is important to Trevor-Roper. Hence, he concludes, none of them could really have been important to Laud. The &quot;true&quot; reason for, say, upholding the mystical character of the Eucharist was evidently to strike a blow at enclosures, emigration and the pretensions of Parliament. Rather an indirect blow, one might think.If one imagines that Laud's ostensible hierarchy of values was his real one, his life comes into clearer focus. Activities such as the promotion of scholarship and the recovery of the church's property rights were not disconnected enthusiasms but elements of a program for reinforcing the links between contemporary and ancient Christianity and safeguarding a refurbished church from the influence of modernist opinion. Likewise, his indifference to politically attractive pan-Protestant initiatives, a stance that puzzles Trevor-Roper, reflects his desire to hold the English church at a distance from Reformation theology.Although Trevor-Roper pronounces Laud a &quot;failure&quot;, the Laudian tradition held a prominent, occasionally preeminent, place in the Church of England for three hundred years, and from that base it has gained an extended, if attenuated, influence. The descendants of Puritan zealots now study the Fathers of the Church, take the sacraments seriously, pay heed to the continuity of Christian experience, celebrate the ancient holy days and even admit religious images into their sanctuaries. From the perspective of 1645, that is an astonishing evolution. There is no way to know what might have been, but one cannot help suspecting that today's Protestant Christianity would be much more drab, anti-historical and unintellectual had William Laud never lived."},{"Title":"Archbishop Laud, 1573-1645,","review":"There is no reason to doubt that Laud was a deeply religious man. Even Trevor-Roper seems to recognize this at times, but the author paints the picture of a single minded and selfless bureacrat who is driven by a sociological ideal of restoring the post-Reformation church to its pre-Reformation glory. Theological convictions and religious ceremonies are humbug for Trevor-Roper's version of Laud. Laud's program is a social and practical one according to the author.Trevor-Roper finds it ironic that Anglo-Catholics would revere Laud and consider him a saint and a martyr since he was a \\"restless, practical bureaucrat.\\" It is hard to see how alienating the middle class Puritans of the Midlands and East Anglia was practical, or how the attempted enforcement of Anglican liturgy upon the fiercely independent and Presbyterian Scots was anything short of madness. It is difficult to understand Laud if one does not take seriously his love for the \\"beauty of holiness.\\" Trevor-Roper concedes that Laud has had his defenders, but that they have been clergymen who understand nothing more than Laud's theology and religious ceremonies. That Anglicans retain the correct posture of the communion table and other \\"insignificant cermonies\\" would not have cheered Laud's heart since his policies were a complete and utter failure.Trevor-Roper's assessment of Laud is akin to a biography of Che Guevarra that considers his commitment to the ideal of communism incidental. That said, I gave the book four stars because Trevor-Roper spares the reader the two extremes of Laud the intolerant religious bigot and Laud the saint and martyr."},{"Title":"Designing Health Messages: Approaches from Communication Theory and Public Health Practice","review":"I've read this book quickly and now plan to use it intensely for my grad studies and my work in public health.

While I enjoy the author's use of locale and her knowledge of psychology, I find the character of Skye very unlikable. She has a need to help people; she wants to be seen as independent; she feels compelled to get to the bottom of things. Yes, I think it's all about Skye's feelings, not the people she hurts, alienates, and leaves fumbling in her wake. She lies. A lot. Cute, pert, trying to be funny little white lies. She lies to justify her meddlesome nature. I may never like Skye, but the mysteries are engaging enough to keep me reading.

She implied that she was too good for her backwater town and couldn't wait to start the good life in a big city. Two years ago, Skye returned home, broke, out of work and without a place to hang her hat. Eating crow, she accepted a position as the district school psychologist thanks to the influence of her Uncle Charles.Since she moved back, she solved two murder cases and lost two boyfriends (the sheriff and the coroner) because she refused to heed their advice and quit sleuthing. Murder is the last thing on her mind when she enters the high school gym and finds the body of a dead girl. The victim is the most beautiful and popular girl in school, one who was going to play Sleeping Beauty in the school play. When it becomes obvious the girl was murdered, Skye starts snooping once again determined that she, as an insider of the school system, could find out things the police can't obtain.Denise Swanson has written another charming amateur sleuth tale that takes the readers into the complete and often vicious world of beauty pageants. There are so many suspects who would have liked to see the victim dead that the protagonist is working double time checking out all the suspects. MURDER OF A SLEEPING BEAUTY is a winner by anyone's standards.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder of a Sleeping Beauty (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"Skye Denison, school psychologist at Scumble River High School, stumbles across the girl who is playing the lead role in the spring musical, Sleeping Beauty.

This is the third Scumble River novel (although I believe there is a short story, which I haven't read) which features Skye, a school psychologist who came back to her hometown of Scumble River, Illinois after a humiliating break up with her ex-fiancee. This is particularly excrutiating for Skye because she had a few choice words for Scumble River and its residents when she made her graduation speech several years ago, and the residents of Scumble River have long memories. There are a few romantic possibilities for Skye in Scumble River, but they are not without their difficulties, to say the least. The greatest thing about Skye, her family and the other Scumble River residents is that they are not perfect. This leads to humor, pain, embarrassment and a lot of interest for the reader. I live in the midwest and I can relate to the characters of Scumble River, and I can honestly say that while they are often a little over the top for the sake of humor, they aren't completely out of the ballpark.The first book of the series (Murder of a Small-Town Honey) really caught my attention, but it carried the duty (and the pleasure) of setting up the Scumble River background and letting the readers get to know Skye, her family, and the various characters of Scumble River. The book was wonderful and I would recommend reading it first, but then I try to always read the first book in a series before any of the others. I didn't like the second book, Murder Of a Sweet Old Lady, nearly as well as the first book. As a school psychologist, Skye sometimes has to come in contact with unhappy parents, and since she has the unfortunate habit of stumbling over dead bodies, she often ends up dealing with unhappy suspects. In the second book she was occasionally threatened or physically assaulted (albeit in a mild way) by male parents or suspects, yet didn't report it to the police. I thought that was completely out of character for Skye, who is a very assertive heroine. Thankfully, the third book completely restored my faith in the series. It seemed to me that the characters and the town of Scumble River just completely came together in this book, and I felt that I knew the characters without having to work to understand why they would react in a certain way, or without having to work out who the character was and how they were related to Skye. The book deals with the timely issue of the media and the image of perfection we are faced with constantly as we watch television and read magazines, and the consequences that expectation of perfection can have on children (and adults, as well), yet it doesn't have a preachy tone at all. I look forward to many more Scumble River books. Denise Swanson's Scumble River series has now joined my short list of cozy series that I will buy without even reading a review..."},{"Title":"Murder of a Sleeping Beauty (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This was a good book, but again, my favorite book so far is the first one (Murder of a Small-Town Honey), and I haven't read the fourth one yet, so there's hope yet.During my reading of this book, I felt that Skye didn't really understand teenagers, or was for some reason bias towards those in the book. (Yes, yes, I'm a teen myself!) Anyhow, the storyline, again, didn't intrest me that much. Justin and that girl who's name I can't remember, were more likable in this book than Skye herself. Also, one more thing, through out the book, Skye was asking for too many things! I know it's her job to help the children, but I was annoyed how she would always try to find the principal to request he do something.Overall, it was good, but I was annoyed by it. The one thing I'm gald about in this book, is that the author didn't kill off the murderer at the end!

For Skye Dennison, the school psychologist for Scrumble River, the period covering the murder-investigation of Scrumble River High School beauty, Lorelei Ingels, proves to be exactly such a moment. Since returning home (reluctantly) after having been fired from her first job and being dumped by her rather obnoxious fiance, Skye has managed to find a way to fit in again in her small home town, and to live down her infamous high school valedictorian speech (in which she stated that all the denizens of Scrumble River had small mundane minds). It's not all good news however: her job is a hard and thankless one, where she seems to be doing the work of at least six people, and where she gets very little help or support from school administrators. Add to that the unpleasant fact that Skye has managed to alienate the affections of the two men she has some romantic feelings for, and you have some idea of what Skye's life is like right now!As \\"Murder of a Sleeping Beauty\\" opens, Skye is summoned to the school gym by a hysterical teenager who claims that, \\"Sleeping Beauty is dead.\\" Inside the gym, Skye finds Lorelei Ingels (popular head cheerleader, Sleeping Beauty in the school's upcoming musical, and regular beauty pageant contestant) onstage seemingly asleep. Except of course that she's not breathing, and that she happens to be a lovely shade of grey-blue. It looks as if Lorelei may have over dosed on something. Afraid that the school may be blamed for Lorelei's death, Skye's godfather (who happens to be president of the school board) asks Skye to investigate. This, Skye is only all too willing to do, but investigating this murder will not be easy going, esp with the sheriff acting really hostile towards her (he's still angry at her for having betrayed his trust in a previous Scrumble River mystery, \\"Murder of a Sweet Old Lady\\"). But Skye is nothing if not determined to discover why Lorelei Ingels is dead; why the Ingels family is not cooperating with the police; and why Lorelei isn't even being mourned by her friends.\\"Murder of a Sleeping Beauty\\" is a really fun read. Denise Swanson does a marvelous job of both imbuing the book with that small town atmospheric feel, and of maintaining a light tongue in cheek sarcasm with which she observes the general ineptness of the school administrators, as well as all the string pulling that goes on behind the scenes in small town politics. The Scrumble River mystery series is not a completely light hearted 'cozy' read, but it is an absorbing and compelling one. It is rather fast paced and is filled with character-types that are quirky and recognizable to all of us. I was well and truly hooked. All in all a really worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Murder of a Sleeping Beauty (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"Sleeping Beauty is found dead on the stage at the high school.

New York: Orchard Books, 1996. Nikolajeva, Maria. &quot;Exit Children's Literature?&quot; The Lion and The Unicorn 22 (1998): 221-236. Every morning, a young boy, who is the neighborhood paperboy, and his dog go out on their route and deliver the papers to the sleeping neighbors. They enjoy their job and the peacefulness of being the only ones awake and out in the early morning. The paperboy experiences feelings of responsibility and accomplishment throughout the story. Most of the illustrations in The Paperboy are dark because the majority of the story takes place at dawn. This gives readers the feeling that they are part of the boy's early morning journey from house to house. The pictures do an excellent job of portraying the events of the story. The article &quot;Exit Children's Literature&quot; by Maria Nikolajeva focuses on some common prejudices about children's literature. According to an author, Perry Nodelman, some of these characteristics that make a book &quot;children's literature&quot; are that the book is simple but not necessarily simplistic, action-oriented rather than character-oriented, presented from the viewpoint of innocence, optimistic with a happy ending, didactic, and repetitious in diction and structure. Nikolajeva has different beliefs of what makes a book &quot;children's literature.&quot; She gives examples of children's authors such as Robert Cormier, Patricia MacLachlan, and Margaret Mahy, whose books do not fit Nodelman's &quot;definition&quot; of children's literature, but in reality they are children's literature. I feel that The Paperboy does fit the definition of children's literature and relates to Maria Nikolajeva's article in that it fits Nodelman's definition. First, it is simple because it has a single, clear plot, a limited number of characters that are easy to remember (the paperboy, his dog, and his family), and flat characters. In The Paperboy, the boy and his dog do everything together, even sleep. Another characteristic of the story is that it is presented from the viewpoint of innocence. The characters in the story are good, and there are no conflicts or problems. Finally, the characteristic that children's literature is optimistic and has a happy ending applies to The Paperboy. The boy is clearly content throughout the story and, in the end, he and his dog are happy to have finished their job. I agree that many children's books can be classified as children's literature if they fit the &quot;definition&quot;, but I also agree with Nikolajeva who believes that books don't necessarily have to fit the definition in order to be children's literature. I think the &quot;definition&quot; can be used for classifying books as children's literature, but I think the definition needs to go further because there are more characteristics of children's literature than those included in the definition. Each book should be looked at individually because they are different and have some of their own characteristics that make them appropriate for children."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"Not so much a story but rather a masterful capturing of the mood and feeling, through poetic language and warm illustrations, of a boy waking up early to deliver newspapers.As recommended on my children's book recommendation site Books for Children (www.books-for-children.com)"},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"The author outdid himself in this wonderful story.

This book is magical.The words are chopped up on the page, which almost crosses the line into free verse. (Note to publishers: We have quite enough books written \\"for blacks\\" that are written in free verse instead of standard English.) But this book is mostly written in sentences, and it's very worthwhile.It's nice to have a book with a black child doing normal American things -- no racial grievances. \\"Paperboy\\" and \\"Come on, Rain\\" and \\"Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm\\" and \\"The Toothpaste Millionaire\\" are all excellent in this respect.Thank you, Dav Pilkey, for a book we all enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"Nevermind what it's \\"about,\\" this book gives an example of a boy who has a daily chore to do, does it, \\"and he is good at it.\\" He is able to find pride and joy in his work and the fact that he has these responsibilities sets him apart from many readers.

This is one of those books that I sit with my kids and have them study the artwork and tell me everything that's happening in each picture.And the cadence of the writing makes it a great bedtime book.

When the delivery is done, the sun is coming up, but not before he and his doggie get home, go upstairs and slip back under the covers. Though more universal in appeal, especially to paper carriers and those who know and love them, it also has a multi cultural appeal. The young paper carrier is African American. The positive values of hard work, sacrifice of getting up before dawn, independence of the little boy getting his own breakfast and service to the community as well as the companionship of a pet are themes than shine through this delightful story."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"When you are sleeping &amp; the sky is dark &amp; the streets shadowy, someone &amp; his dog are up, working &amp; happy.Happy are they at work before dawn, the dog running after scents &amp; growling at critters &amp; the boy pedaling his bike, thinking his thoughts &amp; tossing the morning paper to house after house, as slowly, softly another day dawns.Dav Pilkey's pictures &amp; story capture the shadows &amp; colors of when night turns toward day &amp; while everyone is tumbling out of their beds, the paperboy &amp; his dog are tumbling back into theirs.A fine way to introduce children to the idea of working for a living, of being responsible, of doing the work until it's done &amp; the fun."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"It's a bad sign when a book published in 1996 already conjures up feelings of nostalgia. Remember paperboys? How kids could earn a little extra money by getting that crack-of-dawn delivery job that put a few more coffers in their pockets? Nowadays, many paperboys have been replaced with adults. Adults with cars, no less. Looking back at Dav \\"Captain Underpants\\" Pilkey's Caldecott Honor title, \\"The Paperboy\\", the reader is transported to those ethereal moments that exist for some kids even today just before the sun rises. It's a story about a boy, his dog, his job, and that's about it. No grand statements or surprising moments. Just a lovely look at a once common suburban ideal.On the title page we see a dull gray truck leaving the loading dock of the Morning Star Gazette in (what most of us would call) the dead of night. It makes its delivery of a stack of newspapers at one of the many houses in a particular suburb. The first sentence sets the mood perfectly. \\"The mornings of the paperboy are still dark and they are always cold even in the summer\\". A boy forces himself out of his warm bed and makes some breakfast for himself and his corgi dog. After bundling the papers up, the kid and his faithful companion make the familiar route and think their private thoughts. Just as the sun is rising, boy and dog have finished their job and they return home just as everyone else in the family is waking up. The paperboy and his pet, however, climb back into the bed, \\"which is still warm\\" and dream of soaring through the night sky.The book records each small action that the paperboy accomplishes with a small unassuming note of triumph. Sentences like, \\"It's hard to ride a bike when you are loaded down with newspapers. But the paperboy has learned how to do this, and he is good at it\\". Also, getting out of a warm bed to do a job is exceedingly difficult to accomplish sometimes, \\"but they do\\". Kids don't have to ford rivers or climb mountains to be brave. Just making yourself to do something uncomfortable or unpleasant can be heroism enough. Pilkey recognizes this and celebrates it with understated aplomb.I loved the fact that the dog in this book was a corgi, by the way. There just aren't enough corgis in children's literature, gol durn it! Aside from Tasha Tudor's books (\\"A Time To Keep\\" comes to mind), corgis are the most ignored picture book dogs out there. This is hard to figure when you consider just how cute and cuddly they are. They're the world's only permanent puppies! So if you happen to be a children's illustrator and you feel you have a certain amount of clout in the publishing world (ho ho!), get the word out: We Need More Corgis.The obvious companion to this book, right off the top of my head, is \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\", by Brian Pinkney. In fact, if Mr. Pinkney weren't such an original author in his own right, I'd be mighty suspicious regarding all the similarities between these two books. \\"Sparrowboy\\" follows an unassuming paperboy who acquires the power of flight. \\"The Paperboy\\" follows an unassuming paperboy who at the end of the book dreams of flight. Both are African-American young men who live in suburban neighborhoods. If you're more interested in doing a full-on paperboy storytime, also consider Don Brown's, \\"Kid Blink Beats the World\\". That's a kind of paperboy heroism the likes of which we'll probably never seen again. \\"Sparrowboy\\" and \\"Kid Blink\\" would be obvious pairings, but the tone of \\"The Paperboy\\" has far more in common with Jane Yolen's well-regarded, \\"Owl Moon\\". Both books revel in the feeling children have when they are out in the mysterious night and no one else is awake. If you're thinking about having a storytime that considers the natural mysteries that come when the sun is gone, these two are obvious companions. Read alone, however, \\"The Paperboy\\" will still extend its quiet bravery to the children that read it. Even if they've never seen a paperboy before, they'll understand how great it can sometimes be to have a job of one's very own"},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"Dav, Pilkey a great painting in the paperboy. there were very nice pictures. since the story was written by a few sentence every page, it really gave children more space to image on the story. alhough it's a simple story, it taught our children the most. in the story, Dav descripted what did a paperboy do in his job. and how hard that his work was. as a paperboy, he had to get up early in the morning and delievered his newpaper before anyone got up. eventhough it was hard for him to get up in the morning, he had a very good friend (his dog) would do it with him every morning. in fact, Dav had taught our children that FRIENDSHIP would not only be limit just with human, it could also be with our animals, too. at the same time, he did teach our children to love animals because they could be their friend. also, Dav had taught our children what RESPONSIBILITIES are. to be responable to his/her own responsibilites. in the story, the paperboy would finish his work before he went back to sleep. therefore, when our children grow up, they would know to take care of their responsibilities and not avoid them. it's a good book to teach children about responsibilities."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"The Paperboy was written and illustrated by Dav Pilkey. This was a fun-to-read, lighthearted book that relayed a very vivid lesson of maturity and hard work. In the story, a boy and his dog get up early every morning and deliver papers. The paperboy was a very responsible young man who loved his job. The bright and happy illustrations played a key role in letting the reader know how happy the boy and his dog were. In this story, the author uses various forms of symbolism to portray the paperboy as being a very mature and hard-working young man. One of the first very obvious symbolic representations was the young boy's receding hairline. While this doesn't necessarily mean he is mature, it is a trait displayed by men who are generally much older, wiser, and more mature. In many foreign countries, older men, who usually have little or no hair, are more respected and thought to be wise and knowledgeable. I think the author was probably using this common knowledge to help relay his message of maturity. Another key symbolic representation is the way the boy cares for the dog as his own child. He takes him everywhere, feeds him, and watches over him. These are all characteristics of a mature adult who has accepted the responsibility of being a parent. Lastly, the fact that the boy leaves his warm bed very early on a cold Saturday morning while everyone else is still asleep, speaks wonders of his dedication and level of maturity. In the book, the paperboy never hesitates when his alarm goes off. He knows he has a job to do, and he does it. Even the boy's dog, who he has cared for and taught behavioral patterns, is eager to start the early day. In this book, the paperboy was clearly a responsible and dedicated young man. The various forms of symbolism that the author used were a very effective means of relaying this message."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"In the quiet of the early morning a paperboy and his dog headout on their daily route, peacefully slipping back into bed just asthe rest of the world awakens. In this Caldecott Honor winning picture book Dav Pilkey perfectly portrays the daily excursion of a young boy and his dog during the predawn hours as they deliver the Morning Star Gazette to each neighborhood home. Pilkey masters the art of creating atmosphere within this original mood piece. He uses descriptive language, such as &quot;the mornings of the paperboy are still dark and they are always cold even in the summer,&quot; to capture the reader's interest and bring him or her into the life of the paperboy. His acrylic and India ink illustrations add to the mood and dreamy quality of the story. He uses cool colors, hues of blue and green, during the early morning hours and slowly adds warmer tones to illustrate the rising sun and the coming of a new day. Oblique lines and curved shapes distinguish the rolling hills and clouds from the houses down below on the tranquil street. Pilkey combines both words and pictures to describe not only the paperboy's actions, but his thoughts and feelings as well. Children ages three to six will enjoy reading this well crafted story that depicts a daily event in a new and shining light."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"As a former paper-\\"person\\", this book was a wonderful step back in time.

The Paperboy. New York: Orchard Books, 1996. Nikolajeva, Maria. &quot;Exit Children's Literature?&quot; The Lion and The Unicorn 22 (1998): 221-236.Every morning, a young boy, who is the neighborhood paperboy, and his dog, go out on their route and deliver the papers to the sleeping neighbors. They enjoy their job and the peacefulness of being the only ones awake and out in the early morning. The paperboy experiences feelings of responsibility and accomplishment throughout the story. Most of the illustrations in The Paperboy are dark because the majority of the story takes place at dawn. This gives readers the feeling that they are part of the boy's early morning journey from house to house. The pictures do an excellent job of portraying the events of the story. The article &quot;Exit Children's Literature&quot; by Maria Nikolajeva focuses on some common prejudices about children's literature. According to an author, Perry Nodelman, some of these characteristics that make a book &quot;children's literature&quot; are that the book is simple but not necessarily simplistic, action-oriented rather than character-oriented, presented from the viewpoint of innocence, optimistic with a happy ending, didactic, and repetitious in diction and structure. Nikolajeva has different beliefs of what makes a book &quot;children's literature.&quot; She gives examples of children's authors such as Robert Cormier, Patricia MacLachlan, and Margaret Mahy, whose books do not fit Nodelman's &quot;definition&quot; of children's literature, but in reality they are children's literature. I feel that The Paperboy does fit the definition of children's literature and relates to Maria Nikolajeva's article in that it fits Nodelman's definition. First, it is simple because it has a single, clear plot, a limited number of characters that are easy to remember (the paperboy, his dog, and his family), and flat characters. In The Paperboy, the boy and his dog do everything together, even sleep. Another characteristic of the story is that it is presented from the viewpoint of innocence. The characters in the story are good, and there are no conflicts or problems. Finally, the characteristic that children's literature is optimistic and has a happy ending applies to The Paperboy. The boy is clearly content throughout the story and, in the end, he and his dog are happy to have finished their job. I agree that many children's books can be classified as children's literature if they fit the &quot;definition&quot;, but I also agree with Nikolajeva who believes that books don't necessarily have to fit the definition in order to be children's literature. I think the &quot;definition&quot; can be used for classifying books as children's literature, but I think the definition needs to go further because there are more characteristics of children's literature than those included in the definition. Each book should be looked at individually because they are different and have some of their own characteristics that make them appropriate for children."},{"Title":"The Paperboy","review":"Dav Pilkey must have been a paperboy.

This book is the life story of a child exiled to the Colony at Kalaupapa and although fiction, is accurate to many fine details of the actual place and the experience.I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, perhaps because I had just walked into the valley (didn't ride the mules!!) and saw most of the places described in the book. Read it and reflect, read it and cry for the many souls affected by the devastating disease, and society's fear of condition that we used to call Leprosy, and celebrate the medical advances that made this a treatable disease in the last half of the 20th century!!I live and work in the medical community in Hawai'i, and this book brings an understanding to the history of the islands and it's people."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i started out with promise,however, about half way through the book it seemed as if another author took over the writing. What began with crisp, sharp writing deteriorated into rather sloppy dialogue and descriptions. I think the book would definitely have benefited with some tight editing and elimination of about 100 pages.While the relationships between Rachel and her father, Henry, and subsequently between her father, mother and immediate family rang true, some of the other relationships seemed forced and contrived. Additionally there were some characters and scenes which seemed superfluous and only contributed to the length of the book , not to the quality of the content. The author did a nice job of documenting Hawaii's history regarding it's leper colony and the isolation of its inhabitants and developed an interesting comparison of the leper colony to the Japanese internment camps.If a reader is interested in the subject I would recommended Victoria Hislop's \\"The Island\\"."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I typically shy away from historical fiction, but found this one hard to put down.Before reading this I was not aware of the leprosy problem in Hawaii and had never heard of Moloka'i. This is sad what people went through, and most of the book is based on actual events.The story of Rachel who at the age of 7 is diagnosed with leprosy and sent into exile with the other lepers on a quarantined island, is gut wrenching. It is hard to imagine parents being forced with send their little girl away at such a young age. Rachel is very spirited and has a full life in spite of being on the island. Through her life is has many happy times including finding love and getting married. She also suffers many heartbreaks including abandonment by family, death of loved ones, and being forced to give her daughter up for adoption.I kept waiting for the happy ending where leprosy is cured and she is reunited with her family. Unfortunately that does not happen, but she does have some sort of a happy ending when she is reunited with her daughter and sister.This is truly a great book, one that everyone should read. It forces you to imagine the time and question what your actions would be in similar circumstances."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Imagine yourself afflicted with a strange disease, quarantined in a faraway and unfamiliar land, forced to leave your family and friends behind, with an obscure future ahead of you. Sounds downright scary, yeah? Luckily, this is not about H1N1 or any of the recent illnesses that have plagued the world, but rather the premise of the book Moloka'i by Alan Brennert.Moloka'i chronicles the life of Rachel Kalauma who is taken to Moloka'i from her home in Oahu to Kalaupapa in Molokai, both islands in Hawaii, at a young age due to leprosy (now scientifically referred to as Hansen's disease). It takes us to Rachel's journey from a little kid who is painfully unaware of the circumstances that bring her into forced isolation, to an old lady who tries to live a normal life after being finally diagnosed as leprosy-free. It allows us to empathize with her joys after every pain; triumphs against adversity; and, courage in the midst of hopelessness.The book is a cross between fiction and non-fiction. Rachel is obviously the work of the author's imagination and yet she is an amalgamation of people who actually lived in the island. Moloka'i was, in fact the detention site of confirmed lepers from 1865 until the late 1960s. At that time, leprosy was considered incurable and highly contagious and thus, the victims were involuntarily deported to Moloka'i. The book mentions a number of real life characters who lived in the leper colony including the famous Father Damien, who was recently canonized into sainthood because of his charitable works and selfless acts to the community. In addition, the book also intersperses historical events such as World War II, the mass consumption of electricity, the development of moving pictures and the 1946 tsunami in the island among many others, which prove that the island is still part of a much bigger world even in its isolation.The book tells us not only about the impact of leprosy in the olden times, but more importantly, the message it brings to the readers - that all people, even Rachel who is a leper, deserve a second chance - is as beautiful as Moloka'i itself. And just as Rachel rises above all the challenges that fate took upon her, so did the island of Moloka'i. From being a safe haven for the lepers and therefore virtually avoided by visitors, today Molokai has become an ideal destination for tourists in search for the authentic island life experience."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Thank you for your excellent customer service.

I have a theory that they are more revealing than five star reviews. In this case there are 238 five star reviews and 7 one star reviews. That in itself is revealing. Then if one eliminates the incoherent one star reviews you'd be down to two or three. So about 1% of Alan Brennert's readers disliked Moloka'i. To me, that says more about those few readers than the book.Obviously, I'm in the other camp. I felt it was a moving story and a sad indictment of an insensitive era when we just locked the sick away to wait for inevitable death.In my family in the 1920s in Oklahoma, an aunt contracted tuberculosis. She was sent to Arizona where the dry air was supposed to prolong her life. It didn't. Eventually, seven of my grandfather's children got TB and were locked away in the sanitariums of the day to wait for death. For like the lepers in Moloka'i, no known cure was there to save them.This is a story about living life in the face of certain death. It's about hope when all around you is despair. It confronts an ugly truth, the 19th century attitude of white Anglo Protestant mainlanders exploiting native Hawaiian peoples and the failure of Victorian morality to confront this injustice.Alan Brennert has crafted a touching story that asks us to take little Rachel to heart and follow her through separation from her family, the loss of her dreams and her determination to live, love and dare to hope while facing an illness with only one possible outcome.

Her ability to cope with separation from her family and her ability to make a new \\"family\\" where she lived is quite extraordinary. The author states this is fiction based on many writings of true experiences from patients and visitors to the island over the years. Father Damien, who is famous for his work with the leprosy colony, is also included. I had been to this island for a brief stay many years ago, but knew little of its remarkable history.This was a moving novel that taught me a lot about the times and the dedication of the priests and nuns who worked with the population on Moloka'i and the resiliency of the people who lived there - most of them until their death.

I would have never picked up half of my book selections if it weren't for book clubs assigning these books for me to read. Seriously. I mean, who would want to read about a young girl contracting leprosy at a young age and being sent to live on a leper's colony? I am not even sure what leprosy is. I did not want to read something that would even begin to describe something like this, but for this book club, I did.And I hate to say it, but this is one heck of a book because it drew me in and would not let go till I finished the last page. Literally. My husband and kids had to fend for themselves while I finished this book. I finished it in one afternoon, with a box of kleenexs next to me. As a mother, the descriptions of Rachel being sent away to this hospital, wrenched away from her parents, really tugged at my heartstrings. It never let go, really.Rachel was sent to a hospital at a young age because she had leprosy. After a year, she was sent to Moloka'i, an island that was just a Leper's colony. She was abandoned by her parents but her dad's brother, Uncle Pono was there. Rachel formed her own family there with Sister Katherine, Aunt Haleola, a native healer who had watched her husband succumbed to the disease; Uncle Pono; friends that she has made over the years and finally, falling in love with a man of Japanese descent who was his family's outcast since he had brought dishonor to his family name by contracting leprosy.This is Rachel's story mingled in with others' stories through the years. It is a story of love, loss, regret, dreams shattered and rebuilt, and frienship. Woven into the historical tapestry of the island, it is a book that is enriched by this author's storytelling talents. It is definitely one of the best surprises for me this year. I never knew that I would enjoy reading a book about a young girl living in a Leper's colony. Nor did I imagine that I would learn so much of how much pain and grief fellow humans inflict on others due to their ignorance and yet how strong the human spirit is, how we manage to find such beauty among such ugliness.This really should be a must-read for every single book club.

Through the pages of this book, you learn interesting details regarding leprosy, but you also learn about the will to survive and the power of love. It is beautiful through and through. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"takes the reader back to a time in Hawaii that is lost forever. If your concidering visiting or have gone to any of the islands, read this, so one can understand the struggle this culture has gone through."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I found this book hard to put down. I didn't want it to end. Alan Brennert's Rachel was so real. A very young girl taken away from her family because she had leprosy lives her life among many other victims of the disease. She is fortunate in some aspects as she could live on the island of Moloka'i and have contact with an uncle who also had the disease. It was fascinating to read about her growing up, falling in love and coping. I hope Mr. Brennert is working on another book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A beautiful story, extremely well-written, filled with great historical information. A great read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A five-star achievement! Once I started reading the story of Rachel Kalama, I could not put the book down. The depth and feeling expressed had me tearing up periodically throughout. Sentimental in the feeling of family and friends-as-family without being corny or maudlin. What I think I like the best was the sense that you could grasp the spirituality and physical presence of Hawaii, making you feel as though you were right there. The next time I go to Hawaii will definetely include a visit to Molokai."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A book that tells a story, opens up an overlooked piece of the world and its history, and acts as a launching point for looking up more details, more information. Alan Brennert's MOLOKA'I is such a book.The book's handling of the myths, legends, and magics of the Hawai'ian people had the same strong feeling for me that I get when I learn of all the raw deals the American Indians were dealt. The near loss of an ancient &amp; unique culture and its replacement by Western values. And the massive devastation of their population through exposure to Western disease.Through reading this book I've developed new awareness of leprosy (Hansen's disease) and how widespread it is even to this day. Even with treatments available.The amazing parallels of the lives of &quot;lepers&quot; in exile, the exile of the Japanese from their homes after Pearl Harbor (in California at least).This book neatly laid its arcs early and closed them just as neatly at the end. Everything comes full circle. And not everyone has a happy-ending.And now, I think, a trip to Moloka'i someday soon."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book has it all: historical interest, a magical setting in the Hawaiian islands, a wonderful story, interesting characters, emotional depth, and a spiritual message. What more could one want! Rachel's story, as well as those of her friends and family, is told with compassion and clarity but without the cloying sentimentality one might expect in a tale of the residents and workings of a leper colony. The book is beautifully written and in the end leaves the reader filled with hope for humanity. Read this book; you will be uplifted."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is an absolutely riveting and heartbreaking account of one community's triumph over a crippling disease. Told from the point of view of Rachel Kalama, and her best friend Sister Catherine, Molokai spans two generations of Hawaiian history - from the 1890's to the 1970's - as it gradually recounts the lives of those inflicted with Hansen's disease.Totally ambitious in scope, Molokai is a real testament to human suffering, and how perseverance, family loyalties, and cultural ties can really triumph in the face of adversity. Torn from her adoring parents as a little girl, Rachel is forced to live on Molokai in the town of Kalaupapa where life is hard and disease is everywhere. Rachel and her friends are confined to a green triangle six square miles of shore rock, and that within these boundaries - the implacable geometry of their confinement - they are forced to make a life for themselves. The descriptions of the death and disfigurement at Kalaupapa are excruciatingly real yet really quite touching, as we witness the tireless people who work to help prolong lives. Leprosy is woven into the fabric of their everyday lives, \\"a black thread that could never be cut\\".The story does, at times, become a little histrionic and melodramatic as Rachel encounters one terrible situation after another, but don't let this detract from the powerfully affecting experience of reading this novel. Throughout the story some wonderful characters display their own difficulties and troubles. There's Rachel's husband Kenji, loyal, hard working and kind; her father Henry affable and easy going, who voyages the world and brings Rachel back dolls from all the wonderful places he visits; her daughter Ruth, and her \\"hanai\\" aunt Haleola who is a \\"healer\\" or \\"kahuna\\" and believes that sickness comes from the soul and from a person's past actions and state of mind. There's also Uncle Pono exiled to the Island just before Rachel herself is transported and the boisterous and funny transvestite Leilani who finally succumbs to the disease like so many of Rachel's other friends and companions.Molokai also works as a dramatic recreation of the history of the Hawaii. Brennert recounts the history of the Islands from the late 19th century, when Congress decided that Hawaii should be annexed to the United States. We witness the influx of Christianity threatening the Hawaiian values and way of life, the arrival of electricity and the advent of American domestic engineering, the first airplanes, the fatal attack on Pearl Harbour and the final cure for Hansen's disease, which literally wipes out the illness overnight. Each incident is seen through the eyes of Rachel and through her life of confinement, suffering and hardship on Molokai. This is a profound and sweeping saga - meticulously researched and beautifully written. Molokai is a must readMichael."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"After having read the exploitative and shameful \\"non-fiction\\" work \\"The Colony,\\" by John Tayman, I was a bit leery of Alan Brennert's \\"Moloka'i,\\" a wholly fictional account of the one-time leper colony on the Kalaupapa Peninsula of Moloka'i. I am very glad, however, that I did read Brennert's amazing novel as it gives a far more accurate portrayal of the time and the place and the people than Tayman's book ever could. It is a sweeping piece of historical fiction and an emotional (but never manipulative) journey of seven-year-old Rachel Kalama who, after being diagnosed in the late 1800s, is sent to Kalawao/Kalaupapa, the site on Moloka'i which served as a leper colony from 1866 until 1969.Unlike Tayman (whose non-fiction account has been decried by scholars and the remaining residents of Kalaupapa themselves), Brennert does not feel the need to sensationalize the historical facts to tell his story. Brennert did his research and was wise enough to know that the story was compelling enough--it didn't need to be \\"ratcheted up\\"--to have an emotional impact upon the reader and to do justice to the thousands who lived and died at Kalawao and Kalaupapa.While Rachel's story is fictional, Brennert acknowledges that some of the characters in the novel were loosely based upon people who had actually lived at Kalaupapa. Brennert wisely creates composite characters, taking bits and pieces from the historical records and correspondence of the time. The result is deeply affecting and rich characters, and a portrait of a people who took the worst of times and lived quiet, dignified lives a world away from their families and friends who seemed to have forgotten them. One of the pieces I am grateful that Brennert worked in was the presence of the Mahu, the gay Hawaiians who lived and breathed and were likely committed to Kalaupapa. While at first glance the Mahu character might teeter on stereotype, Brennert creates a very full character that overcomes the stereotypes.Brennert's prose is also quiet. Simply, he creates a realism that never dares cross into exoticism of Hawai'i or of its people, but still manages to depict environ most have never experienced. He captures the idyllic setting and peoples it with human beings full of faults and foibles and courage. We get to see our heroine Rachel grow up, fall in love, marry, as well as grieve the friends (and family) who come and go out of her life throughout the decades. We are given the joys she experiences, as well as the lows, and as we live Rachel's life right along with her, we feel almost privileged to have met these remarkable people and shared in their indomitable spirit, if only for a brief time.One of the potential pitfalls for any piece of historical fiction is info-dumping, throwing historical facts in to give the proper perspective. When handled ineptly, passages of books can begin to feel like history lessons forced upon the reader. For the most part, Brennert avoids this masterfully. Almost never does any information feel unnecessary or forced, an author showing off his research abilities. It is all woven beautifully into the prose, amazing considering the historical events depicted: the death of a King, the overthrow of a Monarchy, the advent of radio and electricity, the dawning of statehood, the bombing of a harbor. It all fits.If I have any nit-picking to do with respect to this story, it is that, at times, the dialog feels almost too contemporary, more 21st century than late 19th. But this is a minor quibble. In the end, Brennert creates a moving story and one of the most memorable heroines I have ever met, a young girl who blossoms into womanhood and manages to live a remarkable life.The breadth and beauty of this novel cannot be understated, and the fact that Brennert takes a difficult period of Hawaiian history and the topic of leprosy that some might find horrific and creates a life-affirming story of love and perseverance without ever venturing into maudlin sentimentality is something to be lauded. Memorable characters, memorable lives lived with dignity. I couldn't ask for more in a piece of historical fiction.Originally reviewed for Guilty Pleasures at Uniquely Pleasurable."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"...a realistic fiction with some non-fiction detail intertwined, of those who suffered from Hansen's Disease (aka Leprosy). The book was longer than I had anticipated ever wanting to read, but also, rich with detail describing a little girl's life growing up on Molokai and what she discovers about life as a leper, both good and bad. You will see the struggles and joys of her life through this third person account. I implore you to read this book!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a well-written, touching account of the history of those forcibly taken from their homes to the leper colony at Kalaupapa, Molokai. It is also the story of those who tried to help them and in turn helped their own demons. The history is well-told; the images of the island beauty and the island spirit are as though you were there. This is the story of a child taken from her home on Oahu during the leprosy \\"witch hunt\\" and how she grows to maturity - physically, emotionally and spiritually. It integrates the spirit of aloha into every aspect of living and shows the bad things that happen to those who do not practice aloha. It also breaks your heart when you see the unfair things that burden those suffering with this disease and the atrocities they indured in experiments in trying to heal or eradicate the disease. It is a touching tale of a terrible way to treat humans and a soaring of the spirit to rise above it.This book should be required reading for every haole/malihini planning on visiting Hawai\`i. It will make sure your heart is in the right place when you visit the islands."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I am a very literate and reasonably knowledgable person but neither the story of the leper colony on Molokai nor the book, Molokai were things I had ever heard about. Someone told me to read this and boy what a great surprise! It was heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time. This is one of the few books that made me both cry and laugh on several occasions. I feel as if I know Rachel and I've even dreamed about her! After reading this book I did all sorts of research on Hansen's disease as well as on Molokai. A Can't Put down book; perhaps one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Alan Brennert has portrayed a haunting yet intriguing look into the lives of those living on Moloka'i on the Kalaupapa peninsula. Hansen's disease, afflicting many of the Hawaiian people, to this day is still often spoken of in many cultures in hushed whispers. The sensitivity in which this disease is showcased, through the eyes of a young girl growing up, is amazing.

I am not one of those kids who only read for school, I read for fun. When my mom told me about the book she also liked it. I started to read and was so absorbed my mom said it was like I crawled into a hole and did not come out till I was done. I would totally recommend this book for anyone who can read. It tells you of a six year olds journy through puberty and motherhood untill the day she dies. I cried and laughed and even felt angry for this girl.

I can't say how others will be affected by its historical and cultural ramifications, but it made me feel more connected to that part of my family's history. This is a beautifully written book, and a accurate portrayl of Hawaiian history - maybe the first I've ever seen in a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I bought Moloka'i on a whim not knowing a thing about the storyline. I was drawn into the lives and feelings of the characters during the first chapters and became involved and immersed, in every sense, in their world. I can not remember having such an emotional stake in the lives of the characters of a novel, but Mr. Brennert's creation became reality for me as I read. Absolutely stunning and the best book I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in years. It touches on faith, family,fear and prejudices on many levels. Most of all, it's about a life journey of strength and love."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I really, really enjoyed this novel. Like most everyone, I knew very little about Molokai and the leper colony there, other than what I read in history. I found this story fascinating on many different levels and would highly recommend it to anyone...a great read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is appealing in every way, yet very haunting. It is one of the best stories ever written about the island of Moloka'i and the Kalaupapa colony. There is a lot of rich history and culture of the islands from this era, and Alan Brennert conveys it well. He obviously did expensive research and knows the subject thoroughly. He shows a great deal of respect for the islands and the culture. The characters are well developed and so real they seem like actual family members by the time you are finished with this story.The early outcasts to the leper colony were literally thrown into the ocean far from shore off the ships that transported them to the rocky outcropping of land. Some of them never made it to shore. The ones who did had no supplies or support system. It wasn't until later when missionaries or others arrived to assist them that these people even had much of a chance of survival. The missionaries built shelters for the inhabitants and docks for the ships. The outcasts included men, women and even small children who were taken from their homes without their parents. It is only though the goodness of those who were unafraid of the disease and who volunteered to help did the victims of Hansen's Disease have any real chance at all. Alan Brennert captures the heartwrenching story of one young girl who was sent to this colony. This is a must read book, and one you won't be able to put down once you start reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Wow. I read this book with my book club. It prompted lively conversation. The topic of leprosy and the colony on Moloka'i was one we knew very little about. Many of us googled while reading and learned even more. The book is historically accurate, heartbreaking, and oddly hopeful all at once. The characters are developed beautifully, particularly the main character. I cannot imagine how it would feel to not only be removed from your family due to disease but to contract such a debilitating disease in itself would be a difficult cross to bear. Yet the characters work to create their own life on the island, they don't let leprosy define who they are. I think that is the message of joy the story brings. And in that way, the tale is not so different from any other life. A good read, I would recommend highly. My one complaint was that the ending felt trite. My fellow reading colleagues didn't feel that way however. The events felt rushed and somewhat unbelievable, all wrapped up in a tight little package with a bow, which I don't think represents life events."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Always have heard about leper colonies but never before did I realize what these poor people were subjected to.

I learned a lot about Hansen's disease and the Kalaupapa settlement as well."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"There is a saying in Hawaii. 'Welcome back to where you began.' I can not get enough of all things Hawaiian, expecially the history and the \\"talk story\\" that makes the Aloha Spirit come alive. This story speaks of the bravery of a people to ward off disease brought to its shores by people from other lands. The people, old and young who facing disfigurement formed together out of necessity on an island Moloka'i a settlement unto itself with stores and a rich community. All this to make their ordeal somehow rich with experience. You are drawn in immediately and stay there throughout the novel. Allen Brennert has also written Honolulu in what I hope is an ongoing series of lsland books. Get both you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"An excellent read, and a fine accounting of the history of the leper colony at Moloka'i and the turn of the century period in which this story takes place.

I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I didn't think I would enjoy this book. I read it only because my book group was reading. I ended up really enjoying it!!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"From the cover, I expected a romance novel that I would skim and hope to get a little Hawaiian history in the process. I was wrong. It was a very touching novel about love and loss, as well as overcoming adversity.My hotel room on Maui gave me a great view of Molokai, and I was happy to have such a wonderful book to read while I was looking at it. I finished it when I got home, but I'd really like to see that part of Molokai after the descriptions.The author did a really nice job with the main character. I truly wondered what would happen to her, and how she'd handle certain situations. She surprised me almost every time. The main characters were very well drawn, as well as some of the minor characters."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The span of the material relative to Hawaii's history is combined flawlessly with the story of a young girl forcibly removed from her family because of leprosy. The book, to me, was reminiscent of Michener's \\"Hawaii\\" with a character development reminiscent of \\"Memories of a Geisha.\\" The former developed location/history and the latter developed characters/situations. This book does both, with neither aspect suffering in the process.I think the treatment of historical characters, those based upon historical characters and of fully fictional characters is even-handed. It would have been easy to denigrate the indigenous beliefs or to either idolize or demonize the reglious who served in the leper colony. The author does none of these things, but rather sets our protagonists and antagonists on a rich stage.Wonderful read. Can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is a beautifully written, emotionally-laden novel that I can say is one of the best books I have ever read.Brennert, addresses how leprosy affected the Hawaiian people and culture. Although he a haole, Brennert does a beautiful job of respectfully illustrating the essence of the nation of Hawa'ii before it was overrun with tourism and overdevelopment. The spirit of Hawa'ii is captured in a way that infects the reader's heart.I usually shy away from historical fiction because it bores me with too many details, or perhaps I do not appreciate history for what it is. But Moloka'i interweaves historical facts into the lives of vivid, unforgettable characters. Although I am familiar with some of Hawaii's history, I have learned a great deal more from Moloka'i and am emotionally affected by Brennert's novel. I can't wait to read Honolulu, Brennert's next book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is very informantive and has a heart warming story line. I could not put it down.

Would recommend thought provoking Quick and easy read. Nice to have as an ebook and would get it again"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I liked this book and the historic background. I lived in Hawaii as a child while much of story of the leper colony was unfolding - back in the 1940's. At that time, they were only experimenting with treatments and possible cures for leprosy. The characters in the story seemed very real and authentically drawn. The intimate details of daily life among the members of the colony and among those whose chosen ministry was to care for them. That part was very interesting to me. The setting was reminiscent for me - the pali, the lava rocks, the spraying of the surf, the trees and other plants. Hawaii came back vividly for me.I got a little bogged down in the later third of the book. However, it was worth persevering.

I highly recommend this book. Could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"It takes a good author to make a good story out of history and that is what has happened here. A real story based on history and the author did his homework learning about this disease and following a person through the years on this island where people were put so they could not spread the disease. I wonder what was missing for those that did not seem to enjoy this book. It moved beautifully and one could not help but learn about the disease, religion, history of the islands and the times."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I was trying to figure out a way to explain just what it was about this book that made it so glorious. Then I found it, hidden away at the bottom of page 372. \\"With wonder and a growing absence of fear she realized, I am more than I was an hour ago.\\"That sensation really does sum it up. \\"I am more than I was an hour ago.\\" It is a feeling that is woven through every page, colors every event. It takes something so tragic, a story about a child taken from her family and sent to live in the leper colony on Moloka'i and all the death and pain that can and does result, and transforms it. This is a story about growing and evolving, about living.The writing is beautiful. The first few times the marks of leprosy were described in an almost nonchalant fashion, the horror and vague nausea they inspired, quickly faded. This was the background, the catalyst but not the story.Apart from a story of the experience of lepers at that time, the late 1800's moving forward, it is also the story of a culture in upheaval. It is the transition of Hawaii into a United States possession and the movement from traditional religion to Christianity. Absolutely fascinating was reading about the events of Peal Harbor from the point of view of a colony of quarantined lepers. The first time they saw a moving picture. How excited they were to get electricity.Leprosy sets the scene, but does not color the story. It is always there, as Rachel grows to an adult away from her family, gaining new family on Moloka'i, but it is more about the people than the disease.A beautiful book. I think everyone should give it a read. I am more than I was before reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is a unique blend of sobering and tragic historical fact and hopeful fiction.

It proved to be a very wise choice.Alan Brennert wove historical fiction so intricately that I believed fully that Rachel Kalama existed in time. I could not read this book fast enough, needing to follow the path that Rachel took to complete the circle of her life. Her courage, her loves and her tragedies were so brilliantly spoken of in Mr. Brennert's narrative. All of the supporting characters were beautifully painted as well.

It is well researched, and clearly based on fact. If any aspiring writer wants a lesson in character development, they need look no further than Moloka'i. There are so many prominent characters in this book; all of them are beautifully crafted.I was advised to \\"have a tissue or two on hand.\\" That advice turned out to be inadequate.

With this book you get a LOT of interesting information delivered via a touching story that enables you to sympathize with the people who were sent to Molokai, their families and the type of people who worked and lived there. It is not the story alone that makes this book great because solely as a story it is a little wanting - but quite good. What makes it a terrific book is that the story is a tender vehicle for making the information personal. I am very glad I read it."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Not going to tell you anything about the content of the book. I'm not here to show off my writing skills either.

I read this book and it stayed with me for years. I can still think about it and picture the story. I have a very short attention span and reading is slow for me. If a book gets boring, I put it down...I don't give it a chapter or even 2 pages. Not interesting, not going to read it. This book has heart and it is character driven.

The novel by Alan Brennert takes you on a roller coaster ride of varied emotions. It involves the infamous Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement on the island of Moloka'i in Hawaii. It also touches on America's illegal overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani's throne in 1893. More can be read about that in the Queen's book \\"Hawaii's Story\\", or in James A. Michener's classic novel \\"Hawaii\\". As with \\"Honolulu\\", Brennert uses a lot of local vocabulary; such as, 'ohana ( family ) and haole ( a caucasian ), which I find adds realism and charm to his novels.It's 1891 and five year old Rachel Kalama is enjoying life as a child in Honolulu. Everything is great until her mother finds a pink patch on Rachel's leg. She later develops another spot on her foot. When mom pricks the spots with a pin there isn't any pain, which is a sign of leprosy. Later that week, her sister Sarah gets mad at Rachel and calls her a leper in front of schoolmates. That brings the leprosy bounty hunter to the house and it's off to Kahili Hospital for Rachel. She is there eleven months for evaluation and treatment to no avail. At this point she is torn away from her family and sent to the leper camp on Moloka'i. Since there isn't any known cure, it's a death sentence for the now seven year old.In Kalaupapa, Rachel is befriended by Sister Catherine of the missionaries and reunited with her Uncle Pono, who was previously declared a leper. She struggles with the disease's traits, but manages to make friends with the dying people around her. Fortunately, her symptoms are slower to develop and she is able to surf, and meet other young patients under the quarantined life. Here Brennert turns this somber and depressing story into a dramaturgy of ups and downs, good and bad fortune, and high and low spirits. The many characters in this book are so contagious to the reader ( pardon the pun ) that you feel vicariously for them. Great job of character development!Alan Brennert does a yeoman's job of cramming 79 years of Rachel's life into 389 pages! The novel was such a page- turner that I hardly noticed the years go by. The reason I like historical fiction of this kind is due to the educational benefits you gain from reading this book. It's hard to believe that a wondrous place like Hawaii could have also been a coldhearted prison for the forsaken kama'aina."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is an historical novel set in Hawaii, a place we often think of as paradise, around the turn of the century. It chronicles a girl's life coping with the disease of leprosy and it is more like hell than heaven. Although we often think of leprosy as a horrible disease that devastates the body, this novel reveals the even more painful social consequences of this disease at a time when so little was know about leprosy and it was considered both incurable and highly contagious. Rachel, the central character, as well as her family suffer as much as from ostracism and social isolation than the immediate effects of leprosy. Taken from her family at the age of seven, Rachel is first sent to a local hospital where even parental visits are timed and no touching is allowed. This is followed by exile on Molokai where she lives at the home for girls run by Catholic nuns. Meanwhile, the disease splinters her family as the house where Rachel lived is quarantined, and her mother and siblings are shunned by friends and church. Rachel makes friends at the compound on Molokai but loses them too as leprosy takes its toll on most of the young girls around her. The nuns who care for her and the other girls do not contract the disease but they do suffer from loss, depression and burnout sometimes as much as their patients.Rachel's life progresses against the background of Hawaii's development from a monarchy to a provisional government to actual annexation by the United States. Through several secondary characters the reader learns of the ancient culture of the islands, much of which was lost due to the influence of the missionaries. New century conveniences such as electric lighting, movies, a new leprosy research center come to the island. But the leper population of Molokai remains isolated and untouchable. All of Rachel's life is filtered through the prism of this disease yet she remains hopeful as she makes decisions for the future and for the good of others.It is easy to note the similarity of past reactions to leprosy, or Hanson's disease as we now know it, and recent attitudes towards HIV. Also similar are the difficulties of past caregivers and those of the present day in dealing with terminal illness and the strain on both family members and friends of those who are ill with rare or incurable sicknesses.But most noteworthy about this novel is how it illustrates the enormous power of compassion, kindness, caring, and a sense of hope in overcoming fear, pain and humiliation."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I guess I'm easy for writers to satisfy. I don't understand the harshest critcisms of this book, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject matter; either Hawaii, or Leprosy. My wife and I visit Hawaii almost every year. It is one of our favorite places, and this book increased my knowlege of the islands, my knowlege of Leprosy, and my knowledge of Kalauapapa. While doing that, it allowed me to vicariously immerse myself in lesser-known aspects of these islands that I love. That's all enough for me to give the book a 4-star rating.This book informs about the real abuse of people. Any book that exposes readers to the true reality of abuse of living beings (or abuse of the land), is making a potential contribution that might encourage the awakening of people, in order that we might behave more kindly in the future. In this age when gratuitous and abstract violence saturates so much popular media, any work that succeeds to expose our past acts of painful shame gets my support. Even if this wasn't one of Brennert's goals (though I suspect it was, at some level), this work is helpful. Face our shameful past, in order that we might not repeat it. (Though humanity's current performance makes one wonder if anything can really help.)"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The wretched effects of Hansen's disease [leprosy] and the inhumane separation of family members because of ignorance are in sharp contrast with the place: the scenic island of Molokai, the Kalaupapa Peninsula teeming with lush tropical flowers, imposing limestone cliffs and all surrounded by the warm aquamarine sea. This paradise became the home for the lepers whom the Board of Health sent to live out their lives isolated from healthy family members and with little hope to ever see freedom again. A heart-wrenching story that touches on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese internment in the US, and the medical advances to treat Hansen's which arrested the disease's debilitating progress giving hope to the sufferers."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I am just finishing this book but I have to let everyone out there know what a wonderful book this is. What an interesting piece of history. I learned so much from this novel and was so drawn in by the main character Rachel. The author weaves a wonderful tale as we follow Rachel through her life. I don't want to give anything away. I strongly recommend this read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I thought this was a difficult read at first; it took me a while to get into the story. However, once I did, it was hard to put this book down. I learned so much about a topic I knew nothing about -- leper colonies in Hawaii in the early 20th century. I learned a lot about leprosy in general. It's hard to believe that a disease that is so easily treated now created so much havoc and tragedy in the not-too-distant past. The love story in this book is very nice, and the historical context fascinating."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Book was as described and came on time. Book is well worth reading for its history and stories. It covers events that have been mostly forgotten."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is a very compelling book. It is a story of heartache, joy and love. It takes you to the Prison in Paradise, Molokai's \\"Leper Colony\\", where the inhabitants courageously fight to live normal lives. You are transported to turn of the century Hawaii, and experience the ignorance and prejudice of the Hawaiian people when Leprosy (now known as Hanson's Disease) strikes. The story is about a young girl who is taken away from her family to live on this distant Hawaiian island, and how she copes with her situation and helps support her new \\"family\\". It is about kindness and lifelong friendships. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I liked this book but I couldn't finish reading it. I got as far as Rachel and Kenji falling in love and then I didn't want to know the bad stuff that I was sure would happen. I guess I really prefer to live in the land of sunshine and rainbows where everything turns out fine and good people get to have good endings to their lives. I guess I need to grow up! ;)"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"When we first meet Rachel, it's 1891 and she's a seven-year-old helping her mother make poi. At this point, none of them have an idea of the changes their family will go through. It begins with her uncle being tracked down and taken away because he has the \\"separating sickness\\". It is leprosy, and it is taken very seriously, because Hawaiians are particularly susceptible. When Rachel's mother discovers a red spot on Rachel's leg with no feeling, she knows what is going to happen. She tries to hide it, but her efforts are in vain as Rachel is taken away to be evaluated. They'll never be together again.I thought this was a fascinating book. Not only do you get a bit of Hawaiian history before Hawaii was part of the U.S., you get to see a really unusual side of it. I had no idea that leprosy was such a problem in Hawaii, nor did I know the lengths the government went through to prevent its spread. They took the sick, young and old alike, and isolated them in an island community stuck in time. Not only are they not allowed physical contact with any of the non-infected (other than the nuns caring for them), their families are often shunned as \\"unclean\\" and forced to make difficult decisions. The lepers are assigned a place to live and then expected to make a life for themselves -- however long it may be.The book is wonderfully written, showing us Rachel's story from multiple points of view. Rachel is relatively lucky. Her form of the disease is the less disfiguring one, so she is able to build some semblance of a normal life. So normal, in fact, that I often wondered how the book would be different if she had the more severe form. Not that she didn't suffer; in fact, she probably suffered more than most, because she had to lose so many close friends. Brennert shows us a full range of emotion, from anger, to acceptance, to guilt, to hope, to happiness, and despair.And, in a way, we also get a history of leprosy. During Rachel's lifetime there are many medical breakthroughs, some more successful than others. We see not only what the treatments are, but how they affected people.For me, there's one thing more than anything else that tells me I've read a great piece of historical fiction: I go straight to Wikipedia to read about what really happened. Some characters in the book are based on real people, but Rachel is an amalgam. Moloka'i is a real place, and in fact, the parts of the island where the lepers were housed are now a National Historic Park. It is still an active leper colony, and you can visit by arranging for a guided tour. The only way into these parts is on the back of a donkey.I highly recommend Moloka'i. Can ya tell?"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Living in Hawai'i for a few years, I stumbled across this novel and all I can say is WOW! I've loved Alan Brennert since I've read this book - I REALLY hope he continues to write Hawaiian/Asian historical fiction. If you loved \\"Moloka'i,\\" read his next book \\"Honolulu,\\" another AMAZING book! Well written, great plots and characters. Even if you're not from Hawai'i or familiar with it, his writing is so easy to follow."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I read the book in such a short time, spellbinding and you feel as you are there with her and living through what she was going through..I definately recommend this book even if it was fiction, there was so much history you felt it was Non-fiction."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I was given this book to read by the book club I had just joined. It's not something I would have picked off the shelf, as I am a bit squeamish about leprosy. I have seen a lot of pictures of leprosy and so I had a clear idea of what the author was describing - I think the book might be easier to read for those without a great visual imagination. That being said the book is a good work of historical fiction with an vibrant cast of characters that being to life an island in Hawaii. Although I didn't like that it was written in the third person because towards the end it started to clunk, it was entertaining, poignant and lovely, I could almost feel the breeze blowing through the palm trees as I read.The story is of a seven year old child, Rachel, who is sent to Kalaupapa, a quarantined leper colony in Hawaii, and follows her life and the life of the colony. The story unfolds of how inside their walls the people find how to live life to the full despite being cut off from the rest of the world. Beautifully written and imagined, worthwhile to read for just the story and then to realise that was how some people were made to live.Author of In the Realm of the Golden Queen"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I had read this book some time ago after reading Honolulu by the same author.

On the tour of the Island i met several other fans of this novel who also had been inspired to travel to Molokai after finishing the book!!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I love to read, but it's difficult to find books that can keep my attention (when there are so many other things to do). Thus I am not an avid reader, but I own a good number of books, most of which are books that seem interesting that I had started reading and never finished. And so they sit on the shelf collecting dust. When my fiance got me this book for Christmas, he thought I would like it but secretly I thought \\"oh great, another book that I would never read or finish.\\"As always, I started to read Moloka'i with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself unable to put it down. Moloka'i is a very touching story that captures the life of Rachel, who was diagnosed with leprosy at the age of 7 and was sent to Moloka'i, where leprosy patients were sent, leaving behind her family, friends and life.The story takes place between the late 1800's and mid 1900's and covers all of the history that occurred during that time. It is fascinating to discover what life was like for these patients of the colony and the author gave us a glimpse of the darkness they faced. The book is a reminder that life is fragile and unpredictable, but that we are able to overcome and prevail in life's hardships. I was touched by the story- Rachel, along with the all the non-fictional sufferers of leprosy, have left a lasting impression."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is definitely in my top ten all time favorites!

A must-read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is an historical fiction that tells the sometimes horrible story of leper patients who lived in Hawaii. There are great things in this book. It will make you weep because it all really happened (except the main characters are fictional). But there is also humor and love and great kindness. It's well written and about a subject that was foreign to me. I learned a lot and read a few other books on the subject afterward to find out more. I highly recommend it. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A tragic tale embroidered with exquisite detail reflecting careful research, Moloka'i sets the standard for historical fiction set in Hawai'i. To take a subject like the isolation of people with Hansen's disease, as black a mark in American history as the internment of Japanese families during WWII, and make it an engaging, even romantic encounter is a unique literary accomplishment. We care about the young Hawaiian girl taken from her family and hidden away from prying eyes for almost her entire life. We chafe with her as her youth and beauty fades and the hideous disease progresses in her body. We recoil in horror when she has to give up her baby so her child will not become infected with the yet misunderstood disease. Our hearts break when her husband, the only happiness she has been allowed in this prison of isolation, dies. But, we are lifted high when she finally is freed and able to find her adult daughter. Alan Brennert does a masterful job imparting nuances of the Hawaiian culture and his descriptive powers capture the spell of the Islands. That the postcard perfect jutting green pali of Kalapaupapa on Moloka'i served as a prison for hundreds of native Hawaiians is something that should not be forgotten.Linda Ballou"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I knew that Molokai was an island used to isolate people with leprosy but I did not know about the symptoms of the disease or the isolation of those that lived there.

Besides her story being captivating you learn so much of how leprosy was treated in those days and the stigma attached to the disease.

All in all, I enjoyed this book. I didn't love it, but I liked it. For those readers that need a lot of action in a book, this one did not disappoint. There was always something going on. In my opinion, the middle and end of the book is a lot stronger than the beginning. I had a hard time getting hooked right off the bat but after about 30% of the book it started to pick up significantly. There were quite a few characters in the book but the really important ones were easy to remember. And the subject of leprosy was actually quite interesting since I literally knew nothing about it. This would be a good read for the summer. The stange thing is that I liked the book but I can't say I'm interested in the author's other books though."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"It took me only 3 hours to plow through this book. Then I read it again in another three hours. I loved \\"Honolulu\\" by Alan Brennert and I knew I would love this book too.I lived in hawaii for many many years and I never got the chance to visit Moloka'i. I have always been fascinated with Hansen's Disease since I was little and my dad told me the story of Jesus curing the leper. Yet, even the bible wouldn't be able to thoroughly portray the hideousness of the disease, the horrid effects to has on families and friends, on children and adults. It wasn't until Mr. Brennert gave there people a voice, albeit from a fictional character, that we can fully appreciate an ounce of pain these people went through.I haven't cried so hard while reading a book, nor have I ever felt more like a local girl than now.

You know when you read a book that is SO incredible and you just can't put it down and you can't wait to pick it back up to keep reading it? That's what this book was for me. The story line was captivating, and the inclusion of all of the historical information about the lepers' lives on the colony and what they endured and what life was like there was so fascinating to me. I have since read other accounts of the leper colony on Kalaupapa and they all mirror the information in this book. Absolutely captivating.

Lost me somewhat in the middle there. A little bias against Christian religion which kind of bugged me. Overall a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Born just before the turn of the century, Rachel's life was much like that of any other young girl in Honolulu. Hawai'i was straddling the dividing line between the traditional ways of it's people and the modern changes wrought by the arrival of the haoleohana. Yet she never gave up hope that some day she would be cured and released from her prison.Moloka'i tells the tragic story not just of Rachel, but of Hawai'i, as they both came of age together. In every word and scene you can read just how deeply Brennert researched his subject, making both the disease and the culture equally important characters as that of Rachel. Rachel and the Hawaiian culture were both written with incredible depth and honesty. As an author, he made me smile, laugh, grieve, and rage in anger for Rachel and her people. Each time tragedy struck Rachel and Hawai'i, I cried with them. Yet, he also managed to educate me on something of which I was previously woefully ignorant. I have long been angry at how the native populations have been displaced and treated, but never seemed to connect the Hawaiian islanders with this same mistreatment. I now know better. I also know far more about leprosy, or Hansen's Disease as it is now known, than I ever wished to. And yet, I want to know more. Moloka'i was finally closed in 1980; incredible to think that only 30 short years ago these people, unbeknown to many I'm willing to bet, were living like caged animals in a zoo.While Rachel's story is fictional, it could have easily been that of someone who actually survived this horrific tragedy. I am thankful to Mr. Brennert for opening my eyes to a piece of American history of which I knew nothing. It is an incredibly sad and moving story, and while he is not the first to bring this story to the public, his is undoubtedly the most widely read. I will be reading more; more of Brennert's novels, more on Moloka'i, and more on Hawaii's history and culture. I will also be recommending this novel to anyone who will listen to me."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I could not put this amazing book down once I began reading. It is historical fiction so both the story and the characters are realistic. It is based on true events surrounding Leprosy/Hansen's disease in Hawaii. I live in Honolulu and I've been to Moloka'i, so it was interesting to read about the places I know. It may not be as interesting to someone who does not have any Hawaii ties or interest. It is heartbreaking but amazing at the same time. I cried in several places but just had to keep on reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Wow. I learned so much about leprosy and Hawaii and Japanese-Americans. I learned so much, period. And, at the same time, I was highly entertained and fell in love with some beautiful characters. I love when a novel can do that. This, combined with Neil White's In the Sanctuary of Outcasts gave me a window into an ancient world that still actually exists. Leprosy may not occur as often in America as it used to, but ostracized people come in all shapes and sizes, and we are just as guilty of the prejudices against them as we were back then, with leprosy."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book but the Kindle edition annoyingly leaves out the first letter of many paragraphs. These are the first paragraphs of chapters or major section breaks in chapters, not all paragraphs.

It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry at the ignorance of people and it made me happy at the good in people.

But, visitors have brought disease to the islands, one disease being leprosy. The appearance of lesions can send you to a special hospital, destroy your family, and eventually send you to Moloka'i, the leper colony.Rachel Kalama is six years old when she has to say goodbye to her uncle. It seems that leprosy has claimed him and she misses him. But, a year later, Rachel is in the same predicament. As her parents try to hide the two lesions, a hastily said slur from her sister rips Rachel from her family. Thus begins Rachel's journey into something no seven year old should have to face. Moloka'i becomes her home, and while Rachel has many difficult moments, her youthful resiliency wins. Through the horrors, setbacks, and poignant scenes, Rachel shines through as an example of living. If you choose to take this journey to Moloka'i, you may find your life changed. Why not come listen to Rachel tell her story?This is a wonderfully poignant book full of good and bad times, happy and sad times, and a good deal of history. I came to love the many characters I met and felt sorrow when one died. The descriptions of leprosy can be intense, but add so much to the richness of the story. Living life to the fullest seems to be an overriding theme here. I recommend this book to individual readers as well as groups. There is so much to discuss here!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I had done my senior thesis in high school on Hansen's Disease, Father Damion and Molokai and I felt like I was revisiting the island.

Alan Brennert does an incredible job of bringing home the very personal and emotional impact that this disease had on the entire Hawaiian population and particulary the families personally affected by it. The horror and dread of contracting this disease and what it meant to the entire family was conveyed in a way that a nonfiction book could not illustrate."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I never rate books but felt so strongly about this one that I had to give it 5 stars. A beautiful fictional story with true characters and historical facts woven in. \\"Moloka'i\\" is must read for anyone who is interested in what life was really like at the Kalaupapa leper colony. I will never forget the story of Rachel Kalama."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This story weaves together characters from real life based on the author's detailed research. Before reading it, I knew very little about the how people with leprosy were treated, and had no idea of the life that existed within their confinement.This is an excellent piece of historical fiction, told through the character of Rachel's eyes from childhood until the end of her life. The author explores many themes, including how life within confinement is, the sacrifices she was forced to make, faith, and how societies at large often make horrible mistakes when they come upon something they don't understand (i.e. the colony, Japanese interment).I also want to say that while there is much to be learned here, this book doesn't read like a history book. It is very engaging, right from the beginning, and is a book you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is truly one of the most moving books I've ever read. While it's a work of historical fiction, Alan Brennert manages to create characters that mingle seamlessly with actual historical figures (i.e. Mother Marienne, Ambrose Hutchison) in a tragic, yet engrossing novel.Rachael's story is heartbreaking and memorable. I found myself actually caring about the characters, and once I finished the novel, I wanted to learn more about Moloka'i and its residents. Like a Hawaiian vacation, it felt like the novel ended way too soon.This book is amazing. Others have reviewed it well, so I won't reinvent the wheel--all I can say is that this is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Molokai is a sweeping narrative that pulls together all the elements that make a compelling story--characters who come alive with Brennert's descriptions and whom the reader truly comes to know and care about; a setting that is exotic to most; an historical perspective that is well researched; and a plot that keeps moving with twists and turns to hold the reader's attention right until the end. There is a message in Molokai of hope and kindness and endurance that refreshes and inspires."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This was a sad story but how she stayed on the island and how she was taken from her family.

This novel takes place after Father Damien is gone. It is beautifully written and very historically accurate.

I read the book while on Ka'anapali Beach on Maui - looking at the island of Moloka'i. Very moving !"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A friend recommended this book and I enjoyed it from the first page. It's written well I found myself reading \\"just one more page\\" every night. It covers a part of history that I never knew. Rachel's character and story will make you laugh, cry, and linger in your mind for a long time after."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Pros: One thing I thought the author did a great job on was describing in detail the magnificent beauty of the Hawaiian islands, the conflict between native and introduced religion, and just the historical aspects in general. The book was well researched and well written in general, and the words chosen were often quite poetic. The author also would sometimes do a great job of getting into the character's feelings (later in the novel when Rachel is older), but would often miss out (i.e. the young Rachel's thoughts and feelings).Cons: A major problem I thought the novel had was that the author spent way to much time in Rachel's childhood, but didn't even explore into her conflicts. Although I found Rachel to be a realistic and well made character, during this time, he tries to introduce other characters that seem to just float in and out of the novel without really trying to delve into most of these people. I found the most annoying one to be Sister Catherine. I usually find troubled characters the most interesting, but Brennert really missed the mark with this one. Although it seems like the author was trying to show an emotional struggle for this woman, the surface is only skimmed which leaves you simply wondering about this character; she comes to a conclusion from this internal conflict seemingly out of nowhere with no real reasons.What could have been a very gripping and fascinating novel left me feeling empty. I really didn't learn much more than when I had googled \\"Moloka'i\\" before reading this book, nor get much insight either into how someone might have lived and felt in that time until the end of the book. I hardly ever struggle to get through a novel, but this one would often get very boring and simply tedious."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I love historical fiction. And, while I enjoyed the history of Moloka'i and the learning about the lives of the lepers, I think the novel fell very short of creating an emotional attachment to any of the characters. Events and people come and go, and moments that should have been heart-breaking to the reader came and went without much thought. I found myself skimming to the end and feeling empty."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i tells a story we should hear but I have two issues with the book itself. To read so many pages, covering so many decades of time in the life of Rachel with so much detail, new characters coming in and out, from the point of view of a distant narrator makes the read tedious. This story would be far more compelling if it could have been constructed from within this dear lady who had to pass through unthinkable tragedy. The development of the other characters too suffers from the distance taken by this style of writing."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I very much enjoyed this novel.

Considering the setting is the leper colony in Hawaii at the turn of the century, you would not think you could fall in love with the characters or story. If that is holding you back from reading Moloka'i, then don't let it. The characters are well treated by this author, especially the pivotal character, Rachel, who is followed from childhood to old age. I also really appreciated how the author treated Sister Mary Catherine, not shying away from her own crisis of faith. A compelling read about a sad time in history. It certainly made me appreciate the advances in medicine that have been made since."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The book downloaded quickly onto my Kindle. It was easy to read, as well as priced reasonably and a very good read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"One day as a young adolescent, while browsing at the library, I came across the book Miracle at Carville by Betty Martin. This book, which told the story of the author's diagnosis of leprosy in her 20's, also described the years she spent receiving treatment for this disease at a hospital in Carville, Georgia. Of the many books I have read since then, few have made as much of an impression on me as this title. When I learned about the sequel, I immediately rushed to borrow No One Must Ever Know and felt the same way about this title too. Recently I chanced upon the book Moloka'i by Alan Brennert and recognized the name of this area in Hawaii that was a former leprosy colony. I immediately had to read this book, and while no longer an impressionable adolescent as I once was, this book again filled me with compassion and love for the people who lived and suffered from this life threatening and alienating disease.In the late 19th century surrounded by the beauty of the islands of Hawaii, 7 year old Rachel Kalma lives an idyllic live surrounded by family members who adore her. While her father travels the world for his job, Rachel listens attentively to her father's stories and hopes one day to see the places her father vividly describes to her. Although there are some in their area who contract leprosy and are removed from the surroundings like Rachel's uncle, nobody ever thinks this disease will affect Rachel. Then she begins to show signs of a lesion which doesn't' respond to any of he mother's ministrations or medicine from the doctors. Eventually the authorities receive word that Rachel may have this disease and when they investigate Rachel, her families fears confirmed, she must leave her family to live among other lepers. Separated from her family except for occasional visits by her father and the company of her afflicted uncle, Rachel must make a new life for herself surrounded by an unusual cast of loving people. Adversity strengthens her as she comes to know the kind sister who cares for her, a fellow leper who hides a dark secret and the love of a good man whom she marries and even becomes a mother. By the end of this book, we weep with Rachel as friends die and cheer for her when she is able to fulfill some of her dreams. But the best part for me was that these were no longer characters in a book but people who I considered good friends, so vividly were they portrayed by the author.Told over six decades, Moloka'i tells the gripping story of adversity and the triumph of the human spirit. As I neared the end of the book I couldn't help but think of how we once viewed AIDS sufferers isolating them in many of the same way lepers were also once isolated. The author has written a compelling book and one worthy to take its place among other titles on this subject like Betty Martin's books and The Samurai's Garden by Gail Tsukiyama."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This gripping novel is based on the author's serious research into the history of the Kalaupapa colony for suffers of leprosy (Hansen's disease) on Moloka'i. Brennert focuses on the human tragedy, both of individual sufferers and of their families who, suffering guilt by association, were ostracized by their neighbors and employers. But he also emphasizes the personal triumphs of these patients, recognizing their dignity and celebrating their achievements. Though a leper colony can never be free from profound sadness, Brennert avoids turning this novel into a ten-hanky tearjerker, focusing instead on the lives the patients create for themselves and on their attempts at normalcy.Rachel Kalama, the main character, is a typical 5-year-old growing up in a loving family in Honolulu when her mother first sees a sore on Rachel's leg which will not heal. Although she keeps Rachel's condition a secret for a year, Rachel is eventully seized by the health inspector, who receives a bounty for capturing her, and sent to a secure Honolulu hospital. A year later, she is sent to Kalaupapa, on Moloka'i, and her isolation--at the age of seven--is total. The &quot;family&quot; she develops in Kalaupapa, her friendships with other young children, and her refusal to let the disease (or any of the nuns) control her spirit make her life bearable, and the reader will admire her pluck even while dreading what her future holds.Yet Rachel is one of those in whom the disease develops very slowly, and her story continues through her teen years, her marriage, and well beyond. Through her, Brennert shows the history of the settlement, the history of treatment for Hansen's disease, and the history of Hawaii itself, including the seizure of the Queen and the annexation and colonization of the islands by the American sugar barons (events which clearly parallel Rachel's story). Brennert enriches his novel by incorporating events described in real documents and journals into his story, from its lawless, &quot;wild West&quot; atmosphere at the outset, to its final development as a &quot;home&quot; for the people who live there. He memorializes many real people among the fictional characters, including Robert Louis Stevenson.Though there is melodrama and sentimentality here, and Rachel's life at Kalaupapa may be more rosy-colored than it was in reality, the emotion flows naturally from the subject and the author's desire to present the full historical record. Few readers will remain unchanged by Rachel's story. As one character says, &quot;How we choose to live with pain, injustice, or death...is the true measure of the Divine within us.&quot; Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This amazing story caught me up in the first few pages. We meet seven-year old Rachel Kalama, youngest child in her Honolulu family. When she is discovered to have a small leprous sore on her leg, Rachel is snatched from the bosom of her family and sent first to be \\"cured\\" in the Kahili hospital in Honolulu. After a year in Kahili, she is then sent to the Kalaupapa leper colony on Molokai. The story of Rachel and her new family on Molokai is beautiful, inspirational and very uplifting.Character development is very strong in this story. The figure of Sister Catherine Voorhies was perhaps my favorite of the whole story, as she deals with her own personal demons as well as her own doubts of \\"Why does God give children leprosy?\\" This story is so wonderful as Rachel and her new-found 'ohana (family) rise above their disease and find dignity and love in their isolated home.Simply one of the most moving and enjoyable books I've read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is an interesting novel about a young Hawaiian leper, Rachel, banished, as it were, to a Kalaupapa, a quarantined colony on Moloka'I, at the turn of the last century, when leprosy was a relatively misunderstood disease. The notion of the colony is fascinating and the devastation one instance of leprosy can do to one young woman and her family is rife with possibilities. Unfortunately, the novel tries to accomplish too much while not doing enough. Rachel's entire life is encompassed in this novel, yet the focus is disproportionately on her earlier years, where as a young child, the depth of her emotions is left unexplored. As she grows older, when her emotions could truly come into play, Brennert leapfrogs from event to event in Rachel's life and awkwardly ties the World War II Japanese camps to Kalaupapa. I felt almost as if Brennert began the novel with the intent of crafting a sweeping saga, but that he somehow lost steam halfway through and began to take narrative shortcuts. Moloka'i is certainly an interesting and engaging novel, but Brennert fails to draw enough of an emotional connection to Rachel. I just wish he could have done more."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"In my wildest dreams I would never have picked up a book about leprosy, but this was unbelievable. The book weaves history through a girl's own ordeal with the disease. You learn a lot about Hawaii's development and how they dealt with an illness for which they had no immunity. The author does a wonderful job in catching glimpses of life while the islands' dealt in erradicating this from the masses. EXCEPTIONAL!!!!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Set in Hawaii more than a century ago, this is the true to life chronicle of the people of Kalaupapa, lepers separated from their family and friends by a debilitating disease, and of how they embraced their plight and lived their lives with warmth, compassion and humor.Although the book is classified as \\"historical fiction\\" much of it examines Hawaii's beginnings and traditions. Few readers will remain unmoved by the story of Rachel Kalama, a seven year old girl whose dreams of journeying to far off lands is shattered by her diagnosis as a leper, her seperation from her family and her confinement to Kalaupapa.You'll laugh, you'll cry, but most of all this story will haunt you and you will be drawn to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Wow, what a powerful story. If Oprah Winfrey's book club were still open to new novels then \\"Moloka'i\\" would rank right up there with \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" and \\"Bridges of Madison County\\". I could NOT put this book down - such is the story's \\"what happens next\\" factor! I read this book in a marathon, bleary-eyed two days -- something I haven't done since my mother gave me \\"Gone With The Wind\\" when I was 14 (reading under the covers late into the night with a flashlight!). Don't be put off by the fact that the primary antagonist in the story is the disease of leprosy: this is quickly relegated to the reader's subconscious as we become absorbed in the human drama of Rachel Kalama's life. Alan Brennert takes us back to Hawaii in the late 19th century and vividly recreates its unspoiled beauty. I was swept along with Rachel who, at the age of 7, is taken from her loving family and banished to the remote island of Moloka'i. Rachel finds her Uncle Pono (who preceded her there and is sadly the source of her own infection) and forges a new life with new friends in various stages of this devastating illness. As heartbreaking as her story is, it is also a story of hope, love, endurance and ultimately survival."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"There is not much to add after reading all of the glowing reviews that come before mine -other reviewers have hit my exact feelings on the mark. An inspiring story of a young girl's perserverence over a hopelessly bleak future.

I could not put this book down and anxiously waited for the moments I could get a page or two in; Rachel and her life became a part of mine. I kept forgetting that she was a fictional character; her story brought me to tears and laughter many times.

This book is a must-read for anyone who has been there, plans to go there, or even is just interested in it. This book brought back all my memories of that visit. It truly is \\"sacred\\" ground for Hawaiians.The author captures all of the emotions, stories, and cruel ironies of those unfortunate people who contracted this terrible disease. Rachel sees her family torn apart, faces constant discrimination, and sees her emotions ride a never-ending rollercoaster as one after another of her friends die of Hansen's Disease. The suffering these people felt is unimaginable and the emotional pain of being forcibly separated from their families is horrific. But the story is uplifting, as Rachel and the others find ways to be happy with what little they have, take pleasure in helping others, and are always hopeful of a cure which thankfully, eventually came."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"\\"That is what I believe in, Aouli. I believe in Hawai'i. I believe in the land.\\"Rachel Kalama is only a girl of seven when she is taken from the loving arms of her mother and father, Dorothy and Henry Kalama, and sent to Kalaupapa, Moloka'i, a leper colony. But although Rachel is torn away from her biological 'ohana, family, she forges relationships and connections that carry her through her illness.I chose this book for my book club because I spent almost 12 years of my childhood in Hawaii. And reading this book was like taking a walk back through my life. I may never have spent any time on Moloka'i, but I recognized many of the names and places that Rachel visits on Oahu (though she was there in 1893 and I was there in 1993).One of the biggest, best things about this book is the setting and atmosphere. I thought Alan Brennert did an incredible job creating Hawaii in book form. I could feel it in the descriptions of the landscape, in the usage of Hawaiian names, in the very being of many of the characters (such as Haleola, Rachel's adopted aunt, who so neatly provides the quote I used for my review title). When a book makes you homesick, when a book makes you, after almost 30 years of indecision, finally figure out where your \\"hometown\\" is, that is a tremendous feat.Overall, I really liked the characters too. I felt they were three dimensional and actually felt Hawaiian or Nisei or white or whatever ethnicity they were. Rachel, of course, is our primary character, and I thought she was a great choice. We follow her through the course of her life, the people she interacts with and bonds with, the experiences she has, the changes she sees around her. One of the highlights, I found, was in her eventual acceptance of having leprosy. Through much of the book, she desires to be cured and leave to start experiencing life. I thought it poignant how she eventually discovers that she can start experiencing life NOW with leprosy and how she shouldn't let life go on without her regardless of her health. Another aspect that really struck me was how, close to the end, she is faced with leaving Moloka'i and the challenges she has there (leaving the home she's known for 50+ years, having to integrate with people who still are biased against victims of Hansen's disease, etc.). I really liked Kenji and thought he was a very interesting character. He burned with anger against his leprosy, and I liked how Rachel was able to get him to cool it and try to embrace the world around her. He and Rachel had good chemistry that lasted far into their marriage. The character of Sister Catherine brought in the struggle of working for these poor patients, of seeing children plagued with this diseased, marred, and having to reconcile that fact with her faith. And other characters, such as Haleola, Uncle Pono, and Leilani, give a sneak peek at Hawaii's past, at love in a leper colony, and of the challenge of sexuality in the early 20th century.What's really neat too, is that there are real people who appear in these pages. Apparently, Ambrose really did work as a superintendent, Jack London really came to Moloka'i, and others, while not real, were based on real people.But that doesn't mean this book is without faults. Character points of view could literally change within two paragraphs, with no chapter or section break. One moment, you are reading from Rachel's POV, the next, Pono, or Haleola, or Sister Catherine. This was frustrating, keeping on top of who was saying what. Sometimes the story nearly grinds to a halt as Brennert tries to keep up with the history of the time. I understand that times are changing, but must we stop so that the characters can \\"catch up\\" with the times: with electricity, cars, refrigeration, planes, etc.? That doesn't even include the background history that goes on: several times, Rachel's story stops to fill in the blanks of what is going around in the world (such as the death of the King of Hawaii, which seems to not fit in no matter how much it impacts a character, the American take over of Hawaii, and World War II). I know it is a tricky balance, to make the world seem real and yet not spend so much time creating that background as to halt the story.Also, the story seemed to get distracted at times, or brought up threads that didn't go anywhere. Leilani and her sexuality is a great example; Sister Catherine and her family problems seemed to be another one (what happens to her in the end??? I have no clue!). And then there are some sexual situations in the book (Rachel losing her virginity, a scene where Pono and Haleola are \\"getting it on\\", etc.) that just felt awkward and unnecessary, even if they weren't overly graphic (though I didn't need that much description when Rachel and Noaha get it on!).I liked this book quite a bit. The setting was beautifully recreated, Brennert did a good job writing from a woman's point of view, and the story itself was touching. For the weird POV changes, the history infodumps, and the uncomfortable sexual situations (I wonder what my other book club members will think of that!), I would probably rate this 3.5 stars. And because I'm trying to be harsher with my ratings, I'll gives this 3 stars. A good book, a great story, and a beautiful land.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I quickly became enthralled with this moving depiction of Rachel's life. Historical authenticity combined with a richly imagined story makes this novel a compelling drama on many levels. Brennert's use of imagery is superb. It's easy to visualize the reality of the setting, from the lush island areas to the harsh cliff barriers that are so important to Rachel's story. Her valiant attempt to stay grounded in a chaotic world is only one example of Brennert's gift of empathy.It's so refreshing to find a novel as interesting and well written this one. If you're going to add any book to your personal library this year, make it Molokai."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is my first review because this is the first book I've read that's compelled me to want other people reading it so I can discuss it with them. As the other reviewers are saying, &quot;Moloka'i&quot; is one of those novels you can't put down! It's a two-day read because you'll find yourself making time to get back to it. When a friend mentioned it's set in the leper colony of Moloka'i, I thought, &quot;what a downer.&quot; But it's not!!! It's about a spirited, underdog heroine who wins your heart from chapter one and who you root for every step/page of the way. Great, great book!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Set in 1890 Hawai'i, comes the story of a young girl who must face life as an outcast, and a family that was torn away from her. In the brilliant masterpiece, Moloka'i, author Alan Brennert illustrates the passions of life, freedom, strength of character, and an astounding will to live, and love. Narrated from the heart of a young and courageous woman, Moloka'i opens a world to us not many knew existed.Growing up in a small village in Kalkaua, Honolulu, Rachel Kalama grows up as a carefree young girl, cooking in the kitchen with her mama, Dorothy Kalama, going to school with brothers Kimo and Ben, and sister Sarah, and living the life of a normal child. With her father a seafaring man, it is no wonder that young Rachel grows up to dream of far off places and journeying with her father to the varied countries he so vividly relates. Then one day, her life changes forever when a small rose-colored mark appears on her thigh, the repugnant and reviled mark of Leprosy. Although there are some nearby inhabitants in the area who have contracted leprosy and were removed from the village, like Rachel's uncle Pono, nobody ever thinks this disease will affect Rachel.However, unfortunately, the health department officials receive word that Rachel may have the disease after she had kept her secret for over a year. When they come to examine Rachel, her families' worst fears are confirmed and she is forced to leave her family and live in the Leper colony on the distant island of Moloka'i. At the tender age of six, Rachel's only chance to return to her family is to be cured of the disease.Separated from her parents by both distance and remoteness, and with only an occasional visit from her father, Rachel must make a new life for herself in the colony of lepers, surrounded by an unusual variety of loving people. Strengthened by adversity and weathered by courage, Rachel comes to know a kind nun who cares for her, establishes close ties with extraordinary friends, and earns the love of the only \\"family\\" who accepted her unconditionally. Rachel lives and grows in the embrace of her \\"people\\", and discovers the love of a man whom she goes on to marry and with whom she has a child.As Rachel lives and embraces life on Moloka'i, the \\"family\\" she develops in Kalaupapa, her friendships with other young children, adults and newcomers and her refusal to let the disease break her spirit and will to live, makes her life bearable.Years pass and at the age of 57, having spent more than half her life living in seclusion with other lepers, Rachel is deemed fit to return home. With the strength only a countless few can muster, Rachel rebuilds her life slowly but surely, never failing to go back and forth between Moloka'i and Honolulu to visit her friends who will never be able to leave the island. Having been re-united with her long lost daughter who was taken from her at birth, Rachel lives out the rest of her days in comparative contentment, returning one last time to Moloka'i to die peacefully. The home where she had lived so many years and finally found happiness.The story of Rachel Kalama is pure fiction, but the story of the Leper colonies of Hawai'i is true. Moloka'i is a masterpiece of a people who won through adversity and embraced life in the face of death."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I was apprehensive to say the least when I started reading this book. I thought there would be so much death that it would just depress me. The story in this book was such a great lesson on survival and making the most out of what life hands you. This book was educational and entertaining -- the perfect mix. If you are hesitating on reading this book for the same reasons I was, do not hesitate any longer. It's wonderful!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I found this to be a very good book. Very well written and a very good story line. It was very touching. I felt like I was there seeing all of this happen.I felt so sorry for this character. It shows no matter what happens in life, good can come out of it. No matter what ailments befall us, we can make it through anything if we have the right attitude. We are all survivors in some way."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"When Molokai opens and introduces us to the indomitable Rachel Kalama, immediately I felt hopeless despair for the fate of this seven year old child as she is sent alone to the Leper Colony on Molokai. Though her uncle is already an inhabitant of the island, what sort of life could Rachel expect to have, sentenced as though a criminal to never leaving Molokai simply because she has a disease? From the mid 1800s to well into the twentieth century, Hawaii's law was that all those with leprosy would be shipped to Molokai, never to leave; they either died quickly or had to learn to make a life out of very little. So when Rachel finds herself separated from her parents and siblings, the only thing that keeps her from devastation is the idea that Uncle Pono and his lady friend Haleola will care for her. Then the next separation in her life occurs when the Board of Health takes her away from them and forces her into the girls' group home \\"for her protection.\\" While it is only one of many separations ina lifetime of them, the best thing to come of this forced move is a lifelong friendship with Sister Catherine, one of the Franciscan nuns who care tenderly for the afflicted. Through friends and supporters, Rachel realizes she is not alone after all. As we watch Rachel's story unfold, it becomes clear that hers is not a hopeless, unmeaningful life; Rachel, hardy and rambunctious, is able to not only develop her own 'ohana (family) from the friends she finds on Molokai, she also finds love, death, and eventually freedom.Told from Rachel's arrival on the island in 1893 until her death in 1970, this is a sweeping tale of a very real place and time in Hawaii's history. Warranted or not, Hawaii's law that all lepers must move to Molokai shaped, curtailed, and forged lives that only the strong could survive. How Rachel overcomes heart-wrenching loss and the odds against her survival make for a riveting tale that engages the reader within the first few pages. Brennert has expertly researched his story and invigorated it with tangible characters. The spirit of this book will live on in me for a long, long time to come. It is indeed the best sort of book to read and find that when you are done, you are actually nowhere near finished with the tale. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I wasn't too excited when I first heard that this was my book club's coice but this turned out to be a very intersting read. It was wonderful to follow Rachel through her life as a leprosy victim and watch her spirit strengthen as time goes on. Definately a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Excellent book. Very well written. I live on the island of Oahu and this book is very good. It's very real in its portrayal."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I called Hawaii home for 25 years and loved the Islands and the people. Alan Brennert told a story based on facts that everyone should read and realize it all really happened. Another chapter in our history that should not be forgotten. It is sad and somewhat depressing as one realizes it is fact based; but you will find yourself smiling and crying. I applaud Alan Brennert. It is a wonderful read.Kae Baker"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is an engaging and emoitional story about how fear and the unknown can affect peoples reactions. A very well done account on people and families forces to live in isolation and how they deal with their destiny. This story may challenge your emoitions."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book tells the story of a woman in late 19th century HI who contracts leprosy as a young girl and is sent to the leper colony on Molokai. It is sad, heartwarming, and inspirational all at the same time. The author brilliantly shows how the patients were able to live relatively normal lives, find love, hold down jobs, and even have children. He brings a voice to those long forgotten by most of our country.Of course there were plenty of hardships, naturally, but this novel tells of the incredible resilience of the human spirit. I highly recommend this book and can't believe I waited so long to read it. I'm from HI and thought the way the author weaved local folklore and myths from old Hawaiian religions was beautiful and accurately captured the superstitious nature of Hawaiian culture.The one problem I had with this book was the repeated use of the word \\"Haole\\". Any one who grew up in HI knows that this doesn't just mean \\"white foreigner\\". It may have originally but today it is a mean nasty word that is basically the n-word for white people in HI. Myself and all my siblings were called that numerous times and it still stings to hear it. We were born there and grew up there just like anyone else. It was our home too. Today as an adult I understand the social and political tensions caused by the past but it's still a mean word used to demean someone. Had the author been from HI I know he never would've used it so casually and so often. Even so, that does not detract from the fact that this was a beautiful novel, one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A very heartwrenching story of human nature, struggles, and successes. The author's descriptions of the locations and people made them all spring to life in my mind. I especially enjoyed references to places in Hawaii that I've visited or, at least, learned about. It was verify historically educational. If it weren't for the fact that I cried through the whole thing, I would have probably rated this book higher. But, alas, as much as I couldn't put it down for long, I did hesitate picking it up a few times knowing I'd be diving in to more tragedy (or triumph) and tears. Overall, I'm glad I read it but I cannot imagine myself ever wanting to reread it. I just don't enjoy crying so much."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I cannot believe people were treated so poorly. Especially after information became available about this disease! This is a heart rending story of despair and ignorance and love and hope."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"MOLOKA'I was a bookclub selection. In my opinion, Mr. Brennert tried too hard with this historic &#34;epic.&#34; Through his main character's life we see her dealing with most every challenge and setback that ever was heaped upon the entire leprosy community. I was most happy that in the end she reunited with her sister, her daughter, and was able to live with some semblance of happiness and normalcy. Whew! I appreciate Mr. Brennert's lengthy research into the history of the lepers, and his creative efforts to bring that information to light through this saga. The writing is good; yet, all told, it was just too much information -- too long, too dark and too laborious."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Another wonderful Hawaii book written by Alan Brennert. I never knew about the leper colony on Hawaii. The book told Rachel's story and her jeorney of being a child leper. The book was well written and had a good ending. I can only recomend reading this book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I really enjoyed this read. I learned so much about Molokai and the leprosy colonies that were there. The storyline is great and it was a great choice for our book club."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Although there was a substantial amount of information in this book about leprosy and the treatment through the last century, the story, while compelling, was told in almost a \\"magazine\\" format. The author inserts his observations about a particular behavior rather than developing the characters well enough so as to allow the readers to inform himself and draw their own conclusions. Had the writing been less overtly sentimental and mushy, and the characters and events written more intelligently, this could have been a 4 star book. Despite that, after a slow opening, this highly predictable story does move along and it does inform; but, after reading it you feel like you've just had a very rich dessert. While you feel guilty for enjoying it you know it's not as nutritious as it should or could have been."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is a well done historical novel, with lots of information about Hawaii and world events from the 1890's to 1970. But most of all it is a beautifully written fictional biography, and that's where it rises from a good novel to a great piece of literature.Rachel Kalama lives with her loving family until she is diagnosed with Leprosy at age seven. Then, given the laws of the day, she is forcibly removed from her home and isolated in the leper colony on Moloka'i.It would be easy at this point to expect a grim story, envisioning the horrors of leper colonies in places like India. But Molok'ai surprises. This is a richly drawn saga of a community of people who struggle with adversity like most of humanity, and manage to carve out a life for themselves.Though the author uses an omniscient point of view, which is typically distant, that is not the case with this book. The reader is taken deep into the hearts of many wonderful characters from Sister Catherine, who spends her life serving the lepers while questioning a god who would create such a disease, to Haleola, a traditional Hawaiian Kahuna, who has one foot in ancient gods, healing and tradition, and another in the emerging modern world. But the character readers will fall in love with is Rachel. Ripped from her family at an early age and experiencing loss and tragedy that would sink most of us, Rachel manages to live a full life and, despite all her trials, keep hope alive.It would be easy for a story like this to be maudlin, but it is not. It is told in simple but beautiful language in an almost matter-of-fact way that is nevertheless deeply moving. Moloka'i is a well written saga that is at times sad, funny, tragic and uplifting--and in totality, a story about the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"From a tragic history a heartwarming novel emerged! This was one of the most thought provoking books that I have read in a long time. It evoked all of my emotions; anger, sadness and laughter. It was a story of sacrifice for all the characters. An amazing novel that depicted the tragic history of a beautiful island. After reading this book I wanted to visit Hawaii just to learn more about this piece of it's history. A very captivating read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"One of the best books I have read this summer. Educational as well as a fun read as you follow the life of this amazing young woman."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I have not recommended a book more. Beautifully descriptive. Wonderful characters. Sad that it is based on actual events. You will not regret reading this book"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I had previously heard of the settlements for victims of leprosy in Lousiana and Hawaii before reading this wonderful book but had no concept of the horrors the people living there had to endure. In Moloka'i, Alan Brennert has created a beautiful story based on extensive research and records kept at Kalaupapa. This novel tells a very factually based story of the fictional Rachel Kalama which reveals the poignancy and dignity of the lives of victims of Hansen's disease who were isolated on Moloka'i."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"An intriguing and ever changing novel. Very nicely written with thought provoking insights. I would recommend this book to anyone who really likes a great read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I bought this book as one of several when I was treating myself to a trip through a favorite bookstore. I happened to be on vacation and was able to read the book in about 3 sittings. The final one was literally an all-nighter; can't remember the last time I felt that pushed to find out more in a story.One of my pet peeves about historical fiction (or fictionalized history, however you look at it) is when the author shows off his/her research way too much, to the detriment of the story. Brennert didn't succumb to this more than a few times and not for long, instead letting the characters tell their own story in dialogue and events.The book moves quickly over the time of Rachel's (protagonist) life from little girl to her death. Her story is at once one of the cruelties, albeit from ignorance, she and others had to endure, and at the same time the way her life moves in a very normal way - love, friends, marriage, etc. - within those confines. There were many times I couldn't help but see the similarities between the way lepers were treated at that time (her story starts with her as a little girl in the 1890s), and the way people, including little kids, with HIV/AIDS have been treated more recently.This story is engaging and pulls you into it with well developed characters and seemingly effortless story-telling. In many ways, it's intense and disturbing because of its very subject matter, but the author doesn't belabor that; instead he never lets us forget that, although fictionalized, the characters represented very real people with very real lives being lived in extraordinary circumstances."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is a touching read, especially if you have visited Kalaupapa on the Isle of Molokai."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"One of the most captivating stories I have read in years. I don't remember crying so many times whilst reading a fiction story, yet so amazing I could not put it down. Well done!I have travelled to Molokai and seen the colony years ago, but this really made me feel I was there again and understood what was going on in such a beautiful mystic place."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I could best describe this book as a \\"satisfying read\\". I won't rehash the plot but want to add my five starts to a wonderfully fulfilling novel. The characters are so well drawn and the emotional tension that permeates the story is perfect. I especially think this is an example of a male author who has so convincingly created a female leading character. A story set in a leprosy colony could easily become depressing or gruesome, but the author has maintained a beautiful balance of sadness, fear, hope, regret, and love. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good story filled with ordinary people caught up in a very awful situation."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I am always happy to discover a book that is so fascinating it is difficult to set down. Moloka'i is a bittersweet story that begins in Hawaii in the late 1880's. Rachel, a seven year old Hawaiian girl is discovered to have leprosy and is sent away from her home to Kalaupapa, where she lives in a leper colony with a whole community of folks that also have the disease. The book is a work of fiction, but the story is set in a real place with real life characters whose lives are interwoven with fictional characters. (Some of the fictional characters are based on real people). Rachel herself is fictional. The story is so touching, and Rachel is such a strong character that you find yourself cheering to her strength and courage, and greiveing with her at her many losses. There are so many lessons that Rachel teaches about life and love."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is wonderful! It warms your heart and haunts you long after you finish the book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is one of the best books I'v ever read! It makes you laugh and it makes you cry while following the life story of a young Hawaiian girl. I read this book while on vacation in Cabo and could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I first listened to the audio book and enjoyed it so much, I ordered the paperback and suggested it for our book club. It is a very moving story of the leper colony at Moloka'i as told from the view of a young girl sent there at age 7 and lives her life there, growing up and getting married. I guess the thing that struck me the most was that Kalaupapa was like any small village of the time. The story begins in the 1890's. I love all the research done by the author. He includes so much of the history of Hawaii as well as Moloka'i and Kalaupapa. The topic lends itself to being depressing, but the way the author handles it, the story is actually very uplifting. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This novel kept me captivated from beginning to end. The author did an excellent job of developing the characters and conveying the emotions that were an integral part of the story. Even though the characters were fictional, the book was based on lots of historical facts which was part of the intrigue. Leprosy does not sound like a topic that would be a drawing card for an entertaining book but the author created characters who were true survivors. Their journeys in life in an isolated environment with a disease of which little was known was quite interesting. They had to deal with the same issues that most people have to face with a chronic illness while isolated on a peninsula in Hawaii. Rachel was taken from her family when she was only 7 years old and was forced to live most of her life without her family. This was difficult for her but she established many friends who shared this terrible disease only to watch many of them die. The author developed a rich character in Rachel as you read thru the ups and downs of her life. I learned a lot, was entertained, and shed many tears. The mark of a great book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. I had read a library edition and loved it so much that I had to have a copy for my own. I have several friends who are reading and enjoying the book as well. It takes you through all human emotions, and just when you thought things couldn't get worse, over several years things get resolved and there is a marvelous ending. I have read Honolulu, another of this author's books, and I loved it too. I may have been especially interested because I lived in Hawaii for three years.I might mention that I was thrilled to receive the book in only two days after ordering it from Amazon."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is an amazing book. It is written with such heart and soul. I have never picked up a book that has made me laugh, cry and smile as much as Molokai. The author takes you on an amazing journey of a woman and who she meets along the way. You are taken through her life story. This book is going to all my friends and family this year for Christmas. I don't want to give the story away or any details because I don't want to ruin the magic of this story."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I very much enjoyed the book. The characterization is very strong and identifiable. Its a story of the human and the inhumane in all cultures and the hope we can learn from the past."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a lovely book that combines the author's obvious love for the islands with a horrifying but uplifting story of the victims of leprosy. That unlikely combination is the best description I have for this beautiful novel.It follows the life of a woman diagnosed with leprosy at a very young age - then a likely death sentence. The setting is circa 1900 and leprosy was the AIDS of it's time - families were beyond ashamed, victims were shunned and feared. To make the horrible effects worse, the victims were sent off to await death in the isolation of a beautiful prison - the colony on the island of Moloka'i.Descriptions of Hawaiian legends and 'talking story' of the ancient times gives this very sad story a beautiful balance. As Rachel sees her friends dying and becomes more removed from all she knew, she grows into an admirable woman. As she grows the islands change as the modern era emerges.I just returned from a vacation to Hawaii and wish I had had this book as a companion. I learned so much about the history, good and bad, of the islands... I highly recommend this to actual and virtual travelers. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a wonderful wonderful book! It is a well written account of the people on Moloka'i, taken there by force because of their disease. What to me really makes this a wonderful book is that it does a beautiful job of capturing the Hawaiian spirit, and even written such a way as to show the unique Hawaiian dialect. I felt I was there listening to people speak. It is a great read, one that I will read again and again!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I read this book for our book club. It turned out to be one of the best books I had read! It had many themes, all handled well by the author. The main character, Rachel, was taken away from her family, at only six years old, (spoiler alert) when she developed leprosy. The story is about her life and the people and experiences she meets on the island of Molokai. It spans the late 1800s to the 1960s and includes the effects of WWII and \\"modern\\" inventions through the eyes of the people of Molokai. This well written story was based on the lives of real people and was very touching. I also learned a lot about Hansen's disease. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Dynamic book/story as so many pieces of history were woven into the plot! Felt like i was back in Maunaloa on topside! Wonderful story which may have been true as it was based on facts! Recommend the book as well as a trip over if possible. Rose"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Prior to reading this novel, I had some idea of the exile of Hawaiians to Moloka'i, so I knew that I would find the subject matter of the story to be interesting. I was literally stunned by the story woven by Brennert and how deeply in love I fell with the characters. Moloka'i is both uplifting and unbelievably sad, and it is one of the finest books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was an interesting story about a fascinating place and time. Rachel put a real human face on the Hansen's disease, and reading her story really made a person care about the time and place and immensly difficult situation faced by those who through no fault of their own, found themselves labeled a danger to their families, neighbors and country."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I just wanted to say that I was really happy with my order! I got it in a timely fashion and the book came just as described as it was online (in good shape). Thanks!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I must admit that I picked up this book to read for my book group with a very negative attitude. The story just sounded much too much like The Island by Victoria Hislop - the tale of an island leper colony - sound familiar! So it was a pleasant surprise when I found that I was enjoying it after just a few chapters.I thought the author writes very well and flows rather smoothly when linking together a large number of facts and events. He describes the settings beautifully and made me feel like I had actually visited Hawai'i (and I certainly want to even more now). The characters were well developed and all added something to the story (except one mentioned below). I really felt like I was experiencing what the main character was going through despite it being so far from my own personal life that it should be unbelievable. While I really had sympathy for Rachel, the main character, I felt that she was very strong and would somehow overcome everything.A bit of a spoiler here but not too much - I was dreading the chance of a happy ending where she was cured and lived happily ever after and was glad when it didn't work out quite like that although, even I, who normally hate a happy ending and love it when everyone dies in terrible pain, was routing for Rachel to get some good luck in her life for a change. So much happened to this poor lady that, when she got on a ship to go on a journey, I was half expecting it to be called The Titanic! I felt the author got the ending right and gave me what I wanted without being too sickly sweet.So why the four stars instead of five?!The book was just a bit overwritten. It was too long and felt like the author had done so much research and gathered so many facts about that place and time, that he felt that he had to include every single last one of them into the story. He could quite easily have cut upwards of 100 pages without losing the feel and flow of the story - in fact the story would have flowed even better had it been \\"edited\\" down somewhat.Another annoyance, for me, was the character of Leilani. Now I won't put a spoiler about this character but I felt that it was squeezed in to get across one possible side effect of Leprosy which really was not needed for the enjoyment of the book. I also felt that the character was put in for sensational effect (and you will know why once you read the book), which did not really work for me.A new author to me and one I will look out for in the future.Worth a read, especially if you like descriptive, historical books."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Emotionally riveting, Molokai is full of historical events: the leper colony, bombing of Pearl Harbor, The incarceration of Japanese Americans. The beautifully drawn characters lives are compared in ways which make you think about life changing events in ways you had not expected."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book really catches your interest and keeps you reading. It's very moving. Although the main character is fictional, the tale isn't. The history of the decease is told remarkably well in a very compassionate and moving manner. I would recommend this to all."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I was drawn to Molokai because of the topic. I stayed with the book because of its story. The author managed to capture the darkness of a leprosy diagnosis and the prejudice against the disease, but even more, he gave a loving picture of the community forged by those exiled to Molokai. The story is warm, loving, and real, portraying the experiences of those isolated by a most misunderstood disease. He weaves in facts about the disease, its transmission and ultimate cure giving the readers a mini-lesson on leprosy/Hansen's disease as well as a beautifully told story."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I searched for quite a while for a large print copy of this book; it's a great story but I needed large print for the recipient.

This book besides illustrating a story of survival and human spirit, it took me to Pre- US Hawaii,an understanding of Hawaiian traditions,the prevalence of leprosy in the islands and how it was a stigma for a whole family. It author wrote a story of survival and holding on to a vision from the point of view of a spirited 7 year old girl."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I just finished this book and felt like I went through a quick course in Hawaiian history. Interesting how one the most beautiful states' past was left out of the curriculum in school (except for Pearl Harbor bombing). This book inspired me to not only read more on Hawaiian history and religious beliefs (which are as fascinating as Greek mythology) but also on Molokai's leper colony. I am in the medical field so I know about leprosy and some of the associated discrimination, but I never really gave it any more thought than that. After reading this book, I realized that I really should have thought more of the poor afflicted patients, especially at that time period, because of what they and their family had to suffer through.Now, the story in \\"Moloka'i,\\" although very good, did not move me. I could not create an emotional bond with Rachel, the main character. I felt at times the story dragged a bit and wanted to just skip ahead to the ending. There were parts that were meant to make me cry; instead I felt the writing was strained.The other characters in the book all were interesting. I wish the author went into Haleola's character more. She seem to be the main source of Hawaiian pagan information so I would have loved to hear more stories from her. Also, I wish the author shared more of her early years in the colony with us. This would have provided the readers a stark contrast of the extremely poor conditions and inhumanity that existed in the Molokai colony from Rachel's experience later (which is post Father Damien).If you were naive like me about leper colonies, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book is wonderful in its' description of humanity.

It was beautifully written and historically accurate. It held my interest from the first page. I was fascinated with the Hawaiian history, the story of leprosy, and the life of the main character, Rachel. While Rachel does have leprosy and has many terrible things happen throughout her life, the story left me satisfied and happy a t the end. This is definitely on my list of favorite books.This is not the first book I have read about a leper colony. I also completely enjoyed The Island by Victoria Hislop. If you enjoyed Moloka'I you will probably enjoy The Island as well."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Molokai was a wonderful story named after the leprosy colony island in Hawaii of the same name. The author, Alan Brennert, effortlessly combines history with the beautiful, sympathetic fictional tale of a young girl stricken with leprosy who is forced to grow up on the island. It offers an interesting paradox; to be imprisoned in what many would consider paradise by a disease you have no control over. Of course, the beauty of the island becomes hell when held against your will.The island is now overgrown, but you can still charter a plane to visit the old leper colony. But you probably won't want to visit after reading this book- the despair and isolation is portrayed that realistically.Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Having lived in Hawai'i when I was a child, I had always heard of the leper colony on Moloka'i, and was fascinated by the notion of people being sent into exile against their will to rot and die alone. I have read a few historical accounts of the colony, all of which gave great details, but none which gave Kalaupapa such LIFE as Brennert's \\"Moloka'i\\". The patients of Kalaupapa may have gone to Moloka'i thinking that they were going only to die, but the picture that Brennert has painted shows us that they really went to Moloka'i to live.Brennert tells the life story of his character, Rachel Kalama, in such a beautiful and complete manner, leaving no stone unturned. In the telling of her tragedies, her joys, and her everyday life and thoughts, Brennert creates a living breathing character that one cannot help but fall in love with. In fact, each of the characters in the novel are well-written and contain depth; the setting is beautiful and accurate, and the plotline of Rachel's life is full of enticing ups and downs.My only complaint is that some of the content and dialogue seemed to be a bit forward for the timeline Brennert chose. I often felt that the story was set in the 1960's rather than the turn of the 20th century. But perhaps that was in fact accurate, considering that Hawai'i was it's own free-spirited culture until us haoles came along!Overall, \\"Moloka'i\\" is a beautifully written novel with multi-faceted characters, and a rich and haunting plotline. This novel has made me miss Hawai'i even more than I already did, and may perhaps plan a return vacation soon!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This started out as a fascinating account of Rachel's exile to Molokai but after a while it just bogged down. The author never really endeared me to any of the characters.....I cared about them but I didn't really care what happened to them as everything became so predictable.It is , however, a great journey into a place that not many ever even knew existed and I learned a lot about the history of both leprosy and Hawaii.It is worth reading but I would suggest just borrowing it from someone."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Where do I even begin?I was immediately immersed within this story from the first page- the moment I met little Rachel, before she was diagnosed with leprosy. Then to follow her through her entire life on the time line as she faces the outcast to Moloka'i, the struggles and shame, the ups and downs, love, loss, friendships, and a new family. The emotions, the descriptions and details are so amazing throughout this entire novel that I felt I was reading non-fiction at times. Or perhaps, that's how attached I grew to the number of characters that were throughout the story. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I cried some more. I learned a lot out of this novel as well- about a culture I sadly hadn't known too much about before, as well as about the past with this disease and how misunderstood things were back then due to lack of medical science. This has to be one of the best historical fictions I have ever read.I loved it so much that I'm afraid I'm not even giving it the full in-depth worthy review it deserves. It made me utterly speechless when I had read the last page and realized that there was no more to be read. Biggest message of all: Life isn't over until it's over.This novel was what I would consider \\"outside the box\\" for me. In other words, not the usual genre I would just randomly pick up and read too often. I'm so glad I did, though.I will definitely be recommending to many.&lt;3Pixie"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I am thoroughly enjoying this book. I am 3/4 of the way finished reading it.

I think that it wove truth and fiction together beautifully. If you are interested in Hawaiian culture you will be drawn into this story. There was also pretty eye opening information about Hansen's disease in this story."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Excellent read.

Rachel becomes a friend that you care for and pray she finds happiness. The final chapters are not as fulfilling as the rest of the novel, it's as if the author had said all he needed to say, and just wanted to tie up loose ends. It offers a window into one more of the injustices our Government inflected upon native nations and their people. A true story of how, when given lemons, people somehow made lemonade."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"\\"Molokai\\" is a fabulous book to read on your way to Hawaii. It is based on some of the true history and beliefs of old Hawaii. I started reading it on my flight to Oahu and was caught up in the story and the main character immediately, sobbing at times. All the characters, including Father Damien, were so real and memorable. Wonderful book, worth every cent."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Great insight into the Hawaiian past and also gripping! I couldn't put it down :) I would definitely recommended it others."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I couldn't put it down! I loved the historical part as well as the fictional story. If you've been to Hawaii and loved learning about the land, you'll love this novel!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This novel about a woman who is diagnosed with leprosy and quarantined on a Hawaiian island is a quick page-turner and extremely engrossing read. The story moves along quickly and interesting events are constantly occurring; however, that was part of my problem with the book. I sometimes felt that the story was just a long list of events that happened, each with a 10 page or so description before rattling off the next event. Huge plot jumps would occur with no notice. I understand the novel covers a long time period - but, some transitions or better connections between events and the overall story would have much improved the writing.I also thought it was an interesting decision that the author made sure to constantly note that the main character's physical appearance was not affected for much of the novel. It's as if he didn't think his audience could identify with a disfigured protagonist and I thought this went against the major theme of the novel.However, despite these flaws, it was still a very enjoyable read. It's nice when a page-turner can give you an unique insight into real historical events, especially those that you probably would not have learned about otherwise."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Molok'ai was a good read - I think because the author has a smooth writing style that pulls you in. All in all, I would give Moloka'i a B-.The book was SO predictable! Within the first few pages, I had the plot-line nailed. And I have a problem with writers who do alot of \\"name dropping\\" - and Moloka'i is rife with public figures making cameos and interacting with Rachel, the main character.There were some holes. Catherine sorta disappeared and reappeared... and finally disappeared. And some characters came and went quickly just so the author could make a point (or drop more names) - which made the story-line choppy. It's like the author had picked up some historical tidbits in his research and tossed them into the story at will.All in all, I would give Moloka'i a B-."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Good read. Fast read. Story moves slowly at times but I think that is the point of her life. Sad to realize the reality behind this story."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A truly wonderful book.

It was very inspirational."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Rachel is a true heroine in this amazing story. For lovers of all things Hawaiian, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i Nui Ahina, Summers on the Lonely IsleThis is a well-written book and you can tell the author spent a lot of time researching the history of Kalaupapa.However, I do not get any feel for the colloquial pidgin english language spoken on the island. If you want to 'listen' to the locals and get a flavor of the east end of Moloka'i, I would strongly recommend the 'other' Moloka'i book. 'Moloka'i Nui Ahina' is based on the life and times of the island's first woman paniolo (cowboy) and a string of 14 summers spent with her mo'opunas (grandsons)."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"How do you take what could be an engaging plot, a stunning setting, and then proceed to embitter your readers against both? Read this book to find out! I simply can't understand the high ratings for this book! The characters should have been sympathetic--spoiler alert!--they have leprosy. But I didn't care and I blame Alan Bennert for this. I think he took a great idea and then did not execute it well. The dialogue is flat, the prose is boring. All of these reviews of the book are more interesting than the actual book.On a positive note, you only need to read a few words per page toward the end to know what's going on. No attentive reading necessary!Will I read another book by him? No, and in fact out of principle I won't even watch \\"LA Law\\" anymore (he wrote screenplays for the show)."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The story of Kalaupapa and the people condemned to live there -- some of whom still do live there -- is a truly shameful chapter in the history of Hawaii, the US, and modern society. But that does not elevate this book. The characters are one-dimensional, the narrative is plodding and unimaginative, and the writing is at best only serviceable. Knowing some of the history, one can predict with precision the next tragedy to befall our characters, like clockwork. It is truly unfortunate that the real victims and heroes of this time are represented by such a trite, juvenile story. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Book missing some first letters on a page especially on Chapter 1 seems to be missing a good deal of the page."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The further I got into this book, the more immature I thought the story-writing got. Although I enjoyed the time period, the history and the subject, the story-line was too adolescent, even after Rachel became a wife and widow and releasee. As Rachel got older, and stronger, the story seemed to get more and more contrived. I was let down."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book did not live up to my expectations. It was an OK read but I would not recommend it to an avid reader."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Bennert's books are biased and a lot of c_ _ p. I read his book \\"Honolulu\\" and it is ridiculous.

Grandma's name was also Pono. Now I know Pono, Lono, Leilani, Kimo and Lopaka are all commonly used Hawaiian names (theres at least two in my family) but some on now"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This was the most engrossing and emotional book I have ever read. There were moments I had to put it down for fear of crying and looking ridiculous for doing so. There were joyful moments and sad moments and everytime I put it down, I had to remind myself I am Tara in Utah, not Rachel in Molokai. Thats how truly potent this story is. You must remind yourself where and who you are. The story starts with Rachel as a child, no leprosy yet and progresses to her diagnosis and being torn from her family. She makes new family though and lives her life to its fullest. The ending will bring tears to the hardest of people. The author was very informative of the history and times without being tedious. I really reocommend this to anyone who has a handicap, disability, or disease and to anyone that has ever made cruel jests at those who do. Those with some kind of impairment will understand and feel for the leper colony and also gain some hope from this story. Those who have made cruel jests, I hope you learn something and perhaps feel some compassion for those you see as less fortunate physcially than yourselves. On the outside, we all have flaws. On the inside some are truly beautiful no matter their physical deformities or differences. That is what this story really speaks to me."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Alan Brennert, with eloquent, descriptive, flowing prose offers an epic tale of leprosy among Hawaiians in the late 1800's to present day. Rachel, the center character, is ripped from her family at 7 years old and exiled to the island of Kalauppa, on Moloka'i, where the infected go to die. Her struggle in the most gruesome of scenario's is so gripping, so raw, so real, and so inspiring it makes it impossible to ever forget her valiant fight and her unyielding spirit.Rachel introduces us to a myriad of compelling characters. In nearly every case we see valor among the suffering; hope among the hopeless and optimism among the grim. Historically we venture through Hawaii's distain of the USA's aggression, acceptance, and statehood. We also experience Pearl Harbor and the oppression of Japanese American's to internment camps; internment camps that bequeathed undue prejudice as ugly and unwarranted as that of lepers.This absolutely astounding book offers a sweeping saga of prejudice, hope, dismay, hope, depravity, hope, searing struggles, hope. HOPE! When you complete, \\"Moloka'i\\" you will hug this book to your heart as I did. You will realize that the impossible is possible. Also, accountability for others mustn't go untethered by one's own discomfort or lack of knowledge. Education before exile.Thank-you, Alan Brennert. You gave me a read to treasure all my life."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"While supposedly only partially based in reality, this book is written so well, it could have been a true, compelling biography.Moloka'i was brought home to me from the library by my girlfriend, who knows I love all things Hawaiian. I picked it up, read the inside jacket, then read the first page...I didn't put it down until I was done.The story, as you may have read in other reviews, is about a little girl who is taken away from her family on Oahu and relocated to Moloka'i because she has leprosy. The book goes on to chronicle her life on the colony and her subsequent release back into \\"civilization.\\"The story would have been enough with just that, but a wonderful addition to this storyline is the inclusion of numerous details about life and politics of the time. Some Hawaiian history is touched on, as well as details referencing port/shipping and military life. It's a Hawaii at a critical time in her development, and the addition of these details creates a wonderful backdrop for the story and really brings it to life.Because my mother had enjoyed _Revolt_in_Paradise_, I purchased this book for her, as well."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book was absolutely captivating. The story of Rachel Kalama is one of strength, courage, humor, sadness, exile, joy and so much more. The people of Kalaupapa endured more than any human should ever have to. And although Rachel is a fictional character, you learn from her what happened to the people who lived there; what a 'leper' really is; Hawaiian history and culture and things you may never have know if this book hadn't been written. And I really cannot wait to take my first trip to Hawaii - I will now make sure it includes a tour of Moloka'i."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"NOt only did I read a compelling story of a woman, I also learned some of the history of Hawaii of which I was unfamiliar. A great read that keeps ones interest."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This story is written so well... I never wanted to put the book down. I thought of the characters morning, day, and night and my heart ached for them and what they went through. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"What a remarkable book and fascinating story! While reading Moloka'i, I grew more and more deeply involved with (and moved by) Rachel's narrative as her innocence became the wisdom of experience through her interactions with a surprising group of humans. Responding to the book on a personal level, I found myself wanting to talk with some of the individuals who bump into Rachel's life and inhabit the story, including her parents, who react to their child's disease differently and Leilani, an amazing character who, also, reacted to the disease of leprosy differently. Other characters in the story chill me--but that's not a negative comment. Instead, I think well written chilling characters take as much talent--if not more--than do well written likeable characters. My reactions to all the characters and to the story add up to one point: I can whole-heartedly endorse this book, especially for readers seeking a glimpse into an interesting slice of US history that is offered with very human (and compelling) faces.For individuals who do not like history, let me offer this point. One of my friends who read the book says that although she usually *hates* reading history, this book completely captured her A year after finishing the book (twice!), she can still see the setting and characters and remembers what happened in the book and in history."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"If you love Hawaii this book is awesome. It really give a historic feel for old Hawaii and a great respect for it's people. It includes a lot of the hawaiian language and old mythical tales weaved into the story. I loved it."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I have to disagree with a previous comment about Moloka'i being like \\"Shark Dialogues.\\" This novel is about one little girl, Rachel Kalama and how contracting leprosy at the age of 5 rips her from her family and alters her life forever. I just don't see any similarities whatsoever to the other novel. But I did read a compelling story which was a true page turner in every sense of the word.

I would put it at the level of The Help or one of the many Oprah's Book Club books, but it seems like this book never got the publicity it deserves.

She is mischievous, imaginative and affectionate. She exasperates her mother, fights with her sister and delights her father..... until she is diagnosed with leprosy. In the late 19th century, leprosy is a death sentence. With no known cure or adequate treatment, the only preventative measure available is a drastic form of quarantine. Rachel is separated from her family and removed to the leper colony on Molokai.Fortunately, it is not as grim as Rachel (and this reader) feared it might be. Rachel adjusts to a new life. There is a great deal of heartbreak and suffering, but she also builds a life with an extended family and friends. In the new century there are improvements in the care and treatment of the disease and eventually an effective cure.I enjoyed this book and I do recommend it, but I cannot give it 5 stars. It's a great story. I love that Brennert wanted to tell about Molokai from a Hawaiian viewpoint. So much was done to native people without their consent or involvement. My problem is that having established this viewpoint, I feel Brennert didn't do enough with it. Only Rachel and Sister Catherine had any real depth of character. I wanted to know more about Haleola and her native beliefs. Leilani was a fascinating character. Brennert could have done so much more with her life history and the role she, and others like her, played in preserving traditions. Most of all, I think he missed a great opportunity by just glancing at the deep religious conflicts between the native beliefs and the western missionary/charity workers. I know the conflict is there, implicit throughout the story, but it felt as if the author and the characters kept backing away from it."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"to me, this was the book of a lifetime.i rarely re-read a book but this one is in that stack.this is a story that the bones of have been told for centuries in Hawaiian and Christian lore.

Here we are in March,and I had yet to redeem it. After working in the yard and enjoying the fabulous weather, I decided the time had come to find just the right book. While browsing, I had already selected another title but the tropical cover of Alan Brennert's MOLOKA'I captured my attention. Well, I thought to myself, since I am not taking that cruise to Hawaii this Spring Break, I may as well just read about Hawaii. (Now I REALLY want to visit.)OMG. . . two evenings, a box of tissue later, my eyes so puffy, I had to give my contact lenses a break, I am here to tell you that there is something for everyone in this well-written book. If you are a historian (which I am not), you will enjoy the well-researched historical elements of the period. If you enjoy epics that span decades, you will enjoy the well-developed, character-driven book. If you enjoy lush descriptions, you will enjoy this book. If you are sentimental, you will enjoy this book. If you are family-oriented or enjoy love affairs, you will enjoy this book. If you have ever had to endure pain and suffering of a loved one, you will love this book.Most impressive for me was the cultural diversity personified by two of the more powerful supporting characters. Brennert compared and contrasted the religious traditions of Sister Catherine and Haleola. If leprosy is the antagonist of the story, then there are two protagonists in the forms of religion. Guided by these pillars of strength, Rachel finds the light and will to live and to live fully in the leprosy colony and ultimately in life. Lots of redemption.Great read. I am recommending this to everyone I know. I can't wait to read others by Brennert."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. A friend lent it to me last year when she found out that we were spending one of our 3 weeks in Hawaii on Molokai. I could not put this book down. Alan Brennert does a masterful job of character development within a flawless historically executed timeline. This book makes you feel like you are experiencing the characters lives. This will be one of the few books that I will read again. I can not wait for his next book Honolulu to come out! I contacted the author because I was so moved by his book. He was very congenial. I learned from him that he was a writer on one of my favorite shows-LA Law. I sent him a few photos of the Kalapaupa penninsula. You will love this book!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Lately I have found I have been judging books by their ability to make me feel emotion. At first I wondered if Moloka'i could do that. This story begins with Rachel as an innocent, naive little girl, suddenly thrown into an unfamiliar world separated from all that she knows and loves. Her character grows into her adult self in this world of isolation just as any young girl would. The author expertly conveys the growth of this character slowly over time.Shame and prejudice exist all over the world, only Rachel didn't realize that she was never alone until she found her family again.Moloka'i made me angry and made me cry. This is a wonderful story set in an unusual place and it is a must read on my list.Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Alan Brennert's \\"Molokai\\" is a wonderful story, full of the joy and misfortune that makes for heartfelt reading. It is the story of Rachel, and her family, and her discovery of a mark that would change their lives completely. The characters are tangible, seeming to appear out of time. The depiction of the lush beauty of the Sandwich Islands is splendid. The characters of the captive community are depicted in their glory and their misery. Rachel is not a leper, but one of us, stricken with an insidious disease. Leprosy was treated like a medieval plague, and the casualties left along the way were many, even though the manner of dealing with the disease was effective in the long run. In my own trip to Molokai in 1987, I heard that ships arriving with stricken men, women and children dropped anchor while still away from the shore, and the afflicted were pushed into the water, and had to swim to shore or die trying. It is an ugly moment in our history, and one that needs to be revealed.I enjoyed reading about the switchback trail along the pali, the looming mountainside which cuts off the leper settlement from the rest of the island, and cuts away the sun during daytime hours. Our group made the trek up, and back, and it was no easy task.I wanted to give the book five stars, but I was disappointed by how some of the characters were painted by the author. The Franciscan Sisters from Syracuse, led by Mother Marianne Cope, were given short shrift. Brennert gives religious life an insult by showing nuns as misfits for the most part. One gets the feeling that Rachel is far more mature than them all. I am glad that Sr. Catherine was given a human face, but why not some of the others?And the leper priest, Father Damien was depicted insensitively, coming across more like a stereotypical zealous Evangelical preacher at times. One should know that there were musical instruments, and there were riding horses, and lumber for homes for the residents on Molokai because of his tireless efforts.Suffice it to say that despite these drawbacks, the book is a must read. It will brighten the life of the reader, who may be able to conceive of God as larger than any human tragedy."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is such as sweeping, visionary tale.

It is a story of family, history, tradition, loss, victory, politics, and the evolution of medical science."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I liked the book a lot.

One of my new favorites for sure."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I picked up this book in the Honolulu airport, hoping to squeeze more aloha out of two wonderful weeks vacationing in the islands. I knew of the leper colony, but not much of the story. This is a book I rooted for; the heroine is feisty, the Hawaiian family or \\"ohana\\" is strong, the beguiling setting as rich in imagery and frangrance any, and the heartache of families ripped apart by a disfiguring disease. But sadly, after the author starts you on a lovely tour of this rich story, he keeps dropping you with clunky plot lines and characters behaving in improbable ways.Sometimes, a male author writes from a woman's point of view in the most uncanny way (\\"The Hours\\" or author Wally Lamb come to mind). This author's portrayal of women characters was fairly weak and so I could never fully believe him and be fully enveloped by the story. More than once, I had to put the book down out of mild irritation for a few days. But there was enough content and history to pull me back.I would agree with other reviewers who were frustrated by the way the book encompasses the entire life of the main character. It makes for some awkward stops and starts. A large omission was an explanation of leprosy or Hansen's Disease. I found myself looking for some information or photos within the book.I can feel that this author has a passion for Hawaii and the history and culture of this paradise, but I wish he had an editor who had pushed him harder to fulfill the beguiling trip he promised the reader."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Interesting because I learned a lot about Moloka'i and the leper colony and our history with this disease.Touching in parts where people were trying to protect themselves and their families from the shame and fear of the disease and families were being separated.Disappointing because the heroine is too perfect, the characters didn't matter to me, the writing in parts seems straight out of a juvenile romance magazine, and too many events seemed to be just crammed in because, oops, this is a historical novel, so better not leave anything out."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I have read several books on leprosy and find it fascinating how the leapers were treated. One book that I thought made it even more real and interesting was \\"The Island\\", which took place in Crete in Greece. Although Rachel the heroine of this novel is a sweet seven-year-old girl, you never got excited or cared that much the story just kept focus on Rachel and what she did. There never was a huge climax or pivotal moment. I give Mr. Brennert the author kudos' for all the research he did and for making Molokai's the island come alive with scenery. Other than that it is a very slow read, but if you have an interest in the history of how leapers were treated you might want to give this book a try."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Mediocre writing but a compelling story. Characters are well-developed. Interesting period piece. I read it for a book club with an interesting discussion but no real debate possible."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"After seeing the glowing reviews for this book I couldn't wait to read it. After forcing myself through the first half of the book which I found very boring and actually put the book down for days at a time I found the second half to be great. My guess is that is why there are so many excellent reviews, it ends well. The first half focuses on when the lead is a child and is a very slow read and then when it gets to her adulthood it often skips years at a time which I think would have been the most interesting part. Anyways, I don't think I'd recommend it to a friend but it was half worth it."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Molokai is a work of historical fiction, and is informative about the scourge of leprosy in Hawaii in the late 1800's and early 1900's. It is well written, but not on a happy subject. It was a choice of my book club, not mine."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This was an very good book about the history of Molokai and the leper colony. The story was well developed with interesting characters. I found the history and culture of the island and its people intriguing."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The book was an excellent history lesson - so sad to read how the U.S. Government over-threw a monarchy, and to learn how victims of Hansen's disease were isolated for an entire lifetime. The paperback book was received in excellent condition, by the way!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Very informative book about the former Leper Colony on this Molokai island of Hawaii. Nice story line and history. Someday I want to visit this island; one of the only islands I have not been to yet. Been to Hawaii, Oahu, Maui and Kuai.This island too sounds awesome."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book was quite informative about a terrible time in American history when people infected with Hansen's Disease were forced into leper colonies. From a learning perspective it was a good read, but there was just something about the story that felt detached. I had a hard time feeling emotionally involved with the characters or even caring when they died. I am not sure why that is. But if you want to learn about leprosy during the 1800's and early 20th century, you will find this book interesting."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The stars rating above should be 5 stars!! Could not get the 5 to work. Molokai is an inspirational novel. It has been lovingly, and thoroughly researched by Brennert. . The characters are wonderfully drawn and the story is mesmerizing . The topic of leprosy might turn some away, but they will miss an emotional and surprisingly uplifting story. There is an analogy that seems to fit the story for me. In the destruction and ashes of Mt. St Helens volcano came a new soil that was richer and more productive. It generated the lushest and most abundant growth in the aftermath. In Molokai too, the leprosy brings forth heroes and develops inner strength that would never have grown without the suffering,challenges and tests of religious beliefs. Love ,friendship, compassion and community grow and thrive amid the challenges of disease and suffering. Molokai is a wonderful, thought provoking and inspirational novel.The words written by Robert Louis Stevenson after visiting Molokai (page 82)say more than any review can."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Book came in excellent condition and in a speedy manner.

I won't read another one by this author. A waste of money."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I love the new kindle, and have been downloading books when I see one I would like to read. However, after selecting \\"Moloka'i\\" by Alan Brennert, I found when I tried to read the book, the book started at Chapter 1, and when I turned the page found the chapter started with Locations 47-56. After trying to read the book anyway, the paragraphs sometimes start with the first letter missing. This hasn't happened to me with any other book previous to this one.Device info: Software Version: Kindle2.5.3(490488060) Serial Number: B003B0A200930FE0"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I don't understand how in the world this book reached publication. One of the worst books I have ever endured through to the bitter end. Boring, boring, boring, junior high level writing and poorly researched. At one point a character is buried 'with head to the east'; 100 pages later a character is buried 'with head to the north'. Almost insulting to Father Damien who worked and gave his life to the colony at Molokai. I will never read another book by this person (I hesitate to call him an Author.)"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"While the author certainly took care to divine his tale from the historical record, the tenor of his writing failed to match the intensity of the story. After several chapters, the voice of the narrative seemed monotonous."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Once you catch grasp of the premise, this is a very predictable tale. Girl gets leprosy and is quarantined. Nuns take good care of her, but her friends all die. Everyone close to her dies; she outlives everyone. She runs away when she is ten, she is awkward as a teenager, she falls in love with a man without the disease when she is 20, is a guinea pig for a research lab, marries, has a child which she can't keep, shows signs of deformity, all the while the world progresses around her. Oh yeah, she gets to meet the Governor of Hawaii. Isn't that special.There is nothing special at all about the protagonist, except she has leprosy, and about 150 pages into the book, I just stopped caring. The author really could have brought us close to her, but instead, spun a dragged out tale through the years, which left me skimming the pages just to see what else would happen. You could skim this book in an hour and take away the same thing as one who read it word by word."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a poorly written book with lightly developed characters. In short, this is a book about leprosy in Hawaii disguised as a novel.Makes for a laborious reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable and informative story about leprosy in general, and specifically about the leprosy colony on the island of Moloka'i, as well as Hawaiian culture and history. I thought Rachel's character was well-drawn, and progressed and grew throughout the book. The story was enjoyable to follow, with much informative information naturally woven into its fabric. My only complaints follow below.Throughout the book, there are some periodic minor sexual references, but only one explicit sex scene, which was only 1 paragraph in length and will be blacked out in my copy. I also disagree with the acceptance of the pagan Hawaiian beliefs as acceptable, but I didn't have a problem with their portrayal in this book.My other complaint is that there are too many melodramatic events thrown into one person's life, even excluding the fact that she lived through Pearl Harbor happening nearby and other real historical events. There's a character whose parents both commited suicide (years apart), and she ends up depressed and tries to commit suicide herself, but Rachel jumps in and saves her. A relatively important man in the book dies breaking up a domestic violence dispute. A sexual assault is attempted on a very important female character. There was a minor character that was a male who felt he should have been female, dressed accordingly, fooling many, and was thrilled when leprosy caused the destruction of his testacles and the resulting hormone imbalance resulted in breasts. I think this existed entirely to be \\"edgy\\" or to make a political statement about the irrelevancy of gender (which I disagree with). If it hadn't been for the fact that this was a very small part of the novel (she only exists for 66 pages of the 390, and really is only given more than a passing reference on 8 of them), this would have ruined the book for me.I'll keep this book, with some potential use of a black permanent marker over some bits here and there. But, I think it's worthwhile for the vast amount of information about leprosy and Hawaiian culture. However, I would be unlikely to get other books by this author, as I think it's quite likely that some of his books would not be ones that I would be comfortable reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I stumbled across this book while trying to find a non-fiction history of the Hawaiian leper colony. Although this is a novel, the author uses historical detail well, and paints an interesting story. The writing can get flowery, and the dialogue is a little strained at times, but on the whole this is a moving, compelling work of fiction."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I haven't loved a book this much in a long time. As other reviewers have said - \\"I couldn't put it down\\". I loved the characters, it was beautifully written (not fluffy or pretentious), and the story was compelling. I didn't want it to end.It came highly recommended to me, and I have passed on the favor. This book is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"What a treat! This novel is SUPERB! I finished it and wanted more...more about the history, more about the characters, more, more, more..."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. A truly original tale of the stregnth of the human spirit. It's an amazing story full of layers and surprises. Although it is a story of tragic losses, it keeps a rosy view and ends on a happy note. It opened up a whole world to me that I had never known about. And though leperousy is long gone, there are so many other historical situations that bare similar accounts. It was a real page turner for me. The story was so full and unexpected that I couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I didn't know when, if ever, a book would ever attempt to overtake Katherine as my favorite book of all time and although Molokai by Alan Brennert hasn't quite succeeded, it has come darn close and I am afraid has taken over the #2 slot from Outlander. When one cries tears of joy and sadness for the last 150 pages of a 388 page book, you know it has touched a chord. Spanning nearly 80 years from the late 19th Century to 1970, it is a story of epic proportions.Young Rachel Kalama is taken from her home at the tender age of 7 and by age of 8 is interred at Kalaupapa on Molokai, more commonly known as Father Damien's Leper Colony. Apart from an uncle who is already there, she is all alone. Yet even with her sadness, with her little girl sweetness, she quickly charms everyone she comes in contact with and makes several very special friends along the way including two women who takes on motherly roles who couldn't be more different from one another. From Rachel's friendships with the other young girls - who are all there as if the were orphaned, to romances, to mischief she gets herself into, Brennert breathes such life into this wonderful character. So much so that when you read historical accounts of Father Damien's Colony you fully expect to read her name among the former residents.Rachel quickly gets into the reader's heart in such a special way, taking ahold of it and not letting go, not even after the last page is turned. She will stay with me for a long, long time. The story is one that made me for once glad for my insomnia as I was able to stay up until 3:30AM finishing. Then I couldn't wait to discuss it with my husband and fellow readers the next day. I simply can't recommend this book highly enough. If you love a good story with characters that simply stay with you for a long time, if you love the Hawaiian Islands, if you are more interested in reading a bit more about Hansen's Disease (as leprosy is now more correctly called) or are simply just wanting a good book that you can't put down then I urge you to give Molokai a try. My only regret is that I didn't get it to it sooner. It had been recommended to me about four years ago and had been on my TBR pile for nearly three years. Don't make that mistake. Read this book and have your heart deeply touched."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Brennert's tale of the plucky young woman who survives the horrors of Kalaupapa and her own leprosy accurately reflects that chapter of Hawaiian history. Conditions there were well known to Hawaiians in the 1890's and most of those who were diognosed with leprosy reluctantly accepted this confinement. A few others did not. On Kauai a leper called Koolau resisted the government's efforts to deport him and created an incident that resulted in martial law. The eventual annexation of Hawaii by the United States was to some extent dependent on leprosy control efforts. Deportation of lepers became a political as well as a medical necessity. (See \\"A Medical Necessity,\\" in THE WAY WEST: TRUE STORIES OF THE AMERICAN FRONTIER). The rush to quarantine and the crowding of facilities at Kalapapa resulted in the conditions about which Brennert writes so well."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I picked up this book a couple times at the bookstore before I finally went back and bought it, as I am a picky reader and worried I'd loose interest in it. I was so wrong. It is so beautifully written, it was a joy to read. I couldn't wait to get back to the book if I'd put it down for a few hours. I've never been to Hawaii in my life but felt like I could picture it just from the author's vivid writing and description. I highly recommend this book for anyone, I don't think there is a certain age range that Moloka'i is aimed towards. Its just lovely how the book spans Rachel's whole life, from the heartbreaking start to the fulfilling ending. Very impressive story, I will certainly read Brennert's other works."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is now one of my all time favorite books. Not only is it beautifully written, but the author skillfully keeps the time line moving so the reader is left with the big picture by the end of the novel. To think that just over a hundred years ago, antibiotic therapy was not advanced enough to spare those with Hansen's disease a life of shame, ridicule, and abandonment. I found myself reading more slowly as the final chapter neared so the story wouldn't end. I am still thinking about Rachel and the thousands of other patients just like her."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is the joyous journey of a spirited 7-year-old girl who is banished to a Hawaiian leper colony. The author conjoins history, mythology, happiness, heartache, and affliction with a deft hand.Regardless of the dire subject the story steadfastly stays upbeat and uplifting. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"i had no interest in reading a book about leprosy.....but my book club chose it, so i did......and this is SO much more than a book about leprosy....it is a lovely, charming epic of a story........a fabulous, well written story ...now when can i go to hawaii? ......"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I am so lucky to have run across this book while browsing Amazon.com! Other reviewers have praised Moloka'i much better than I can, but I want to give it my 5 stars. I've been fortunate to have visited Moloka'i a couple of times, and have stood on the pali overlooking Kalaupapa thinking of those souls who had to spend their lives on that beautiful but isolated place. Rachel Kalama embodies the spirit of the Hawaiian people; those who love life, family, the land and the ocean."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"My family is considering moving to the Island of Molokai so the books title originally got my attention. Not knowing much about Hawaiian history, leposry or the how it played out on this Island I eagerly read through the book. The story is heart wrenching and one I couldn't stop reading. What I learned about Hawaii's history is so helpful and quiet sad, it explains why the Hawaii people are not always overly friendly to outsiders. It's amazing to read history on mans horrible treatment to man because of fear, ignorance and intollerance.Great job - I really enjoyed the book and was sad when it was over."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Lepers are the shunned center of Brennert's Hawaiian novel. Protagonist Rachel Kalama is five when the story opens in 1891 Honolulu, the year the last Hawaiian king dies and its first and only queen ascends the throne for a brief reign. Rachel's uncle Pono is chased down by the Health Inspector and taken away - a leper - and Rachel is warned to tell no one. But soon a sore appears on Rachel's leg and then her foot. Though her mother desperately hides the signs for a year, the disease is discovered and Rachel, too, is snatched from her family.Though reunited with her uncle, Rachel is subjected to dehumanizing medical examinations and can see her family only through a barrier. Pono is taken away again, this time to the leper colony of Kalaupappa on the island of Moloka'i. Rachel is only seven when she follows him, though their reunion is brief and she is sent to live in the Catholic dormitory with the other girls. The families left behind are also ostracized, for their association with lepers. Thus far the story is heartbreaking, and bewildering for Rachel, but slowly she begins to adapt to a new life.Though every step forward seems accompanied by another catastrophe - the death of a playmate, loss of contact with her mother, more death - this is not a litany of woe. Brennert paints a vivid picture of a community struggling for normalcy, as people do. Rachel (who has the milder form of Hansen's disease, leaving her comparatively healthy for years) forms friendships, knows joy, marries.Brennert's meticulous research charts the changes in the colony and in Hawaii, as the American presence grows larger. Improvements are made in living conditions and treatments; new experiments provide new hopes - usually dashed. Missionaries strive successfully against the old \\"pagan\\" ways while Rachel, brought up a Christian, learns about her own culture from Pono's new woman, who becomes a surrogate mother (though her influence is resisted by the colony's Catholic nuns).This is a novel about life amidst overwhelming obstacles and a novel about the disease itself - its mythology, its mystery and the growing triumph of medical knowledge during the twentieth century. Its fascinating subject and sympathetic characters combine in a gripping story."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A wonderful story! When I first heard about the subject matter I was a little nervous. (How much fun can a leper colony be?) However,I was totally blown away! Rachel is one of the best written characters that I have ever read. Although her journey from child to women takes place under trying circumstances, her story speaks to us all! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a fictional account of life in a turn of the (20th) century leper colony. I had previously read \\"The Pearl Diver\\" by by Jeff Talarigo, another fictionalized version of the life of a 'leper' and was fascinated by it. So when my book club chose to read this book, I couldn't pass it up. It was riveting, and I learned a lot. Some I may have wished I hadn't. The ostracization of the victims was a shock to me. And yet....I can understand how fear caused their peers to react in that way. I think parallels can be drawn with the early days of AIDS, and probably other disease as well.This book relates both ugly and beauty in human relationships. It is a book in which, like all good stories, you hate to tell the characters goodbye. Reading this book may change you and the characters will definitely haunt you for some time after you finish!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"In the Hawaii of more than a century ago, nothing struck more fear into the hearts of those that lived there than hearing the dreaded word, \\"leprosy\\", spoken in connection with themselves or a family member. To hear that pronouncement was to stigmatize the family of the afflicted, and for the afflicted it was to signal the end of life as one knew it and the beginning of another life: that of the living dead.In those days, leprosy, or what would in more enlightened times be known as Hansen's disease, would consign the unfortunate individual to total banishment from all that the individual held dear. The leprous party would be removed, by force if necessary, and exiled from one's home, family, and friends. All such individuals were then sent to live on the restricted and undeveloped segment of Moloka'i island that was reserved for lepers.It mattered not that the individual so separated from one's family was a child. The only thing that mattered to the officials carrying out their duty was the containment of the dreaded disease. This was how they chose to address what was then perceived to be a contagious disease with disfiguring consequences. Such is the story of Rachel Kalama, who towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the age of seven, was separated from the bosom of her loving family. Tossed upon the shores of Moloka'i with other individuals defiled with the same dreaded disease, a frightened Rachel eventually manages to make a life for herself on the island. This is her story.Through Rachel's eyes, the reader sees what life was like on the leper colony for those souls unfortunate enough to find themselves so exiled. Rachel finds herself reunited with her Uncle Pono who had also been afflicted by this disease and exiled to Moloka'i. Rachel is also enveloped by a new mother figure, the healer Haleola, Uncle Pono's companion. Moreover, Sister Mary Catherine Voorhies,a young nun from the Franciscan order whose mission it was to tend to the female children on the island, takes a special interest in Rachel and a long standing relationship is born.Slowly, a new family circle develops around Rachel, as she is seemingly forgotten by the family from whom she was separated. The only one of her immediate family who occasionally stays in touch with Rachel is her father. Rachel grows and develops while at the colony, and through her eyes the reader sees the changes that occur on the island over time. As Rachel grows up, the reader is introduced to a host of rich and clearly defined characters that interact with Rachel and help her to become the vibrant young woman that she eventually becomes.Her self-realization, however, is not accomplished without pain. Rachel eventually marries a Japanese-American also consigned to Moloka'i and bears a child, but children born in the leper colony at Moloka'i were immediately removed from their leprous parents in order to avoid their being infected with the disease. They would then be sent from Moloka'i to live with relatives or be adopted by strangers. So, even happy occasions such as marriage and parenthood had the shadow of leprosy cast upon it.This is a beautifully written, well-researched work of historical fiction. With its richly delineated characters, I found myself totally immersed in the story of Rachel, and the life that she managed to carve for herself. The narrative is quite descriptive, and I found myself fascinated by the workings of the leper colony and the changes that it would undergo over time, as well as by its unique identity. It is a well told story of the resilience of the human spirit, and its will to triumph in even the most dire of circumstances. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Brennert pens an incredibly touching tale of a little girl condemned to a terrible hell, and of her own struggle to find a life of her own within that prison. Brennert's characters shine through the difficult burdens placed on them to display a moving humanity, hope forging through even the darkest pit. A beautifully written (and well-researched) tale of another time and another place, brought to a very absorbing life. More, please !"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Spoiler alert!Perhaps because this is a historical epic, this novel seemed to have no arc -- there was no real tension or story to keep me interested, and the characters weren't interesting enough on their own to make me care. Rachel ages, she falls in love, gets sicker and healthier, while people in her life come and go -- yawn. The main character never came alive for me -- perhaps she seemed too idealized -- and those surrounding her were often drawn so sketchily that I often had to think hard to match a name to a character who hadn't appeared for awhile. Oftentimes those characters had contradictions that made knowing them difficult -- for example, when we first meet Kenji he's portrayed as a loose cannon -- not only was Rachel's first sight of him in the wake of a fight, but she soon sees him attack the ump for what he thinks is a bad call during a baseball game. Yet that side of him is never shown again -- he's thereafter portrayed as serious and responsible, and although he meets a violent end, his final violent act is a last resort, and noble. The contradiction was never explained, and I was left with a weak understanding of the character and what made him tick. This made the subsequent portrayal of Rachel's grief -- written so as to attempt to wring tears from the reader -- feel empty and a bit unearned.I also felt as though rather than creating an outline of plot points that would move the story along, the author started with a historical timeline. Everything that happened to Hawaii during that time was presented here, and rarely did it feel personal (I contrast this to a novel like the excellent Middlesex, which took historic events and made them gripping and relevant) -- events that could have been fascinating were rather bland.Finally, various parts of the book were so heavy handed and hokey they literally caused me to groan. The worst offense was Crossen's singing of Taps as he watches the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but there were certainly others. Perhaps I could've forgiven these had I been more engrossed in the characters or the story. With such a bare-bones plot, the writing needed to be flawless for the book to succeed. It wasn't."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Rachel is a happy seven year old living in Honolulu when she is diagnosed with leprosy (now known as Hansen's Disease) and sentenced to live the rest of her life in Kalaupapa, the leper colony on the island of Moloka'i. The historical novel Moloka'i, while spanning the years from the 1890's to 1970's, brings dignity and compassion to those who were quarantined to the island and separated from their families.Moloka'i is an enchanting novel by Alan Brennert. It is the story of Rachel and her life on Moloka'i but ultimately it is a story of hope and faith. It is a heart wrenching story but the people on the island also experience laughter, love and joy.The character development is well done. I especially appreciated the attention paid to Sister Catherine, a nun serving the people of Kalaupapa. The nuns are not the stock characters that inhabit most media, but thoughtful, tormented and realistic people with desires and dreams. The setting of the beautiful islands of Hawaii is described by one who loves it. Hawaii and its people are alive in this beautiful, stunning novel."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a beautiful story of love, compassion, courage, strength and mostly the different types of Ohana (family).

This book is in pretty good shape and costs hardly anything"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"...She realized now how wrong she'd been; the pali wasn't a headstone and Kalaupapa wasn't a grave. It was a community like any other, bound by ties deeper than most, and people here went to their deaths as people did anywhere; with great reluctance, dragging the messy jumble of their lives behind them.\\"The aforementioned quote (p 382), pretty much sums up this historical fiction genred story about the life of a Hawaiian girl named Rachel, who is sent to a leper colony as a youngster after testing positive for the disease. It begins in 1891 and continues through 1970, following the main character from her youth, through the typical milestones in life, to her death.What I liked most about this book was the writing, which is descriptive, engaging and easy to follow. I can't say the same about certain aspects of the plot, which were what I liked least about the story. Specifically, NOTE: SPOILERS follow, I disliked most of the story line surrounding sister Catherine including: her bad behavior towards Rachel (when she complains about God after something sad happens), the facts surrounding the death of both of her parents (really?), her halfhearted suicide attempt, and the rescue that follows. Additionally, Rachel's mother's behavior (once the reader learns the truth about what happened to the rest of her family) towards Rachel is (inconsistently) heartless. Lastly, in a story about leprosy, I expected the author to include more about the disease (say, in the Author's Note section), at a minimum, how it is spread.In summary, historical fiction fans will likely enjoy this well-written but imperfectly plotted story set in the late 1800s to mid 1900s about the inhabitants of a leper colony named Kalaupapa on the island of Moloka'i. Better: Even Silence Has an End by Ingrid Betancourt, When the Emperor Was Divine by Julie Otsuka and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This is a great book. Did run a bit long. Several times I thought it was finished. Time frame in the very end seemed to skip"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I really liked this book, as it gave a really good idea of what the life of someone who had leprosy was like. The fact that it takes place in the Hawaiian Islands was another plus. I would recommend MOLOKAI as a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"One of best books read all year.

Not a fun read, but one that taught me something new with each struggling day.

This one certainly did the job."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"A moving account of the leprosy camps on Molokai. The main character is well developed, and the reader becomes quickly invested in her.

I'm looking forward to a great discussion on this book when our Book Club meets in a few weeks!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I was always intrigued with the Hawaiian Islands and enjoyed Hawaii by James Michner.

This was truly a wonderful experience into Rachel, her life, her loves and her survival."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Funny, heartbreaking and absolutely wonderful. Based on real people and situations, the leper colony and those confined there, whether by choice of disease, come to life in Brennert's deft writing. My book group read it and we were all enchanted by Rachel's story and the depth of life she is able to achieve. The real people are true to their own stories whether they are good, indifferent or both. The tragedy of leprosy at the turn of the century is made starkly clear."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"King Kamehameha V, the last of five Kings of the Hawaiian islands, was descended from the chiefs of many native tribes. A bachelor, he took office in 1863, some 68 years after his ancestor became the first King. One of Kamehameha V's first acts was to set up a settlement for lepers on the island of Molokai. The settlement, known as Kalaupapa, isolated those known to have the disease, which was thought to be communicable. Those isolated to the colony lost all civil rights and became wards of the state, cared for by primarily religious leaders (Father Damien and Sister Marianne Cope among them)as the disease laid waste to their lives. Hawaiians had little choice but to give up their afflicted relatives, even children, and most were vilified for the shame and the fear of being family members of those associated with the disease. Kalaupapa's mandatory isolation policy survived a century, until 1969; leprosy drugs that evolved in the 40's did result in some patients who developed a resilience to the disease being released back into society. An almost barbaric, shameful reaction to an epidemic was therefore a reality of most Hawaiians' existence.Alan Brennert employs a technique in his book, \\"Moloka'i\\" that works best if you are a skilled writer with a vision to combine reality and fiction. In pursuing his novel of life on the \\"leper's island\\", Brennert incorporates real-life characters (patients, caregivers and citizens of the world)whom he has renamed, with the central character, Rachel Kalama Utagawa. Rachel is drawn with a crystal clear vision of what a Hawaiian native taken with leprosy as a child, might have grown to be.In quarantine dictated by the government at Kalaupapa, Rachel struggles a lifetime with the isolation, fear and bravery she needs to sustain herself in the face of what might be the untimely leper's death, or a lifetime without freedom to come and go.You, the reader, will fall in love with Rachel and be drawn into the world that she is forced to inhabit. And although it is a sad tale, the simple beauty of Rachel's life, her will to enjoy her existence, her losses and her loves, will leave you spellbound."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Bring your tissues and sense of humor, for this emotional and uplifting work of historical fiction will be sure to have you smiling and crying...sometimes at the very same line!I am so awed that this novel was written by a man, as Mr. Brennert so thoroughly and accurrately captured the complexity of female relationships- sisters, mothers-daughters; frienships, etc. As I felt upon reading another wonderful work of historical fiction, \\"Memoirs of A Geisha,\\" I was that much more impressed by the fact of the author's gender and ability to tell the story from the female perspective in a manner which undoubtedly rings true.Mr. Brennert's researching skills and love of Hawaii - its culture, language and traditions - are evident throughout this multi-generational story about a young girl torn apart from her family and sent (sentenced?) to live in the leper colony in Moloka'i. While I admittedly knew very little about the disease, and Moloka'i, prior to picking up this book, I found it extremely engrossing and hungered to know more - and the author truly delivered, leaving no aspect of what life must have been like there unexplored.Whether or not this topic sounds like it would interest you, the real reason this novel is so universally appealing is the depth and profoundness of the characters' inter-relationships and love. This is a novel for everyone, would make an incredible book club selection, and I am personally passing along copies to all my friends, since it is one of the best books I have read in a long time and think everyone will love it!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"as i was, you are lucky to have found this book. it is soooo good! i NEVER review books online, but this one is worth my time and effort to share. i read it a year ago, and i am still haunted by it. i can't believe how lucky i was to pick this book out of all the thousands at the library. get your hands on Molokai and read it. you will love it."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Similarly to the other reviews, I too was entranced by this heart-warming novel. Although the story is about heartache, the characters make it a heart-warming tale. I couldn't put this book down. I also fell in love with each and every character. Alan Brennert has an amazing work that is above and beyond my expectations."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I've been a fan of Alan Brennert's ever since I read Kindred Spirits and Time and Chance, but he's outdone himself with his new historical novel Moloka'i and has again proven himself to be a masterful storyteller.This is a poignant story that I knew very little about-Hansen's disease (a.k.a. leprosy) and the Hawaiian people. Rachel, the main character, is a lovable, spunky Hawaiian girl who is banished to a leper colony in the late 19th century. Her life there, though difficult, is also filled with adventures, friends, love, and hope. The story spans nearly 80 years (from the 1890s to l970s) and is full of twists and turns I never expected. At times I laughed out loud and at times I cried. I always cared about the people.I couldn't put the book down and was sorry when I finished it. It's rich in universal emotions as well as Hawaiian mythology, culture, and history. Fast-paced, full of warmth, humor, tragedy, and characters so real and affecting that I fell in love with them all. I now want to go to Moloka'i to see where they lived.Moloka'i is a masterpiece of narrative skill, empathy, and brilliant prose, and it honors people who lived not only with a terrible disease but also with dignity and humanity.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Wow, what a HUGE disappointment! I have to say I am so surprised at all the 5 star reviews! I was hoping to read a fascinating and compelling historical fiction novel, and instead I got a sappy and cliched story- the tried and true classic tale of the bereft young girl, growing into the woman who triumphs against all odds. The only originality to the story is its setting- otherwise, it has been told a hundred times before. The characters are romanticized and typical- you can easily predict what will happen to each of them. No twists, turns, or surprises. The development of the protagonist is particularly trite. When I compare a book like this to, say, \\"Water for Elephants\\", which I could not put down, or \\"The Help\\", which I loved, it pales in comparison. In both of those novels, the writers convey a sense of time and place, such that you feel as if you are being transported there, and are able to incorporate the richness of the setting and time without skimping on great character development. You can't wait to see what happens next in those stories. In \\"Molokai\\", the writer manages to take a fascinating backdrop and make it boring. The story lacks the richness and color needed to lift it out of its obvious course, or to provoke any real thought about the issues. The writer barely explains the facts about the disease, choosing rather to describes its symptoms. The actual history I learned could fill about one chapter, if that; the writing no better than average. If you are looking for rich and riveting historical fiction, or even an original plot, don't bother."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"What a great story! And so well-written you feel you are there.

Well worth your time."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"The description calls this book a \\"sweeping debut novel,\\" but that's inaccurate. At least 10 years ago, Alan Brennert wrote one of my favorite twist-in-fate novels, \\"Time and Chance,\\" in which a man gets to trade places with an alternate version of himself and see how his life would have turned out if he'd made different choices.That book was so marvelous that I'm eager to read \\"Moloka'i,\\" and I encourage readers of this book to seek out \\"Time and Chance.\\""},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I loved this book - couldn't put it down.

The story was terribly sad, but very well written and as Rachel's life progresses, the history is fascinating, including bits about the first plane flying over the island, World War II, and the internment of the Japanese in California during the war. I knew about the leper colony, but before reading this book hadn't realized how terribly the families of patients with leprosy were treated and often shunned by society out of fear. That's not even to mention how horrible it was for men, women, and children to be ripped from their families to live in quarantine without their consent.This book was so interesting and I loved reading Rachel's story and how the historical events affected her throughout the years. That was fascinating. Very sad, though. Great book!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I wish every book I pick up can draw me in and keep me so engrossed as this book.

As heartbreaking as her situation is, she encounters people who are kind, loving and nurturing throughout her life which enables her to live a full life with courage and determination.This book is beautifully written and the author does a fine job \\"painting\\" a very colorful and vivid picture of the people, places and emotions for the reader to enjoy. The book wraps up neatly and completely, no loose endings in this book.This book is fiction but some of the characters in this book (Mother Marianne and Father Damien) did exist and the events are historically accurate from what I can gather from a quick research I did online.

The characters are all so well-developed that you almost feel like you would recognize them if you ran into them in your life.

It begins with the story of Rachel Kalama as she is torn out of the fabric of her family in Honolulu at the age of 5 and taken to this faraway place.This is a heart-wrenching story, very detailed, and gives the reader a lot of information. I learned so much about this place....I had always known about it, but not in any detail. It was often shocking, but often heartwarming too.Four stars instead of five because I thought it got bogged down a little bit in places.

Although, I was sad when the book was over, it felt complete. Be prepared- this book is extremely emotional. I found myself crying at both the sad times and happy times (and there were many tears!).

I wanted to read something that was both fact and fiction, something that would give me some background to the land I was about to visit. This book gave me more than I could imagine. It follows nearly the entire life of Rachel Kalama, through her short life on Oahu and then her life on Moloka'i as an exiled leper. This book is rich in traditional Hawaiian culture and history - I highly recommend this read to anyone with a thirst for more knowledge about the people of Hawaii and the community in Kalaupapa, Moloka'i."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"If you love historical novels this book is a great read.

Loved it!!"},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"This book was chosen by my book club and I'm so very glad it was. I don't know if I ever would've come across it otherwise and it quickly became one of my favorite books.When I began reading, I was immediately pulled in because of Brennert's writing style and because of the main character, Rachel. Brennert has a rich way of weaving his words into a great attention-keeping story and I couldn't put the book down. As for Rachel, she's just sweet and adorable! If I remember correctly, she was seven years old when the book began. I really enjoyed how as a reader, I got to watch her grow up. Throughout the novel, I was always rooting for Rachel's escape from the island of Moloka'i. Does she ever get away? Well, I'd spoil the story if I told you so you'll just have to read it for yourself.Hmmm... let me back up... if you aren't familiar with Moloka'i, it's a Hawaiian island that was used as a quarantine colony for those with Hansen's disease (leprosy). Rachel is exiled to Kalaupapa, the leprosy containment community on the island of Moloka'i and the book follows her journey. Filled with a rich historical background, Rachel lives on Moloka'i through a period of great change. From Hawaii being absorbed by the United States, the cure of Hansen's Disease, the beginning of aviation and automobiles, the book is filled with actual historical facts that bring not just the characters, but the island itself to life.Unlike most novels I read, I was quite fond of many of the characters. Rachel, of course. Then there is Sister Catherine, a nun who lived on the island and took care of the female children. She was a woman with such strength and compassion, yet she was full of fears and doubts which endeared her to me. She was such a real and down to earth character. Haleola, also a Hansen's patient, took a sort of mother-role over Rachel. In a large way, she made up for Rachel being taken away from her mother and showed Rachel nothing less than pure love and devotion. Even Rachel's papa who never left or forgot her. A sailor on a steamer boat, he never stopped sending her things from the various countries he traveled to and visited her whenever he could. Dr. Goodhue was another person I was fond of. He was a really good doctor with a genuine care for the people of Moloka'i. Even the Territorial Governor (a real person), Lawrence Judd, was someone I was fond of as he was true to his words to reform Kalaupapa.Before reading this book, I had no knowledge of Moloka'i and the separate island community where people were exiled to. It was such an ignorant way for the people with Hansen's to be treated (pun may or may not be intended!). Families were literally torn apart, the reputation of the family completely destroyed. However, through the turmoil and loss, much was also gained. The people living on the island welcomed newcomers and one another with open arms. Instead of being sent there to await their deaths, together they triumphed, forming new families and new lives.A very touching novel, this book let us into the lives of the people of Moloka'i and when it ended, I was sad. It was like saying goodbye to good friends. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. Interesting topic with a character I became totally invested in.

This story if told of her journey and life living with leprosy. It's an amazing tale of love, courage, and strength.Alan Brennert tells a great story and sheds a light on a part of Hawaiian history that not everyone may be fully aware of. It's a story that you find out about the people, the history, and the mythology of Hawaii. A book you won't want to put down and one you will happily recommend to others."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"My Aunt Viola, born about the same time as Rachel in 1891, used to tell me that, \\"if life give you lemons, make lemonade dearie.\\" In my 54 years life has thrown me a lemon or two, a challenge here and there and a couple of heartbreaks - but never leprosy. Rachel, at age 7 was thrown a boatload of lemons when she was diagnosed with the dreaded, awful-in-biblical proportions disease of Leprosy.Alan Brennert has written an epic story of the history of Moloka'i, the leper colony/island designated by the officials as the place where lepers would go to live and ultimately die, in quarantine, away from society, family and friends. Told through the eyes of Rachel , a happy, friendly little 7 year old girl who has the misfortune of getting the disease, she is yanked, literally yanked, from the arms of her parents to go live on an island in an institution with a bunch of nuns. She's not alone as the island is a virtual prison for all Hawaiians who have succumbed to this nightmare, which from the late 1800's that the book begins until mid century, was misunderstood, mistreated and untreatable. It carried with it a stigma of dirtiness, shame, contagion, ignorance. Brennert expertly weaves in the history of the island, the introduction of aviation, modern medicine, electricity and plumbing, as well as advances in medicine and treatments - with the passage of time of the inhabitants of the colony. His research into the subject was extensive, and he treats parts which under someone else's pen would have become a sappy mess, with integrity, honesty and gripping emotions without becoming emotional.The ramifications of leprosy are chronicled through the stories of the families left behind in Honolulu or some of the other islands, who must hide, change their names, grieve for their losses quietly - lest someone at a school or at a workplace find out and cause a healthy relative of a leper to get fired or be asked to leave or be shunned. For Japanese immigrants the double whammy consisted in their personal shame and desire to obliterate all memory of the family member who contracted the disease.Not to give the wrong impression and back to my lemonade analogy or metaphor or whatever the hell it is - people on the island made lemonade by the bucketful. Their sickness, lack of health, heck - lack of limbs and deformities - did not define them. They struggled to maintain some semblance of ordinary life in the face of truly extraordinary circumstances. They became each other's support system, the family they no longer had - not without missing and yearning for the life they had, but certainly making the best of what horrific odds life had given them. It IS a book full of hope, of spiritualism, of kindness and good karma. It's a book that makes you think, that connects you to Rachel and makes you feel for her. I'm not a crier - I might be hormonal, but I'm no crier - and this one had me tearing up several times.The author follows Rachel, who is one of the lucky ones with a slow-developing form of the disease, through adolescence and into marriage, the many friends and relationships she makes and loses on the island and through her we see the evolution of the island, the effects of WWII, the progression of medicine.Before I finished the book, I took a look at youtube looking for references to Moloka'i and leprosy. I wanted to see what was real - and I saw on youtube exactly what Brennert described - an island of hope and tragedy, of sorrow and loneliness, an illness which devastates and people who deal with it with serenity, grace and hope."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"I found this novel engrossing, partly for the story and partly for the description of Hawaii and its history. Having lived in Hawaii, danced in the streets when it received Statehood, and been back often enough to see the changes from the quaint Waikiki to the upscale shop-lined street that is now a soul sister to Las Vegas, the book was fascinating to me in terms of how the islands have been transformed. We can not be reminded too often that Hawaii became a part of the U.S. as a victim of aggression. The description of the leper colony and its inhabitants, and the manner in which they were brutally separated from their families, was a sad but perhaps inevitable chapter in the history of medicine and government. I liked the character development--but this was not really a character-driven book in the true sense. The main thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was a feeling of being let down in the end. It was as if the author got tired of writing about Rachel once she left the colony, and sketched in a few significant details. Did she ever find a job? Where did she get the money to travel? Did she meet anyone? I wish I knew."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"3.5 stars really. Moloka'i is the story of how bad life can really be. Rachel Kalama has leprosy and we follow her life as she lives with the biblical stigma in exile on the island of Moloka'i.Rachel is really a lovable protagonist. We meet her at the age of 7 and as her world begins to fall apart, we can't help but empathize with her, to want to console her and become children again ourselves through her eyes. As she develops into a young woman, she becomes something much more - a capable and daring individual, who refuses to let her disease prevent her from living or from killing her dreams of travel, which she keeps alive vicariously through her father's experiences as a sailor. And how can we not love the old woman she becomes? Giving, loving, determined to right not just the wrongs imposed upon her by white doctors and superstitious Hawaiians, and a keeper of a dying tradition. The woman exiled by her people becomes the protector of her culture, not immune, but resistant to the changes imposed upon them as Hawaii is incorporated into the American way of life.And how can you not love her father, Henry Kalama, as he Roaming around the world, making his living on steamliners, but keeping his daughter, forgotten and forsaken by everyone else in the world, close to his heart? Or any of the wonderful people that reach out to and protect and befriend Rachel in her living prison?Ultimately, Moloka'i tells the story of persecution on many levels. It touches on the historical ordeals of those unfortunate enough to contract Hansen's disease. It speaks of the racism and arrogance of American business men and missionaries who asserted their dominance through force and co-opted Hawaiian land and lives. It explores anti-Japanese sentiment and how a family dealt with it during WWII. But in the end, Moloka'i forces you to consider the definition of a good life - and Rachel's, perhaps because it is cast in the land of the dead and dying, is brought into exceptionally high relief. Would that we could all live half the life she had in spite of her fate.I realize I may be a tad biased in this... Moloka'i reminds me very vividly of my grandma, who grew up less than a generation after Rachel in these very same places and I can't help but imagine her life, experiencing the same momentous historical and technological changes. I can't help imagining O'ahu and Kaua'i and Maui. Brennert does a fantastic job bringing these places back to life and describing them in ways that appeal to people who've visited the islands, but I wonder if his small touches (one might even call it fanservice) appeals to people who've never been.There was also a section toward the middle where I began to feel like Brennert was visiting tragedy upon tragedy on Rachel for the sake of continuing a cycle of pity, each more outrageous than the last for the simple purpose of getting you to empathize with her, which was totally unnecessary - and really, how much more horrible can you make someone's life when you give them leprosy at the age of 7? The answer, according to Brennert, apparently, is: A LOT.Still, Moloka'i is a compelling biography that brings a tremendous amount of satisfaction. And as I mentioned earlier, I don't think I will ever forget Rachel. She surfs, has a fondness for Jack London, and is fearless in her interactions with any type of authority - especially for an early 20th century woman. I put her on the pedestal beside Elphaba."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Today, there are effective medicines and treatments for Hansen's disease (historically known as Leprosy). The disease is also not as communicable as once thought. However, this book spans 80 years from the late 1800's to 1970. During much of this time, Leprosy was feared and severely curtailed the freedom of person's suffering with it. This is the story of Rachel, who is diagnosed with Hansen's disease when she is 6 years old, removed from her family and sent to Kalaupapa, a settlement on the island of Moloka'i. Her story is rich with details of life in a Leprosy Settlement and what it was like to live with a disease dreaded and feared by society. Through are a variety of characters, Brennert shows that although some refuse to accept the constraints of this condition, many more lead happy fulfilled lives. Some abandon hope as soon as society abandons them, others live and breathe hope. This is also a book that will provoke debate on many emotionally charged issues. The shame and fear associated with Leprosy, the challenge of living with little freedom and limited resources and no control over your circumstances. This darkness is balanced with examples of the courage and strength of the human spirit that faces adversity and triumphs. In short, this is a complex story and excellent historical fiction for those who enjoy character driven novels with emotional pull."},{"Title":"Moloka'i","review":"Moloka'i is one of my all time favorite books.

Debbie"},{"Title":"Summit : Vittorio Sella : Mountaineer and Photographer : The Years 1879-1909","review":"Vittorio Sella is little-known today, but knowledgeable people like Ansel Adams consider him one of the greatest mountain photographers ever. Sella did his work at a time when cameras weighed 40 pounds, glass negatives two pounds apiece, and mountain climbing was much more primitive than today, without the warmest clothes, tough equipment and bottles of oxygen. Sella is also known for being the first person to scale the Matterhorn in winter.Sella was the son of the first Italian to write about photography and his uncle was a famous leader of Italian mountaineering. Expedition photographs were a new idea in his day, and primarily served the purpose of map-making for subsequent expeditions. Sella's work also served that purpose, but transcended it with stunning minimalist views. As Ansel Adams points out in his preface, Sella also understood the technique of mountain photography in ways that are missed by many current photographers.His work was of such stature that he was invited along on important expeditions by the Duke of Abruzzi, which allowed him to be the first to create images of many important scenes. These expeditions included his native Alps, Alaska, Uganda, the Caucasus range, and the Himalayas. His photograph of K2 in the Himalayas is considered the finest one ever.As dazzling as these images are, the essays in the book greatly add to them by explaining the context of their creation, the photographic problems involved, and the artistic aspects of the work. I enjoyed reading each of them, because each shed a different light on the work.Although the book is about summit photographs, the book includes many photographs during the ascents, of the people met during the expeditions, and of local scenery.The summit photos are remarkable to me in many ways. First, he made great efforts to get the right perspective -- often climbing another mountain to get a view the the one alongside. Second, he created stunning panoramas of the major chains which exceed what the eye can see, even if you were there. Third, the pictures have a sense of motion in the glaciers that is quite remarkable. These rivers of ice look like they are moving in videos when you look at them. Fourth, the mountain views have a spiritual quality that is uplifting. Your view of mountains will be forever changed by these photographs.Also, I feel grateful for the photographs because, although I love mountains, I am not a mountain climber and would never have a chance to see these beautiful, inspiring scenes otherwise.I encourage you to read and enjoy this book as example of what goals can provide. In the days when Sella was climbing there was no chance of reaching the top of many of these peaks, such as K2 (thought by many to be the toughest mountain in the world to climb). Yet the climbers and Sella achieved lasting meaning for themselves and for us in their partially successful endeavors. Goals take us to the top of our skills by extending our ambition and focus. Be sure you are always looking for the next mountain to climb (and photograph). Let these wonderful images inspire you on to your personal greatness! Also, think about choosing goals that will aid and inspire others for many years in the future as Sella did."},{"Title":"Summit : Vittorio Sella : Mountaineer and Photographer : The Years 1879-1909","review":"This is one of the key volumes in any collection of mountain photography books. Sella was one of the earliest and most accomplished practitioners of this difficult discipline and this Aperture monograph does full justice to the importance and beauty of his work. The book, measuring approximately 28x31 cm, has been handsomely and meticulously produced. The quality of the photo reproductions is very good, capturing the spirit of the originals. There is a very pleasing layout, with pictures alternatingly presented on white and grey backgrounds. Formats vary, with about 25 photos spilling over onto a second page. There are two large foldout panoramas: one taken from the summit of the Elbrus and the other one representing the Baltoro area in the Karakoram. As far as I can tell, the 3:4 aspect ratio of the original 30x40 and 18x24 plates has been respected.The documentary value of Sella's images is undisputed. But Sella's images surely transcend the boundaries of a purely documentary kind of photography. Take one of the earliest images shown in the book, taken on the Aletsch Glacier in the Bernese Alps in 1884 (Sella was 25 then). It is not easy to reconstruct the standpoint of the photographer, but I suspect that he is looking towards the L&ouml;tschenl&uuml;cke, with the the onset of the Sattelhorn ridge barely visible to the left and a sizable chunk of the Mittaghorn-Gletscherhorn chain in full view on the right hand side of the pass. It must be early morning as the light is slanting from the East, softened by a disperse cloud cover above the Mittaghorn. The picture is titled \`Crevasse on the Aletsch Glacier, Alps, July 18, 1884', but for me the real protagonist is the mysterious human figure nearly in the centre of the picture. It is the silhouet of a mountaineer in period attire, including the typical Alpenhut. He has left ropes, ice axe and other climbing gear behind and is studying a document. We can presume it is a map, although from the shape and size of the document and the climber's posture, we could deduce it is a kind of letter he is studying. The incongruity between the majestic surroundings, bathed in ethereal light, and the hard-etched casualness of the human figure remind us of the surrealists who would be experimenting with strange juxtapositions only a few decades later.A later example of a fascinating image is the picture on page 111, showing the Duke of Abruzzi and guides climbing the Chogolisa icefall in the Karakoram range. The diffuse colours, the halos around some of the ice towers and the brushed effect in the gloomy sky place the picture in the Pictorialist tradition (&agrave; la early Stieglitz or Steichen). Again, there is an oddity which makes the attentive observer pause. The first climber has taken a position on a small shoulder and is overlooking the terrain they have to tackle next. Clearly, he is not belaying the second man (presumably the Duke) who, assisted by another guide, is attacking an ice bulge under an ice cave. Curiously the lead climber has left his ice axe behind on a little ledge in front of this ice cave lower down. It is difficult to say why in that particular situation anyone would feel tempted to leave behind this essential piece of climbing apparel. As in the Aletschgletscher picture, there is a detail in this picture, a slight twist of perspective, which reveals a deeper layer beyond the purely documentary.The essays accompanying the pictures vary somewhat in quality. Individual chapters are ordered chronologically, reflecting Sella's progress as he worked through his major campaigns in the Alps, Caucasus, Yukon, Ruwenzori, Sikkim and Karakoram. Paul Kallmes' short introductory essays to the chapters are informative and well written, if only a little short. Wendy Watson's concluding essay \\"Picturing the Sublime\\" is a disappointment. Although it contains a lot of interesting biographical material, Watson fails to penetrate to the heart of what makes Sella's photography truly great. Compare this to Ansel Adam's all too brief but very insightful introductory essay where the artist and master practitioner reveals something of what it takes to create the particular spatial depth in mountain photographs. Whilst Watson occasionally tends to hyperbole, Adams' language is movingly poetic, but remains focused and precise.The book ends with a notes section, a bibliography and a very good timeline. This is worth studying in detail as it includes some startling anecdotes. For instance, in December 1892 Sella traveled by train from Dover to London. During the journey he leaned too far out of the window, thereby striking his head on the tunnel wall. After spending two weeks in coma, he fully recovered from his skull fracture.We also have to wait until the very final pages of the book to see two pictures of the man himself, both taken at very old age. One wonders how he looked like when as a young man of 25 he wandered through the Alps with his 30x40 camera ..."},{"Title":"Summit : Vittorio Sella : Mountaineer and Photographer : The Years 1879-1909","review":"This book is absolutely breath-taking.

These men were not the types of gentlemen one would like to suffer disagreements with and this is borne out in the second half of the book which retells the Hawkhurst Gang's hideous murders of Richard Hawkins and a year later the more infamous ones of Galley and Chater. The account of these murders is extremely graphic, most detail in this book has been drawn from the transcripts of the perpetrators trial. Definitely interesting, but not for the faint hearted.It is illustrated but only in line drawings and there is a short but reasonable bibliography at the end to follow up any of the detail further."},{"Title":"From Ulster to Carolina: The migration of the Scotch-Irish to Southwestern North Carolina","review":"Excellent service.

Of course, opinions may vary on Halabi's objectiveness, but I feel he had done an excellent job on portraying both sides of this conflict. As a Druse who has lived in Israel all his life, Halabi has experienced what it is like to live as an Arab in Jewish society. As he speaks both Hebrew and Arabic, the author was able to talk to many different people on both sides of this conflict, making friends and enemies along the way. Halabi is a career reporter and his book is full of details, so this is not a quick read. It can be difficult to keep up with the names and different groups, but I believe this is due more to the incredible complexity of this conflict rather than the fault of the author. This is a great book that can give the reader background on a conflict that may seem confusing to many."},{"Title":"The West Bank Story","review":"THE AUTHOR FAILS TO CREAT A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PALESTINIANS AND THE ISRAELIS ARE IN.

Additional chapters follow for fuel injection, camshafts, ignition, oil, cooling, and superchargers. The author includes an individual summary for a half dozen or so competition and street \\"packages\\", examples of successful hot rods and what was done. And finally there's a chapter on building a 405 HP - no supercharger - cobra engine.This is not a Haynes type of book, with lots of drawings showing how to take something apart and put it back together, this is primarily discussion, with lots of pictures, on what works and why, tweaks you should know about based on the author's experience, and what doesn't work or work quite as well. Of great benefit is the discussion of individual vendor components with associated pros and cons. This helps ensure the right amount of money is spent on the right stuff.The author clearly enjoys performance engines and making performance engines work better, and he is a pro - see the website at http://www.seanhylandmotorsport.com/. He also writes well, there are numerous 'stories' from experience which are reassuring: he's been there, done that. He covers both street setups, strip and road racing. I would say there's fairly even coverage, street vs track, and much is a matter of degree, such as boost from the supercharger.hence i recommend this book for anyone thinking about tuning their cobra, or getting an earlier model gt or cobra and having some fun hot rodding it. there's a lot that can be done, and this book shows clearly how to get from 240 hp to 600 or more, for street or strip."},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance 4.6 Liter Ford Engines","review":"It's good to finally see a book on the Ford modular engines. Hyland does the reader a great service by tirelessly going over blocks, cranks, intakes, cylinder heads, injectors, and ignition systems. He does a wonderful job on the cylinder heads, carefully showing how many cc's the chambers have with each style and letting you know what your likely compression ration will be with various cylinder head and piston combinations. One other area where this book really shines is the excellent photos that accompany the text.I do have two minor quibbles. I disagree with his statement about hypereutectic pistons. For the average mild performance application, hypereutectics will be fine. If you have NOS, or a turbo, then by all means get the forged units. It would also be nice to include a overview of how to set the cams, chains, and sprockets for those who are installing a stock style camshaft without doing cam events. After all, not everyone is going to degree their camshaft, even though they should, and having a guide might prevent a few bent valves.All in all, it's a solid book with a lot of information that isn't available elsewhere.

You'll be glad that you did."},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance 4.6 Liter Ford Engines","review":"Obviously, Sean Hyland has done a bunch of mod motors and R&D; over the years. The review of different heads and intakes is nice, and seems spot on. How to modify intakes seemed a little vauge, but not bad. There's a few combos in the back of the book that probably would help some guys get an idea of what to build. There's a good source of info about superchargers!There's some engine build-up stuff in there, and lots of pictures, but I thought he could have been a bit more specific about actually building the engine step by step. I liked the parts where he told about past failures, and what he learned from them. I also liked his description and instructions for head porting. He doesn't explain how to do it as much as he does what to do.

Some readers will fault the book because it does not give to a soup to nuts rendition of how to build the engine leading you by the hand with each piece as it is assembled into a working engine. That's not what the book is about.The book is an extraordinary tour-de-force about what does work and what applications it works best in. The information about blocks, cranks, rods, heads, pistons would take years of personal experience and thousands upon thousands of dollars to acquire. For the price of a paperback it can be yours. The information on oiling systems, cam drives and cam drive hardware would be comparably expensive to research on your own.Degreeing a cam in a 2V pushrod engine is a walk in the park for knowledgeable builders. Doing a 4V twin cam engine the first time can get you upside down and backwards in the blink of an eye. Hyland devotes an entire section of the book to cam phasing and how to do it with these engines. If you haven't done it yet then you do not appreciate how confusing it will be the first time you try.

However, I bought an '03 Mustang last year on a whim. I didn't know much about the 4.6, and after having it for a few months I was longing for another Fox with a familiar 5.0. I basically forced myself to keep the car and have gradually started to like it.

It's less useful if you have a 5.4L, 3-valve truck engine and are looking for tips in that context. If you are shopping for modular Ford engine books, you may have read my review on Richard Holdener's \\"Building 4.5/5.4.L Ford Horsepower on the Dyno,\\" book. My lament with this book is the same; a dearth of specifics on the 3-V 5.4L truck powerplant. This book, however, does have a modecum of specific info on the 5.4L 3-V and lots more practical nuts-n-bolts info. Because of the general architectural similarities between all the modular engines, the nuts-n-bolts approach covers a lot of ground generally. Of the two books, this one provides a more \\"hearty fare\\" that could be useful to a truck owner... if he understand the difference in context between the basic needs of a torquey truck engine vs a high-revving sporty engine. This book is geared towards the power side of the equation and that's exactly what the author intended. No foul! I came away a lot more knowledgeable regarding the Ford Modular engines. A few specifics on building a 5.4L torquer would have earned this book a rarely-given-by-me five stars. I like the layout and composition. It's only lack is a comprehensive index... something sadly lacking in many books these days."},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance 4.6 Liter Ford Engines","review":"The information in the book is awesome and a lot of mustang performance ideas are given.

At least Willow has some spine and guts to her. I was surprised to see what happened between her and Thatcher, and Linden too.My chief complaint is those stupid letters at the end of the books. My goodness if the ghostwriter doesn't have any confidence in his past works (that they'll sell on their own without having to advertise like this), then maybe he should move on.

Great reading if you loved Flowers In The Attic (Dollanganger Series)."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"After I read Willow, I was thrilled that the book didn't include any of the usual incestual relationships found in VC Andrew's novels. Although there was an undercurrent of incestual thoughts on part of Linden for Willow, it didn't really come to it's full fruition.I loved the character of Willow. The writers created a smart, ambitious, independent heroin. She was serious about her quest to find and know her birth mother, but she was vulnerable since the death of her father. When her college boyfriend failed to support her journey, it left Willow with a new fresh wound of vulnerability.Willow had to marry Thatcher. She loved him and because she loved him, she wanted to trust him. That is her bottom line.I would have loved to see the writers delve deeper into their relationship. It seems obvious to me that if they are both married to others and using their daughter like a pawn that they have unfinished business together.The ladies who told Willow about Thatcher's infidelity was the writer's way of giving the story's heroin some female friends.Finally, I have to admit that I cried during every part with Willow and Thatcher because I had a feeling that he would betray her in a most hurtful way. Willow has to deal with that hurt and I don't think that she has healed. Sure she divorced Thatcher and married her college professor, but that doesn't seem like closure enough for the love that they shared."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"I haven't actually read the wicked forest book, but i loved the first one.

Andrews fan for almost 20 years. HER books were much better then, much better than the books the ghostwriter puts out now. Why? Because he uses a formula to write these books.Now this book had a great story. A ritzy lifestyle, interesting people, fancy mansions. I liked Willow and wanted to know more after reading it and this book picked up the trail really well. However, it was VERY predicatble, even for fans who have only read a couple of the V.C. Andrews books. Yep, things are going to look rosy for Willow for a bit, but as a fan, I KNEW something bad would happen right before the ending and it did. Typical. But, all in all, this one has a great storyline and interesting characters and was a really quick read. Great for any V.C. Andrews fan.And, as for those awful letters at the end of these books. Give me a break..."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"I really enjoyed Willow and was looking forward to this installment. Boy was I dissapointed! I want to know what happened to the Willow from the first book. She is painfully absent from the second installment and that absence really hurst this book. In Wicked Forest, Willow is replaced with a weak and incredibly stupid version of the girl from the first book. She spends the entire book looking at life through rose colored glasses. The Thachter situation really made me angry. Many times I had to put the book down because I was annoyed with the whole thing. Any girl with half a brain could see Thachter's infidelity coming and by making Willow so blind to the situation made a half way decent book barely tolertable. As with other reader I also felt the ending was rushed. There had to have been a better way of handling that, even if it meant having a 3rd book from Willows point of view.One of my pet peeves about all V.C. Andrews is the fact that no matter how old the main character gets she still refers to her parents as &quot;Mommy&quot; &amp; &quot;Daddy.&quot; Come on, I stopped doing that when I was in elementary school. All this does is take away from character's intellegience &amp; in some cases they don't have all that much to spare (i.e. this book)I agree with everyone regarding those silly letters at the end of the books. Most of the people buying this book has read the ones being plugged in the back of the book, so give it up already."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"I have to say at the beginning of this new series I was excited and hoped it would be the start of something better by the ghostwriter. However, I was disappointed with Wicked Forest. First off the whole thing with the letter from other characters from differents series was silly and a real stretch. The whole thing with Willow marrying the professor so quickly was a bit out of character (at least in my opinion) and we knew nothing about him!I would have to say that Bunny and the rest of the &quot;townies&quot; were very colorful and kept the book going.Overall I was pretty disappointed. I will probably read the next one for the sake of continuing the series."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"First of all, I have to admit the Willow series is a lot better than some of the other VCA books. It is interesting and I actually have met some people that snobby and obsessed with their social world. I didn't realize how much I liked it until I got ticked about Thatcher cheating on Willow. Man, I was mad!!!!Those letters are annoying, I agree. And every book has to have an incest thing going; I would love to see some ghosts from the past haunting people or some scary stuff. After all, you find this book in the Horror section of the bookstore."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"After reading the first Debeers book, I was greatly disappointed. Back then when it first came out, I still had faith and hope in Mr. Neiderman's writing and hoped that he would go back to putting effort into the books he ghostwrote for the VCA name.

I didn't like it as much.I don't feel that this book was very well written. I found it to get quite boring and twisted."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"This is making me sick! It seems every series the GW has written under VC's precious name is filled with blank, unintelligent and boring characters. Willow was alright in the first book. She wasn't too whiny and she would do things even if others didn't agree with her. But this book was horrible. Willow turned into a judgemental little brat! She thought she was so much better than everyone else. For a psychiatrist who is supposed to &quot;understand&quot; people, she sure doesn't do a good job here. She claims that everyone in Palm Beach is too shallow, blah, blah, blah. She also seemed very vapid and unintelligent. And Thatcher, who I was suspicious of from the beginning, turned out to be even worse than I imagined. His character changed as well. The Palm Beach ladies are all - of course - shallow and materialistic. Does the GW seem to think that his &quot;heriones&quot; live in a world where everyone else is walking around with no problems other than what to buy on their next shopping spree? Every character and plot of his seems to be the same recycled blah in every book he writes! Instead of following a &quot;pattern&quot; he should think of a new storyline and work off that instead of trying to copy old ideas. It's a good thing I didn't buy this book, for I'll never read it again."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"this book was doing bueatifully... until that thatcher thing. i won't give it away, but that was totally out of charactor. it seemed like the author got bored and decided to cause some chaos. believe me, it shows."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"Ok, the second book in a VC Andrews series are ususally pretty good (in Dark Angel's case-one of her top 3 best) It's usually the 3rd or 4th book where things go down hill think-If There Be Thorns, Gates Of Paradise and the all-time worst in my opinion Twilight's Child) Anyway, in this case, the writer seems determined to ruin the saga in only the 2nd book.

Bunny! I might add, I didn't much fancy the Linden thing, but hey, I guess incest is a company trademark eh? (it only works if Virgina Cleo is the true writer, she made it so you couldn't help loving the Troy/Heaven, and being horrified, yet intrigued with Cathy/Chris.)All in all I was pretty much in love with the book... really when you think about it, besides Music in the Night, the ghost writer has only done good on the miniseries (for some reason, I like those. They're diverse, I suppose.) ... so Willow was so refreshing ... well ... then I bought the sequel, expecting an equally satisfying read I was horrified to find that the new books quality was far below standard! The plot sucked, sure it started out okay, because I liked Willow, but then, all hell broke loose; they wrote \\"It took my breath away\\" AGH! It pained me so to read through the Logan series without hurling my lunch over Melody's \\"sudden\\" relationship with Cary and the way she described everything with that infamous quote... sure Cary sounded pretty hot, but no need for the extra goo...Anyway, from there, the characters plopped, Bunny got predictably more \\"Jilian\\" making her a very stupid and nausiatingly copied villian, Thatcher sleezed around, and immediately I was aware of there half-baked copy of Phillip and Logan ... MIXED ... (the horror) the spinsterous sister? So incredibly \\"the aunt from Rain\\" (cannot remember that name) Linden was your average crazed little horny incestuous leach (aka.: Cary) and Grace didn't even have a personality to begin with... The only parts I found amusing were the little club of divorcees and Willow's rainy day moments.Another thing I hated was that quick divorce, and marriage to that professor... ah ... another timeAll in all, only buy the book if you are hardcore VCA and can't stand to wait more than a day to buy it after it comes out."},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"I thought since &quot;Willow&quot; was such a great start to this series that I'd love &quot;Wicked Forest....&quot; Nothing was farther from the truth.

I loved Willow's Mom Grace even though Grace wasn't there for Willow growing up you can tell just how much she always loved her. Grace was the best Mom to Linden even though he was not all there at times in his mind. By reading along you can't help but wanting Grace to find love I picture her so young a beautiful, you know she was just dying to get out and live her life but she was scared to go out into the world she knew that Linden needed her.

I enjoy the concept of them all, as well as the writing style- don't change them!"},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"I am a true die hard fan of V.C. Andrews, the real one that is, not the fake and unoriginal ghostwriter they got churning out her stories now. In the begining he did a pretty good job but after the Landry series everything kinda went downhill, even so, I had high hopes for his new series though I should have predicted that when the De Beers series came out it would be just as pointless and predictable as his other mangled attempts at writing. But, to give the devil his due (as the Ghostwriter says at least a hundred times in this book and his others) the De Beers series doesn't stink nearly as much as the Hudson series or even worse the Shooting Stars and Orphan series which gave a whole new meaning to the term Horror Fiction. I didn't like the first book in this series but this book wasn't so bad. That's probably the most I can say about it. I didn't really like Willow as a character. Sure, she's not as wimpy as the GW's other heriones (BIG PLUS) but she really came across as cold and annonyingly over analyical to me (HUGE MINUS). She's always critizing and finding fault with other people. According to Willow, everyone in Palm Beach but her was hopelessy snobby and flawed in someway. I though she could have been a little less of a jerk to Marjorie and the rest of the Club Florette(?) too. In their own way they were only trying to help her out. Also I though the way she talked to her dead father was downright creepy!!! Don't get me wrong, I can understand talking to someone you love and miss after they die and all but having them talk back was a little bit too much for me. And another thing, for someone who wanted to be a pyschologist Willow was in complete denial of how crazy and screwed up her half brother Linden was. I mean, when he went all psycho at the end she totally should have seen that coming. This book was ok, (even if the ending was a little rushed) and I'll continue to buy the rest of the series if for no other reason than to add to my collection of V.C Andrews books.

Believe me, you'll be so mad and feel betrayed yourself...I don't like this book much towards the ending, but will probably continue with the series...take care all!"},{"Title":"Wicked Forest (De Beers Family 2)","review":"I have been trying to kick the VCA habit for years (I'm 35). I'm proud to say that I quit the miniseries a couple of years ago, but am still reading the full-size book series. The ghostwriter must be reading these reviews, because the DeBeers series shows an improvement that I hope will last. A problem of the books that came after the Casteel series has been that the young protagonists are too &quot;wide-eyed&quot; for someone living in the 21st or late-20th centuries. Young people have sharpness, and Willow seems more modern than Rain Hudson or Dawn Cutler. The dialogue has also become sharper and pithier, which was sorely needed!

Also, Willow is a strong, independent role model type character that I'm sure many will like. And while I kept hoping that Linden would be killed off so I didn't have to read passage after passage about this weirdo, I found the scenes with Willow and Grace to be touching. I hope there is a book from Grace's point of view. Many of the other characters, such as Thatcher's mother Bunny and the members of the Club d'Amour, are so shallow and flaky that they are actually funny, which is a definite plus.The only complaints I have are that we don't really get to know Willow's friend Miguel all that well, and like I said, the story ends in a rushed and confusing way. And Linden's scenes bored me to tears. Oh, and I'm glad that I'm not the only one who noticed how tacky the letters from Annie and Melody are.

You got lots of surprises in this book. So if you didn't read it yet watch out because I may said some of the surprises so don't read more then what I just wrote:)......First I could not beleived Thatcher had cheat on Willow and came up with such a lame excuse, it was so stupid and after they were about to divorce he didn't love her any more or even care for her and even his own daughter, I knew he was a flirt but that bad, I thought he was a bit different then all the snob in Palm Beach but no he his not different. The death of Willow mother Grace was very shocking, I didn't thought she would die, I was so surprise and after that Linden go crazy and lock Willow in her suite and paint the windows all black, let me tell you this book was not a boring one, lots of things happen in it.I was sad to read that Grace die, I like the character of Grace but Willow sometime gets on my nerves, she is too analystic and judge people to fast and she was thinking about getting an abortion because Thatcher had cheat on her, I didn't thought she will thought seriously about something like that, it not like she doesn't have the money to raise a kid and her baby was made out of love, well it was not a rape like her mother had but Grace had kept Linden. Also I could not beleived how Thatcher had change so fast, he had seem to love Willow so much and after that he even consider of telling he had seen her and Linden in bed togheter to make him feel he (Thatcher) was the victim and not Willow, I thought it was so sick and low of him to had consider that, Thatcher make me sick!Well it sure not like the real books of Virginia C.

However most of the book is predictable and the last few chapters felt really rushed. I had hoped that Willow would sort things out with Thatcher as I felt that their relationship could have developed a little futher and also alot more could of happend between Willow and Thatchers family.

I liked how Willow's character was developed to be an intelligent, analytical, skeptical young woman, much different from the bubbly, naive, &quot; i believe in magic&quot; heroines of other VC books. Willow actually had some substance. However, this book seemed way too drawn out and at times, just completely dull. Throughout the book, Willow is taken through the glamourous and corrupt world of the filthy rich. But somehow her life seems completely boring, even with the romantic interludes with Thatcher. I was, however, glad that Thatcher's character turned out the way he did. I never liked him from the first and anticipated that he was holding something back. The whole incest storyline with Linden was nothing short of irritating, and the ending was way too rushed and unrealistic. Thus far the Debeers books have ended with bland, even dreary endings that have left me unsatisfied.

The relatives, lovers, and friends of those who die faceinevitable bereavement. For many, however, the grieving thatfollows death is poorly understood, and hence, poorly handled. ***Thomas Attig's recent book, How We Grieve: Relearning the World(Oxford University Press, 1996), offers a powerfulconceptualization of bereavement and grief, and thus offersimmediate help to those who may have come across only the facilegeneralizations of some of the &quot;death and dying&quot; popularizers,such as Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. ***Thomas Attig is President of the Association for Death Educationand Counseling. In a series of six intertwined essays, each witha slightly different emphasis, he develops his central metaphor:&quot;relearning the world.&quot; Attig argues that bereavement is a&quot;choiceless event&quot;; grieving, by contrast, is full of choices,all of which require tremendous amounts of directed energy.Grieving, in other words, requires that survivors choose torelearn the world. And this relearning--this making of choices--is an active, difficult, and not always successful, process. ***Relearning the world encompasses a frighteningly wide range ofchoices. Attig illustrates these choices through the ingenioususe of a small number of case studies (i.e., concrete instancesof grieving), each of which occurs over and over in variouscontexts as the notion of &quot;relearning&quot; is unpacked and deepened.If you now think of grieving as simply a matter of &quot;feeling sad,&quot;you need this book. ***In less than 200 pages of clean, concrete, sharply focused prose,Thomas Attig illustrates and explains what it means to relearnthe world (i.e., what it means to grieve): 1)We relearn our physical surroundings; 2)We relearn our relationships with our fellow survivors; 3)We relearn our places in space and time; 4)We relearn our spiritual places in the world; 5)We relearn our selves [one entire essay is devoted to grief and personal integrity]; 6) We relearn our relationships with the deceased[another essay is devoted to love, grief, andseparation]. *** The brute reality of death remains, no matter what. No book canprevent bereavement or block the pain of bereavement when it doescome. No book can make grieving easy. No book can remove themystery of life and death. Still, reading does help. ThomasAttig's How We Grieve: Relearning the World may help survivorsthink a bit more clearly about grieving and make more positivechoices as they struggle with their bereavement. *** As a bonus, the book is beautifully printed. I recommend it toyou."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"This is a very, very good book. It helps immensely in understanding why grief can be so difficult and absorbing. It teaches how to be patient and understanding in dealing with grief, our own grief or the grief of others. It offers deep and valuable insights into the many aspects of the grief process--including why the world seems so strange after somebody dies, the importance of stories in grieving, our choice-making in bereavement, the ways we remain connected to a loved one who has died, even why so many of us want to read about grief when we are grieving."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"I was widowed at the age of 29. In the months that followed I read every non-secular grief book that I could find. Attig's was definitely the most helpful book I came across. It repeatedly enforced the point that things had changed beyond my control. It also then pointed out to me what I still had some control over. At a time when I was lost and feeling rather helpless it did a great job of showing me how I wasn't helpless. I gained a lot of motivation for facing the challanges ahead of me from Attig's book, I recommend it to others who's lives have been turned upside down from grief."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Is grief an illness? Are there stages of grief? Does time heal all wounds? For Thomas Attig, the answer to all of these questions is NO! Grief is a process by which one relearns his/her world, a world that has been permanently altered by the death(s) of significant persons in one's life. Using the stories of eleven persons, Attig demonstrates the active nature of grieving. For Attig, the stories are the heart of the matter. The reader is introduced into the stories at the point of the loss experiences. Attig takes us through their coping behaviors as he develops the model of relearning the world; including relearning our selves and our relationships with the deceased. How We Greive is a very special book. It does not simply restate the stages and phases of grief so frequently outlined in like texts. Attig presents a different and important perspective to the understanding of how one copes with the death of a loved one and why grief occurs. Although Attig's book may be perceived as a resource for the professional caregiver, it can motivate all of us to examine the nature of our own relationships and assess our own coping styles and support systems."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"This is a profound and immensely practical work on grief. It is emotionally compelling and deeply moral, with sophisticated epistemological and religious stances. Clearly it's the culmination of twenty years of listening, teaching, and writing on the subject of grief."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Grief is a topic that has been explored only in recent years, with Kubler-Ross getting it all started. Attig brings this topic a step further in discussing not only how we grieve, but in suggesting that in doing so, we must relearn the world. We have lost a loved one and our world has been vastly changed in just a few quick moments. We need to cope, to allow ourselves to grieve, and ultimately to create or &quot;relearn&quot; a world that can never be the same. The wonderful case studies Attig presents are the most helpful in helping the grieving reader to do this important life task. They tell real stories of real people that we can identify with and relate to. They evoke emotional responses that help us grow and believe we too can relearn our world in the face of grieving. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is grieving the loss of a beloved relative or friend, or to those who wish to prepare themselves in advance for the inevitable."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Grief is a topic that has been explored only in recent years, with Kubler-Ross getting it all started.

How often we say, when somebody has died, \\"If there is anything I can do...\\" We're sincere, but usually, after we've prepared a casserole, we feel so helpless to do anything more. Then I discovered \\"How We Grieve: Relearning the World.\\" Since then I've been giving it to bereaved friends. They take comfort that others have shared their experiences. They learn the ways that others have begun putting their lives back together. Several have conveyed to me what reading \\"How We Grieve\\" has meant to them. It gave them a sense of being understood and it provided many useful clues to understanding themselves and discovering how to reengage in the joys and burdens life brings. So, in truth, I no longer say, \\"If there is anything I can do.\\" Instead, perhaps three months after the funeral, I write a heart-felt inscription in a copy of \\"How We Grieve\\" and send it to my friend. I commend the practice for the solace and healing it has provided."},{"Title":"How We Grieve: Relearning the World","review":"Thomas Attig, a former professor of philosophy and recent past-president of the Association for Death Education and Counseling, would like us to believe that he has introduced a new approach to the world of grief counseling, the idea of &quot;relearning the world&quot; after loss. One feels like the target of a salesman as the author repeatedly seeks to convince us why his approach to grief work is unique. The more powerful portions of the book are the real-life stories of grieving that are used to illustrate the ways in which we grieve.It's not that Attig's ideas are off-track or even disputable, but rather that they are not revolutionary. They have been addressed by other writers, though without a catchy name being applied. More importantly, the process of &quot;relearning the world&quot; has been experienced by all who have suffered the debilitating loss of a loved one and eventually found their way back to a life worth living"},{"Title":"Celtic wonder-tales,","review":"I've read many times the celtic tales written by historians or history teachers. However, i've never read those tales in such touching and heartwarming way. Ella Young loved her land, and it notices. From the creation of the world, to the arrival of christianity to Ireland, these celtic tales are lovely to hear and to read. I've read the spanish version (a translation), and even when i know that in the translations some of the original spirit is lost, this doesn't occur with Celtic Wonder Tales. The writing is so simple, direct and beautiful, that the only complaint i could have is that the book is too short.

I work in finance, and am not an engineer. I found this book to be the most clear of the three, and by far the easiest to understand. This book had better diagrams and used better analogies to explain the technology than did the other two books.The book was laid out logically, and did a good job of building on knowledge explained in previous chapters. There were one page summaries at the tale of each chapter, which were helpful in allowing you to either skip or skim the text. The glossary at the end of the book was especially useful, as was the end chapter on future trends within the industry. The book was a quick read, and once I had finished it I felt comfortable engaging in a discussion with people much more accomplished in the field than myself."},{"Title":"Fiber optic reference guide","review":"This book is an excellent resource for getting up to speed on fiber optics quickly. It does a good job at explaining the basics of fiber cables, lasers, modulators, receivers. If you know nothing about fiber optics, you can read this in a weekend and get an overview of most of the field. This book doesn't go into the mathematics or physics much. If that is what you are looking for, then the book isn't what you want. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fiber optic reference guide","review":"This is an excellent overview covering a wide range of fiber optic system-related topics. It is particularly useful for the working engineer, because it covers the basic information succinctly and without complex mathematical analyses. End-of-chapter references point the reader to sources of more detailed information. From the basics of optical waveguides, the operation of passive and active devices, and system design considerations - this guide provides an excellent 'first step' on the path to clear understanding."},{"Title":"Fiber optic reference guide","review":"The best Introduction to fiber optics I have seen so far.

After deciding to make mead I purchased several books on the subject. Many of these were written by wine makers who seemed apologetic for meads \\"inferior\\" quality to grape wines. I found this book refreshing and different. It encouraged me to have fun and make mead that would appeal to my individual taste rather than making a brew to meet someone else's expectations. The methods taught were sanitary and consistent with other books I've read. I was not encouraged to do anything illegal or unsafe. Buy this book. You will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"This book has been described as a &quot;Frothy Pagan Rant&quot; and that's really about on the mark but if you're into that sort of thing it's probably right up your alley. The author is a pagan and a bee keeper so she knows the practical business of making mead right out of the comb. She's also a bit easier to understand than other authors. She includes sample rituals as well as many recipes (including one for pumpkin) and goes a bit into the legal aspects of home brewing. A good book for pagans that want a well-rounded education when it comes to mead. Non-pagans might find it a bit over the top though. Hell, I'm a druid and I think she needs to take a chill pill too."},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"I like this book and found the recipes and technical details useful; readers fearing to be put off by jargon will find comfort with the writer's cheerful folksy style.But it pains me to find a reference to &quot;King Arthur and his Knights Templar&quot; (an anachronism of no more than 1600 years) on the first page (xiii, actually) and a statement that &quot;honey ferments naturally&quot; on p. 3. She does go on later to say that honey must be diluted to allow the yeast to work; I know these are trifling details, but for me they cast a dubious light on the rest of the ritual and traditional material. I really want a word with the editor; I like the book and I am happy to refer to it when I start brewing."},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"Sure there are alot of Pagan overtones to this book, but I don't mind that at all. This author does a good job of explaining many historical things about Mead. She has experience harvesting her own honey, and offers several tips on how to make mead. Although I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is a beginner, it is a good book to round out your mead making library."},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"We were new to brewing mead and picked up this book to give us some insight into where to start. Not only have we had success with every recipe from this book that we have tried, her hints on fixing problems helped us save several batches of recipes from other sources. Like the reviewer above, cleanliness isn't pushed here... but as in all cooking, it is necessary and common sense. In the last two years we and our friends have brewed up over 200 gallons of various kinds of mead and malomels and enjoyed them all thanks to this book."},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"YES!! This book is well worth any price. It is am easy read, with entertaining images and catch phrases. Of the 5 mead books we bought, this one is by far our favorite. Though we have yet to taste the bounties from the knowledge we gained from this book, we were able to breeze through the purchasing our mead kit and the first batch with ease!"},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"I refer to this book every time I make mead.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Mad About Mead: Nectar of the Gods","review":"If you're not a pagan, and are looking for a concise guidebook for making mead, then this book probably isn't for you. The first five chapters are dedicated to &quot;historical&quot; uses of Mead, whose accuracy is somewhat dubious, and which I found to be a waste of paper and my time. The last half of the book has some unique recipes and a general description of the process to make mead, but the author seems to have a blas&eacute; attitude about keeping things clean. Other more definitive books on general wine-making practices have stated however that cleanliness is the cardinal rule in making wine. And again, the process descriptions are riddled with unnecessary pagan inuendos and catch phrases.Excluding cleanliness, the overall processes described in the book are sound, and the information is useful, but it's no more than what you'd get from a more focused book on wine making, and other books on the market get to the point quicker. Also, after following the author's advice on acidity levels, all I successfully made was battery acid.And finally, the author indirectly advocates the distilling of mead. She does state that it's technically illegal, but there's nothing technical about it. In chapter 12, under the heading &quot;Stuck Fermentation&quot;, she says you can use &quot;shock therapy&quot; to fix a batch of mead of 8 percent alcohol content (or greater). What she calls shock therapy, the boys at ATF would call distilling, and that's illegal. Originally I'd stated it's illegal for health reasons. After further research, turns out it's just a last vestage of prohibition that's never been repealed, and now never will be. The reader may do as he or she wishes, but the author should have been a little clearer as to the true nature of what is involved.In closing, this book might make a good companion to a more serious book on wine making, but as a primary source of information, it just doesn't measure up."},{"Title":"The landmark history of the American people from Plymouth to Appomattox","review":"This is a great book to read with your children.

Eli Smith with the help of the Lebanese scholars B. Albustani and poet N. Al-Yazgi, no effort was made to modernise the hard to understand outdated arabic. The Anglican publishing house printed an Arabic Lexicon to explain the uncommon Arabic words.How unique is this edition?Very unique indeed. The Jesuits revised the Newtestament in 1969 after almost 100 years, and the old Testament from 1980 to 1988. The Bible Society wanted one translation accepted by the vast majority of orthodox, mainly Coptic and evangelically active minority.Here comes the Orthodox Church tradition: the Controlling authority of the Septuagint and the wider Alexandrine Canon. Athanasius rule to the Catholic Church, detailed in his Pascal letter 367, still applicable in the Coptic Church of Alexandria. The only difference is the sequence. The Catholic epistles are followed by the Pauline letters.An Arabic Study Bible?Sure, and a genuinely good annotated Bible, that avoids dictating dogmatic influenced interpretations, with simply commonly agreed footnotes, of scholarly proven facts, explanations and comments. Four colored maps and two indicative sketches, are helpful tools for all students, together with general introduction and brief introductions for each book.An ecumenical effort for Bible translation into modern Arabic coordinated by the ever active Bible society in the Middle East. Maronite Catholic scholarship (mainly society of Jesus), hand in hand with the continious efforts of the evangelical missions, and participation of some lay Orthodox concluded this monumental work.Translation principles and rules:So beautiful is the statement of faith &quot;Throughout history, Bible scholars labored with great erudite and hard work to recover and preserve the original text unblemished&quot; The goal was ultimately rendering in Middle Eastern Arabic speakers a simple modern Arabic language understood by a wide spectrum readership. The word to word translation was avoided in favor of the dynamic equivalent given that translation from Hebrew to Arabic is more expressive due their Semitic brotherhood.Starting with the best available Hebrew text (Stuttgart: 1968-76),with reference to Aramaic (Syriac) whenever needed. As for the New Testament translation (4th edn.,1994) Koine (Old Greek) the used text was UBS 3, and Nestle Alland no 26.Two Arabic Bible Versions:The Bible society has chosen to produce two editions, the full Alexandrine Canon used by the majority Orthodox of the Orient and a minority Roman Unite Churches. A shorter edition ( 'mutilated' in the words of F. Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury), without O.T. Apocrypha, for the minority born again brothers.

While Ken's book is a great read, this book goes into more depth on demonic influences and forces in our lives. Using this book and the Word, you can combat the evil one with the utmost confidence and authority.The Church has given up a lot of authority to the devil. I have often asked the Lord, \\"Where is the authority that was given to Ken Hagin, Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, Smith Wigglesworth and the other great men of faith?\\" I felt the Lord telling me that HE never changes, and the Word has not changed. Man is the one that changes. He also told me that if the church did not do anything about the devil, nothing would be done. Jesus delegated his authority to the church before his ascension to the throne. We have the responsibility to use that authority against the enemy.If we are to do the works that Jesus said we would do (for example, when was the last time the dead were raised in the church except at noon?), then we need to change some things. This book will help us (the church) do just that. It is time we take authority over the enemy and make our churches a place of deliverance and refuge where EVERYONE can find help in time of need.Remember that God is not a respecter of persons, AND he is not a man that he can lie, AND he is faithful who has promised.

I needed that spur to more action. Yet the author keeps our focus on the Lord Jesus Christ, not on \\"spiritual warfare,\\" and I know how important it is to keep our focus on Him, our beloved Savior, and depend on Him to direct us as to when and how we should engage in spiritual battle rather than leading ourselves into the battles.

So if you know an adult who would love a &#34;personal story&#34; view on history, this might be a good fit."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable book, Dogeaters provides a fascinating view of Filipino culture under the Marcos regime. Hagedorn attempts to define and give an understanding of Filipino identity, how it is constructed on an individual level as well as on a national level. While reading the book, one comes to understand the problematic nature of living under a dictatorial regime by witnessing a multitude of characters escaping into the fantasy worlds created by drug use, a romance with the West (especially movies), and sleep.While the book can be a difficult read at times, this struggle seems intentional. Hagedorn presents the reader with a fragmented novel, one told by multiple narrators (at times it is unclear who exactly is the narrator), one without a disjointed plot progression, and one replete with a dizzying cast of characters and events. It is through these difficulties that one may face in understanding character relations and plot that Hagedorn allows the reader to identify with the Filipino people. Citizens of the Philippines in the middle of the twentieth century faced profound hardships in the construction of identity. So too may readers of Hagedorn's novel find it difficult to identify with characters in the book, the events in the book, and the very nature of Filipino culture as expressed in the book.Overall this book is an engaging read, providing both entertainment and enlightenment for the reader. One comes to a greater understanding of what may be called the Neo-colonialism of the West, or the imperialistic subjection of a people to the consumerism, materialism, and capitalism that so dominate the culture of the West. Furthermore, one sees that indigenous culture often falls prey to these influences. I highly recommend Dogeaters to any reader, but note that it would have to be given an \\"R\\" rating were it a movie, so reader beware!"},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"Dogeaters, by Jessica Hagedorn, is an exploratory look at Phillipene culture. Set during the Ferdinand Marcos reign, the book focuses on the stories of many, seemingly unrelated, characters from all facets of life. Though the story does not come together as cleanly at the end as an Agatha Christie piece, the characters lives are interwoven enough to give the reader some sense of closure at the books conclusion. Disjunction, as mentioned, is the basic theme of the book. We have no consistent source of narration, as Hagedorn employs third and first person POV's throughout the book, giving her reader an intended sense of confusion about whose story it is that we are reading what the point of it is. Through the use of several points of view, and the use of made-up news articles, and of course the many different characters, Hagedorn gives us a sense of the confusion and separation that the Phillipene people experienced during this tumultuous time. We are meant to see the ways in which the nation reacted to the end of colonialism and the rise of a dictatorship, we are given a picture of a country searching for some sort of identity. An example of the disjunction apparent within the text would be the stories of Rio and Joey. Rio, the closest thing we have to a main character, is the daughter of a wealthy employee of the richest man in the Phillipenes. Her life is contrasted throughout the book with that of Joey, a male prostitute/drug addict, who is trying to survive in continuous near poverty conditions. It is interesting to say the least. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in untypical and exploratory novels. It is and engaging read, and is interesting enough to keep most anybody's attention. It might be frustrating to people who enjoy plot driven stories however, because what makes Dogeaters work is the vividness of its characterizations."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"First: yes, this is somewhat fragmented-- there are multiple points-of-view and the style changes with the characters. I guess it is postmodern, but that term is so offputting to most readers these days that I use it reluctantly. It's really no more difficult to follow than the postmodern techniques we're all used to with dream-sequences and flashbacks on such shows as &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;Second: the writing is sure of itself, a tour de force.Third: the subject-- Manila and the Philippines in troubling times-- is, in a sense, the true protagonist.Summary? It took me a long time to get through this, but that is more a reflection of me than it is a rebuke on the book. I admired it greatly and was often struck by the insights, the writing, the intimacy with all the people in the society-- from senators and society people to male prostitutes. Because I have little time to read, I prefer novels to short stories (i.e., a longer story I can pick-up and put-down over the course of a few weeks) and in some respects this was almost more like reading thematically related short stories.Because of my own limited time to read, I would forget some of the subtle clues connecting the chapters.The book would benefit from a different kind of reading. But it has an almost Tolstoyan scope to it.There is some amazing writing here-- much of it is very funny. It is often poignant and always, always very very vivid."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! While some may complain that Hagedorn's Dogeaters is too fractured to enjoy, I found this fragmentation an asset to Hagedorn's overall message. Through this fragmentation, Hagedorn illustrates that fractured identity that Phillipinos have struggled with throughout history. The Phillipines has never had a strong national identity, and Hagedorn illustrates this beautifully through her many plot twists. Hagedorn also shows that because of this lack of identity, life has become virtually unbearable in the Phillipines, and as a result people resort to many forms of escapism. This can be seen through the frequent use of drug use, and the idolization of public figures. Hagedorn also shows the strong destructive influence of the west, and capitalism, into Phillipino society.However, a word of warning before reading this book: While the fractured plot definitly serves a purpose, it is quite confusing. The many characters seen with no introduction can be quite confusing. However, if you're up for a challenge, Dogeaters is a profound, enlightening, yet disturbing, read!"},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"People condemned colonialism as being the exploitation of one country by another. The dominant power sucked the resources out of the weaker one, paying only a little back in terms of some technology and a semblance of law and order. But I think now we have realized that that economic bloodsucking was only one of the evils of the imperial experience. More subtle, but maybe longer lasting, was the degrading of the self among the dominated. The ruled felt powerless, they felt their whole culture had failed them and offered nothing of a future, while the West (almost always the dominating powers) remained glamorous, powerful, sexy, and almost unreachable. The dominated peoples shucked off their traditions, rejected their pasts, and tried to become Western. If this is only partly true, it is truer of the elites, who could aspire to local power if they mimicked the real rulers. In the post-colonial era some countries adopted Western institutions to benefit themselves, while others took only the outward forms of the West and used them in corrupt ways. If these remarks hold any relevance to post-colonial society, they are even more true of the Philippines, where America held out a vision of \\"Americanization\\"---democracy, education, and pop culture---which could not be delivered in reality in a Southeast Asian peasant society that had lived under loose Spanish control for over 350 years before the Yanks arrived.DOGEATERS is an achingly realistic portrait of Manila society, where nobody wants to be what they are and everyone wants to be somebody else. Identity comes from trashy Hollywood and Manila movies, soap opera is life. The shopping-obssessed elite rejects everything in their own land. The demi-monde leers around every corner. Phoneyness is next to godliness. The riffraff rule. Everyone survives on the edge. Marginal men become mainstream. Snowy Christmas scenes and \\"Jingle Bells\\" greet a holiday, but it's all \\"out there\\" somewhere; Manila remains hot and humid, home to a Malayo-Polynesian tradition that is walled off and laughed at by the would-be foreigners that dwell in the vast city. Imelda Marcos, a character in the book, collects her shoes and puts up huge \\"cultural\\" monuments that commemorate herself. She has no clue about and no sympathy for the problems of her nation. A thinly-disguised Benigno Aquino gets assassinated and everyone betrays everyone else. Everyone turns out to be marginal in the end.DOGEATERS starts off in a brilliant way. The first two thirds of the book is exciting and insightful. If you have ever read Vargas Llosa or Lobo Antunes, you will not find Hagedorn at all difficult. Changing narrators and jumping back and forth is part of post-modern literature. Hey, what's so new about that ? I am not at all Filipino, though I have visited that country. OK, I didn't understand most of the Tagalog words tossed into the text without explanation, but you get the sense even so. In the last third, however, the author runs out of ideas. She can't keep up the momentum created through her intense, accurate description of certain classes of Filipino society. The story becomes diffuse and kind of limps across the finish line like \\"American Graffiti\\". Still, for anyone who fancies a novel that really opens up a culture quite neglected and unknown in the West, DOGEATERS is a must read."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"Hagedorn's take on my country is eye-opening, witty, and true. We read the book for a student forum in Wesleyan University, and we could not stop talking. Topics like power, post-colonialism, Filipinos' penchant for movies and pageantry, historical narratives, and the Philippines' &quot;halo-halo&quot;-ness were brought up and talked about earnestly. Everyone, including those who are not of Filipino descent, enjoyed the book's juiciness and intelligence. READ THIS BOOK! It's one of those books (like Master and Margarita)that you can read again and again and still come off with something entirely new. If Jessica Hagedorn would visit our university, I would graduate happy."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"If you liked the movie MAGNOLIA you will love this book. Intertwining the lives of fourteen (sometimes seemingly unrelated) characters, author Jessica Hagedorn weaves a narrative portrait of Marcos-era Philippines with bold images of sex, drugs, dreams, and corruption. Readers take a ride with characters like pretty boy prostitute Joey Sands who sleeps his days away and gets high all night with wealthy johns he picks up at the gay disco. In just pages, Hagedorn switches gears with a look into the lives of adolescent, sexually-repressed girls Rio and Pucha Gonzaga. And interspersed with these plots Hagedorn shares telling clips from the fictional METRO MANILA DAILY and CELEBRITY PINOY; or interviews with The First Lady; or sexcapades of moviestar Lolita Luna; and the list goes on...the reader better keep up with the pace... The effect of this collage style is an overall cinematic and surrealistic quality in the novel. Movies and dreams, which are the &quot;opiates of the people,&quot; underscore the book's escapist theme. The one fault of the book, however, is that it is not a movie. A reader should know before taking the plunge that the &quot;escapism,&quot; so well explored in this novel, is for the characters only. DOGEATERS demands a lucid, careful reader for full appreciation. This is no brain candy."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"I had to read &quot;Dogeaters&quot; for my American Literature class during my sophmore year of college. Usually when I have to read for class I get bored very easily, but this book completely astounded me for so many reasons. It is a frank and honest description of the Philippines during the Marcos era. The characters, particularly Rio Gonzago and Joey Sands are believeable and frankly portrayed both in negative and positive lights. I was particularly impressed by the way that Joey was portrayed. It is not often that an author's main character is a sympathetic, homosexual, drug-addicted, male prostitute. Yet the reader feels that he is a real person telling his story to those who would pick up the book. Though the final few chapters became a little hard to follow at first, I read the book at least five times, both straight through and also just passages, and finally developed a sense of what was going on. &quot;Dogeaters&quot; is one of the few books that I loved so much that I actually lent it to someone to read."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I am Filipino, but have very little knowledge of what life in the Philippines is like, so in many respects this novel breaks new ground for me (although I did recognize much of the Tagalog that Hagedorn uses). That being said, I have to say that this book moves beyond being easily categorized as a transculturation text or something that simply received press because of its introduction of Filipino culture to the American populace (much in the same way that Alvarez and Garcia wrote books that could not be dismissed as simply being Latino-American fiction produced for an ethnic-hungry reading population). The style reminds me of the book \\"Twelve\\" in its fast paced movements and I especially liked the way the storylines of all of the characters had a way of intersecting with one another. I loved reading about Joey's character and also liked the way Hagedorn discusses a major problem with many Asian cultures - the problems of navigating the way with which Western culture bleeds into almost every facet of society. Hagedorn writes vivid descriptions of characters struggling with and enjoying the way Western entertainment has become the norm.Problems with the novel? I guess one major concern is the over-emphasis on explaining what makes a Filipino a Filipino and the constant explanation of every little tidbit of Filipino culture. The way she uses language is well-done and people can understand the Tagalog without any translations, so I wish she had chosen to take a step back and not necessarily explain every cultural tidbit she thought a non-Filipino would not know. If that's what someone wanted they would have purchased a sociology textbook.In the end, this is an entertaining read that does a good job of playing with narrative forms."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"Dogeaters is a dizzying whirlwind slice of Filipino life. Jessica Hagedorn's post-modern, at times surreal, story is interesting not so much for the characters but the form and structure of her storytelling. Using a mix of points of view, interlacing traditional prose with play dialogue and songs (the kundiman), the fast paced narrative is at times breathlessly exciting- at its worst, it is overwhelming. The book's emphasis on style comes at the cost of an engaging storyline or fully realized characters- none of whom you completely understand or emphatize with. Ms. Hagedorn, with some ingenuity, does manage to illustrate a society caught between two worlds- the colonial, the post-colonial, the East, the West- and people who, despite being connected by sanguine relations (mothers, fathers, the family unit, ancestry, etc.) are more connected by media and technology- a people in love with the glamour of the movies- even though though their own lives, mired in poverty, violence, empty wealth, corruption- is the very stuff that movies are made of. The richest man in the country, the President and First Lady, a hustler/junkie connect via the movies. Daring and gutsy. (I especially liked the allusions to &quot;dog-eating.&quot; Everyone is suspicous of everyone- the nightclub owner looks down on his busyboy because he thinks he eats dogs, the department store clerk thinks that the barbecue she buys from the roadside vendor is not cowmeat but dogmeat. Funny and true- I think that Ms.Hagedorn captures the suspicion and hypocrisy and self doubt and defeatism (she still keeps eating there...)that pervades Filipino culture, or any culture, under foreign influence and/or dictatorial rule."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"The whole idea of the postmodern novel has been rather disintegrated in this book. Hagedorn makes it seem as if giving a slice of life can never reconcile with an actual plot. If anyone has read Salman Rushdie or Marquez, that is obviously untrue. For the other folks, I'm truly sorry you haven't read anything worthwhile written in the past 30 years. In the end the entire theme of coming to age has been hastily written in the last thirty or so pages and everything else before was simple background to the terrible life that most of the characters experienced. If you want something thats almost strikingly similar in style and statire to this novel, read Ishmael Reed's phenominal Mumbo Jumbo."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"i thought this book would be interesting. instead, it was too intertwined with daydreams, multiple plots and different characters. it was difficult to read and hard to stay focused."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"This is a genuinely good book. However, I must say that it requires a dedicated reader. There are many characters and sometimes the story line can be confusing. It is definitely not the type of book that you would want to start reading one week and finish reading next month. No, I would recommend that you read this entire novel within a short period of time so that you can experience the richness that the text can provide without becoming lost in trying to remember who was who.The novel is a clear demonstration of just how far the tentacles of American consumerism and materialism can reach. Hagedorn depicts these characters with a criticism of contemporary Philippine lifestyles in mind, at least in my opinion. This also works for the average person who is into brand names and movie stars and who really needs to just get a life."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"I know I was supposed to love this book, but I couldn't finish it. It's fragmented and difficult to read."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"The Dogeaters, what a name for a book. It makes you wonder what it is about. You will probably think it's about people who eats dogs but it is actually about a girl faced with a serious problem. What problem?, I will not tell you it is up to you to find out. So, I will just keep you wondering, but I recommend that you go and read this book. And then you will find out the great ordeal this girl had to face."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"I read this book beacuse of all the good reviews. But I ended up being very disappointed. As a Filipina, I feel that this book gives a very negative portrayal of the people in the Philippines. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"I read Dogeaters by Jessica Hagedorn for a report I have do for English class. I thought it would be helpful and give me different looks on Filipino society, I was wrong.This book was extremely hard to follow. Within the plot were a bunch of little ones, it was hard to keep track of which characters went where. Also Hagedorn used the language of the Filipinos in her book, so often I was very confused about what people were saying.The most disturbing part of this book was the cover. When I bought the book I figured I would recieve it with a cover such as the one pictured, but instead I got this awful picture of a woman on a cross holding a head and a sword, with a child in her womb. The whole thing was very disturbing and I was forced to put my own cover on the book.Overall I would not reccommend this book, unless you're up for a challenging confusing story line, and if you want it for a report on Filipino culture, pick another book."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"Hagedorn's noteworthy novel presents a story of the Philippines through a Baroque layering of interconnected plots, as the many characters swirl around in the urban landscape of Manila. As some posters have complained, the plot can be confusing because of the many interconnections. In addition to the many characters, the novel is at times overwhelming because it is so filled with named things: imported foods identified by their national origins, references to Hollywood actors and pop culture figures from both the US and the Philippines, and places in the Philippines. The density of this short novel deliberately challenges the reader to follow along by figuring out the plots' interconnections and the many cultural references. For those who aren't willing to meet the novel half way, it certainly would be easy to become lost or bored. In certain ways, I would compare this novel to the experience of entering a virtual world in which the reader has the freedom to explore a different reality. The reader's job is to engage and connect all the people and things to be found there. It is an effort worth making."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"Unfortunately Jessica Hagedorn's book illustrates one of the primary problems in developing a novel that has the potential to be mainstream but falls short because of the need for readers to understand a generally foreign culture outside of the 7000+ islands of which the Philippines is made up of. As a Filipino who was born in the Philippines grew up in America, if it wasn't for my parents' being hell bent on teaching me the history and culture of our country, I probably would've hated this book.This is not a book I would recommend to those unfamiliar with the history during and right after American occupation of the islands and for those who don't at least have a small grasp on the colloquialisms which perpetrate the Filipino language. Also, her style of writing in which chapters go from one character's perspective to another can be confusing and took a few chapters for me to become accustomed to and may be a turnoff for some readers. It is, however, one of the few novels by Filipino-Americans written about Filipinos that can be readily obtained in the US and I would recommend it to younger generations who are interested in learning more about a culture that continues to struggle with its identity due to the colonialism and imperialism that lasted centuries."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"In any case -- I give it all five stars on account of the almost comical portrayal of familiar (to a Filipino) personages. Ms. Hagedorn is obviously what we term here as &quot;burgis&quot; -- the picture she paints of the impoverished characters in the book would raise an eyebrow in Manila. The character Joey Sands, for instance, was a street urchin and petty thief -- and later a street hustler -- yet he is a favorite dj in the hottest Manila club? That just doesn't happen here. In this country -- everything is about connections, connections, connections -- and I didn't see his (Joey's) claim to the city's inclusion into the moneyed set.Certainly it wasn't on &quot;Uncle&quot;s credentials.
