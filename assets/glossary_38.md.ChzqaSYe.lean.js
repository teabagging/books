Bradbury has a gift for descriptions, and he makes a wonderful story even better through his use of language. A future civilization has banned books, and it's the firemen's job to burn any books people have hidden, and the houses in which they are concealed. Guy Montag is a fireman who has done his job for ten years, never questioning the pleasure of seeing books burned and consumed by flames. Then he meets a girl who shows him that life is not all burning and speeding. She shows him that if you take the time, life has a deeper meaning. He begins to question the burning of all the books he never had time to read and understand. He is driven by a madness to find out what the books say. Unfortunately, he'll have to break a few laws and give up the life which he's lived for so long. He has to make a choice between the illegal life he never knew and the ignorant life as a fireman."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having first heard of Bradbury after reading The Martian Chronicles, I immediately fell in love with his writing and was itching to read Fahrenheit since I had heard so many good things about it.The brilliant novel was better than I thought. What took me the most was the sheer realism of such a strange world. I could feel the pain and fear the characters endured throughout the story as the infamous \\"burning of books\\" took lives and houses. I really got the sense that books were as taboo (let alone illegal) as narcotics are today.The edition I read included an afterward by Bradbury reflecting upon his own story after about 20 years. I was impressed that he felt that he wouldn't have changed much if he had the chance. This was but another bulletpoint in my list of reasons to have such high respect for this acclaimed author. Fahrenheit 451 was a fantastic read and I encourage everyone to read it, especially sci-fi fans and librarians :)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a book I had always meant to read - so when a 16 yr old I know had to read it for class I read it too. It's a quick, entertaining read. Nothing earth-shattering for adults, but I can see why it's recommended for high school (or even middle school) kids."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my new all time favorites. While this author has some problems with his interpretation of our society as seen from his point of view 50 years ago, his language, full of metaphors, couldn't be more beautiful. As the song says, \\"If a picture paints a thousand words...\\" This author can paint a picture with a few of the right choice of words."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is my favorite book--I have read it three times! Consequently, Ray Bradbury is my favorite author. His style of writing is so captivating. I would, however, say that this book seems to me to be an acquired taste. I LOVE it, but a few of my friends don't like it at all. I think you need to have a certain maturity to read it. When my stepdad first introduced it to me, I was probably still in middle school. I gave up on it after reading the first 20 or so pages--I just didn't get it. A few years later, I picked it up again, understood every word and idea, and loved it!I recommend this book to friends and many of them say, \\"Oh, that book? It's so weird.\\" But you'd be surprised; when you read it, it's almost like looking into a mirror of our world's future. It really makes you think--is this where we're headed?Buy it. I can't guarantee you'll like it the first time you read it, but give it a chance. If you want great literature, this is it! And check out some other Ray Bradbury books and short stories too; I highly recommend them!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a must-read book in many ways. Written in 1953, the author was able to predict (in some fashion) the coming of Cable TV, personal music devices, and non-stop urban violence. Bradbury was a prophet.The object of Bradbury's wrath is intellectual sloth, which, left unchecked, results in censorship and a barbarous society where everyone acts on impulse. The author does not merely elevate the importance of books while trashing the influence of media: he elevates the importance of ideas, of thought. Bradbury condemns careless reading as easily as he condemns mindless television. Nor does he find electronic media to be useless: Bradbury's Professor Faber admits that film, music and television can make important contributions to society, when the individual films, songs and programs convey coherant ideas. The Clarisse character further emphasizes the importance of ideas by exploring the arts of conversation and observation.This is an excellent book which defines education, and shows the consequences of an uneducated society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a 190 page, high action novel, written by Ray Bradbury. The plot is about a man named Guy Montag, who is a Fireman. Only in his days, firemen aren't the same as they are now. This book is set in the future, and Montag didn't fight fires, he started them. He lives in days where books are prohibited. The government and the media control everything and everybody. People aren't allowed to read so that they can't be smart and don't know reality. Everybody in his society owns a parlor. A parlor is a huge TV that covers an entire wall of a house. Montag has a wife named Mildred, who lets the parlor get the best of her. At first, Montag loved his job and actually got joy out of watching books burn. His job takes a big turn after watching an elderly woman burn in her house for her books. He also took a book from her house and asks an old friend to help him come up with a plan to eliminate the firemen. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes action, and likes a little challenge in his or her reading.Ray Bradbury has great characterization for each character. Montag is definitely the protagonist is this story because he understands what is wrong, and he wants to fix it so that nobody else is hurt from these firemen. The antagonists are the firemen and the government. The government is what created this illiterate, controlled society, and the firemen are what keep it like this. The great characterization helps the reader a lot, because when new names are mentioned, you're not clueless on whom they are. You know a little background on everybody and their relationship to the main character, Montag.I think the theme of the book is: \\" Even if it's just you against the world, always fight for what is right.\\" This is the theme because others are afraid to stand up to authority, but Montag isn't because he knows his good cause. He realized he was wrong for so long, and he then chose the right side; and he' willing to fight for the people that are scared to.The language is very understandable. The author does use figurative language so the story is more intriguing. He uses great imagery to explain different settings people, and things. The author's language and style are very effective because while reading, you can actually visualize everything going on. The author's style is unique because his descriptions are like no other. His words allow the reader to actually experience what Montag does, which is what makes the story so rich.The point of view changes from time to time. At times it is told in third person with dialogue, and at others, it is in first person. It's great to have different point of views because you get different perspectives on situations. When told in first person, advantages are you know Montag's feelings and thoughts. When it is in third person, you get a full overview. The tone also changes. It can be emotional or very action filled. When Montag expresses himself the tone gets emotional and calmer, but when there's lots of commotion it gets more hectic and dramatic.The story's conflict is with Montag and his surroundings. The type of conflict is person vs. society. The plot definitely thoroughly explains the conflict with background on how it started, and possible resolutions.Fahrenheit 451 is a great novel to read. It teaches us how lucky we are to have freedom in what we want to do. It also shows people that are very kept to themselves, to rise and let their voices be heard. It also helps us appreciate books more and embrace our intelligence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"of the future (and, boy, is it *not* pretty!).For all Americans' talk about how they don't trust anything they see on TV, they sure do parrot what they see as fact time and again: They talk about characters in soap operas as if they were real family members (like the \\"families\\" of the parlor walls in the book), they trust what Fox News throws out as fact every day of the week (shades of the book, again), and things have improved so much in this country that years ago there had to be an entire cable channel created to accomodate the insatiable appetite for 24/7 celebrity news.Oh, how Ray Bradbury was a visionary way back in 1953.Upon television's advent in the late-1940's and increasing popularity in the 1950's, it was often referred to as the \\"boob tube\\" and that would be a vast understatement nowadays. I think it's pretty much safe to say that the tube's executives have run out of fresh, original ideas, hence the bombardment of mindless \\"reality\\" TV shows (where everything is, surprise, scripted). Americans also think it's perfectly fine for these televangelists to scream about what a bunch of losers we are but if we fork up thousands of dollars to them, we'll be saved. (That's gotten so out of control that there are a few cable channels devoted to that junk.)And now we're back to mindless soap operas such as \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" The cycle of mindlessness just goes on and on.I read the 50th anniversary edition of Fahrenheit 451 and at the very end of the book, someone conducted an interview with Bradbury who said that there are no forms of censorship in this country because, \\"We have too many groups for censorship to be possible.\\"The reality is the exact opposite.The majority of these \\"groups\\" actively encourage censorship when what's being said either affects their agenda or when they just plain don't like the statement. Too bad the interviewer didn't ask Ray to explain the recent record/cd crushings (today's answer to burning) of Sinead O'Connor or the Dixie Chicks (these happening in the past 15 years alone), when they made statements that certain groups didn't like.The worst example of censorship is happening everyday right in front of our faces with the Iraq \\"war,\\" where the puppets in the US media say whatever the Pentagon instructs them to say. Want to get the truth about what's going on over there? You'll have to tune in to international news outlets. But do that before Bush appoints his right-wing friends on the board of PBS to stop the BBC World News and other international news from being shown over here.Finally, there are a few things that were written way back in 1953 but which have turned into proof-positive fact in America 2005. Coming from the character of Fire Chief Beatty:Page 60: \\"The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That's why we've lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're almost snatching them from the cradle.\\" Translation: A child is to be incorporated into a mass consumer from birth, not because the country's power structure want your children to be smarter.Page 61: \\"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a *sense* of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.\\"Hey, Beatty, you forgot political science."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I remember seeing the movie based on this book with Oskar Werner and Julie Christie when I was a teenager and discussing it with my teachers. As you read the book many similarities can be seen today, such as large billboards, people not talking to each other, a society dependent on drugs and entertainment and reality TV shows and of course the rushing around in a rat race.Whats amazing is that Ray Bradbury wrote this book in 1953 some 50 plus years ago and unlike the book 1984 written by George Orwell this book is ignored by the media and pessimists of todays society and our future.For those you like science fiction with a large dose of reality please read this book before you die from drinking the Kool-Aid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, a good friend has been recommending it for some time. I must say that it took me a little longer than I thought it would to read. The language for me was little hard to follow at times. Some of it was so chopped up that I would have to go back and reread the page over to try and understand the message of that page.I thought that the themes themselves were very prevalent to our day. I am finding that more and more that children are unwilling to read and want to play video games or go on the internet. The idea of how books are slowing being eradicated is spot on in current events. I really liked the message of how knowledge will set you free, and the good, and bad that can come from it. (As the snake said to eve, you will be like a God.) I also liked his idea of the TV walls and how it clouds the mind with loud noises and bright colors. I found that to be very interesting, especially with the outburst of 42\\" TVs and all the crave for the latest gadgets. I find it very ironic that Amazon is out with their new product Kindle. No offense to them but I do not support that item.One thing that I did notice was that as I was reading it reminded me a lot of \\"The Giver\\" by Louis Lowery. I know that The Giver was written afterword but I actually liked that book more that his. I also understand that it was more meant for children, but think that the ideas presented in her book, almost paralleling Bradbury's book, were very well written and thought out. I also thought that her book was simply just a little more easy to read.Either way, this still was an excellent book, with a lot of different issues that I think have a love of prevalence in our current status. If you liked Bradbury's book, I would greatly recommend The Giver."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Good read!The most amazing part of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is that it was first written in 1950. Wow! That blows me away, a futuristic book written 58 years ago that in many ways is was right on.The characters and story are excellent. Some of the writing in the book, I found to be difficult to grasp. Alot of intense dialogue between the main characters, several times, I wasn't quite sure who was talking to who.Overall, a very good book, I look forward to reading some of Ray Bradbury's other classics!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451. 451 is the temperature at which paper burns. How did we find this out? Learning, and with learning comes books, and according to this story with books comes burning. This story follows one man, one guy actually. Guy Montag is a fireman. However not the definition of fireman of which you think. This is a world where the past is burnt and all is forgotten and minorities are eliminated. Books are for burning and your family is all on a T.V. wall. People die and nobody cares. Nothing matters as long as people are happy. Houses are fireproof and books are the exact opposite. I really liked this book. Bradbury's book shows our own flaws as well as those to come. Montag's fire captain, Beatty, tells him how the firemen got started, \\"\`Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to popular songs [1] or the name of state capitals [2] or how much corn Iowa grew last year [3].'\\" We have all of the game shows. 1. Don't forget the lyrics. 2. Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader. 3. Jeopardy. This book was written in the 50's. Over 50 years later (almost 60), this is beginning to form. I hope that this does not happen. For if it does, who knows what we will lose next. Will it be our real families? Our front porches? Our books? Our identity? This book is very controversial. It's ironic that every one in this book is anti controversial and don't ask questions and yet this book brings up so many questions. It also makes you question yourself and what you think. With all of this technology being brought into our world, we're not against it but we don't hate it. With all of the new innovations by the time we buy something it's already obsolete. When you buy a computer in a few weeks they all ready have an updated version. Sometime its just nice to stop and smell the roses.

Did it freak you out?\\" And yet, is the \\"Farenheit 451\\" of our cultural stereotype all that accurate? Yes, Bradbury's world is a distressing one, but the story itself is, in the end, about perserverance, about the human love of knowledge, and about how a group of people lives to fight against a world that doesn't want to know. As Montag, or \\"Ecclesiastes,\\" discovers, there are still things worth fighting for. And while we may cringe every time a Chesterton slides into the incinerator, the true meaning of the book lies in Montag's determination to save some knowledge from that incinerator.Is it a distressing setting? Yes, of course. As some of the other reviewers have said, that often is because it's far closer to the truth than we would like. But, of course, that's the reason Bradbury wrote the book. But under all that is a story of hope; a story that, if we dig just deep enough, can empower us to face the danger and the distress and to let us prevent \\"Farenheit 451\\" from being a nonfiction book.So the one thing you should know if you're not sure you want to read \\"451\\" is that it's not \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Not by a long shot. In the end--and with Bradbury's writing, you will get there fast--it is a distressing world, but a heartwarming story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I chose to read Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" for a High School Book Report. I thought the fact that so many of the ideas portrayed in the book by Bradbury are still very relevant today was fascinating. The book was published in the 1950's, yet Bradbury's ideas about the influence of of media and its effect on society are evident today. Society as a whole has had its general thought process effected (to some extent at least) by the media with ideas portrayed in ad campaigns or television shows, which make decisions for you instead of letting you develop some of these ideas on your own.Another theme that the book does well is representing the effect of censorship on society. The protagonist of the story, Guy Montag, begins the book oblivious of his own ignorance towards the world around him, not changing until a thoughtful teenage girl (Clarisse) causes him to question why everything is the way it is. These questions lead Montag down a path to enlightenment in which Montag discovers the reality of an unaware society. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" does a superb job of displaying the harmful effects censorship can cause: a society of robotic citizens who find ignorance more attractive than actually exploring life.Another reason I enjoyed reading this book was the fact it was very thoughtful and left a lot of different ideas open for interpretation. The book did seem a little bit dry at times, but it was not a bad transition because it allowed for time to interpret a few of the many ideas presented in the novel. I thought that \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was an excellent read and I would happily recommend it to anybody who enjoys something more meaningful and thoughtful than an average novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is another author, like George Orwell who has the ability to see the a possible future and present it in a way that appears to be a time in the life of an individual character, as well as surrounding characters who are experiencing the same world. Whether this is a made up story or not remains to be seen, because as the author states in Coda, \\"\\"The point is obvious, there is more than one way to burn a book.\\" But it is told in a manner that is all so more believeable in todays current world of technology than perhaps it could have been percieved when it was first concieved. Bradbury like Orwell are writers that having discovered them, I feel fortunate to know that there are many things they have still written I have not yet read, but I certainly intend to!Something to truly look forward to!Guy Montag respresents an individual who with help from a mysterious \\"Girl\\", awakens from the slumber he has found himself in. It seems to me that even now, this fantastic creation if truly appreciated for the message it delivers, can continue to awaken others who are not seeing the entire picture.Told in a manner that is clearly intellectually sound, the implications are truly frightening.Five stars isn't enough to rate this, nor would ten or any other amount if it existed here be.I will certainly be absorbing more of his writes.And if you haven't read this, although frightening I don't believe I could recommend that you do so more highly.

In this futuristic, dystopian universe houses are fireproof and firefighters burn books. Books have been banned because they make people think uncomfortable facts, however most people are too caught up with their wall-to-wall TVs and fast cars for the thought of reading to even cross their minds. Montag loves to burn and thinks he is happy with his life until he meets a girl who thinks about the world in her own way and a professor who remembers when books were treasured rather than banned. The story follows Montag as he slowly comes to realize how he really feels about the world he lives in.Fahrenheit 451 explores deep ideas about human nature, censorship, and the balance between knowledge and comfort. The most disturbing thing about this book is how close Bradbury was to our life today. Almost 50 years ago, he imagined things similar to cell phone earpieces, big screen TVs, and super highways. Other things are exactly like today: constant advertising, mindless entertainment, an endless war that most people forget about, and political correctness restricting peoples' speech. In the world of Fahrenheit 451, books have been banned because they make people think uncomfortable thoughts.This compelling book is a quick, but by no means light, read. Bold, artistic language and a fast-paced storyline makes Farhenheit 451 seem less like a vehicle for a sermon, and more like a window through which one can view a different but eerily similar world. His word choice and use of imagery creates a surreal feeling throughout the book, forcing the reader toAs good as Bradbury is at description and ideas, I felt that many of the characters were fairly one-sided and seemed to only exist to spew out speeches about differing points of view. I found it hard to relate to them, and didn't sympathize with them at all. However, part of Bradbury's point is that in this world human relationships aren't valued. Perhaps the character under-development was done on purpose to force the reader more into the mindset of the time.Overall, this book was thought-provoking and beautifully written. Its overarching message of individuality vs. comfort is just applicable to today's world as it was 50 years ago when the book was written. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think more critically about the world in which we live in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"'Farenheit 451' is rightly deserved to considered a classic much on the order of the works by George Orwell. Written almost sixty years ago, 'Farenheit 451' brilliantly and concisely captures the overall demise of society through the \\"dumbing down\\" of people by the media and socialist-leaning government. People become automatons, unwilling to think or feel pain. Books become the enemy because they speak of reality and pain. So in 'Farenheit 451' the government outlaws all books, and \\"firemen\\" become government backed literary arsonists. However the author brings us hope in the form of the lead character, a fireman himself, who begins to think for himself and crosses over to another world (figuratively speaking :-)). His life rapidly unravels and transforms.I suppose my only quibble with 'Farenheit 451' is that it somewhat overloads the story with a sub-story of a world war about to begin. I'm not sure why the author introduces such a distraction other than to tell the reader \\"hey, none of the citizens care about the war because they are too brainwashed from the government and media\\". I think \\"Farenheit 451\\" could have been just a little better without such silliness.Bottom line: a near perfect read. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book tells an intriguing and dystopic anecdote about.....books. It is thought provoking, and evocative.

Not only was the story outstanding, but the way in which it was written was phenominal. Ray Bradbury's Far451 depicts a society where books are illeagal, and fire men are for burning any books found are burned. Guy Montag, the main charachter is a fire man, reads a book. He learns to love books, and is not afraid to do what he belives. Everyone else does what they are supposed to : watch T.V. and other forms of entertainment that require little, or no intellect whatsoever.(that is just the very beginning) This novel is very close to real life, and is the most acurate prediction of where our society is headed (Not literaly!, just the conformity, and the censorship) There is more to conformity than what appears to be, as Ray demonstrates. It also eliminates love in some ways, and &quot;life&quot;.

The book was a sort of prophesy by Bradbury in the 50's, warning Americans of what may happen to young minds today and in the future, if we allow television to blindly influence our lives and society. I view the &quot;families&quot; as the television, dangerous because it delivers suggestions to the brain, before one can approach it with analytical thought. Visual suggestions can alter your way of perceiving life if one doesn't approach it with question and analysis. Books, however, allow one to analyze and reason out ideas for themselves. This is a point clearly illustrated in Brabury's book, the importance of reading; the enhancers of free thought. Once again, I strongly recommend Fahrenheit 451 be read, particularly by the youth of the 90's and the millenium. This is definitely a book needed in our age of runaway technology."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"THE BOOK WAS GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT WARNED US OF A FUTURE THAT COULD COME SOON, BUT FOR YOUNGER READERS THEY MAY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ALL THE METAPHORS THAT HE THROWS IN THERE."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Overall, I liked this book.

Fireman play an important role because if someone has books, the fireman burn them and the house which they are in. This book's protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman who has a change of heart about burning books and tries to get others from buring them.It is an awesome book and it even has a mechanical dog who sniffs out books and reports it to the firemen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In a not so distant future, Guy Montag is a fireman. But, paradoxically, his mission is NOT to quench fires, but to set them up in order to burn books. Because in the world in which Montag lives, it is absolutely forbidden to read books. Because reading books forces one to think for oneself. And thinking for oneself might lead you to question the world and not be happy. And in this world, it is mandatory to be happy.This book warns about the dangers of a mechanized civilization which condemns the life of the spirit and the free mind. The prescience of Bradbury is remarkable: in a book written in the fifties, he foresaw the terribly negative effects TV could have. Today, there still are free thinkers in this world, but to most people they seem weird and strange. TV, of course, can be used for constructive purposes, but let's be honest and admit that some 90% of its consequences have been stupidly destructive. So turn off your Oprah (like she could recommend good literature) and read this book: you'll end up wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Read this book! This, sadly prophetic, book truly reflects modern day life. Amazingly, people don't read anymore, BY CHOICE! Were offended by any and all things serious. Life has become nothing but trivial, meaningless, stupid, &quot;fun.&quot; The movies, television, pastimes, everything, is completely empty and devoid of all substance, if it actually has a point, then it's called &quot;overly serious.&quot; After all, we just want to &quot;have fun;&quot; why waste our lives trying to fix problems? Forget the problems! Life's too short! Eat, drink, tomorrow we may die! Ozone depletion, global warming? Bah! Human beings like you and I starving to death? I don't see it! Poverty, pollution, living beyond our means, injustice, racism, classism, sexism, hatred of all differences, greed, and countless other serious problems? Who cares, I don't see 'em! Flick on the TV!... and all these other anoexic, empty-headed, cuties we all aspire to be, who have nothing to offer us but &quot;cute-ness,&quot; and, of course, the planned obsolesence of the latest clothing fads, etc!How have we gone this far over the edge? Why don't we read? Why don't we care? Why don't we think? Why do we allow this to go on? Ray Bradbury tackles all these questions and more in his book. While this isn't a difficult book to read, it is slow reading, because, to get the point, you must continually stop reading and think about what you've read, to ask the important questions: Is it better to know, or not to know? Is it better to read, or not to read? Why do I read? Why do I think? How do I separate two conflicting truths, which are equally true? Join Montag, Clarisse, Faber, Beatty, Stoneman and Black, Mildrid, Granger, and the other characters of Fahrenheit 451 to help you find these answers.What a great book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is truly ironic that some here are saying they didn't like Fahrenheit 451 because it was &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;didn't make sense.&quot; Slamming this book because it didn't feed itself to you, predigested? You missed a major theme of the very book you're trashing: society has degraded because thinking was deemed &quot;too much work&quot; - challenging books are burned, and mindless entertainment keeps people docile.Either you didn't really read it, or you haven't learned to think for yourself yet. (And only those under 20 get to use the latter excuse.)You don't have to like this book. You don't need to agree with everything Mr. Bradbury says. BUT - if you didn't like it because it required too much work from you... well, let's just say you shouldn't be proud of that fact. Everyone who &quot;got&quot; this book, whether they liked it or not, understands this.And to the book burning eighth grader...

I finished reading the book two months ago. I have to say it is very good. Set in the future, in a time where fireman burn books for a living, we see played out the story of a man named Montag who is a fireman....but he knows there's more to life...... Befriended by a sixteen year old girl named Clarrise Mclellan, he begins to see through her eyes the beauty of simple nature. And books come alive to him. He later comes to himself and quits his job as a fireman. Although this is a Science Fiction it has a depth that this genre often lacks. Montag's wife is distant from him. Clarrise who was like a daughter to him was killed. And in the end being an outcast joins a group of men who believe in a brighter future. This book is not only important to read but moving. Put it up there with Brave New World and 1984.I have a great appreciation for good litreture. Being a future writer myself, I believe good writers are always good readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To verify, I am a boy of age twelve. For a little introduction before delving into my review of this book, I would like to say that I amuse myself with books more advanced for my age, as they are by far more interesting, and enhance my writing skills and whatnot. With that done, I will not begin my comments on the book and a bit of a summary.Concise Summary (in my standards): Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury, concentrates on a man by the name of Guy Montag, living perhaps a century or so from modern day, when the world suddenly altered into a dystopia. Therefore, firemen, instead of extinguishing fire, generate fire. However, they perform such tasks because of certain objects: books. Books were thought to be threatening and complicated, and thus, were ordered to be destroyed. The entire history of firemen was completely changed to fit this. For example, Benjamin Franklin was the first fireman, but he was a fireman parallel to that of the world in Fahrenheit 451.Anyway, Guy Montag is happy with his life. Until he discovers a girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan, who forces upon intricate thoughts about the past. Certainly, she was an odd person. Later on, she disappears, possibly dying. However, despite this, she remains an impact to Montag, influencing him. By time, Montag betrays the society and becomes an avid book-reader. The tale journeys through a short, almost unbelievable period of Montag's life, twisting into the end with Montag joining a group of book fanatics whom memorized certain books.Comments: The story is interesting, unlike any book I've ever read. Instead of being based on the normal spaceship, out-of-the-world concept, it is based on a completely different world, frighteningly similar to ours in a way. Bradbury employs nice words, but does not suddenly place a difficult one right out of nowhere. Because of this, the flow is great.The writing style is at least normal, as it should be with most authors. The plot is overall good, although I do feel that everything occurs too quickly. In a week or so, Montag changes from a ten-year fireman to a book lover. Regardless, it is a good book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is the living master of the science fiction genre. This stuff is good, written in 1953, even if you are like me and don't like science fiction. Pass on those Bush-bashing movies by disingenuous poorly dressed film-makers and go to the real thing.This Fahrenheit is called 451 because that is the temperature at which books burn, more or less, and that is what this is about. Reminiscent of Hitlerian Germany, book burning is back in vogue in the eastern US in the late 20th century. The first ironic twist is that the firemen start the fires to burn the books, generally engulfing the book owner's home, and sometimes the book owner as well.Guy Montag is a third generation fireman who starts to question the purpose and meaning in burning books. All homes have been somehow fireproofed, so no real fires occur, only those started by the fire department. Montag's wife sits home all day, watching mindless broadcasts on large screens, and complaining that Guy needs to earn more money in order to purchase even larger screens. Her ultimate objective is to cover all four walls of the living room with monitors.Guy starts to sneak home some of the books and of course, he ultimately becomes the target of his own department. He learns that he should not trust his wife or his colleagues, all of whom long ago drank the kool-aid. He does make the acquaintance of an elderly professor, an intellectual and scholar from the old days, who ultimately puts him in touch with others of a similar ilk.Perhaps most interesting is the reason givien for burning the books. Non-fiction is bad, since it is all contradictory and impossible to prove, and fiction is even worse since it is not even true, just made-up people, places, and dialogue. And dont get me started on poetry or philosophy, that will only cause confusion, sorrow, and feelings of being lost. Society has made a clear selection in its entertainment, with an absolute preference for high speed sports, action, and adventure.More irony follows as Montag on several occasions becomes both the observer and the target as he is pursued by the authorities. Then we learn from reading a book that books are not a suitable way for humanity to store knowledge, that requires dedicated but powerless and marginalized scholars involved in constant peer review and analysis. The last irony is that Bradbury has written a very short book here, actually a novella, because he knows that we prefer action and adventure to reading.As of this 2005 writing, I understand that Bradbury is in his 80's and still working. In various interviews, he expressed anger that Michael Moore would adapt his title for a completely unrelated and unfunny diatribe. But then, Bradbury lifted \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" right out of Shakespeare. What comes around, goes around."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"How many times have you ever wished that you never ever have to read another book again or how many times have you wished that books should be banned so that you could watch the TV all day long? Well, enter into Ray Bradbury's world where reading books are illegal, watching TV all day is encouraged and running people over with cars are acceptable.Remember in school, where the brainy kids would always answer the teacher's questions while the rest of us sat behind? The rest of us would always feel dumber and after class we would beat up the brainy kids. It was a no win situation but in this wonderful society, class consisted of - you guessed it - television and more television. But in this world, everyone was made equal, so much equality that practically everyone are mindless zombies.Guy Montag, the protagonist of FAHRENHEIT 451, mindlessly burn books for a living. His profession is being a fireman. What better way to prevent books from making us unhappy, right? Wrong! Everyone that follows the contraband-book-society is miserable. Right off the first few pages, someone wants to kill herself and it turns out to be Montag's wife.Clarisse McClellan enters the picture and she gives Montag a little shove towards the direction of actually making him think for himself. For a moment there, Montag starts to live. He sees nature meaning trees and flowers, you know, that sort of junk people really don't see when their mind and concentration is on the television. McClellan also makes Montag question his lifestyle and happiness. He starts to get upset because he realizes that there is something terribly wrong with how the society works. But don't worry. Before McClellan can complete the transformation of making Montag into a living and breathing person, she gets run over by a car, driven by a bunch of kids. A wonderful world, is it not?Since Montag is stuck in between the phase of being a zombie and being a full fledge person, he looks for help. Although he wants help, he's placing himself in danger, by - be prepared for this - reading books and by talking with Faber, a retired English professor. The journey that awaits Montag would be full of confusion, danger and anger especially when Faber and Beatty have a verbal one-on-one. By the way, Beatty is really Captain Beatty, as in captain of the fire department."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Set in a not-too-distant future where books are banned, firemen start fires rather than put them out and room-sized TVs provide all social interaction, Farenheit 451 is truly scary. In a world like this, that is at once strangely familiar yet radically different, Guy Montag's behavior throughout the novel helps the reader identify with him. Definitely thought provoking and frightening in how close to reality much of the subject matter has become."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's books make for immediate, mesmerizing, entirely compulsive reading. His prose is electrifying in its use of poetic metaphor and dramatic syntax. The reader is instantly plunged into an alien culture, or a terrifying future, and is not really released even after the last page is turned.I had been postponing reading this novel for years. I am, after all, a confirmed bibliophile. Reading a novel with a plot involving the burning of books would, I kept telling myself, be too traumatic for me.I finally decided to wade in.Need I say that I only put the book down when I absolutely had to, when reality intruded? The novel carried me along on its relentless wave of narrative. Of course, I tried not to picture the books burning as I read, but Bradbury wouldn't let me. Not when he was describing them as living creatures, dying, their pigeon wings flapping.... The fact that I managed to endure this at all is a real tribute to the greatness of his writing.The characters are indelibly imprinted on my brain. The most compelling, of course, is the protagonist, Montag. Equally compelling are Faber, who is obviously Montag's alter ego, and the numinous Clarisse. She is the one who first awakens Montag to the futility of denying his own soul, the stirrings of thought and penetrating questions that reading invariably arouses. The most tragic character is Beatty, who struggles hard against his love of books, in his work as chief fireman. This struggle culminates in a final, ironic conflagration. Montag's wife, Mildred, is to be pitied, since she is unable to acknowledge her emptiness, her consuming loneliness. She pushes away the power and beauty to be found in books. She refuses to come out of denial, preferring \`the family', a banal cast of characters she endlessly watches on the living room \`wall-to-wall TV', in order to anesthetize the deepest longings of her soul.As I read, I became aware of a deeper sense of discomfort, underneath that elicited by the burning of books. Due to my own life experiences, I, along with this disturbed society, had been unconsciously longing for a world in which no one would ever get his or her feelings hurt - a world where everyone's rights would be respected, especially those of minorities.Bradbury gave me a sobering look at such a world, and it was absolutely terrifying. It was \\"American Idol\\" gone wild, a world in which people no longer thought, felt, or even communicated on a soul level with other human beings. Instead, they spent all their time being \`happy', through mindless, ongoing entertainment.I realized that I didn't want to live in such a world; it would mean the total annihilation of what makes us most deeply human - the ability to dream, to wonder, to ponder the deep truths of life.Books and the questions they raise are incompatible with living in a world where nobody would offend anyone else. Books disturb, probe, anger and challenge. Books are flawed at times, due to their authors' all-too-human penchant for furthering their own pet theories, however twisted they might seem to a reader. Books can make us squirm, for they can force us to face the unwanted realities we try to bury.There is still a part of me that thinks that books such as \\"Mein Kampf\\" should be burned, or at least, allowed to expire by going, and staying, out of print. The Marquis de Sade also comes to mind as an author of books with a markedly offensive subject matter. Then there's Anais Nin. One of her books chronicles the incestuous relationship she had with her father...The problem is, where do you draw the line? Who decides which books merit extinction?I don't have a final, satisfactory answer.And so I am left feeling restless and slightly depressed, although I'm glad to have read the book, nevertheless. It has caused me to ponder what I really and truly believe regarding the banning of books, and their potentially harmful influences.Yet another uncomfortable element of the plot is Montag's desperate, evil act toward the end of the novel. I suppose it is inevitable, however. It is indeed immoral, but then, so is the entire, nihilistic society he is a part of. It is the act of a man who has turned on a symbol of that society, and so, turned on himself, in a sense, in order to be reborn as a new man, a man who thinks and feels, even if doing so causes him some measure of unhappiness. This act could, itself, be considered a harmful influence on a reader, since Montag evades punishment. Yet, as an act of rebellion, of a misplaced sort of justice, it is totally fitting. Therein lies \\"the treason of the artist\\", as Ursula K. LeGuin puts it. For the artist makes meaning out of pain, suffering, and tragedy. This is also part of the value to be found in books.The symbol of rebirth is ubiquitous in the novel. At one point, the myth of the Phoenix is mentioned. Ironically, civilization is being reborn out of the very fire it has used to destroy the very objects that had given it meaning - books.By the end of the novel, groups of people have quietly begun the reconstruction, the return to reading. It is a movement that is slowly gathering momentum. Civilization, suggests Bradbury, as Miller's \\"Canticle for Leibowitz\\" was to do years later, is constantly rising from the ashes of every Dark Age in order to reinvent itself.So I know that I will be re-reading this book sometime in the near future, as I intend to do with Miller's. Both are books that apparently dwell on despair, only to end with a feeling of hope.Bradbury has once again sparked my imagination and tickled my intellect. He also refuses to let me forget his incredible take on a future that may or may not turn out to become all too real."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have re-read this book twice. It is a profound, pivoting novel, redolent of dysthymic admonitions and insight into the depths of nature. We are truly moving closer to the future allocuted by Ray Bradbury, for we reside in a society of superficiality and vice, in which mass media precludes critical thought and engages in unmitigable ideological insemination. The infernal machine known as the television is everywhere, and the pretense of the machine's adoration of the viewer and pseudo-relationship manifests itself in the aplomb, homogenous you-centered advertising schemes. Political correctness is bilious and has reached a prodigious, nauseous height. We are absorbed in a sub-culture of vanity, asininity, and conformance, whilst the circumambient ecumenical situation continues to precipitate. But we can preclude the advent of a Bradburian future. We must destroy televisions everywhere, and rid the world of superficiality. degenerate literature such as modern romances and John Grisham should stop being idolized, and we must return to the antecedental genius of man, We must read Thackery, Bronte, Joyce, Mann, Goethe, Kant, and we must liberate ourselves from ignorance. reading this, i felt that Clarisse Mclellan was predicated upon me. I have always wandered amongst fecund leas and orchards and the fallow moors, engrossed in nature, and admonished and mocked for it. Just the other day, whilst seeing the reflection of a television's promulgations, i heard jets in the sky, their aquiline screech shattering the heterogenous tranquility of the pines diademed with mists of the sea... and all the while, the television blasted, and i thought eerily of Fahrenheit 451, and what would ensue...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I don't really think this is the case. 451 is a book about what books should be about. Books should inspire us to think, to challenge ourselves. The best poetry should make us cry (so, too, should the worst but for other reasons.) Books should make us question our society and it's assumed intrinsic goodness.John Cheever said, in his Pulitzer acceptance speech, that books, maybe, could prevent nuclear war. Bradbury, too, makes this point in the speeches of the wandering academics Montag meets at the end of 451.If you're interested in reading a book with a purpose, with a meaning -- a book which strives to show us where we could go and the bad we could do -- read 451 and let yourself question the status quo."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not going to summarize the book. I'm not going to tell you how Guy Montag feels, how his wife feels, how those people on the screens that cover three walls feel. I'm just going to tell you how I feel. And the way I feel is this: awe. Mr. Bradbury wrote this book way back (well, way back for me) in the fifties, I believe, after a series of unsuccessful attempts. He wrote it half a century ago, yet the country depicted in it is strikingly like the US today.Let me put it this way, in a slightly more historical backround; we were talking about Confucius and the Legalists today in Social Studies, or History, whichever you prefer. The Legalists were like the US in this book. They suppressed opinions that did not agree with their own, they used military force, they even burned books. Only agriculture and medicinal books were allowed to be printed. The way the Legalists ruled ancient China during those fifteen years is like the way the government runs the US. Actually, I started a great discussion with the only other kid who read this, comparing that future world to this ancient one.But the scariest thing is that it's not really THAT far in the future. They've won two nuclear wars since 2070. The year 2070 is going to be in my lifetime unless I die very early. Freaky. Very, very scary to think of.The last thing I want to say in this oversized-review is that I absolutely NEVER give five stars. A book has to be really great to get the great \\"twelve-year-old stamp of approval\\", as my mommy calls it. I'd recommend it to anyone within the vicinity of my voice...in fact I think I have. (Before homeroom I tend to be a little tired, I mean it is as 7:40 in the morning, and I get \\"roudy\\". This means I tell the whole hall in general which books are good, which are bad, and it actually works. Because of my interesting antics I've gotten three fans of this book, and countless others of books for youngerpeople.)Ray Bradbury, if you are seeing this review, which you may in fact be, I've really got no idea whose looking at this, you have a Fonz' (ever seen Happy Days? I watch reruns on TV Land) quality thumbs up.\\"Hey!\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Since I don't want to give away all the details of the book I will try to be as descriptive as possible. The book open with humans, as a whole, not remembering the way life used to be. In a time when there were books, schools, and maybe most important of all, the freedom of speech. You first meet the main character Guy Montag after one of his work shifts. He is a fireman, but not the type of fireman that we would think of today. In this case, he is a fireman who starts fires. In the world in which he lives, owning books is a highly punishable offense. In this case, firemen arrive at reported libraries with tankers full of kerosene and light the books and the homes of the book owners on fire. This usually takes place at night to make a good show for those who enjoy to watch. The same people who owned the books will also be arrested. However, most of these so called &quot;radicals&quot; who own the books decide to be burned along with them. In any case, Guy enjoys his work and never seems to give the mass destruction too much thought. That all changes, however, when he meets a girl named Clarisse. She talks with him about the way the world used to be and it starts making him wonder about things. Eventually he begins sneaking books out of the fires. Of course this type of behavior is going to get noticed and he has to go on the run and ends up turning on his society and his role in it. He later finds a home in a wasteland outside of the city with other educated people who take him in and watch as the city is blown to bits in a techno-war that lasts only three minutes. In my view this was a pretty good book. It was entertaining and a short read. Some of the themes like drive by terrorism, the large amount of entertainment, and the fast vehicles make a point that not all technological progress is useful. On top of it all the story basically ends on a good note because all of the controlling ways of life are destroyed and the educated can now build a free world that once existed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like books that you don't need a dictionary by your side, or it doesn't take three months to read then, fahrenheit 451 is a book for you.Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In this society fireman start fires instead of putting them out. The people in this society don't even read books they are consumed by tv and radio. There's one problem though Guy likes books.Throughout the story Guy's life is a plagued by disturbing events like his wife's attempted suicide, a crazy lady that would rather be burned alive than have her books burned, and to top it all off his friend Clarisse is hit by a speeding car and killed. This was devastating to Guy because she opened his eyes to the emptiness of his life. This is when Guy questioned the duties of his job.Other exciting events in the story are when Guy doesn't show up for work one day and his boss Beatty pays him a visit. Upon his arrival Beatty discovers that Guy has been hoarding books from the fires to read. Beatty tells him that he can keep the books for one night and after that he has to turn them in for burning. Guy begins one long night of reading. Overwhelmed by this task he turns to his wife for help, but she's more interested in tv. He pays a man Dr.Faber a visit, Faber agrees to help him.The next day Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty for incineration. Then the alarm sounds and they rush off for another book burning. When Montag gets there he realizes it's his own house. His wife betrayed him. Beatty forces him to burn down the house himself.Once he is done he turns the flamethrower on Beatty and kills him, then he manages to escape the other firemen and the big mechanical dogs.If you want to know what happens next you'll just have to read the book because a review shouldn't give away the ending. So if any of this sounded interesting I suggest you pick up a copy of fahrenheit 451 and read it, you won't be dissapointed.After reading this brief introduction to this book you would understand why I gave it a near perfect score, it's action packed with adventure, and it's easy to understand. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is, from an analytical standpoint, about the meaning of life, values and the reactions of people. The book begins with the main character, Montag, as you will realize he lives the life of the classical fireman. He burns books because it is what he is paid to do, he goes home to his wife that, since they have no children, sits around and watches T.V. all day, and is completely brainwashed by the society. Montag then encounters a girl, named Clarise, who thinks about the world and he wonders. Not too much later he goes to see a professor who helps him to think, himself, and in so doing puts Montag against the society that he was the idealist for not so long ago.This book can be analyzed as an insight to the meaning of life for the different characters have such contrasted views as to what the true meaning of life is. First of all there is Montag the protagonist of the story, he changes his meaning of life from, work at my job, that isn't too bad, so I can support my wife and she can be happy. Then contrastingly to what I considered as my view on life before is flawed, because my wife isn't really happy; for two reasons, first she almost kills herself, without thinking much of it, and, second she doesn't understand how to think so she really can't be that happy anyway. This leads him to think that his purpose in life is to try and enlighten some part of the society to induce thought and maybe make people really happy instead of the temporary solutions they use all day long. The second character that is the general view you get on the people in society is Mildred, who is basically every average housewife. Mildred is a living zombie of absolute brainwashed stupidity, she really isn't capable of her own thought and she thinks she is happy, since she can't really think for herself and their isn't much material around about the meaning of life, she really doesn't have a view, but her character, or moreover what she represents matters to the story and how life is viewed by general people. The third person that shows the meaning of life that is generally accepted is that if you please your superiors you have done your job in life, this character is captain Beatty. Beatty is an interesting character he knows what Montag knows that books let people think, he has also read many but he utterly supports the government without objection or dispute. He knows what the government wants; yet he agrees and he tries to convince Montag that he is right and the government is right and he is doing what must be done. These three characters show contrasted views of three beliefs on the meaning of life, or what is good.Values are shown vividly in the book, there are different values shown, such as knowledge, material, and thought. The first example is the night call to the house where the woman burns with her books; this exemplifies value in knowledge. This is shown in what the books represent to her, she has such value in the knowledge, which the books contain, and value in the importance of this she doesn't feel she can live after they have been burned. The second instance where value is shown is in Mildred, and her value of material, in this case her parlor. The scene where this is most relevant is when Montag comes to burn the house, she complains more about her parlor as she goes away than she does about her husband who will be sent to jail. The third time value is shown though this is in no order is in Clarise. The value she represents is thought, she values thought without even having to try, she values it because her family values thought and she is fed on thought and conversation; throughout her life by her uncle and parents she is thought the value and meaning of thought, and so she expresses this value.The reactions of people are also in the theme of this book, for many times this is shown. The different reactions I will discuss are: first, the society's reaction to banning books, second the reaction Captain Beatty has to books, and third Montag's reaction to Clarise. First, I will discuss society's reaction to the banning of books. Society in this world is not so much different from ours, yet a ban against books wouldn't make sense to people, but it seems logical to people in this world. I am for the opinion that this is because the government structures the world around fast pleasure instead of the pleasure of knowledge, so it can be easy to ban books and make people into what Mildred and her friends represent. I believe given time this would easily follow through in our fast paced world, not because people wouldn't fight but because of people that wouldn't really care. The second reaction I would like to discuss is the reaction of Captain Beatty to his reading of books. This is intriguing, because even after reading many books Beatty still hates them, this is odd since the general reaction to something you hate is not to do it, yet Beatty knows his enemy like a friend an intelligent, hateful method of enforcing your opinion. The third, is Montag's reaction to Clarise, she doesn't have to do much to catalyze his thought, this is most likely due to the fact that he thinks a lot but not about the right things.To conclude this book has many an Interesting aspect to it, and is worth a good read, make sure to remember not to be a person that doesn't care."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story, Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about an alternate society set in the future where cars travel 100 miles per hour, TV walls interact with people and books are banned. Guy Montag is an enthusiastic fireman, who enjoys pouring kerosene over books and burning them and the entire house. In this society, firemen do not put out fires. They start them.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury. This book was action-packed and involved a lot of good writing. For example there were many metaphors in this book. They helped to connect Montag's society to ours, and show the frightening similarities between the two.Mildred Montag is Guy Montag's wife. She is an example of the people the government wants to create. Mildred is shallow and cares more about her possessions than about herself or her husband. Also, Mildred never shows interest in what Montag has to say. She regards him as an annoying younger brother rather than her husband. Mildred is the stereotypical housewife of this time period. She values all the things her society does. She seems to not think for herself, and only knows what the society wants her to know.In the beginning of this book, Montag seems perfectly content with his life and his job. He says it is a pleasure when he burns people's houses. He loves the smell of kerosene that comes from his job, and \`wears it like a perfume'. Then one day Montag meets a girl named Clarrise McClean, and his life changes forever.Clarrise is a peculiar girl for the time period. She thinks. She enjoys smelling the leaves in fall, staying up late at night talking and watching the stars. Clarrise seems like a girl that came from our time period and was placed in Montag's. The norm for teenagers in this book is to play video games, play sports, and kill each other. There are many gangs in this society and often innocent teenagers are shot. Also, teenagers like to drive their cars hundreds of miles per hour to see how many people they can run off the road. If a pedestrian were to be crossing the street in this society, they would most definitely be killed. However, no one walks anywhere. Rather, they take the subway or they drive to wherever they need to go. Pedestrians are seen as weird and are often watched by the police to make sure they don't do anything illegal.When Montag meets Clarrise and talks to her, he immediately wants to know more about her. She is unusual to him, and he likes that. Montag loves the way Clarrise doesn't care about what anyone else thinks of her. Clarrise teaches Montag to question society when the society seems wrong.The day after Montag met Clarrise, the firemen were called to a site where there were books in need of burning. Montag seemed detached from the routine that usually captured his every waking hour. The firemen were at the house of a woman who had hidden books in her attic. When the other firemen were pouring kerosene over the books, getting ready to burn them Montag stole one. He put the offensive book under his jacket and in doing so saved it from being burnt.When Montag got home he revealed to Mildred the stolen book. He opened up the air vent in his room and exposed 20 more books! Mildred was horrified, and gathered the books so she could burn them in her incinerator. Montag ordered Mildred to stop and said he wanted to read the books. He reasoned the authors must have spent their whole lives writing a book and therefore the books must be worth reading. Some people were willing to die for the ideas and opinions in these books, and Montag wanted to figure out why.Mildred, like most of the society, took no interest in Montag's books. She knew that if she did, she could be sent to jail. Mildred did not want to risk ruining her reputation, or loosing her house and TV walls. After Montag realized that Mildred would be of no help to him, he decided to talk to someone. Montag needed someone who would be aware of what he was going through, and could help him understand the books. Montag recalled an elderly man, by the name of Faber, he met in the park years ago. Faber told Montag that he was once a literary professor and he loved books. Montag went to Faber's house to visit him there. He brought with him one of his stolen books; the Bible.Faber eventually helped Montag in his quest to change the society. He told him that this couldn't be done quickly, but rather after a long period of time. Montag and Faber then began to discuss a plan to change society's views. They decided to place copies of books in firemen's homes. Then they would have the homes burnt. This would cause unease within the system and hopefully cause its demise.This book is about a society similar to ours. They have censored everything possibly offesive, thus only keeping the facts. The society is terrified of stepping on the toes of minorities for fear that they will rebel. They believe the bigger your market, the less you have to handle controversy. The public doesn't want to read anything that might offend someone. This aspect of Montag's society sounds frighteningly like ours. People watch what they say in public so as not to offend anyone. Montag's society grew to hate books because they might cause an uprising. What their society wanted above all, was for everyone to be happy. The story of Fahrenheit 451 is of the coming of age of Guy Montag. It is about his heroic efforts to restore civilization to it's thinking. This was an astounding book, and it is great for people who like action, controversy, and to think about life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 at school. Before I picked it my Mom was telling me how she enjoyed reading the book before me ,so naturally me being a teenager assumed that the book was going to be stupid ,but I got it anyway .It turned out that Fahrenheit 451 was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. It's true to life sci-fi theme puts me in the future world as depicted by Ray Bradbury where firemen are paid to start fires instead of put them out. I read the book once before but the second time around was much better. Allot of details in the book were overlooked by me the first time .It captures the decay of modern day literature to technological advances such as television and amplifies it with a sci-fi twist to the point where literature is forbidden .The reader follows the character montag through the story as the reluctant firemen begins to long for literature .His wife is addicted to television so she doesn't really help him with his self-esteem .He meets a man named Faber who helps him learn more about literature while his secret still remains kept .Eventually he ends up with a choice between his job and his life .A problems with this book is as follows ; If literature is forbidden how to they teach children ? Overall It was a good book and if you haven't read it yet I'd recommend that you do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book follows the same outline of the great novel \\"1984\\" by George Orwell. This book deals mainly with the threat that censorship poses on a nation. Guy Montag, a fireman, has never had a problem going along with the norm until he meets a young girl who changes his perspective on life. He then begins to question why he burns books which leads him into trouble with his boss Fire Chief Beatty. There are many important lessons that one can draw from this book but mainly the idea that books never die and that they live on in people's hearts and minds as long as there lessons are remembered. This book can teach young people to appreciate the importance of books, a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"the book fahrenheit 451 was a decent book it involves a character named montag. he is a firefighter no, not the ones who put out fires . he burns books because its the law not to have them. later on in the book he grows to like books because of his own curiosoty, but he almost looses his life because of it. i wont give away the ending but if you want to know what happens then i suggest you read it. chances are youll like it"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's account of a bookless world is realistic in every way. Farenheit 451 is realistic in how it describes situations, people, and places throughout the book. In the beginning of the book it describes Guy Montag and a book burning. The author describes the book in how the books &quot;Flutter around like birds and the sky burns as black as night.Guy Mantag is a firefighter who, instead of fighting fires, he starts fires. Guy does this because of a massive government censorship act in order to keep people in line with the way they think. It is sort of like a cover up. Society agrees with this because they don't want to break the law.This book's in depth descriptions are so good they pull you in and its like your there. Farenheit 451 will fill you with a new way of looking at things."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had heard of this book but had never realised what it was actually about or I am sure I would have tried to read it a long time ago. So when I happened to read the synopsis of it I was quite excited to find this classic.Any story about book burning and censorship gets me quite riled up. I adore reading books and would hate a world where they are not allowed. Even in today's world of 24 hour TV, ereaders and all the other technology, there is nothing quite as relaxing and entertaining to me than reading a book. I started this book with high expectations and a real desire to love it.The concept of the story is great. Given that it was written in 1950 as a short story in Galaxy Science Fiction and then transformed into a book in 1953, the author was very forward thinking and he got a lot of things spot on. The dependence of people on large screen TVs and the rise of reality and interactive TV along with the dumbing down of society that it seems to cause. Luckily, the whole book banning and burning has not happened!It was in the execution of the writing that I felt let down. It was just all a bit too poetical and pretentious for me. If he had stuck to the telling of the story idea it would probably have been one of my all time favourite books but he somehow tried to be too smart - perhaps I am just too dumb - but the style just did not work for me. It was supposed to be allegorical but I was just missing what the underlying meaning was!That being said, I am still going to look out the movie and give it a watch, even just to see Julie Christie in one of her classic roles.I gave the book 3 out of 5 for the concept of the story but I didn't rate the writing style very high."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight.

I think this is a great book for high school students to read for class for many reasons. First, Bradbury shows that it is okay to fight for what a person believes. I feel this is a great life lesson because if no one fought for what they believed, then everyone would all believe the same. That is good for high school students to realize because most teenagers keep their beliefs to themselves for fear of being bullied or made fun of. Even though fighting for what a person believes can cause that person to go against authority, which should not be encouraged in today's society, the overall result is better than not fighting for their belief. Secondly, Bradbury shows how society is able to change by the using examples of how the society in Fahrenheit 451 has changed and the reactions the people have in the society. That is also a great life lesson for high school students because nowadays students are so focused in on technology and their social life that they do not realize that the world outside them is majorly changing, not always in a good way either. I think that the students that read Fahrenheit 451 will have a positive attitude after reading this book. Mainly because it gives the students a different perspective and point of view of today's world and how they can improve what they think should be improved. Bradbury makes an excellent high school book author because he knows how the teenagers think and so he can help express to them the importance of fighting for what they believe in their own \\"language\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic and predicts many products that we use today such as flat screen tv on the wall, blue tooth, and drones."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is a very good science fiction book. it reminds me the important to read books.

Oh, not really because of what happens in the book (which is not a bowl of cherries), but because of how close we are to the society he describes. We've pretty much reached the big media/pervasive television/don't read point that he describes as the precursor to his universe. The only thing left is the actual banning of books. Though horrible for us, Bradbury writes a pretty good story around it. The problem I have with the book is that Bradbury jumps the \\"tell-a-story\\" rails quite a bit and ends up on the \\"classic citations\\" and philosophy tracks too often and for too long. It just gets in the way of what he's saying. Of course, my saying that is one of the slippery slopes he describes (condense books down by removing the thought-producing parts) as leading to his world. But, even so, because of these \\"interruptions\\" to the story, I rate this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a gem, the best book that I've ever read. I didn't have the opportunity to read it in school and decided to check it out. I now have a little paper in my wallet that I carry with me everywhere. This paper has quotes for the novel. My personal favorite. While most of these quotes are disturbing, because they're just so close to the truth, they are brilliant. Mr. Bradbury's descriptions and vocabualry usages are amazing.He wrote this book 50 years ago (52) yet he still managed to get so close to the truth. Back then, TV was a new thing and Mr. Bradbury sensed that there was something wrong with it. His future has TV as a replacement for books, books being outlawed and firemen starting fires instead of putting them out to destroy books. Mr. Bradbury probably feared that something like this might happen and decided to put his thoughts down first.While books still exist now and aren't outlawed, much more people would prefer watching Wheel of Fortune or going to see a useless movie at the theatre like Mr and Mrs. Smith. One thing that struck me was that there are over 5 million copies of this book in print. A lot, right? Not really if you think about it. While this book has been out for over 50 yrs, movies make 200 million dollars in 3 or 4 months getting a huge amount of US's population attending them.Mr. Bradbury makes TV something that everyone has in his future, like it is now. He has the TV's taking up an entire wall and certain characters are begging for another wall. Picture it, a giant wall, a TV screen. Now, how far is that from the truth? Now we have those giant plasma TVs and the ones litteraly attached to the wall. How sad.In his future, the U.S. is the big dog, starting wars with other countries because they can.This future is full of violence and hostility, but one man will stand up to it. The last 40-50 pages of the book are pure genius with some of the most memeorable lines ever.Mr. Bradbury has made a classic, my personal favortite book, a wrok fiction that could easily be mistaken for a work of non fiction. So tonight, instead of watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, why don't you pick this gem out. I'm sure that everyone in the U.S ahs heard of it, but I bet that a much fewer number has read it...if they hadn't been forced to at least."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is an interesting thing to review an american classic, and furthermore to review a book by an literary legend. That being said, it is apparent to anyone who has read the novel of why exactly it is a classic. Bradbury is among those authors from the golden age of science fiction writing. The early to mid 20th century saw a surge of scifi writers, the most prominent standing out from among the crowd to bestow upon us today's required readings. No sarcasm there, infact moreso enthusiasm. Huxley, Orwell, and Bradbury (and the even earlier Wells) have all produced standing classics which are used by many facilities to teach. It is truly a wonderful thing.Bradbury's book begins with a recount of the passion and the draw to burning. As a foreshadow, thiese paragraphs seek to write about a fireman in a futuristic dystopian society (dystopian in the quality of mental freedom). The society has, over time, allowed provisions to be made that completely cut out freedom of thought. However, the frightening thing deals with how they do this. Instead of just restricting books and other forms of published media, they have distracted the general public by means of electronic trickery. An advanced and much more frightening form of brainwash, the citizens are too caught up with \\"their family\\" (the referred is actually those on the television, whom they've become so ingrained with that they spend most of the day watching) to care about much else. This works for most, but not all, as humannature dictates. There are those behind the scenes, taking care of the dirty work.Enter Guy Montag, a fireman with the local fire department. Unlike modern convention, firemen in this futuristic nightmare are set out to burn the aformentioned media. They carry bottle of kerosene, the adversary to their predecessors, and threaten to burn anyone who posesses printed literature. However, Montag dissents when he reads a book that he swiped and he begins to slowly support those who he has hunted for the past years. His captain, Beatty, is a fierce man with a sharp wit. He completely understands Montag's position, as he has lived it, however he sides strongly with the belief that books are the root of all evil and that by destroying them, the government is doing the people a favor. He twists the situation of brainwash into sounding almost appeasing.Bradbury wrote the book in an amazing fashion. Taken from the life of \\"he who burns the books\\" (or the character who's job creates the actual problem), the story follows Montag into his general dissent and being hunted by those he previously worked for. Bradbury uses an amalgam of characters to shape our perception of this world, everything from the foundation upon his societal institution was based to the hidden war that is being waged. Without giving away too much information, it is sufficient to say that the conflict is resolves in a satisfying manner. One would suspect that such an occurence would happen during the upstart of such a ruled society, and I was pleased to see it concluded in that manner."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent read, thrilling and provocative. Ray Bradbury is one of my favorite authors because of his superior ability to convey detail. I began this book thinking it wasn't all that good but to my surprise I loved it and it is now one of my favorite books. It was a good book because the writing was engrossing and there was alot of action, he made the characters come alive and you could imagine them in your head as you were reading and play a sort of movie in your mind. The way Ray Bradbury views his future from 50 years ago is not that far off and is a bit frightening. Even though it was a great book I only wished it could have lasted longer. After the city was blown up it ended right there and left you wanting more. I also enjoyed reading about the futuristic gadgets and devices they used such as the Mechanical Hound, Seashell Radios and the Parlor. Overall I would suggest this book to anyone despite their taste I strongly feel no matter what kind of books you like this will appeal to you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book one day on a long bus ride. At first it was just something to do, but soon it became more. It is a very fascinating novel, especially when considering that it was written 50 years ago.

I also appreciate that it is written in a deeper matter, a characteristic of a true classic. I can understand that perhaps the fact of this being required to read at many schools might turn many students off to the book, but personally, I enjoyed reading it for pleasure."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 surprised me how good it was and how quickly i read through it. The idea of firemen not putting out fires but starting fires got my attention and held it. The way that Bradbury saw the future also kind of scared me, that people were killed all the time and no one noticed or even cared, but somehow this society was supposed to be perfect. The Mechanical Hound was something that also interested me, the perfect hunter. Something that can find the genetic make-up of your body and store it and then whenever you need to be killed, can track you down and finish the job. The only thing i could change about the book is to make it a little longer. After the city is bombed it just ends. I was hoping Montag would find Faber and the story would continue, but it didn't.

Bradbury is really a national treasure. If you ever get the chance to hear him speak, don't miss him. His stories are priceless. (Especially the one about his anger at people telling him for years that he was crazy to believe man would set foot on the moon in his lifetime. He said he called up every person who laughed in his face the night Neil Armstrong did--and pretty much laughed in their faces!) There is a fantastic one-on-one interview with him in the Walt Disney Tomorrowland-Disney in Space and Beyond DVD (interviewer is Leonard Maltin). His friendship with Disney (a fellow futurist) was fascinating. But it's the sense of wonder and child-like curiosity and optimism (not childish or blind optimism as he clearly understands what can create a dystopia) that make you realize why he is a national treasure. He's inspired me to look to the future, to look up, to look forward, to always be wary and alert to what can go wrong, (and the dangers of closed or lazy minds) BUT not to let any of that stop you--that anything is possible in a world willing to believe, in a free world with open and curious minds."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Many other people have already said that they liked the book, but I really have to say, this is one of the most brilliant stories of all time. From the first sentence 'It was a pleasure to burn' to the end, I couldn't put this down. It's almost poetic, you don't get stuck in bogged down writing full of unimportant details. This book is an extremely easy read, yet it is a hundred times more impactful then a 500 page book that takes you weeks to finish. Sure, you'll think about that while you're reading it, but this book will come back to haunt you years down the line.For a story written so long ago, it's frightening that society has done nothing to prove it wrong. This is a classic story about censorship that manages to enforce it's point without sounding at all preachy. It encourages thought. I wish they had made me read this in school, surely this would strike a chord in many people bored by the onslought of bad shakespeare movies. Hopefully this story serves as a cautionary tale to the people of today. Our TV's keep getting bigger, our music more portable, our transportation faster, but it feels like, in our need for speed, we're leaving the important things behind.To conclude, this is a brilliant story, even who people who read but once a year.

The main character is a new type of fireman, one who burns down houses with books in them, rather than saving them.The writing in this book is amazing, parts of it you have to read twice just because of the amount of visual and symbolic words used.

F451 is a really great book to read, but a fabulous book to discuss. We had some of the richest discussion about human nature and societal pressures during our seminars on this book. I liked this book so much, my essay on it made the exceptional writing board! (which only happens when I really care) Most of the books read at school get a bad rep as overrated classics written just for English geeks who love slowly digesting and turning over every stone in the book, but Bradbury's writing style is so warm annd easy to read, anyone can conquer this classic. Unlike other books of its genre (science fiction) its ideas of science fiction in a somewhat more approachable manner, stuff you could really see happening. Overall, F451 is a great read for anyone with some extra time on their hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ages 14 and up.

Despite being hailed as a book about censorship, I prefer to stress the aspect Ray Bradbury himself prefers: that long before the government mandated the burning of books, people had abandoned them, considering them 'obsolete.' It isn't so much about politics, but about society. I also want to mention that it is not objectionable books being burned, but ALL books, and with it, mental thought processes. People are being reduced to robots, with short attention spans. The essence of life is being sucked out of them, and this is the best theme of the book, in my opinion: the emotional pain and suffering of those who have nothing to cherish in life. The suicides and murders, the agony of the protagonist, Guy Montag, the bursting into tears of a woman . . . it is a much weightier theme than censorship.The book does have its drawbacks- an emotional but often confusing writing style mucks the clarity of the content, and there is an annoying on-purpose disregard of grammar. The character of Faber rubbed me the wrong way, as did the group of hobo learned men in the end, who declare themselves unimportant except as vessels for the books they have memorized. In fact, there is a paragraph in which Montag seems to notice and be conflicted by it- which is COMPLETELY UNRESOLVED! That got to me.Overall, the book is not a literary classic, but it's worth reading for the ideas in it, for the simple pleasure denied Bradbury's characters- to think about it, to talk and discuss. Montag is a sympathetic character, Clarisse is wondrous with her childlike enthusiasm, and Beatty is deliciously evil in that he gets straight to the root of what happened and what he does- and continues. No self-delusion of grandeur.Read it! See what you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book has it all. Bradbury's fascinating description, a engrossing plot, a skewed but interesting hero, and a cause any reader can get behind. I know there are probably thousands of reviews of this book, but I just had to say it again. If for some strange reason you haven't read it, read it now. You are missing out!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was first published in 1953. It is one of those books that for some reason I was never required to read in high school or college. For that reason, I am trying to read a few of these classics each year. I was not sure what to expect as I am really not into futuristic books, however this book blew me away with its accuracy of predictions some 55+ years after it was first published.Fahrenheit 451 details the eternal war between censorship and freedom of thought and continues to be relevant today more than ever. In Bradbury's future, books are illegal and happily so--citizens are too busy watching their wall-sized televisions and listening to their in-ear \\"seashell\\" radios to care about the loss of good literature. Guy Montag begins the novel as a fireman who enforces the temperature of the title--that at which books burn--but then transforms and tries to show his society the mistake of censorship. It's a treat to hear Bradbury read his own work, almost as if a wise elder were sharing a cautionary tale. Sometimes the slower pace seems awkward for a novel of such action, but overall the reading does justice to the timeless classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was the first novel to describe what would happen if people couldn't think. It is an interesting story that you don't find much. The world it draws up has no basis. This is because people can't think. In Fahrenheit 451, people are not allowed to have books because the government is afraid of an educated society. This book is very distressing because censorship could happen today. If there was censorship, the world would become dull and disturbing, as nothing would happen. There would be no great events, and this would cause no one to realize anything. This is the reason that it is still popular today. It is because of how controversial it is, in the fact of the world it portrays."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a masterful speculation of what the world would look like if events continued to unfold in its destructive progression. What happens to our cognitive abilities when we are glued to the \\"wall\\" every night, plug our ears with sound, and shut ourselves in our homes? Who are our families? Do we care about our neighbours, or even our own families? A great book, and a must read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A science fiction thriller. A true masterpiece that will blow you away. Although it's a science fiction book, it has some frighening resemblances to our own world. I could easily see this world turning onto the thoughtless \\"utopia\\" described by Ray Bradbury.The government tries to keep everyone happy in the process of no self thought and the burning of things that would cause debate and conflict, such as books. Now that houses are completely fireproof, the firemen no longer need to stop fires. Instead, the have a new job: to burn books.I liked this book because it kept me wanting it to keep reading and reading to the end. It was even hard for me to go to sleep some nights I was reading it. All in all it was a great book about one of the \\"bad guys\\", a fireman, who stood up agains the grasp of a corrupt society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a book that really get writers hooked.

What was wrong with my high school? No Bell Jar, no 451?*Anyway* fascinating read and crazy to think that books may be obsolete in the future, quite sad, since I'm an avid reader. The premise of the story is about a fireman who knows nothing else but his job and what life is like now, until he meets a young \\"strange\\" girl who discusses actual real life with him. After that, Montag starts to wonder things outside the realm of what he always knew and starts to question his job and the purpose of burning books. He ends up rebelling and fighting for the cause.If you liked 1984, this book is similar is some aspects (to me at least). The sad bleak future that these authors dreamed up with the loss of individualism and the control of telescreens/televisions everywhere with lack of intellect."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the story of Guy Montag in a future where most people live their lives in willful ignorance and the job of firemen is to find books and burn them. The story follows Guy, who is a firemen, as his new neighbor gets him to open his eyes to the world around him. The plot is enough to keep any reader chugging along, but the main hook to this book is Ray Bradbury's disturbing vision of the future. You can form your own opinions on if its an accurate vision, but whether you think it is going to happen or it is just a load of crap, it should defineatly get you to think about the world around you. This book certainly deserves the 5 stars I gave it and if you haven't read it then I seriously suggest you get a copy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An interesting story of book censorship and the consequences of mankind if we allow this to get out of had. This version of the book has an interview with the author at the ned which I really enjoyed reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman; he starts fires to burn the houses of people who keep books illegally. He enjoys his job and doesn't ask any questions, until a series of events open his eyes to the emptiness around him, forcing him to question everything about himself and the society in which he lives.The story that Bradbury wrote over fifty years ago is every bit as effective as the day it was published. The censorship he describes isn't simply the result of an overbearing government, it begins as a function of the masses, whose desire for political correctness and 'happiness' lead to the destruction of things that offend and stir emotions. The solution, along with burning the offending books, is to bombard the senses so as to eliminate the thought process entirely.In this age of political correctness and mass media, Bradbury's words ring more true than ever. His vision of a society where all men are not created equal, but made equal, is a stern warning against the elimination of individual thought and the idea that true happiness comes from being constantly entertained.I can't begin to do this book justice; nearly every page contains a thought-provoking passage. Bradbury wrote a classic whose truth is timeless and that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. Just imagine living in a society where reading books is illegal. The way that Ray Bradbury wrote this book is magnificent. The reader can easily visualize the flames when he describes the burning books.Guy Montag is a fireman who never questioned his job. In this world, a fireman was not hired to put out fires but hired to burn books. When Guy Montag met a seventeen-year-old girl who tells him of a past where people read books to learn and to read for pleasure instead of burning them, he begins to doubt his chosen profession. What's wrong with owning books and wanting to read and learn about the past and read for pleasure? Why can't society be the way it used to be. Why do we live in a world in which the government feels that it must control every aspect of our lives? These are just a few of the questions Guy asks.Imagine Guy Montag's horror when his wife discovers a stash of his illegal books in her own home! He now must explain to her why he has done this. Just because it is illegal he doesn't feel it to be such a terrible thing. Mrs. Montag is not only saddened by her husband's deception, but totally frieghtened of the consequences.Fahrenheit 451 is a must read! It is a very imaginative and fascinating book. It grabs the reader's attention from the very first page to the last!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a fast-paced science fiction novel about a futuristic society that has outlawed the reading of books. The main character is Guy Montag, a fireman whose job it is to burn the books and the houses they are found in. Montag thinks nothing of his job and is perfectly happy living an ignorant life, along with the rest of his brainwashed culture. That is, unitl he meets Clarisse. A 17 year old who doesn't fit into society, Clarisse begins to open Montag's eyes to the reality of the world he lives in. This book is interesting, powerful, and a bit scary. The writing contains many similies, metaphors, and other forms of descriptive writing. Although sometimes confusing, 451 makes you think a lot about society today and how it could be in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury has written a book that made me feel as if I were Guy Montag. He uses situations of panic that seem unfair and confusing. This is a very useful writting trick that made the book better and slightly frightening for me. If there were 900 stars to award this book, I would still give it a five if the scale were the same. Ummm... I can't think of anything else to write. I was hoping Clarisse would come back towards the end of the book. She didn't. That's okay. I guess. She sounded hot. My lungs are failing, so I need a ham sandwich. Bye. Oh yeah, and the book is good."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is remarkable. Fahrenheit 451 by Rad Bradbury is an intriguing book about what would happen if a society had gotten rid of books. I totally have grown to like this book. I have read it 3 times over and every time I Loved the way Rad Bradbury wrote as if the book was a debate of literay authors and ideas. The reader can visualize the pain and risk Guy Montag the main character goes through. The first thing I noticed about this book is the cover. How clever to have a person burning with newspaper and the title &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; which is the point where things burn. The best part of this unique book to me is the last part &quot;Burning Bright&quot; and the afterword. Bradbury's writing stands out the best. The reader can totally feel the fatigue as Guy takes his last step, before realizing he is safe.This book sparked a new &quot;flame&quot; for me because I could feel and taste the burning of books and how it could impact my society now. I can just feel what would happend if my city,state or country burned books. The chaos and killings. Books now are looked at as last resorts. The internet has taken over all books. But this book made me think a lot too. I reread his afterword and coda twice because I like to think of how he came up with this idea and his writing style. This is a great book that not only gets the reader lost in this world of burning but notices different authors, books, and new ideas that can bring just a better new generation of authors, poets and everyday writers and thinkers to come as one and share to the world that as quoted in Fahrenheit 451,&quot;Knowledge is Power!&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a well written and thought out science fiction novel that has many different levels of understanding to it. The book is designed to force people to consider the future of society seriously. This book is great because it changes the roles of people in the future to make the plot interesting. The plot of the book is set at a brisk pace to keep the reader from putting it down because the author is desparately trying to prove many points that are hidden throughout the story.The book places you into the future where the government tells the people what they can read and how they can live. The majority of the people loose their independence because they allow this to happen without protesting and they deserve what horrible thing will come of this. There are a few people like Montague who begin to fight back against the government. Montague used to be a fireman who in the government contolled society burns fictional books until there are none left in the city. The government wants all fictional books burned so everybody can be happy all the time. It turns out the people become ignorant because there are no fictional stories to compare their lives to. Montague attemps to escape the government with a few allies helping him out by storing the memories of the books in their heads to share with generations to come.Montague at first loves his job as a book burner, but he changes as he sees how ignorant the people in society are getting. Montague's curiosity lures him to the books. Montague is independent unlike all the characters in the story who are brainwashed except for Montague's ally Faber. Faber is a frightened old man who used to be a college proffesor until the government ruled that there will be no more fictional books, and he was forced to live alone without his beloved books. Montague came along and changed Faber so that he wasn't like all the other ignorant people. Faber now will fight back for what he believes by helping Montague bring books back to life. Montague and Faber need eachother to live in this society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not such a fan of Ray Bradbury but his book Fahrenheit 451 is excellent and is now among modern classics in the same line as 1984 and Brave New World. Most new versions of this book carry with it a great introduction from Bradbury about how he typed his manuscript on a typewriter that cost 10 cents to use every half hour. The story was first published by Playboy magazine. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn.Inspired by Hitler and Stalin book burning, 451 tells the futuristic tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, who works for the government as an emergency book burner that sets fires to books which have been banned. They storm houses, dig up floor boards, find books, destroy them and then arrest the owners.Montag begins to question the controlling society that he lives in. Why is he burning books? Inevitably this leads him to seek out books for himself and with it the paranoia of being found out while working for such an oppressive regime. There is some very good plot twists and the story is full of tension, suspicion and mistrust.You will read 451 in a day or two. It is less than 200 pages long and easy to get through. A modern classic that you should not miss."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Definetly this book is worth reading, it is interesting that even dough it was written in the 50s it represents many of today's issues, it is profetic in many ways.Book burning is only a representation of ways to hide knoledge, this can also be done by controling newspapers and news in general, by limiting information to a society or prohibiting books.Are we to far from fiction?, when our rights are steped on in the name of freedom something is seriously wrong, someone once said that going to war in the name of peace is like having sex in the name of virginity.I like the ending of this book, but to be honest I really beleive the story could have been done much better, I still give it four stars because I found the main issue, that is, free thinking and access to knoledge, are very well ejemplified trough the story, and it really gives the reader something to analize, it also makes for a great round table discussion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book, Bradbury demonstrates his talent of symbolism as he brings the inner meaning of the book to our eyes. 451 takes place in a distant future far from our time. In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book. I would reccomend it for anyone who is willing to give it a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"FARENHEIT 451 IS A BOOK I READ IN MY LANGUAGE ARTS CLASS IT TAKES PLACE IN THE FUTURE WHERE FIREMEN START FIRES INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM OUT.

It has held up well over this time span. This is a fable, a warning of an era where free thought is squashed.The world of Farenheit 451 is an unpleasant place. Although nominally a democracy, the people elect only who they are told to; war is a constant threat and the general populace is kept in a state of blissful ignorance. The only books that remain are dry manuals and rulebooks.Guy Montag, the principal character, slowly becomes aware that there is more to existence than the narrow life that he has lived. As he awakens to this new world, other cracks in the old regime become evident, most obviously with the number of suicides that are taking place. Even if this dictatorship is weakening, it is far from dead, and as Guy begins to explore the world of books and free thought, he puts his life in danger.Although written in the 1950s when television was just beginning, this novel seems to predict an era when TV has essentially replaced reading; fortunately, despite the dominance of television in today's world, books are far from out of fashion. Although not an altogether happy novel, this book is generally optimistic in that it shows how difficult it is to truly contain the human spirit. If it is not 100% realistic, it need not be; as stated before, this is a fable, and a classic in not only science fiction, but literature in general."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to believe this little book by the famed Ray Bradbury has been around for about fifty years. I remember kids talking about this book just a few years ago when I was in high school and remember thinking it was some great new work of sci-fi. With all the changes in our society and culture the past few years (from the Internet to digital television), FAHRENHEIT 451 is more significant today than it was forty years ago.The plot of the story is simple. Guy Montag is a fireman. However, in the future, instead of putting out fires, fireman start them. Guy burns books and he enjoys doing it. Books are illegal to own and most people spend their free time (and they have lots of it) driving their cars (at speeds of over 120 mph) or listening to the wall-sized televisions that have become their family. One day Guy meets a strange girl who sets a fancy to his heart. His meeting with her allows him to open up and begin to see the truth.The story is simple, but it is what the story says about our society that is so significant. We are told by the story's antagonist that things changed because the country became divided by factions of every sort and people no longer cared about the knowledge books contained. Reading forces people to think and thinking is bad because it forces you to consider others and when you only care about yourself, how can you think about someone else? In our modern American society where many people label themselves with as many hypens as possible, where lives are literally being played out on television, and where violence is becoming more and more the norm; the issues raised in FAHRENHEIT 451 need to be discussed more than ever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put fires out; they start them to burn books. In Bradbury's fictional world, it is better not to know or find out anything because if you know too much, you could be in danger. This book is closely related to the book 1984 by George Orwell because you can be put to death for simple things like writing in a diary. In Fahrenheit 451, you can have your house burned down and go to jail for the rest of your life if you are caught with books because reading for pleasure is against the law. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who burns books for a living. He sees his wife sit at home everday with the \\"family\\" who is actually just a television that surrounds the walls, when he starts to question his life. Why are books burned? Why are they so destructive to society? He makes the decision to change his life, risk everything he's worked for and discover what it is that books contain. Montag starts secretly hiding books in his house and reading them at any opportunity he gets. He learns that there is a whole world inside of books that he never knew existed. He tries to tell his wife about this and how books are so important but instead of agreeing, she turns him in to the police. After this incident, Montag's house is burned down and he is confronted by the police chief, Captain Beatty, and has to decide what he is going to do. Although this book was published back in 1953, the idea of firemen getting paid for burning books seems very real. These ideas make you think that maybe someday this could happen. Fahrenheit 451 is a book for ages 13 and up. The incredible descriptions of books burning,along with houses and the mechanical dog are very realistic. I thought this book was good because of the descriptions, you felt like a part of the book and it made you want to keep reading. I would recommene this book to any and everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This wonderfully written science Fiction book is a thought provoking and has two very good qualities. First of all, with Fahrenheit 451 you must read between the lines to find out what Bradbury is really saying. Not only is Bradbury writing a wonderfully twisted novel, but, to me, he is also saying that people are afraid of new or interesting ideas and, since books are full of them, these people will burn the books to put an end to ideas that may cause trouble for \\"society.\\" Of course, as with all of Bradbury's books, it is open to interpretation because of its weird and different look at life and some of life's hard facts. Bradbury's characters have been created with a depth that creates a realistic quality. This depth makes you want to know them, yet, in a way, you feel that you already do. We follow Guy Montag through his insanity knowing he is not insane, it's the rest of his world that is nuts. We grieve when his friend Clarisse McClellan dies because she is more in touch with reality than anyone else is. In all, this great book wraps you up in its story of everyday life in the future, with all its twists and turns. In other words, don't burn this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Depending on who you are, there are different messages provided in this book. To a reader in the 50's, this book may just seem like a chilling, futuristic novel. More can be seen by the modern reader because the actual science fiction portion of the book is less distracting. All of the devices described in the book we either already have, or now know are impossible to create within this new century. For example, the interactive &quot;family&quot; Millie was so involved in could be around any day now to consume our loved ones. The mechanical hound, on the other hand, won't be. When the creativity and dazzling ideas of the &quot;future&quot; are lost, the morals and messages become more defined. Bradbury was probably more accurate than he would have ever thought, as we move towards a more lazy America. Some of these messages seem more religious then anything else. They inspire to take advantage of the moment, and be thankful for what we have been provided. No matter how advanced we become, nothing will replace picnics and family values. Although these things have deteriorated over time thanks to technology, they should always be practiced if only for tradition"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Firemen no longer save lives. Instead they burn books and the people who harbor them. Censorship is the way of life in the science fiction world of Fahrenheit 451. Conforming with government, destroying individuality, and asking no questions are the rules of Guy Montag's world. Set in the twenty-first century, Ray Bradbury's novel tells the tale of the fireman who begins to question the rights and wrongs of his life. In this world books promote thinking and wondering and acting. Compliance is necessary for the government to ignore its people and watch over its \\"thirty-second\\" wars. The government wants assimilation and ignorance of differences. So modern technology produces television that is interactive and family rooms are replaced with television parlors - four walls of larger than life TV screens. The firemen hunt out owners of books and burn them, their homes and their books to the ground. \\"It was a pleasure to burn,\\" is the opening line of the story. In the beginning burning books is a source of joy, an excitement programmed into Montag by his world. Then he meets a girl whose family raised her with an encouragement of challenging what she is told. Montag is amazed, almost scared of the idea of questioning life. She begins to question him too. \\"'Do you ever read any of the books you burn?' \`Is it true that long ago firemen put out fires instead of going to start them?' and the worst of all, \`Are you happy?'\\" And there begins Montag's conflict with the government and with himself. When he reads a line of a book he realizes that there is no turning back. He can't be who he was before. And maybe he doesn't want to be. The book is set up as a narrative of one man's experience in trying to rebel against a world that has almost complete control. It is written partly as a typical novel and partly as a sequence of Montag's thoughts. The plot is hard to follow in places and often confusing but the idea behind the story is important enough to make reading the book worthwhile. Bradbury attempts to warn us of what the future may hold that we might prevent the beginning of a world of tyranny. He tells us to remember and cherish the attributes that make us who we are. He teaches us to be an individual and challenge the world around us. Although I did not enjoy the novel, because of the confusion, its message is very important if I want a world where what I think and say is important. A world in where I am a person with rights and opinions that are as valued as any other person's. I do want that world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is a crime that the literary world views SF as nothing more than a second class citizen. This book is, without a doubt, one of the greatest works of fiction of the 20th Century. Because, however, it is also a classic of SF it is not considered to be noteworthy in that regard. Bradbury's prose can be compared to a surrealist painting. While the plot may seem straight forward, there is so much else to be seen and to know within the story. Definately, this is a book that any self respecting SF fan should be able to say that they have read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: Magnanimous, in other words: Great! Everyone needs to read this novel, it's an essay about war, *censorship*, love, and philosophy. It will test your mind with tribunal, dysitopic, epic thoughts that will not leave you for your entire life. Now, I will address different readers to how they will like the book. For the devoted sci-fi fan (who for some reason hasn't read this book...): This book contains scenes which are inummerable and subjective to your thoughts, images which are astounding considering the day in age written. Mechanical hounds, massive bombers, wall size televisions, nuclear war, all of it is contained here.For the Owellian/Huxley dystopian fan: This book contains issues of censorhip that these days are beginning to ring true. Poems are regarded as sad thoughts that make people angry. Your spirit will be lifted as the protaganist, Guy Montag, views a woman commit suicide after seeing her books burn. You get to feel for the characters and their actions, and you will love the ending.For the cheap sci-fi fan who just wants wanton acion and adventure: Sorry pal, don't look to this book for action. There is some, but not too much, however, go ahead and do yourself a favor, read the book.For the non sci-fi reader: I don't know how you came across this book, probably through recommendation or assignent. However daftly you view this spectacular book, be prepared to enjoy it. This is a book that will stay in your mind.To anyone: Take heed this book, times might become too true for comfort someday...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was &quot;Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest.&quot; Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is perhaps among the greatest books on censorship ever written. At times, it may seem heavyhanded in its approach, and the action, as some reviewers have pointed out may seem a little farfetched. Indeed, who can imagine firemen dousing homes in kerosene and setting them ablaze? But this is not where the value of the book lies. Its value lies in the warning about the type of society we may become, and perhaps already have. A society where serious thought, questioning, and insight are little valued for fear of causing societal unhappiness and where people coast along in life fed by a constant stream of meaningless and useless information via television, unchallenged in their concepts of life by thoughts that may trouble them.We have now in our society a movement - political correctness - that is dominant on college campuses, a movement that seeks as its ultimate goal the suppression of any thought or idea that may in the least be offensive to another individual or group. In Fahrenheit 451 Fire Captain Beatty explains how Bradbury's society of the future came to burn books. Minorities of every stripe complained about how they were portrayed in this book or that book, tearing out page by page those sections that were offensive until the day when the &quot;libraries were shut and minds closed forever.&quot;There are further fewer active readers in American society today than 50 years ago. The great majority of Americans now have their worldview filtered to them through television, and children are raised on the offerings of mass entertainment from Disney and MTV. It is entertaining sometimes, but it is not the stuff of life. Fahrenheit 451 is indeed a prescient and frightening warning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an eerily prophetic science fiction novel written in 1953. This book deals with concepts such as censorship which was prominent in the '50's and today as fewer and fewer people read books. The story is based around Guy Montag, a futuristic fire fighter who doesn't put out fires for a living but instead burns books. One day he meets a young girl named Clarisse who changes his view on books and life. From then on Montag is a changed man and attempts to overthrow the fire department and everyone else who is against books. After killing the fire chief he flees the city and meets up with a group of outcasts who are pro-books. They have memorized entire books hoping that one day they will one day again become accepted. This is a great book and I reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading on and on, and flying through the pages of an exceptional novel, sums up my spellbinding experience with Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. With its wide array of characters I shared their pain, sorrow, and excitement. Its many themes forced me to ponder about our civilization's future. The picture that Bradbury painted of a particular community was magnificent. Most importantly, I encountered a society that seemed alien and threatening, but also familiar enough to be real. It is a story of censorship and consumerism, a novel concerning the future, a tale describing the transformation of a man are words that merely describe the power of this novel. Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written, organized encounter with the life of an ordinary fireman and his legacy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book, books are banned for making people's minds corrupt. Firemen now don not put out fires, they simply just start them. Guy Montag, a fireman for 10 years, never questioned his job of destroying books. Until he met a 17 year old girl who told him of a great past. Then, Guy meets a doctor who tells him how he can save the planet from another dark age.Ray Bradbury, I salute you! This book contains some of the most thoughtful sentences and words, and talks about such topics as censorship, politics, and the corrupt police. Too bad it was short. This is so good, I might read it again right now! The only thing that's stopping me is that it's a library book. I NEED THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have not read this book yet, you are missing out. This book by Ray Bradbury exposes you to why books are very important. A must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury did well done job. this book exposes you to why books are so valuable. Reading is a gift from God. If you have not read it yet, you must because you are missing out on a terrific story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I chose this book because I have read Ray's books before and enoyed them. The title seemed interesting, so I took it. His style of writing can be confusing, so you must concentrate while reading. I gave this book a &quot;thumbs up&quot; because it had an unexpected ending."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just read &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; for the first time recently, and found many of the observations about censorship quite relevant. However, as a science fiction story, what may have been riveting in the early 1950s seems a bit tame by today's standards. Particularly interesting is Bradbury's vision of the evolution of television, which of course was still in its infancy at the time he wrote the story. The idea of a room in which the visual image surrounds you on all sides sounds a projection screen TV owner's fantasy. Bradbury's vision of a totalitarian society is as scary as anything out of &quot;1984,&quot; but ultimately Bradley was mistaken in believing that television could pacify the masses for totalitarianism. In fact, instant communications has made a totalitarian government, which relies on total control of information, less likely. The book is brief, checking in at a quickly read 160 pages. And this edition features a couple of scenes Bradbury wrote later on that were not featured in the original novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The Firemen of tomorrow do not put out fires anymore..... they START them. This story about a fireman doubting his job is absolutely riveting. Guy Montag thought he was happy. Then a girl named Clarisse came onto the scene. Her sudden disappearance and/or death leads to his unsettlement. When his wife, Mildred turns him in, he must burn his own house. He finds hope with a group of shabby old professors. Ray Bradbury must have been psychic to write a book that hits this close to home. Who knows, Fahrenheit 451 may be the future. This book is a MUST for children to read in the classroom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel portrays the abuse of technology, and how it can permanently alter society in traumatic ways. Fahrenheit 451 is one of Ray Bradbury's most influential masterpieces. It has the power to change your &quot;mindset&quot; on our world, and, basically, your idea of the &quot;fate&quot; of our species."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book should be on everyones bookshelves and should be required reading for every middle school student. Instead we force rot our children's brains with Harry Potter nonsense along with other books of fluff and non substance. Farenheit 451 might be science fiction but I believe it to also be an insight into things to come.It is hard for me to imagine that someone with a phd supposedly would give this book a 1 for review, but at least even that sheds a bit of hope on our civilization. At least for the time being we can all still have our differences. I do question though if it was actually read instead of some form of protest over a required reading.This is a well thought out short book (approximately 180 pages), no sex scenes, a few curse words (the typical) and even the violent scenes do not dwell on the blood and gut portions of death, therefore making this an acceptable book for any level of reading. I my opinion this should probably be the first science fiction book anyone picks up to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When my youngest son read Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451 for his honors English class, he was amazed that I had never read it - so much so that he went out and purchased a copy for me. It's easy to see why this book has become standard reading in High Schools and Universities. Bradbury is obviously an accomplished writer, and he focuses on the timeless topics of freedom of information, government control and war. Written nearly 55 years ago, he could have never realized how close to the mark he was going to hit regarding the central role virtual relationships would play in our world today. A quick and worthy read that you need to squeeze into your schedule."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can't believe that some people could read this book and not understand why it is important. This book is a classic for a reason. Underneath the dystopian surface are truths- and frightening resemblances to our own society. When I read this for the first time, I was shocked and pleased to hear that there is someone else who thinks like me. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for turning a critical eye on your future, peices of our present (the books is frighteningly prophetic) and writing your anthem for all of us who choose to think and not just follow."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury wrote an absolute classic on the subject of human freedom and censorship. The outstanding characteristic of this little book (I was done in 2 days) is that it does not rely on an opposive state (as does 1984), but rather on a society that chooses to distance itself from books.The basic irony in the story is that, after houses were made fireproof sometime in the future, there was no more job for the firemen. As society sought to occupy such spare capacity, it chose to eliminate books, as they constituted a hazard. To me, the most outstading part of the book is Bradbury's description of how man turned away from knowledge, starting with minorities feeling oppressed by those who \\"knew more\\". In order to achieve happiness, society had to eliminate the feeling of inferiority some people had, and such inferiority was largely linked to books.The most interesting point, however, is that this book was not rendered false by time; the future depicted is quite similar to one we see today in the world and in the U.S. We have people who are not knowledgeable about an ongoing war, despite being aware of it; there are people outside the country who hate us, but we don't really know why (remind you of anything?); there is a growing sense that we are not free to express our views in fear of offending someone; and lastly, TV and instant gratification is suplanting the need to know and deeply understand the world and who we are.In the book, it took a young girl and an old professor to awaken our hero, Guy Montag. Though we are not yet burning books, it seems like the general direction was correct. I highly recommend this book; to me, the best test is the fact that, after reading it, I really wished I had written it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not going to waste a lot of time describing _Fahrenheit 451_. There's over 1,000 reviews on Amazon alone. I'm sure most people know that it tells of a dystopian future in which books have been banned, and how firemen are employed to start fires instead of fighting them. Even some of those who have not read the book have at least that superficial idea.What makes _Fahrenheit 451_ so nightmarish is how this society came to be. This was not the result of a totalitarian dictator or government, it was the will of the people. Somewhere along the way, people tired of being challenged, both intellectually and morally, by books. Bland, inoffensive, and mind-numbing forms of recreation dominated the cultural landscape. Commentators on the ailments of the human condition became enemies of the state, while the true disease itself went unchecked. There are quite a few out there who think something like this can't happen in these \\"enlightened\\" times.It's already happening. The cirriculum throughout the American school system is being dumbed down far below the capabilities of the average student. Public libraries are being underfunded, and in many cases, closed down completely. Authors and intellectuals are given far less reverence than celebrities who hold on to their fame through idiotic publicity stunts rather than through talent and hard work.So, I might not have told you anything you don't know already. I won't be offended if you choose to brush off everything I mentioned previous to the point I'm about to make. Read _Fahrenheit 451_. Take a good look at the cultural and intellectual climate of society today. Ask yourself if this is what you want our future to be.Me neither."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazon.com recommended Fahrenheit 451 to my list a long time ago and I just now got around to reading it, somewhat skeptical at first because the description on the back of the book seemed, at best, cheesy. The publisher might want to rethink the blurb. But, I read it anyway, and am thoroughly impressed not only with the style of writing, but also with the complexity of the situation presented. In a novel where books are banned because they cause too much 'free thinking' and 'confusion' for those who fail to understand them or don't want to read them, there are a lot of fairly frightening similarities to the way society is progressing today. Granted, I don't believe we will ever burn all the books of the world, but it is a cruel reminder how many people are ignorant to the importance of books, whether fiction or non-fiction. It also reminded me how much I enjoy cracking open a new book with its characteristic smell and feel, and how much I, as a reader, would miss that privilege."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is very hmm how can I say this? Well, there are acutally no words at all to describe the great masterpiece that Mr.Bradubry conjured up over 50 years ago. Many of the kids nowadays ( I am a freshman in high school!) are saying &quot;This book sucks, etc etc.&quot; Well, don't you see it? The kids of today are ALREADY turning into the Mildreds and Firemen of tommorow! They are putting this book down because THEY are the firemen and Mildreds of today.....This book shows a prfound truth in today's culture and generation, our generation. Mr.Bradbury has showed us a future, no not a future, but of a PRESENT to us that if we stand around idly this future will occur. Remember Faber'sline......&quot;I saw the way things were going, a long time back. I said nothing. I'm one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the 'guilty,' but i did not speak and thus became guilty myself.&quot; I believe this is one of the most moving and truthful and insightful lines in this book, for it shows what will happen in our tommorow.This is a plea for help, if anyone is reading this, do all you can to proclaim this book to the masses. If we do not spread this around, we will crumble. All of the freethinkers and people that think &quot;Outside the box&quot; will be crushed by the fiery hand and ax of tommorow's society. We are a dying race, the rebels, the freethinkers, all of us. Do not give in. If they burn our houses, burn with them. Do not cave in to pop-culture's ideals and guildlines we must follow. Is America truly &quot;A land of the Free?&quot; I think not. We are slowly simmering in this melting pot and we will slowly begin to melt away....For example, the other day at lunch, my friend and i were talking, and i asked him,&quot;Josh, if a new machine was invented would you ask, 'How it works?' or, 'What's its purpose'. He replied 'How?'. I asked him a myriad of questions like this and i realized what our world is coming to. Yes, like Josh, all of the smart ones of the world are becoming mechanical, ruled under the constraints of society, sub-conciously. All of our intellects are starting to perish. Our smarts will be used for inventing Seashell radio's and TV walls and the Robot Dogs of the future. No more will we be appreciated for our philosophies, thoughts, our ideas, insights; No, but we will be appreciated for how happy we can make the masses and how happy we are will be our number one priority. Please, if you have children, please please do not let them be swayed by commercial jingles or catch phrases or tunes. I am a kid, only one kid, but if this message gets accross to another, i will have succeeded in spreading this message of a scary new world. I believe this new world is an apocalypse to freethinkers, and we must unite before anything happens, we must not sit idly, as Faber's costly mistaken took its toll. Mr.Bradbury's best book ever, a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to describe what a powerful charge this slender little book carries. You read it and wonder how Bradbury was able to make a prediction so spot-on accurate way back in the 1950s when he wrote this. There are scenes and lines that are etched in my mind permanently: the Mechanical Hound and its procaine snout; Mildred crying when Montag reads &quot;Dover Beach&quot; to her but not understanding why; Beatty's chilly monologues on sedating the masses by stuffing them with useless facts; 17-year-old Clarisse tasting the rain on her tongue. I once read a book on meditation that described ideas as having sound, structure and weight. The ideas in Farenheit 451 seem to have those properties, so vividly does Bradbury present them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'll admit it, in the interest of full disclosure: I don't like Ray Bradbury. Not so much his work, but him. His quasi-luddite persona that distrusts ATMs but dreams of flying cars, his palpable (and occasionally justified) pretentiousness that allowed him to transcend pulp sci-fi in the 50s while still pandering to that crowd. That out of the way...Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for a high school sophomore/junior about the dangers of anti-intellectualism and censorship. It is a bracing look at what such policy might lead to. It's fairly well-reasoned and it remains gripping throughout. On the other hand, however, it lacks the sort of over-arching philosophy that can be found in other dystopias. Although it's a great way to get into the subgenre, it's by no means the only or best word upon the subject. It happens to be oversimplified and narrow in focus.It is also, though, excessively didactic. There's very little nuance here, and it's none too subtle about getting across its message. It doesn't quite match up to 1984 and Brave New World, both of which ponder higher philosophical questions and give us plausible scenarios in which the human spirit is broken. In fact, 1984 is now only really significant in its portrait of humanity, since the state it depicts is no longer achievable (I guess Orwell never thought that it would be companies and individuals and not the government who would develop computer technology). Brave New World is the most prophetic of all, largely because it depicts the final showdown of the human spirit and the wheels of society not as a bang, but a whimper, with people so preoccupied with sex and drugs that they just push out thoughts when they come.In fact, Fahrenheit 451 is not all that prophetic. As a warning sign, sure, it retains currency, but it was written before the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement, in Eisenhower's America, where paranoia over Red invasion and Soviet spies like the Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss made such private invasion seem inevitable in the name of preserving liberty. In fact, restrictions on expression have been almost infinitely eased since 1954. The Supreme Court under Earl Warren began to strike down state obscenity laws prohibiting mostly porn, but also avant-garde films, to the point now where they're all gone. I'm not about to argue that the arts now are more vital and important than they ever have been, but it helps when the most popular show on TV is The Sopranos when it used to be All in the Family. Now, much more than ever, we live in a society where the minority is free to say what they wish, thanks to the Internet, the great equalizer. That these voices don't all make it into the mainstream is the fault of the media corporations and the anti-intellectual public, not moral queasiness by the majority. In fact, looking at the 50's, with the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for refusing to answer questions about Communists, where being a Communist and speaking out against the government (in some circumstances) were crimes, and Joe McCarthy decrying such people as Arthur Miller and Defense Secretary George C. Marshall as Communists, it is difficult to argue that censorship has worsened. In every measureable respect, things have gotten much better. That's not to say that tomorrow it might go the other way, but it hasn't and it probably won't.In spite of the recent Ray Bradbury renaissance, we need to put all of his work into context. The outwardly-happy-inwardly-freaked-out 1950s led to many great artistic works, like On The Waterfront and film noir, as well as great popular works, like The Twilight Zone, all of which had underneath them the peculiar paranoia of the time. Fahrenheit 451 is no different, and I would implore you to read it and take this into account. It is highly readable, but let's be honest about its impact and accuracy as prediction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a young writer, Bradbury bubbles with ideas in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", and the end result is a nice little novel about the evils of censorship and government control. The protagonist, a book-burner named Guy Montang, turns a complete 180 during the beginning of the novel, falling into the lure of freethinking in a world of blarring propaganda and social norms, of repressed emotions and the fast-paced, dangerous city lifestyle.The book has faults. The actual writing is spotty at times, and the extremely circumstantial plot does not complement the thought-provoking concept presented in F451. This is not written as well as, say, Orwell's 1984, and likewise it is not as powerful or as captivating. Though the two books cannot be fairly compared, it proves as an example that the book is lacking something, that sustenance of style that makes a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not a science fiction fan in the least, but this is such a classic - how can you NOT like it? It speaks volumes on the way things are today even. I so respect the author's views and thoughts on life and censorship. I think it should make us all pause and consider our own lives and if we're living them to the fullest and grabbing it by the horns!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Just finished Fahrenheit 451 this past week after reading it well over 5 years ago in 7th grade. Back then I thought it was a nice little book to read but unfortunately missed all of the key messages that Ray Bradbury was addressing in our society today.5 years later, I picked this book up again and was blown away again by the story itself and what I missed years ago.Guy Montag is a fire fighter in the non-traditional sense. The setting is an age where houses have been fireproofed not against house fires but against their own fire departments.Books are banned in this society , an atomic war is looming over the heads of the city, and above all of this is the agony that Guy Montag must face as he makes a decision on questioning the same job he has faithfully executed year after year.This novel is both fascinating and unnerving with the same turn of a page. A future where movies and television (parlors) block out all of our problems instead of addressing them could very well happen one day. A future where books are no longer useful in a society dominated by the entertainment value of Hollywood.A fine read if you ever get the chance to pick up this novelTravis S"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok, I saw the movie \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and I thought it was well-made (even though I didn't agree with most of the content). So, the next day I hear that Ray Bradbury (the author of this novel) is furious at Michael Moore for stealing his title. The name sounded really catchy and this dispute sounded like it could brew into a controversy between Moore and Bradbury. Also, I wanted to see what the whole thing was about since they label it a classic.So, I picked up the book and I was blown away. This book is really short yet it is so intriguing. It's basically about this guy who is in a futuristic time where the government does not allow people to read books. If you are caught with them, they have a special crew of \\"firefighters\\" who go and torch your books (hence Fahrenheit 451: The temperature at which paper burns). Kinda weird, eh? Well, it gets better. This society basically doesn't think on it's own. The reason that books are not allowed is because that they influence people to think and it does not fit well into this new society.Then the protagonist (who is a \\"firefighter\\") wonders what is so powerful about books after witnessing a lady willingly being torched to death with her books. He is very unhappy with his life and figures that maybe the content that books contain (which he has never read before) might be the key to livening up his useless life.I'll stop there and let you figure the rest out for yourself because this is one book that you would want to read without much knowledge of it. It's quick, yet thought provoking about how society even today could change into something similar to that. Excellent read. Make this a definite addition to your potential reading list."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was a Ray Brudbury fan for a long time before I finally picked up this book. I have to say, while it is a brilliant piece of utopian literature and should be required reading, the fact that Bradbury threw it together on a pay typewriter in a public library shows. The underlying point of the book comes across sharp and clear, but at the expense of much of what is quintessential Bradbury. His deep probings of character and deep pools of thought are whisked away to make room for a fast-paced story that in my own opinion could have been at least twice as long. Anyhow, let Farenheit 451 be your door into Bradbury's world, and when you're done pick up Something Wicked or Dandelion Wine, find your way to the Illustrated Man or the October country and you'll find Bradbury's real treasure"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Though I was long familiar with many of Bradbury's works, I had put off reading Fahrenheit 451 in favor of other books until a friend lent it to me recently. After finishing it, I'm angry with myself for having taken so long to pick it up. This book is a fantastic tale of a future society that abandons intellectual development and destroys its books. Like all great literature, it offers insight into our society today despite having been written over a half-century ago, and it continues to reward reading today.This book is more than a seminal work of dystopian literature, however; it is also one of the most elegant meditations on the value of literature in modern society that I have ever read. In envisioning a society that destroys books, Bradbury has to explain what is lost as a result. His answer, as we see in Faber's expositions during Montag's visit, is the exact thing which makes this book worth reading - the insights we gain into our own world and our own lives through reading. Integral to this process, of course, is the fact that people must read them and put what they take from them to good use for a society to thrive; as Bradbury notes, the first step towards the world of his novel was taken when people stopped reading. It is this message which makes this book essential reading, especially in a society where entertainment today bears an ever-closer resemblance to the noise-dominated media depicted in Bradbury's nightmarish future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are only going to get one Bradbury novel this should be it. There are many reviews about the plot, so I will not go into that. The story is one of the greatest ever told. Bradbury is very adamant on his views of education and reading and writing. This book proves that our ability to express feelings would be lostwithout writing. Get this book, but with some caution. It may seem a bit boring at first, but once you read it a few times you will grow to love it. A great work of art should not be very acessible, and this is a great work of art."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic story of the dark ages. Guy Montag, a fireman with the job of burning books, sees a problem with book burning after meeting a nonconformist neighborhood girl. Ultimately, this leads Montag on a path which encourages him to discover books. While he was told books are nonsensical and useless, he discovers their beauty. Montag rebels, destroying his own home and killing the fire chief. As a fugitive, he ends up on the outskirts of the city when a war destroys his former homeland. The insinuation is that the book keepers who live outside the city will bring about the end of the dark age, rebuilding civilization.Bradbury's futuristic society is effective because he creates a thorough picture of the future. In the same breath, I think the scenario is realistic because people do not read as often as they once did. It made me think about the likelihood of a new dark age.The story starts off slowly. Montag seems to have an unhealthy obsession with the young girl. But as the story develops, more conflicts are evident. As a consequence, the story flows more smoothly. I particularly enjoyed the police chase. The mechanical hounds seemed very realistic. They would seem to be such an effective crime fighting tool for this day and age.I would suggest this book is a classic. If you enjoyed &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, or &quot;Animal Farm&quot; for the ideas they stood for, you should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury seemed very confusing and weird just from reading the back of the book. Soon after reading the first few chapters, finding out this novel wasn't bad at all, actual pretty well written and interesting. It broadened my view of censorship and the fascinating situations in this book that have extreme resemblances to a world that doesn't seem so far from our own.Guy Montag is a fireman whose job is to find hidden books and burn them. Even from the start it is made apparent that Montag had a discomfort about his job. His new neighbor Clarisse McClellan helps to make his realize this and that reading and learning is not bad. His boss, the Fire Chief doubts his dedication to this job as is he. In a world where knowledge is strictly prohibited, Montag discovers the importance of literature. All the characters in this book are clearly described to come a live, made to imagine there actions and words.This book will make you wonder what it holds for us in the future, a world without books. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone searching for a beautifully written novel for all ages."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was a very realistic novel. I believe the future will bring people to eventually hate books. There are more and more ways to read a book without even reading. Television is a big part in why people today do not want to read. Children begin watching TV at a very early age and just lose complete interest in reading period. There have been studies where watching television for a couple of hours each day causes ADD which will effect the amount of reading a person will do.This is an easy read for any type of reader. There is a clearly outlined plot. There is nowhere to get confused or even lost. Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books. Now you might think a fireman burning books is lame but it really just makes this entire novel so much more interesting to read. The people can't even remember the last time a fireman put out a fire! Than Guy Montag's new neighbor clarrise shows him why reading is not bad but good. Clarrise shows him the beauty of reading and all of its positive feedbacks. Of course this is a very dangerous game he is playing for if he would get caught he could be arrested.

It showed me a picture of the future if the government would not be controlled by the people and books would be banned from reading which would make the people be equal. This would be a problem because there would be bad leaders and people would not be very happy about it. I liked how Montag was standing up for the people which were connected with the books to help them out because he could not believe how the world was run by people who wanted to control the people and rule the country until they die. I learned from Montag that you need to do some courageous things to make this go better and live on a side to spread the word of books which might be passed on and on until the people understand that reading is good for people and people should be smarter in order to have strong leaders not leaders that want everyone to be equal and not allow to do things they want and whenever they want. The books would allow the people to show their emotion and to get over stuff that was difficult to deal with and they also teach us new stuff and expand our knowledge. The literature was banned in the society in which Montag lived because the leaders wanted them equal."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book was recieved in a really well condition.

Although the book is not your everyday entertainment its still good for school assignments."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very little in the way of review is required for this classic novel, given that its content and themes are so well known. I will, however, attempt to give a response to this monumental work.Fahrenheit 451 addresses the subject of censorship by depicting a society in which books are forbidden. The destruction (by fire) of any books discovered represents a form of social control which is, essentially, a distortion of utilitarian ethics. The fire chief, Captain Beatty, explains to the novel's primary character, Montag, that the work of a \\"fireman\\" is to assure happiness for the many. Utilitarianism, of the kind promoted by John Stewart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, judges the ethical correctness of any action according to whether or not it produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. The character of Beatty argues that books have a disruptive influence on society: \\"[W]e can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, what do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right?\\" Happiness for the majority is encouraged by \\"the parlor\\" (a form of television) which entertains and generates contentment by avoiding material which could stimulate independent thought and, therefore, anxiety.Montag, however, becomes increasingly dissatisfied with this stagnant social situation, and curiously (given his lack of exposure to books) he expresses his disquiet through an apparent reference to Plato's Republic: \\"Maybe books can get us out of the cave.\\" While this may seem an unlikely observation, it neatly signifies the growing enlightenment in Montag and his desire for further enlightenment - both for himself and for his society. It also draws attention to a somewhat ironic parallel. In matters related to education, Plato was very selective about which works of literature should be used, just as only a few books (mostly technical manuals) are permitted in the society imagined here by Ray Bradbury.But books aren't really the issue for Bradbury; what matters is the freedom of ideas they represent. Books themselves are mere receptacles. Bradbury's interest clearly lies in the censorship of ideas, not the medium that carries them.Fahrenheit 451 deserves its status as a classic. It beautifully conveys the power (and the fear) of ideas, and the conflict between the conservative and pioneering tendencies in human consciousness. It easily earns five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury a long while ago, but then I've read it again and watched the movie I couldn't say how many times. It's one of those stories you can read, or view, over again. The story is placed in a futuristic society where books are banned and firemen set fire to them wherever they're found. What brings this story back to prominence, for me anyway, is the gradual cessation of printing that has begun as a result of the evolution of electronics. And many schools are also no longer teaching children script. Where might it all end. I remarked to a friend recently about just this situation and she responded with: \\"I'd create a suitable place within my basement to keep books safe\\". That is exactly the sense that one develops while reading \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". The movie follows the book, however, I'd read the story first. And one idea Mr. Bradbury had which has always provided me wonder is the memorizing of book contents. An idea that was copied in the movie \\"The Book of Eli\\". Mr. Bradbury has always been a favorite of mine as has \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I have read it through three times now and love it every time. The interesting changes of the future, but steady curiosity of the main character kept me wondering. A splendid story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The narration is more cerebral than story-driven even though Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is one engaging dystopian thriller. What continually surprises me, as well as countless other reviewers, is how prophetic the novel has become. Predicting the future, even only for the sake of story, has a tendency to unravel a novel's relevancy if enough years pass since the original publication. Even that's putting it softly. A novel about the future will cease to matter UNLESS, as in the case of Fahrenheit 451, the story ages in a state of becoming mostly true.My favorite bit of wisdom came from the author's afterward of the particular edition I was reading. To summarize, he commented that people of all ages and all creeds have the potential and often do engage in the act of book burning without ever lighting a single match."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book in high school and loved it. Since then, I've read it again and still love it. Fahrenhiet 451 addresses the serious issues of censorship and how a controlled society of this sort could limit the well being of society as a whole. In this frightening world Ray Bradbury created, books are not allowed and people are encouraged to escape into fantasy television shows that encourage shallow thinking. Guy Montag, a fireman who burns books, begins to question his reality and sets out on a journey in pursuit of freedom and truth. The novel is highly thought provoking because it encourages its readers to think about societal rules and to question the structural foundations of the group mentality. It was also an exciting read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What else can be said about Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451? Nothing, but I'll try. It is an amazing book, with an amazing plot, an amazing story, and it must be read by anyone who enjoys dystopian themes. The world that Ray Bradbury envisions in Fahrenheit 451 is as close to realistic horror as it can get for any thinking individual - not even Stephen King could create anything as truly horrific."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to think of what to write in a review for your favorite novel, but I will certainly try. Fahrenheit 451 is frightening in the fact that the events laid out are plausible; it's completely accessible to a variety of readers. It has everything that a dystopic novel needs, even if the future setting is a bit vague. Bradbury's writing has stood the test of time and there's no doubt that high schoolers will still be studying this novel in another 50 years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD.

Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Watch tv, sheeple.In the future, books are banned, and drugs and the good old electronic screen are used to keep the population docile and uninformed. Firemen don't put out fires here, they burn books when they are found, in a big macho showy way. One such bloke begins to have doubts about his occupation and society, and breaks away."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced.

I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"They say Bradbury's amazing, but he really didn't impress me at all. It seems that he tried to write in such a sophisticated way that the book became boring. The Fahrenheit 451 is slow going, and very hard to understand. We had to read this book as a class and almost everyone found it confusing. Even the ending hardly made any sense. The book is going on like normal, and suddenly it all ends abruptly. Bradbury has failed to make the writing interesting, and it is not easy to tell what's going on. For example, the whole plot is not appealing. There is a society where books are not allowed, and Montag (the man who burns alot of books) ends up liking books. He has to run away from others and hide for a long time. Some details were completely unnecessary, and had nothing to do with the book. As soon as the book starts getting even a little good, Bradbury drifts off to another topic and that slows down the whole flow of the book. When some things were going on in the book, it is like Bradbury didn't want to get off that same topic at all. If something happened, or there was a discussion, Bradbury made it as long as possible. The book failed to entertain me, and I do not reccommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called &quot;brilliant classics&quot; the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it.

I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly.

The main character is a &quot;fireman&quot; named Guy Montag who begins to realise that books are'nt really so bad, and he rebels. Firemen in this society don't put out fires, they burn the books.

The totalitarian state forbids books and most of the people don't question it or offer no resistance. Guy Montag, the main character of the novel, is one of the firemen, who have the assignment to burn books. Until he witnesses, that an old woman wants to die with her books, Guy Montag doesn't question any orders and even likes his job, but after that experience he begins to think about the meaning and power of literature/books and history.The novel 'Fahrenheit 451\` shows, what kind of terrible things censorship can do to a society and the importance of free speech. We need to think for ourselves and never accept everything. The author maybe wanted to express a warning through this novel about a society we might have to live in some day. I think this novel is suitable for school reading, because it includes important topics which can be discussed well in class with a teacher, although I didn't really enjoy reading it. It's not a book I would like to read in my freetime, but in class there might be interesting topics to think and discuss about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an &quot;F&quot; grade. It squeeks two stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have infinite patience when I am personally pretentious, self-absorbed, and dull. I don't have the same patience when I read books that are that way, though.The story is about a futuristic world where knowledge, thought, and argument have been banished in favor of momentary happiness, thrill, and pleasure. The protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman. In the future, instead of fighting fires, they are in charge of lighting them. They are the front line defense for society against the societal decay caused by books, so their job is to go around burning down the houses of those who own and read books. Montag, at some point, realizes the importance of books and instantly becomes an enemy of the state, a target of the same department that he worked for.One problem with this book is in the fact that Bradbury can't create a realistic world in which these events could become a reality. Granted, he was writing 50 years ago, so he wouldn't have had knowledge of the type of entertainment which exists today, but all he seems able to conjure up is the concept of immediate, personalized entertainment as if that is the only type of entertainment that would remain. He creates a world (or just a city, because this type of environment only seems to exist in the city) where people are zombies sitting in their homes surrounded by television screens that are running all the time telling the people what they should think and feel. Conceptually he wasn't wrong, it's just his clumsy handling of the telling. He can't create a solid series of steps that lead from the present day to that future (though he tries). He can't recreate the sort of television show that these people would watch, and he can't explain clearly why anyone would want to watch it.Beyond the setting, the characters themselves are one-dimensional. They are all archetypes, and none have the spark of life which would make them interesting. Clarisse, the dangerous intellectual adolescent; Montag, the newborn Man whose eyes have recently been open; Faber, the reluctant wise man; Beatty, the hardened symbol of the State, who is a very capable parry to the thrusts of Faber; none of the characters have any depth whatsoever.The writing itself was a pain to read. Bradbury can't seem to figure out which word he needs to use, so he opens a thesaurus and dumps as many words as he can onto the page. In addition, he wanders off on tangents without bringing those tangents back to the main storyline. Furthermore, his dire need to make his point (a panoply of ideas is good, not bad) by either having the characters themselves soliloquize it, or by doing it himself in wandering, dull monologues. This is the sort of self-absorption I allude to in the title to this review.To drive home the fact that Bradbury thinks he's God's gift to knowledge, the afterword and coda and interview with the author leave nothing to the imagination. According to Bradbury himself, he's got tons of ideas of how to make the story better. None of those ideas have to do with improving the writing, just making each character's monologue longer. He claims to refrain from adding those updates to this edition of the book (50th anniversary edition) because he feels the original text, as the author wrote it, is pristine and perfect. His contempt for editors is plainly spelled out at various places in the tacked-on content.I really can't recommend this book to anyone who has already graduated from high school. The story is poor. The writing is poor. The author's point is all it's got of value, and even that is nothing special. It may be helpful to know the character of Guy Montag in case it ever comes up in conversation, but other than that, I can't think of any reason to spend time with this book. 2 stars"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school. I know it has been marked a classic, but i found it incredably boring and a overdone. I thought it was overrated. I can read trashy entertaining books, but i also read classics. I only like to read the trash, or the entertainment when i know its trash or entertainment. I found the characters in the book shallow (Like Clarisse) and under developed. It was too bland and meaningless for what people make of it. And the phoenix metaphor at the end? That was a chiche. I wouldn't say this is a bad book, i mean its fairly well written, but i found 1984, which had a similar cautionary note to it and was also a Dystopian novel much more meaningful."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can see why so many people like the works of Ray Bradbury. He is a very effective story teller, he has a particular talent for building vivid imagery with few words (his \\"less is more\\" style is DEFINITELY a winner) and he is able to take very important, very relevent modern themes and inject them into his stories. In this story, we see how Bradbury has taken aim at the world of electronic media as an advancement that very well may, over time, become the downfall of mankind.So why did I only give him three stars? Two reasons: (1) While Bradbury is long on imagery, in this book he's short on character development. It works well with the protagonist's wife because Bradbury created her to be shallow and indifferent, but what about the young neighbor girl who was so intriguing and just disappeared one day, with no explanation at all? As for the protagonist and his \\"boss,\\" their characters weren't developed to the point where I cared for them either way. In order for a novel-length story to be a good one, you have to have at least one character that you identify with or get emotionally attached to, and that doesn't happen here. (2) As in \\"The Martian Chronicles,\\" Bradbury puts his dystopian society to an end by dropping the big bomb on it, leaving the small band of survivors to go on to -- what? Sorry; end of story. Makes me wonder if Patricia Cornwall was schooled in the not-so-fine art of ending books by Bradbury..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazing. Up there with George Orwell's 1984 and Alodous Huxley's Brave New World."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story was ok. For a short book it kept me mildly interested. The most interesting part was reading the 'Afterward' from the author about why he wrote this piece.

Unlike today, all houses and buildings are fireproof, making you think firemen would be unnecessary. Firemen however, have a different job. They burn books. If a civilian is found with a book, Guy Montag and the other firemen burn it, and the person is sent to jail. All his life Montag had thought burning books was the right thing to do, something to which the world had become accustomed. Then he met 17-year-old Clarisse. She had what was then considered an unusual family. They would just sit and talk for hours at a time. Montag begins to form a friendship with this girl, and comes to believe she has a lot to teach him. Clarisse walks Montag to work everyday, talking to him about many things; her uncle, about how people don't talk about anything, and about the wonder of books. Then, one day, Clarisse disappears. She isn't there when Montag walks to work, making him surprised and confused. After a few days without Clarisse, Montag asks around, and finds out she was killed in a car crash a few days ago. Not having Clarisse to discuss life with causes Guy to wonder, is burning books right? What ideas do these books hold? This story is continued as a trail of where this thought takes him, and of the tragedies and joys that occur because of it. I believe the writing style of this book fits what Ray Bradbury expects life to be like in the future. It seems to be slow, dry, and boring. Bradbury uses detail to the point where it is meaningless. He gives three examples when one would do, and elongates things until they are uninteresting. At one point in the story Montag is sitting in the firehouse, listening to all of the sounds. Bradbury explains about \`the flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the time voice in the firehouse ceiling, and the tick of playing cards on the greasy tabletop.' It would have been much easier and quicker to use two examples and get on with the story. No part about the book hooked me, and I had a hard time finishing it. Although the plot was good, this book could easily have been fifty pages shorter. The author is also very repetitive; using the same dry language many times over. Words like pretty, and nice can be found repeatedly as the story progresses. Although I'm not in love with this story, I think it's worth reading. This book made me realize how in America we always talk about being having freedom of speech, but never what we can or can't read. I can't imagine a world where one of the things I love the most was outlawed. Overall, I can't really give this book a number of stars. Scoring Fahrenheit 451 on my enjoyment, it gets about two stars, but on making me think, it gets five."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"...and seriously though-provoking.

This novel takes place in a world that is vividly described by Bradbury. I rate Fahrenheit 451 five stars because of the adventure and curiosity. With events happening at every page, Bradbury keeps the readers on their toes! With the main character being Guy Montag, a fireman, whose job wasn't to stop fires, but to start them. He liked his job until he met a seventeen year old girl that tells him about the past, and a retired English professor telling him about the future. In this wondrous world where books were depressing and illegal, Montag finally knew what he was supposed to do a long time ago. This novel has events running by, rapidly, happening one after another, this novel is full of fun and excitement! This book always makes you want to read more, from the time you pick up the book and until you put it back down, you will never want to put it back down. Ray Bradbury leaves readers with suspense and tension at the end of each time you pick up the book, this is definitely, without a doubt, the best book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Like all great books that cause a stir, either because of their &quot;ideas&quot; or the fact that they're so shocking (think Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; or &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; took its place long ago among the classics. But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as &quot;fiction.&quot; How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and starts to burn... Why on earth would you want to know that? . Because that is extremely important in this book, due to the fact that its main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. However, he is not a fireman in the way we now understand that word: a man that tries to stop fires. Here, firemen burn books.Bradbury tells us about a place where books are forbidden: nobody can read them, or have them, without committing a crime. The authorities consider that they are dangerous, and because of that they make firemen burn them, and the houses where they were.Everything changes for Montag due to two things. To begin with, he gets to know Clarisse, a young girl that makes him see life from another perspective. Secondly, one day the unexpected happens: he cannot help but read a line of a book he was burning. Of course, Montag gets curious, and as a result, he steals some books, and decides to read them.That causes him many problems, as he begins to put into question things he took for guaranteed before. With the help of Faber, and old former professor who still remembers how things were before books were forbidden, Montag starts to think about a way to change things... Will he be able to do that?. I don?t want to give away more about the book, so read it and you will know :)It is worthwhile to point out that &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautiful story, so wonderfully written that it is very easy to read. Notwithstanding that, I believe that the more important aspect of this book is that it is a good way to remember why we like books so much, and what a privilege it is to be able to have them.Thanks to Bradbury?s imaginary dystopia we realize once again that something that Heinrich Heine said is true: &quot;It is there, where they burn books, that eventually they burn people too&quot; (&quot;Dort, wo man Bucher Verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am, Ende Menschen&quot;). I think that the book?s message regarding the dangers of censorship and the importance of reading should remain with us...On the whole, I highly recommend &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; to you. Enjoy it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I like books that teach me things. Fahrenheit 451 is similar to other books like 1984 and Brave New World, where humanity is just a shell of what it used to be. However, 451 presents a problem much more slippery and troubling than 1984 in my mind. How do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped?Bradbury's prose takes a little getting used to, but his message needs to be understood. It's a message that grows more important everyday, with classics being exchanged for cliff notes and books being banned because they offend someone (huck finn, uncle tom's cabin, catcher in the rye). This is the first step to Bradbury's nightmare, culminating in the thought 'Everyone must be equal - not like the Constitution states - but *made* equal'.Editorializing a bit here, 451 represents to me the ultimate victory of things like MTV, reality television and political correctness. Humanity is reduced to one plastic mold - through laziness or censorship - and everyone is loving it. These characters don't realize how empty their lives are; instead of working out problems everyone retreats into their own world. Instead of attempting to answer humanity's most profound question, the world of 451 pretends they don't exist.One last thing: Clarisse is a trip - her character really catches a living quality I don't see often in books. With Fahrenheit 451, I learned a lot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most important and influential books of all time. In 1950, when it was written he didn't know he was going to predict today's society. Guy Montag, the protagonist, loved his work. There seemed to be nothing that he liked better than to spray kerosene on a pile of books and watch the pages curl and turn into ash. Until, one day he meets Clarisse, a 17-year-old girl who has been educated about the world. At one point in one of their conversation she asks if he is happy. Montag realizes that people should have the right to read books. He finds that books mean a lot to people when a woman chooses to burn herself with her books. Guy comes up with a plan to get revenge on other firemen in an effort to stop book banning.Montag's boss, Beatty tries to reason with Montag about the banishment of books saying \\"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs. Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy (61).\\" The people of Montag's society live under such a principle, even though at some times they may not know it.The turning point in the novel is when his wife, Mildred discovers what he is doing. She becomes scared. Eventually, she turns him in, and he is forced to burn his collection of books. This is the climax of the book because the reader is unsure what lies ahead. The adrenaline of the reader is at its highest, and ones mind is trying to think of all the possible outcomes.The censorship that is in Bradbury's novel comes from an inferior dictatorship. It is a culture that does not want its citizens to be lured into the meanings of books. Today, our culture is bombarded with advertisements. Everyday it seems as though we have less time to ourselves. Today we are not burning books and bookstores are popular, but we still seem to ban books for one reason or another. Fifty years later the book still remains relevant to our society.Fahrenheit 451 is a brilliant novel. In my opinion, it is as meaningful perhaps even more so than it was when it was written in 1950. The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and the importance of free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree totally or not. We must always be open to new opportunities that arise and never except the norm. Everyone should read Fahrenheit 451, take what they learn from it and apply it to their everyday lives. Overall, I think that the novel has a good message and I am glad that I spent my time reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 years ago in highschool, and just reread it last month. It was the feature book in our town's One Book, One City program. What I found was that F451 doesn't lose it's impact all these years later. The ideas of censorship, of book burning, of reading in general come sharply into focus as the reader experiences Montag's journey."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've read this book a couple of times and the truths of this book never cease to amaze me. Very similar to Orwell's 1984, this is the visionary look of what happens when government has too much power to control our lives and censure our media. In this story, books are the source of evil because they encourage free thinking and contain ideas that discourage the ideals of this government's philosophies. To control what people think, books are banned and burned by firemen. Firemen, as far as people believe (because books don't exist that disprove this), have always been around, burning books to protect the public from the evils they portray. This is the story of Guy Montag, who is a fireman.Guy Montag lives the life of any dedicated fireman. He does his job, pretends to be happy, and spends much of his income on TV walls so his wife can have more people in her \\"family\\" in which to converse with (and be controlled by).His life changes when he meets his seventeen year-old, free-thinking neighbor, Clarisse. Guy's eyes are open to a new world as he finds a new love for thinking for himself and discovering the wonders of books.This book has really appealed to me of late because of my own new-found love in books. If you don't appreciate having libraries in every town and an endless supply of books in which to enrich your imagination then you need to read this book so you can imagine what life would be like if books were banned along with your ability to think for yourself. Consider this a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A time honored classic, once a scary prophetic vision, and quite possibly, now a reality. Ray Bradbury's futuristic thriller, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; reads as both analogy and warning, and a dire one at that.This book has been on my &quot;let's read it in the near future&quot; list for some time. But it wasn't until the city of Portland, Oregon selected this book for their &quot;Everyone Reads&quot; campaign that I found the incentive to read it.This story spins a tale in the near future where reading is considered outlaw, that books are contraband, and any attempt of thinking outside the box is handled by extinguishing the threat. Guy Montag is a fireman, but not in the common sense; he starts fires instead of putting them out. He's &quot;married&quot; to Mildred, in a passionless marriage of convenience; Mildred who prefers to spend time in front of the television and listening to the radio in her life of hopelessness. Early on, he meets the fair Clarisse who boldly suggests to him that life is much more than starting fires. It is the tipping point of his decline, as his life begins to rush closer and closer to the incinerator itself.What impressed me about this book is that it was written in the early 1950's, and yet it reads as well as a modern novel. Bradbury would refute any attempts of suggesting he was forecasting the future, but so much of what he saw the future becoming has transpired. How many hours do our children spend in front of the television? And in these times, when our libraries are being threatened to track patron's records or monitor internet use, how far away are we from Bradbury's 451?It's both chilling and reflecting. As a dour warning for what might happen, we can take heed to this warning to ensure that we celebrate divergent thought and reading as a gift for our citizens and not something to fear. Whereas people would refute the claim that we would never burn books in America, why is it that this book so often has actually been banned from some libraries and schools across this country?We need to listen, and learn, lest we suffer the fate of Montag and start to live in a country and world so brilliantly premonitioned in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"'Fahrenheit 451' is a powerful story that imagines a future world where literature is burned and readers are imprisoned. Bradbury creates a whole dumbed-down society of people who are robbed of creative and independent thought, and where this deficit is enforced by law.I felt that the major shortcoming of the book was that the entire book smacks of '1984,' but it is not nearly as powerful as Orwell's story. 'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to &quot;help&quot; the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic.

The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on. I mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with 4 wall TVs, robot dogs, and burning books. And the story never really had an ending. It just stopped, I guess to end the boredom. I think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book. How else would it get on the required reading list? Maybe he gives 50% of the profits from sales. Please don't buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I found this book to be very dry and boring.

This story has some characters that are very different from each other. The main character Montag, who is a fireman who burns books instead of stopping fires, is very different from his wife Millie. His wife just watches TV all day and they call the actors their \\"cousins\\". Also their are so many different things that happen that you can't really keep up with them and you can't really understand it because you can;t understand what the characters do. The plot does not really make sense, it is about people who burn books and let me tell you it isn't very fun to read. I think that the the book is creative, but the Author should use something else to go with this story. The vocabulary was pretty good and he used good sentence, but they got confusing and you find yourself doing nothing with this book. The book just goes on and on and then you find yourself wanting to burn it like the fire fighters do. I would say that I recommend this book to probably no one because it isn't fun to read, you fall asleep during it and you can never feel suspended. People who like Sci-Fi stuff might, but it isn't really Sci-Fi ether."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 was just an ok book. I was lost most of the time and the book didn't really make too much sense to me. If i had to read this book over again i definitely wouldn't."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We all hold some novels so close to our hearts that we cannot view them dispassionately. For me, one such treasure is Fahrenheit 451. This is the novel that first awakened me to the possibility that science fiction could be about more than just action heroes, quick thrills and mindless drivel: that at its best, it honours a unique literary duty, allowing us to glimpse horrific futures that may actually come to pass if we leave the path of wisdom.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the finest examples of that sub genre of science fiction called dystopian fiction. Every science fiction writer of note has drawn from this well, but few as successfully as Bradbury. The only other authors to realise equal successes are Orwell with 1984 and Huxley with Brave New World. Some would add Gibson and Dick, but theirs are derivative works of a later generation. Of all such works, Bradbury&#65533;s is the most accessible. At his centre, Bradbury is an optimist while the others are not. Consequently, Fahrenheit 451 holds out the light of hope when the others leave us despairing.This book operates on countless levels. It can be read as a futuristic fable, a psychological drama, or a social commentary. It is a rich character study; a pounding plot-driven quest; an overwhelming thematic work, or a setting of sterile horror. In actuality, it is all of this and more. Rarely does one happen upon a work in which the parts fit together so exquisitely, and for this reason alone, it deserves its reputation as one of the greatest works in the genre.But it is the characters that make this book come alive. When the protagonist experiences the emptiness of a hollow life, the anguish of guilt, the glimmerings of a real love, the terror of blind panic or the despair of pursuit, it is as if these things are happening to us. Bradbury&#65533;s skill transforms science fiction into literature.This is not a book for juvenile minds. While it is written in tight, almost Spartan prose, and reads like a children&#65533;s novel, it is actually a highly philosophical work. In some ways palpable, but in more ways subtle, it focuses an unflinching light on those ugly aspects of our nature that impel us towards superficiality and mental sloth. It is no wonder that shallow readers and idle thinkers find this book unrewarding and depressing; even vaguely insulting. More thoughtful readers will be disturbed, but that will only be to Bradbury&#65533;s purpose.This work is really written for brave thinkers - those willing to confront unpleasantness and sweat for their rewards. Such readers, no matter what their age, will fall in love with this book. Bradbury exposes the failings of our natures with a perception and a depth of wisdom that few science fiction authors can reach. Most of all, his love for humanity shines through the darkness of his cautionary tale: and he has the literary courage to warn us against ourselves without the addition of artificial sweetener."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed the book through-and through. I haven't read since high school and found the second time refreshing. Montag, the questionable fireman, discovers truth in the cave of reality while wife, Mildred, stares at walls of fiction. Beatty, the fireman, villified a brainless modern world with hopeless, while Clarisse fantasized about the future of tommorrow. Each character's desperate nature compelled me to read further. One taught who shouldn't, one inspired who knew better, one conspired who should have loved, one deceived who kinked the hose of knowedge, and one questioned everything who never did before.Bradbury's novel is one many can relate to in the modern world. His dystopian is filled with brillant biblical and philosophical allusions. His words are more poetry than prose. Like many of his novels he questions the heart and mind of the future in a world of new conveniences and conflicts.Bradbury's flaws are few. But like many books in the bible, with prophetic damnation there is also a promise. There is a glimpse of a new hope, but there is no second to this lonely motion. I would like him to push the plot onward. The baptism of Montag is just the end of an old life, but it's also the beginning of a new one.As I read Ray Bradbury's art work, I see a need for free thinkers, individuals who challenge daily. Many of the writers decorated in the text show this will to propell the individual past the barriers of social appropriateness. This is something I have always admired about his writing and will continue to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic parable that warns of the bleakness of a society in which political correctness has gone awry. The firemen in the story burn books (and the houses in which they are found) in an effort to save mankind from being offended by their contents. There are a couple of gripping passages in the middle of the story, amidst intense action sequences, in which the firemen's philosophy is expounded, and a history is given to explain the madness. In the words of the fire marshal (Beatty), &quot;Colored people don't like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don't feel good about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Burn it. Someone's written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book.&quot; And so on.The main character (and fireman) Montag evolves from someone who merely observes with a curious detachment the odd book-loving maverick around him, to an active participant in a quest to salvage what little is left by way of the written word. He is inspired by a little girl and an old man, both unconventional thinkers, and along the way, Montag's disdain grows for his conformist wife. [Curiously, and most prophetically, Montag's wife's love of interactive television (or its futuristic analog) ends up stripping her of any individuality or character, and causes Montag to tire of her more quickly.]A great read, all in all, with credible characters, creative and thought-provoking settings and devices (including a mechanical &quot;hound&quot; working for the fire department that tracks prey according to its hormonal makeup (or &quot;odor index&quot;), and dispatches it with a poison syringe), and a caustic tone that spares no one (the media, the government, religion, etc.). The story is totally conceivable, too (even today, despite its completion in 1953), which serves to scare the reader more than the most fantastic piece of fiction ever could. My edition had a riveting Afterward by Bradbury as well, circa 1979, in which the author inveighed against censorship and those who see fit to censor. In the author's own words, &quot;There is more than one way to burn a book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine a place where fire alarms alert firemen of where books are being held, and the firemen start fires that destroy those books along with the house and sometimes the people living inside of it. It is a time of censorship against all books. Guy Montag is one of the firemen, but a few people have helped him realize that what he is doing is wrong. But with this knowledge comes the betrayal of his wife and co-workers. Guy must escape the world in which reading is illegal.This book offers a fascinating glimpse at what the world, or at least the country, may become if books continue to be censored. Bradbury keeps the reader interested by citing books that many of us have read, including the Bible. And his topic of censorship still rings true, possibly more so than when it was written, due to the growing list of books censored from libraries and school curriculums. I recommend this book to anyone who recognizes the power of books and what society would be without them, but also to those who don't realize the power. Overall a wonderful book, written in a way that spans lifetimes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As much a clich&eacute; as it is to say, I think this book is even more relevant today then when originally written. I think Montag's wife's obsession with the &quot;real people&quot; she watches is such an uncanny parallel to the reality based shows that are so popular now that it's almost creepy. The fact that it was written so long ago only adds to the impact. There is also the similarity of the viewing walls and the 56 inch high definition T.V.s of today. It's a little like a horoscope though, the reader can read more into it then is there. Ray Bradbury's past future is dreary and bleak and no one cares for anyone else. I tend to be more of an optimist, I think there are still enough people in the world that care to prevent the kind of events that happen in this book to occur any time in the near future.I don't believe the main focus of this book (as most people think) is censorship at all but rather a love letter to books and the joy of reading. Mr Bradbury writes about the joys of reading as though he were describing a flesh and blood lover. He clearly despises censorship and complacency but he gives more of his passion to the love of the written word. I think the &quot;not happy, but hopeful&quot; ending shows his faith in man.This is literally a classic piece of fiction and it's impressive how much Ray Bradbury says in such a short novel. It's easy to read on several different levels. There's almost no excuse not to read this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who's job requires him to efficiently burn books when a call enters the station. In the future, the government, in control of millions of people, decides to make reading books against the law, fearing that a literate society would destroy itself.Guy, through the vision of a young girl and an old English professor, discovers his own wonderment of his surroundings, triggered through great ideas found in books. Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society.With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a profound book indeed, and I don't know how I can hope to do it justice. I think in many ways, Ray Bradbury is after us to think about happiness, and when we are better off being unhappy. This comes up several times -- the twisted, tragically fallen Fire Captain Beatty calls his firemen &quot;The Happiness Boys&quot; because they make melancholy and thoughtfulness more difficult, by burning literature. Later, when the hero -- Montag, the book-burning fireman who begins to question his job -- confronts his wife's friends, he tries as hard as possible to make them UNhappy about their boring lives, in the hope that it will wake them up to the world around them... The very first sentence of the book states &quot;It was a pleasure to burn&quot;, referring to Montag before he begins to wake up, and become an unhappy, sympathetic human being... Bradbury is getting at some important things here, such as how we can be most peaceful inside when we are questioning, when we are not happy. Older readers might want to think about reading John Milton's &quot;L'Allegro&quot; and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; to flesh out their own personal response to this book. I think younger readers, who could be reading this for school, might be interested in renting the movie &quot;Logan's Run&quot;. Both stories are about future societies, where order and happiness are maintained by weeding out anyone who seems capable of independent thought. In this story, that means burning all books. In &quot;Logan's Run&quot;, it means simply killing anyone who starts to get too old, who might start to have a little perspective. In both stories, the main character is a member of the elite, with a personal, professional stake in maintaining order, who suddenly begins to question the whole system, and ends up siding with his &quot;enemies&quot;, the thoughtful people. At any rate, this is really quite a tremendous book, and I hope a lot of people read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this story in 7th grade, and since then I have never been able to forget the amazing tale of Guy Montag and his job as a fireman. I will never forget the magic of Clarisse, who to this date is my favorite book character of all time. I loved this book immediately when I started reading it and I never put it down until I was finished.Guy Montag is a fireman. But it's not the kind of fireman that you and I know today. These firemen burn things. Books to be specific. It is said that books are not needed for the future, and are officially illegal. So when it is found out that people are in possession of books, the firemen come to the house or whatever hiding place, and burn the books, and sometimes also burn the house. Guy Montag meets a girl named Clarisse one night as he's walking home, and with that one conversation, his life makes a complete turn in his life, soon sheltering books in his own home.The story of Fahrenheit 451 is nothing but amazing. This book is unlike anything I have ever read, and to this date, is one of my favorite books of all time. Some people say that this book is &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;wish it would burn&quot; but these people don't understand the mentality of the book. You need to read into it and understand it fully before you go bashing it.The book Fahrenheit 451 even reflects some of our ignorance today, seeing as most of my friends hate reading. If only more people could get into this book. I would recommend Fahrenheit 451 to anyone I knew, even those friends who don't like reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns. If you have not read this book, now a cult classic, you wouldn't know that fact. Nor would you know that in Ray Bradbury's world of the future people don't say anything because they don't know anything. And they don't know anything because they don't have books. At first books were leveled down to a sort of pastepudding norm by cuts that made them shorter, producing condensations and digests. Classics were cut to fill a two-column single page, winding up at last as a ten-line summary. Then books were outlawed. Discipline relaxes. History becomes neglected. English is dropped. Life becomes immediate. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts? The amazing thing is that Bradbury predicted that censorship would start with the minorities objecting to the way they were depicted. Blacks, Baptists, Dog Lovers etc. waanted strict enforcement of anti-book laws and the burning of all books followed. Someone has written a book on tobacco and lung cancer? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book. The smokers are distressed? Burn the book. A book, any book creates problems. You don't have to face those problems. Just burn the book. The point is obvious. The world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority feels it has the will, the right, the duty, to douse the kerosene, like Montag, the protagonist of this novel, and light the fuse. But you know there are more ways than burning to destroy a book. Every dimwit editor could slenderize, starve, bluepencil, leech, and bleed white any book and make any author sound like Edgar Guest. Frightening in its implications, 451, this insane world, which bears many alarming reseemblances to our own, is required reading for all lovers of books. Incidentally, the proof that Bradbury's esthetic vision was not far off the mark was that he discovered, years after 451 was published, that cubby-hole editors at Ballantine, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some 75 separate sections from the novel. Alert students reading those editions told the author about this exquisite irony. The original story is now available thanks to Judy Lynn Del Rey."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read it twice now, and everytime I read it, I enjoy it more and more. This book was about one person and the changes he went through. Guy Montag was a firemen, who burned books for a living. Then he is enlightened to read a book, and is helped by Professor Faber. At the end, Montag is a rebel. He runs away and becomes I leader of other rebels to bring reading to the world they left. This book show how the technology is taking over and not even using books for education. I think it is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a short and simple book that deals with some incredibly complex issues. Most people mistakenly believe that Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit about censorship. Although that shoe does fit this story, Bradbury actually wrote this book to highlight the possible consequences that our society may have to face if the trend of television and similar forms of entertainment began to overtake more imaginative forms of entertainment such as books. This theme seems even more relevent today than it would have when it was written in 1953. The fictional world of the future that Bradbury created is a depressing and generic place where people have forgotten how to think for themselves and are completely unable to form true bonds of family and friendship. The books that are burned by the firemen are against the law but the story points out very obviously that these laws began as a result of the citizens' own actions. Books were burned if any one group found them offensive so that everyone would be happy. Eventually, all books were considered offensive to someone and the government stepped in to take care of the problem of books once and for all. Unfortunately, this did nothing to REALLY fix the problem. It merely dumbed down society until people were unable to realize their true feelings. Suicide and murder is a normal and acceptable occurance. Everything is impersonal and generic as protagonist Guy Montag goes from \\"content\\" fireman to book-loving fugitive in the matter of a couple hundred pages.As a book lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bradbury writes in a natural voice and it is extremely obvious that he himself if a great lover of books. It is a refreshing read while still disturbing the reader with it's eerie depictions of where we could be headed as a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this novel for a literature class in high school and while I thought it very good, I didn't feel it was as powerful as other similar dystopian novels like 1984. Well, I still don't feel it is quite as good as 1984 (which I think is maybe the greatest SF novel written) but I have revised my opinion on Fahrenheit 451. It is exceptional. It is somewhat eerie to read about Montag and his wife Millie and realize they could represent in many ways the society we are now becoming, one further and further detached from people and things and, of course, books, and even memories. With all our innovations and technological discoveries, we seem to be lagging behind in literacy and when I read 451 this time, I could not help but identify the metaphor book burning took on for me, where we are slowly being almost totally reliant on computers for everything, including entertainment for hours on end and reading seems an almost quaint and charming relic of the past."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Truth be told, I read this book in my high school days and probably didn't appreciate it as much as I could have. I remember thinking it was an above average read, but I didn't have a strong appreciation for the novel's depth. Bradbury's message didn't strike me until I recently picked up the book again years later. Reading this novel again, I was wowed and amazed about the events I had missed with my first reading. The underlying message about the dangers of losing one's self amid conformity came ringing forth, and the idea of fire burning as a metaphor for burning away existence stuck with me. Bradbury's work became a profound experience for me.Set in a dystopic world, Montag works as a firefighter whose job it is to burn books, as they are held as dangerous materials. When Montag meets his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, she wakes him up to the world he exists in by asking him a simple question: \\"Are you happy?\\" Montag, as if in a trance before, begins wondering why books are thought to be such a deterrent to society, why he should be burning instead of reading, and why society runs the way it does. He identifies an uncomfortable unhappy feeling, and takes steps to try to get to the bottom of the vast emptiness he has lived with. Beatty, Montag's boss, begins to identify the guilt Montag feels about his job, as Montag at one point feigns being sick, and tries to philosophize about why the world exists the way it does. Beatty's basic premise is that books make people think, and bring about all sorts of \\"nastiness\\": emotion, tears, feeling, rebellion, and power. He states that the world is better conforming to systematic enjoyment and collective thought because it is, in his words, less dangerous. Montag has a life-changing moment when their fire crew is called out to burn down a woman's house; the woman refuses to go, and is burned up along with her books, and Montag feels responsible for this. Montag befriends a man named Faber, an ex English professor who he remembered from a year earlier hiding a book while at a park. Where Clarisse wakes up Montag to his life, Faber is the key to Montag's full reawaking, and taking action towards his new ideas. Faber gives him the tools to know that there are people out there who believe in reading and thinking. Montag vows to never burn again. Beatty eventually suspects that Montag may be collecting books on the side, and eventually the call comes for Montag to burn his own house down. From here, Montag has a dilemma about whether to follow his boss' orders, or try to escape somehow. Without giving too much away, Montag is on the run as a fugitive as the chase is being broadcasted live as police attempt to hunt him down. From here, we are left to try to find out whether he will escape the police, and, if so, where he is heading.Fahrenheit 451 is one of those rare books that becomes more powerful and poignant as time goes on. As much as the story is about dystopia and the ills of censorship, it goes beyond this. It is also a book about the pitfalls of society devoid of conscientiousness, individuality, reason, or uniqueness. When we get to the point where we lose our voice or our ability to think, our existence becomes empty and meaningless. Perhaps even more startling or tragic is the notion that citizens may not even realize that society has become this way, or that THEY have become this way, as is the case for the main character, Montag, who happily burns away house after house, book after book, and lives a rather systematic life as a fireman, with a wife who is more machine than spouse, a product of the times.Some compare this book to 1984, and with just cause, as both depict the isolation caused when individuals have little to no control in thought or living. However, Fahrenheit 451 feels less dark and gloomy than 1984, and seems to have an optimistic outlook, so I find it a little more enjoyable.Fantastic book! One that has deserved every bit of praise it has received."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the middle of the last century, a number of authors wrote novels describing the de-evolution of out Western culture:-Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley-A Clockwork Orange&-The Wanting Seed, by Anthony Burgess-1984, by George Orwell...And Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury!Set in a \\"near-future\\" which has somewhat already materialzed in our own time, the Fire Department has long ceased to be an emergency service. They have become a secret-police force, whose primary purpose is to incinerate \\"illegal printed material\\". Why? Long before Thomas Paine distributed \\"Common Sense\\" and \\"The Rights of Man\\", or Martin Luther nailed his Theses to the cathedral door, the printed word has proved most unsettling to all thug-ocracies.Montag, a disillusioned fireman, who just can't stop thinking for himself, soon finds himself under suspicion for his own secret literary curiosity.The future described by Bradbury, is a time and place defined by LOUD, ALL PERVASIVE, BOMBASTIC commercialization, and a truly vapid, soulless, and superficial popular culture. Does that sound familiar?Printed material has been banned, (and burned) because it \\"disturbs\\" peoples minds.Montag, a sensistive and introspective sort, finds himself profoundly alienated in this society, failing to find authenticity even from his own wife. He can not help but question the role he plays as a fireman, and finds that he must find out for himself as to why the books he burns are so \\"dangerous\\".Look at the contemporary \\"popular culture\\".Observe all the conforming artificial fools about you.See the overt lack of free-thinking on any given college-campus, (institutions that once exemplified the concept).The loud, obnoxious, all-pervasive and overly-commercialized popular \\"culture\\" is ALREADY HERE. With so many empty-heads so easily distracted, the next step can very well be the willful incineration of all that \\"disturbing\\" literature out there.Be assured it didn't just \\"happen this way\\".Someone wants you to conform. Someone wants you to STOP THINKING.There may not be a \\"fire-brigade\\" acting as the tool of an oppressive police-state, or even public book-burning events. Maybe books will become \\"passe\\", because we have \\"computers\\", and \\"electronic media\\".However the printed word becomes \\"obsolete\\" (and there are people working very hard to bring this about), be assured that your very civilization is circling the drain.

This story about burning books later transformed into what we know today as the classic Fahrenheit 451. This book is hailed as one of the best science fiction novels at the time, and is still very successful today.The book revolves around a character named Guy Montag, a fire fighter in an America where there is no order, or self control: Books that contemplate deep thought are outlawed and burned, with no sense of literature or compassion towards those who hang on to them; as the pages burn at a cozy 451 degrees. This America, maybe even this world focuses more on fake joy and illusion, than pressing world issues, such as the constant threat of nuclear war. In this world, or at least in this America; the citizens are rampant, and are brainwashed to think that they are happy, when in fact each and every one of them are just drones without a real queen. More people are killed in random car accidents than their last nuclear war, which America won. Guy, like almost everyone else in the nameless city, gives in the misapprehension of happiness until he meets someone. One day he meets Clarisse Mc Cellan, a young teenager who changes his perspective on his life, and life in general; from the smallest rain drop to whether he really loves Mildred or not. He begins to realize the sheer grievance of the world; from thinking putting new blood in a person is curing them, to thinking T.V families are your real families. (This is Mildred's problem until the very end). He at last questions his own occupation, which is probably the reason why his life is the way it is. He finally goes off the deep end and steals a book from a lady who burns her and her books before the firemen do. It is then revealed to Mildred (and the readers) that Montag has been keeping a stash of books hidden for a year, and has been trying to memorize them. Alas, the information always slips away; like \\"the sieve and the sand.\\" He then goes on a journey, both physically and mentally; as he must face himself, the Mechanical Hound, and even his own boss Captain. Beatty. He is very much Montag's opposite, and is the main antagonist.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who can create deep thought from reading a book. This book is action packed, epic, and is a striking realization on a path modern America might be heading for itself. The book itself is actually more relevant today than when it was first published in 1950. The fact is that the back story mentioned in the book on how America got this way is sounding more and more like our present. Basically, their past might be our definitive future. This book is classic for a reason, as the book is critically acclaimed by almost any person who reads it; of any demographic. The only real requirement is to be able to analyze the information in the book, as there are a few moments of symbolism in the book. Overall, I believe that there are a lot of bone- rattling moments that anyone with a brain should enjoy, but probably won't in the end. And for anyone who likes this book, I recommend The Martian Chronicles, and Dandelion Wine.\\" They are excellent examples of Bradbury's work. I also recommend The Last Book in the Universe; it is very similar to Fahrenheit 451 in plot. In all, I would give 5/5 to the classic that made us all think a little more.. --Christian C."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books I've read and reread throughout my life, and it has proven itself as a true work of genius in that it had something new to say to me at each stage of my life. In my youth, I was led to believe that \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a novel about censorship - after all, the main characters are \\"firemen\\" who burn books. But with maturity, and a wider view of the world, I began to see the more potent message inside the book.In this supposedly futuristic world, society at large has been dumbed down gradually. Books have been reduced and summarized until readers can only stand brevity, then they are eliminated altogether. Special interests of all sorts have demanded censorship or destruction of anything deemed offensive. Advertising and marketing are everywhere. Mindless interactive entertainment consumes all available leisure time. Life is lived in a drugged stupor with a soundtrack delivered in a steady stream through earbuds. The threat of annihilation looms large, while most of the population carries on lives not worth living. Personal relationships are now so superficial that people regard television characters as their \\"family\\". Voices of dissent, when they appear, are silenced quickly.There's very little I can say about a classic novel that hasn't been said before. We may never see widespread elimination of books as Bradbury imagined, but it can't be denied that the views and attitudes that brought on the firemen are certainly part of our world.If you haven't read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", read it now. If you've read it before, read it again. Then come join the rest of us tramps by the railroad track, and be the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was forced to read Fahrenheit 451 as a high school sophomore and hated it. I thought it was boring and completely implausible and I wanted to burn it as soon as the unit was over (I didn't).Fast forward 10 years. For some reason I decided that I should go back and re-read all of the books I was forced to read in high school English classes. And maybe it was because I chose to read it instead of being forced to, or maybe it had more to do with age and a knowledge of the world that I didn't have back then, but I found myself completely entranced with this book.The storyline is believable, especially in the context of real world attempts to ban books for various reasons over the years. The characters are three dimensional and sympathetic. The pacing is perfect. The book is so gripping that before you know it you'll realize that you've read the entire novel in one sitting.Fahrenheit 451 is still technically classified as science fiction, a label that can be a turn off to those who think of Star Trek or Stargate when they see it. I personally would categorize it as a classic suspense novel, or as literature, rather than calling it sci-fi.If you read the book when you were very young, whether you liked it or didn't, I highly recommend re-reading it as an adult. You will learn as much about yourself and how your perspective has changed over the years as you will about the possible future that Bradbury presents.And if you've never read it at all, read it now. This is one of those books that should be a part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is Ray Bradbury's 55-year-old futuristic masterpiece about a time when firemen burn books instead of extinguishing fires. (451F is the temperature at which book pages burn.) His fireman protagonist, Guy Montag, has suddenly changed allegiances and become interested in preserving books rather than destroying them. The book is supposedly about censorship, but to me it seemed to be more about apathy. The book burning started after everyone had stopped reading anyway, and the liberal arts schools had mostly disappeared. Montag's professor friend Faber lists the three things that books provide: texture, leisure to absorb the information, and our response to what they teach us. The texture is the fabric of life that books describe, and the more densely woven the fabric, the better the quality of the book. Bradbury's writing style is not very fluid, but his take on the future is noteworthy at times. Not all of his predictions have come to pass, but the bug that Faber puts in Montag's ear made me think of people wearing their cell phones today. Also, the author mentions that the television is used as a babysitter, and he was spot-on about that. However, we don't have vicious mechanical hounds, at least not that I know of, nor do we all live in fireproof houses, unfortunately."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"There is a reason that Fahrenheit 451 is considered a classic.. it is one of those books that we can identify with during any era we have lived in, and our current era is no different. Less and less people are reading \\"real\\" books and more and more people reading and giving credence to trash magazines and internet blogs.I always felt that F451 and 1984 were set if not in the same universe, then maybe universes right next door to each other for they tell similar yet both separately important stories. This book is a cautionary read on society gone wrong, and is one I consider a must read for any reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Deep inside each of us is a Montag, a burner of books, a fireman who destroys rather than saves. And this is what makes Fahrenheit 451 the masterpiece that it is: it gets at the root of censorship, at its ultimate cause, at the fear of ideas that all of us must struggle with at one point or another. In our current age of political correctness from all ends (and sometimes the middle also), Bradbury's warning rings louder than ever: it is not books that we fear but what is inside of them, the fear that by reading something new we might find our precious ideas about life challenged. And rather than engage the ideas that make us uncomfortable, we try to isolate them, condemn them, and then destroy them.What struck me most about Fahrenheit 451 was how closely Bradbury's vision matches our current world, particularly in the west. Like Mildred, we are all too willing to lose ourselves in fantasy soap-opera worlds, finding ourselves more interested in the next American Idol than in the neighbor across the street. And here is Bradbury's real coup: it is not any particular idea that the government and we ourselves fear, but the very idea of ideas themselves. Montag and his fellow firemen are not discriminatory: they burn anything, because their employers know that whatever makes you think, whatever makes you question your shallow, empty life, whether it is pornography or Shakespeare or the Bible, is a danger to those who use ignorance to gain and hold power.Think about that the next time you get the urge to light the kerosene and destroy an idea."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine what tomorrow will be like without books, a time when books are condidered extremely malevolent and a time when firemen's jobs are not to put down fire but to start fire. This is what Montag, our main character does.This book tells of Montag's gradual realization of the superficialness around him and encounters the very taboo that he was told to destroy. Montag soon realizes that books were not only not evil, but a precious thing that needed to be saved. We see Montag's progression in this book, from the girl he met on the street, who said that she was \\"tasting the rain\\" to his wife, whose only interests were watching TV and hangs out with other friends of hers. Montag came to conflict with his society as he finally rejects it altogether. Eventually he did something that no one would think of. And that something may just be the path to save knowledge."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic. I first read it over 30 years ago and the issues raised are just as pertinent today as they were then.The book was first published in the early 1950s, at a time when censorship and control were also topical issues. The world depicted by Bradbury is, to some extent, a reality for some. Not necessarily because of technology but because once people stop thinking, questioning and creating they have surrendered at least some sense of self.On one level, this book can be read as 'straight' science fiction. On another level, it can be read as social commentary.You decide.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury, one of the most celebrated authors of all time, paints a very frightening and vivid picture of what life would be like if we were not allowed to read books. In this futuristic society, firemen do not put out fires - they start them.Fahrenheit 451 has survived the test of time. Although written in 1953 about an advanced society that is threatened by the imagination and the knowledge that can be gained from reading, decades later this book still parallels some of the struggles that we must face in society every day. Fahrenheit 451 is a classic tale of censorship and the harm that it can cause when man is forced to take on his own battle between knowledge and ignorance.Guy Montag has been a fireman for 10 years and considers himself to be relatively happy with his career and the way he has chosen to live his life. He has never questioned the ritual burning of books, the constant television watching or the rules set by government and society.This all changes when Montag meets Clarisse - a 17-year-old girl who is fascinated with books and the sacred art of reading. She tells Montag of a time when books were not burned, and firemen were hired to save homes and lives from fire - not to start the fire themselves. Even though Montag knows that reading is illegal, he cannot help but be drawn to the passion that books bring to the people that read them secretly.After Clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag takes a deep look at himself. He begins to question his actions, society and happiness. Struggling with following his own morals yet still obeying the laws, Montag finds himself caught in a web of confusion. His descent from society begins with hiding books in his home, but before long he is running away with a group of outlaws that have made it their mission to memorize books in order to prevent future generations from missing out on knowledge and the stories of mankind's journeys through time.Fahrenheit 451 is a must-read book - definitely one of the best Bradbury books that you will ever get your hands on. This tale of irony, censorship and societal constraints will follow generations for years to come until one day they too are faced with challenges not much different than this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Farenheit 451 (the temperature at which paper burns, says the prologue), Guy Montag is a \\"fireman\\" whose job it is to burn books, and any building and/or people associated with the crime. After an old woman commits suicide by lighting her own house on fire instead of escaping and allowing her books to burn, Montag has a crisis of faith. He's always believed in the rightness of his cause, but now is not so sure. So he pockets a few books and takes them home. He tries to read poetry to his wife, to disasterous effect. Montag has to make a choice - the life he knew or a life (possibly very short) of scholarship where books supply the grist for the intellect.Although the story is putatively about book-burning, censorship, and propoganda, that is just the surface story. Bradbury paints an eerily prophetic picture of a land so in love with its own happines (and leisure) that no one wants to rock the boat. Deceased relative are not grieved. Whatever grief is present is drowned out by the cacophany of ever-present televisions, advertisements, and catchy tunes. Keep the plebes disctracted and they'll let you get away with anything! There is also some wicked social commentary on the lack of accountability in society, which is even more apparent today than when the book was written.Often, when one finally gets around to reading a modern classic like Farenheit 451, one is dissappointed. Not so with this book - the action is exciting, the resolution is satisfying (if dystopic), and the philosophical debates between the characters is interesting. At less than 250 pages, it is a quick read, but this is one classic that every science fiction fan will enjoy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In his world, firemen started fires to burn books-as both their job and for their own pleasure. He lived what he thought was a picture-perfect life, and never questioned why they burned books or the way society was. When he met a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, his life changed forever. After she mysteriously disappears, Guy sought the assistance of an old professor named Faber, who helped him examine the past, and what their society has become in the present. He began to question society and the censorship of ideas that surrounded the world that he lived in. Guy had to decide what he needed to do to change all of it.When I originally began reading this book, I found it confusing and a little hard to follow because of its futuristic setting and characters. However, as I got farther into the book, it became easier to understand the story line and the plot. Even though he wrote it in 1953, Ray Bradbury makes outstanding points in his book about the messages that society and the media sends to us even today. No matter how convincing they may be, it is only the truth that matters. This book opened my eyes to many questions about the way we live today, and how we can move to modify the \\"Ignorance is bliss\\" idea in which many people live today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an innovative and awesomely prescient look at the \`future,' which is for us now the past. As I read it, I could draw quite a few similarities between Montag's desensitized and ignorant society and our own, or at least the direction ours seems to be heading. As in Montag's world, we seek convenience above all things rather than overcoming our obstacles and learning from our mistakes. I would go so far as to say that today; literature is slowly dying out just as newspaper journalism is, because there are more convenient ways to get our entertainment and news. However, such practices bring us closer and closer to a world where citizens are merely cattle as long as they are entertained, like in Fahrenheit 451. I also thoroughly enjoy Bradbury's writing style, how he conveys Montag's loneliness as he is realizing the plight of humanity and cannot tell his wife, indeed he doesn't even know if he loves his wife, he can't remember where they met. Montag changes from complete bliss in ignorance, to a willingness to give everything to enlighten the rest of the people, as he was. Bradbury is not flowery with his descriptions, but I think he gets the feeling across which is the most important thing since no matter what the description, we are the ones forming the mental picture. The issue of censorship is addressed on an extreme scale by this book, but still one cannot help drawing comparisons to now, and how easily it is to see it progressing from here to there. This book is a classic, and unlike some with such lofty titles, it is most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having met and seen Mr. Bradbury speak in person in the very location where he wrote this book out on type-writer, the Powell Library at UCLA, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the message this novel conveys. Serving as a warning to the intellectual and knowledge seekers, Guy Montage's search for information and logic is heroic considering the political repression present in his society. One of the pre-eminent beacons promoting freedom of speach and the free exchange of information, this novel continues to serve as a guideline and reminder of the importance of the open exchange of ideas. In a society where many governments and religious regimes seek to curtail information flow, this is a message of the necessary pro-activeness and vigilance necessary to preserve the Alexandria library of modern civilization, the printed word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reason that Fahrenheit 451 is such a great book can be a hard one to pin down, though the fact that it is goes without question.It is the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who faces a crisis when he begins to question his whole way of life after a chance encounter with a young woman on his street. After this first, casual meeting, he begins to re-examine his relationship with his wife in contrast to the familiar, warm relationship that the girl has with her family- instead of this loving type of exchange, Guy finds that his closest relation, his wife, spends all day with the three-walled 'family' that barks constantly at her from a script, but that never bothers to actually say anything. From these estranged roots, Guy turns to look at the thing that he is destroying and that he has been taught to hate- books. This curiosity gets him into trouble quickly, forcing him out of the life that he knows and into one of panic, flight, and eventual banishment...though even this is a blessing in disguise.The novel works from the basis of a phenomenon that has occurred in literature in recent years- that of the utopia gone bad, something that Thomas Moore never could have imagined. In this growing canon of literature you will find such venerable titles as '1984', 'We', 'Anthem', and 'Brave New World'...what separates 451 from these is it's focus on the specific problem of entertainment as a venue to the masses. What happens when the government controls our books, our television, our inputs? What happens when we close our minds off to literature because it is going to offend someone, somewhere? What happens when we become so PC that we burn 'The Merchant of Venice' because it might offend Jews, 'Roots' because it might make whites look bad, and 'Huckleberry Finn' because it might make blacks uncomfortable?Bradbury attempts to answer this question, albeit indirectly- true, no one can be offended if these things are removed, but neither can anyone learn and grow. Life, civilization, everything- it all becomes stagnant, sliding slowly away to meaningless interactions that amount to nothing. Bradbury does not tell us that our point is to go around offending but rather that in order to function, we must push one another. Life, love, happiness...none of these happen without passion, fire, intensity...all of those emotions which flow might step on someone's toes, true, but they are necessary to be human.The novel tackles this with an unforgiving brutal bent to those who would censor and suppress anything that might make a person think. Captain Beatty is the epitome of the problem, though even in his final thoughts he seems to be full of a sort of self-loathing. This character, along with several others, leads the reader to examine the different sides of the issue at hand, trying to discern which approach is most appropriate.In doing this Bradbury achieves what the intent of the novel is- to make us think about and examine our own views on what art (specifically literature, but it can be generalized) is and what place it has in society. Should it be censored? Should it be controlled (as in Plato's \`Republic')?The fact that the novel encourages these questions in such a short span (a little over 100 pages) is a testament to Ray Bradbury's brilliance as a novelist...it is also the reason that you, the potential reader, should make sure to pick up a copy and tear through it (it can be finished in a single day, easily). By doing so, you will be facing what are still very relevant problems in our modern day and time.Bottom line: this book is considered a modern classic for good reason. It has all the elements- ideas, execution, style, substance- and should not be missed.-LP"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's best; A non-stop look at the supreme ignorance that comes with totalitarian regimes. A dystopia like BNW and 1984, this dystopia is littered with awesome similes, startling paralles, and absurd contradictions such as firemen who light fires, instead of putting them out. Whether your of Liberal mentality (Michael Moore took his bush-bashing doc title from this book.) Or if your of a Conservative mentality, (this book gives a great account of what true conservatism is all about.) The story is prophetic, and will manifest itself in America now or later. Just like G.Orwell's Big Brother has now manifested itself through the Patriot Act. This book is a must read, and if you don't like it, well, you can always burn it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book definitely has great ideas to revolve around, and ever since I've heard about the burning of books, I thought it was worthy of reading and I placed some expectations that were all met. I wanted it to be exciting, and it definitely was. I also found this book to have less boring scenes (there are boring scences to every book, and we can't deny that) than many other great books - this book is short, but it is to the point, which is one of the many reasons to love this book. While \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a great book, it took more than a hundred pages to set up, which I found to be a drag.I cannot say what the biggest strength in the novel is - there are lots of strengths. I like how the author doesn't mention what city they are in; that way, everyone can relate to it a little more. He doesn't set it in Los Angeles or New York (though for all we know, it could be), because he wants to imply that every place is like this - in other words, it could be your city that they are living in. He does this to create a better microcosm of the world. Also, the idea of book burning is one of the greatest ever, as it shows how a society denies knowledge and chooses to go with ignorance instead. The biggest weaknesses in this novel is that it is hurried at times. I think Clarisse McClellan dies too fast, and it would have been better if they had had a bigger relationship. Also, the ending is abrupt. Then again, that is his style. In his short story \\"Frost and Fire\\" the ending is also abrupt. However, he has a great way of making people relate to his stories, even though they might be science fiction. In the future, I probably will read another one of his books.This is a great book, hands down. Go take it out of your library or purchase it and read it. It will only take you a matter of days (in fact you can even read it in one day). With a great theme dealing with censorship, along with everything else that is great about the book, this should be a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's the temperature at which paper burns said the first page of the book and I knew it having read it earlier, and yet I chose this book to be re-read. It has only instilled my faith further in the power of words and what can they do. Writers such as Bradbury and Orwell who have written on the totalitarian society and how a group of people stand and fight it, may be somewhere at some point done the same and that is what which amazes me.I first read this novella (190 pages and yes I am aware that the technical definition would not allow it to be classified it as a novella, however I chose to call it that) when I was 16 and was enthralled by it. Guy Montag's transformation from a fireman who burns books and takes pleasure in it to the one who savors the written word and wants to save books and thereby his soul is brilliant. Bradbury did not dream the future when he wrote Fahrenheit 451, the future actually was here. Right now. Look around you. Aren't we burning books by banning them anyway? I am sure in certain parts of the world people are not at liberty to read (Afghanistan being one such place). I wonder how my life would be if someone were to barge in my house and burn down my books. I would either kill myself or the person in the bargain. It would be the latter in all probability.What I loved about the book this time, is that I understood the layers involved, which I hadn't earlier. It is not only about book censorship, it is about censorship period. The part in the book when Guy is raving mad at a bunch of women who think nothing beyond their husbands and \\"families\\" who can now be viewed on huge TV Screens and how he reads poetry to them and one of the women starts crying. I would like to believe that the tears were for a lost tradition amongst them. That of reading. The joy of thinking. The freedom to speak without editing a word.I can say one thing though - Books can never be extinct. Try as you might. Try hard if you will. Just try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"[This review is for the paperback \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" of the novel, which contains special additional essays and an interview which enrich the experience of reading the novel.]I'm not going to recount the plot details since this book should be a part of every book lover's lexicon. (If you have been off of the planet for the past half-century or so, this is a parable, set in the not-too-distant future, about book-burning. But the novel is really about what makes a person an individual. It postulates what people might be willing to give up in order to have \\"peace of mind,\\" and poses material enough for hours of stimulating debate about the real value of independent thought and its importance to society.)This review is simply a friendly nudge for those of you out there who have already read this book once, perhaps when you were quite young, and have not re-visited it. I urge you to do so as soon as possible.I just re-read this incredible novel for the first time in thirty years. I picked it up because my teenage daughter is reading it as an assignment for an English class. I read it in high school, too, and I recall that I enjoyed it. But for some reason I had never re-read it. Bad move on my part. I got so much more out of the book now that I am older and have been in the world for awhile. The novel has aged beautifully. Actually, its insights, in light of our computer age and the changes which are being wrought in publishing and in the education of our children, are astoundingly relevant. This is a novel so current in its political and social re-imaginings that it could have been published last year.I love Bradbury's books. He is a master story teller. HisThe Illustrated Mansits on my nightstand bookshelf right beside a copy of Ring Lardner's short stories,Ring Around the Bases: The Complete Baseball Stories of Ring Lardnerand a copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short storys,The Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald-- just in case I need to re-read a wonderful short story or two before sleep comes.But as I said, I had not re-read this particular book in a long time. Not only did this futuristic masterpiece affect me completely differently when I read it again after such a long lapse of time, but I found so many nuances in the book which are just not present in the movieFahrenheit 451(wonderful as the movie is.) I had forgotten how mesmerizing Bradbury's prose is. I had also forgotten that this novel won the National Book Award. It's a treasure, and a novel to be savored periodically throughout one's life.I especially like this edition which mentions on the cover that it was released as the \\"50th Anniversary Edition.\\" Not only does it contain Bradbury's 1979 Coda and 1983 Afterword, but there is an illuminating interview with the author where he discusses his own views about how the book has held up to the passing of the years, his approach to writing in general, how he views the \\"future\\" we are now living which he imagined in the early 1950s, and even what he considers the weaknesses of the movie version of his book.This is great American literature.

And of course, one of those brave book burners is Guy Montag.Guy has lived his entire life without questioning it, but all of that changes when Guy meets Clarisse McClean. Clarisse is pretty, young, and very curious. Guy has never met such a girl before. A girl that focuses on love, friendship, and the contents of books, the same books that Guy burns. Guy tries to ignore her but cannot, and when Clarisse dies in an automobile accident, he is left on his own, with his wife and his colleagues being very close-minded.One day on the job Guy is called in to an old grandma's house where she has been keeping books, illegally. Guy tries to convince the lady to get out of the house, before she burns down with it, but she refuses. Before Guy burns down the house he steals a book. Guy is aware that it is illegal but he cannot resist. Guy is determined to read that book. So, he tracks down his old English professor, Faber, who agrees to teach Guy how to read. What will happen to guy? Will he get arrested for holding contraband? Will he get burned? Will he die? Read the book to find out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It got me questioning my own life. And I started thinking; maybe this really could be the future. The phrase \\"curiosity killed the cat\\" takes on a whole new meaning in this book. It's great for people of all ages and any gender."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I won't quibble with the social importance of \\"Farenheit 451,\\" but I do think the book has limited value as literature. Quite simply, it's well-written only in parts. Some parts are almost laughably weak, in a literary sense.The book gives us a frightening vision of America about 500 years in the future. An unseen, unnamed, unaccountable government has extraordinary control over citizens' lives, and the government perpetuates its power by dulling people's ability to think, remember, and feel. Medical advances don't reduce suffering -- they dull our senses. People are drugged and then saved from their drug overdoses. Similarly, media is used to dull minds, rather than to enlighten. The urban environment where most people live is fast, violent, and dark; and most people have no contact with the natural world. It's our America, extended to extremes.Guy Montag, the main character of Farenheit, is a fireman: this means that he sets fire to books, because books have been banned. He's in an emotionless marriage, and his wife can't even remember when they met. When Montag has second thoughts about what he's doing and about his society, his wife and his boss fight him, and a crisis quickly emerges. Montag must flee in order to survive, and he joins other outcasts in the woods.These are powerful ideas. The problem is with the execution, in some parts. The book starts slowly, and the language of the first 20-30 pages probably tempts many people to put down the book. By the second section, the imagery improves, and the repetition of some themes (books as butterflies, the screaming entertainment walls, black beetles) starts to be powerful. But then, the chase scene in the third section and the meeting with outcasts are both rendered in pretty stiff language. I guess the best that can be said is that the author exercises restraint in his language.My other complaint arises from a few logical gaps. For example, if the government truly has the awesome technology it seems to possess, how could outcasts live in the woods that are just a few miles outside of town? Why would there be woods and farms a few miles outside of town in the first place? Also, what's the meaning of Beatty's ability to quote literature, apparently with gusto: Does he love literature and represent one way to fight against the oppressive society, or is he the fireman chief he seems to be on the surface?In sum, \\"Farenheit 451\\" is an important book. More than 40 years ago, it put into concise form the fears that many people had about the way modern society was heading. It created memorable images of book burnings and mindless, mechanical violence. But the language itself is rarely as evocative as the ideas it relates."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have known aboutFahrenheit 451for many years, but never picked it up until recently when my daughter brought it home from the school library. She hadn't enjoyed it too much, she said, but some of her friends had. Bradbury, along with Isaac Asimov and a couple of other authors, is an icon of 20th century American science fiction, and this novel offers an excellent display of his prowess. The version I read, published by Ballantine Books, contains an interesting Afterword written by the author in 1982 (the book itself was written in 1953 at a UCLA typing room on typewriters 'which rented out at a dime a half hour'). In it, Bradbury describes the book's c. 1980 adaptation to the stage, in which he further developed certain key characters, namely Clarisse, the mysterious young girl who opens the main character's eyes, and Captain Beatty, the ironically well-read fire chief who is in charge of book burning. Bradbury also mentions changes added by Francois Truffaut, the Director of the film version (seeFahrenheit 451for the DVD). Appropriately enough for a book about an extreme form of censorship, Bradbury notes that he has avoided the temptation to censor his own young self by bringing some of these additions into a revised version of the novel: \\"I don't believe in tampering with any young writer's material, especially when that young writer was once myself.\\" A wise decision, judging from the excellence of the original product."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book blows my mind. It says so many things that I've been believing for years (and that's before I read it) about human nature: the tendency of the masses to follow and do what they're told; how easily humans waste their capacity for critical thinking; the difference between pleasure and true joy; the true meaning of freedom. Many people don't search for a deeper meaning to life than what tradition gives them, and that's okay; it's their choice. But when those people assume that everyone is that way, and they start restricting people's freedom because they think it will make everyone happy - well, that's when you get Fahrenheit 451. The character of Millie, especially, strikes me with her utter devotion to meaningless trivialities. We all know a Millie, or two or three. And this book is the story of how Montag discovers he really isn't like Millie at all, even though he thought he was, and how he fights the law and becomes a renegade, just to discover who he really is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If ever there is a formula for the perfect novel, 451 has the ingredients. It would be one part science fiction masked in a glaze of poetic impulse, settled on a bed of classic literature soaking up the juices of vast philosophical thought. The burning of books is a horror to any who love the written word and our freedom to dream. It would be our worst nightmare for society to regress to a state of anti-intellectualism so staunch that ideas themselves have become the enemy. Ray Bradbury not only captures our fears in this post nuclear world but also touches upon our often forgotten love for the stories that have captured our hearts. This is a must read for anyone who has ever loved a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"By my count, this'll be the 1,218th review for this book on amazon, so what could I possibly say that the other 1,217 haven't?But for those few who dare dig this deep to read: I loved the book. I've read numerous novels and thrillers for fun, and also dabbled in more serious, non-fiction as well (check my profile if you want), but this one book managed to bridge the two meta-genres. In Ray Bradbury's comments he mentions that he wrote the book on typewriters that charged a dime per hour in a university library, driven there by the distractions of two young daughters in his house; as a result (imho) the work comes fast and furious and makes no apologies for failing to artistically create a subtle and symbolic background.The characters are few and the scenes sparse but it is a book that almost says as much in what is left out as what is included. It is also a book that fully describes (even immerses) the reader in this distopian future which only slowly comes to mirror our own. The commentary, like many of the characters, is never explicit, left to the reader to draw their own conclusions. Rather than the spoonfeeding of Animal Farm or even 1984, true motivations and causes are hidden and the reader's own perception of civilization can guide them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't want to think how many years ago I first read Fahrenheit 451, but it must've been around the same time (1966) that Truffault came out with his horrible cinematic version of the novel. I know this because I remember being unimpressed with both versions (although the movie may've soured me on the book).Re-reading the novel now, I still don't think that it ranks up there with, say, Huxley's Brave New World. But it is an astoundingly prescient vision of the sort of society in which we live: one in which cultural memory and tradition is increasingly replaced by immediate kitsch, in which media is entertainment, reading is a dying practice, immediate gratification the norm, jadedness a perennial hazard, and never-ending war a reality. Social commentators such as Morris Berman and Susan Jacoby have argued for a kind of secular monkdom to try to preserve and pass on the tradition that's quickly sinking beneath the new dark age that's descending, and this isn't at all unlike the anonymous book-memorizing preservers in Fahrenheit 451's moribund society.What does it mean when a culture loses its depth, its memory, its lineage? What does it mean when an entire society is unable, as the character Granger recommends to Montag, to \\"stuff [its] eyes with wonder, live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds\\" (p. 140) because it's far too occupied with commerce and kitsch? Bradbury's dystopia invites us to ask ourselves these sorts of questions. We ignore them at our peril."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an excelenent book about book censorship and its tale still fascinates the mind today as much as it did when it was written in the 1950's. This book however i should notice reads in some parts more like a poem then a novel, sacrificing plot and dialogue for poetic beauty.The characters in this book are very deep and realistic leaving a haunting feeling on you, however interestingly he doesn't actualy spend much time actualy describing them, but somehow from the story you can draw so much more than you would from a description, however short or indepth it may be. I suggest this book as a standard reading for all people who wish to understand what the world could (and inevittably is) comming to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'll spare you the summary (you can read that in many other reviews) and tell you that this story is very easy to read and understand. The main idea of the story is that censorship (especially concerning books) is very dangerous and damaging to society. Whether you know it or not, books (especially the classics) are everywhere. From nursery rhymes to mythological stories, they play an important part in our daily lives. They are referenced in tv shows, movies, and in our vernacular. Think of Shakespeare. How many times do we see the Romeo and Juliet story whether it be in movies or music, etc. Or Homer's Odyssey? Or the Bible? If we were to lose these gems, our lives lose that important element. You don't have to be a reader to not feel the magnitude of losing our greatest stories. What I got out of the book also was Mr. Bradbury seemed to be warning the reader that if society doesn't open their eyes and take notice of important issues, the rug is going to be pulled out from under us. If we keep burying our heads in the sand and hiding behind celebrity rags, video games, and sporting events, we'll lose touch with the world around us and become victims of something bigger. He's not saying that fun can't be had, but if our lives are simply filled with sloth and fluff, we are going to be no better than a lemming. It's our duty to educate ourselves in order to prevent things like censorship or war from happening. A very good read, indeed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have always meant to read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" but had never managed to get around to it. In a world where time is scarce, I neglected this classic work by Ray Bradbury. I regret this situation very much. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a modern classic that deserves to be read. The individual is poorer for not having done so.If the novel has any message, it is that censorship is a very great danger. In the extreme case, we have the official authorisation of book burning. Books contain evil thoughts and encourage individuals to think for themselves. If books are removed from society then the power to control the individual is that much greater.Although written more than fifty years ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" still resonates today. Yes, the evils of the Soviet Union and its satellites are no longer with us and the cold war has been left to the dustbin of history. However, whenever given the chance, governments of all colours just love to seek control through censorship. Even in the west, governments hanker for greater control as a means of stemming the growth of terrorism or whatever else they deem to be a danger to them. As citizens, we should always question any attempt to increase the power of government over what the population can read or watch or listen. We must always be vigilant.Ray Bradbury is a man of great prescience. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" can legitimately be compared with the master works of George Orwell. This is true praise as Orwell rests in the pantheon of the geniuses and Bradbury deserves his place in the sun just as much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school and, well, you know the routine. I thought, \\"Oh, great, assigned reading, this'll be so boring to read,\\" et cetera. Boy, was I ever wrong.Set in America's not-too-distant future, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to set fire to houses where books are found. He loves his job, and never once doubts his happiness in life - that is, until he meets a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse. Clarisse tells Montag of a past when the censorship of books was nonexistent - and more importantly, of a past when everyone could truly be a unique individual.Thus begins a riveting (and frighteningly prophetic) tale as Montag finally begins to question things he never questioned before and sets out on a quest to find the truth. Not only will the author leave you contemplating the novel itself, but the unsettling possibility of this kind of censorship actually surfacing in the tomorrow of America."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a high school teacher, and Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books to teach. First of all, the students enjoy the story, the images, and the writing style. With an opening sentence of \\"It was a pleasure to burn,\\" even students who usually don't like reading \\"eat\\" up this novel. With Bradbury's eerie insight into today's society (the book was written in the 1950's) and the topics of censorship, the value of books, etc, I never run out of things to discuss with the students.The novel makes people think, question today's society, remember great pieces of literature, and explore controversial topics. Despite instances of mild language, the images of the book stick with the reader; the mechanical hound, the hearth and the salamander, the venom spitting python hose are just some of those fantastic images that permeate the book.I highly recommend the novel. It's worth a second read if you haven't picked it up in awhile, and if you've never read it, you are missing one fabulous novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In his world, firemen started fires to burn books-as both their job and their own pleasure. He never questions why they burned books or the way society was, until he met a seventeen year old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who, with the help of an old professor helped him examine the past and what they have become in the present. Guy began to question society, and figure out what he had to do to change it.When I originally began reading this book, I found it confusing and a little hard to follow because of its futuristic setting and characters. However, as I got farther into the book, it was easier to understand the story line and the plot. Even as he wrote it in 1953, Ray Bradbury makes outstanding points in his book about the messages that society and the media sends to us today. No matter how convincing they may be, it is the truth that matters. This book opened my eyes to many questions about the way we live today, and how we can change the bad one step and a time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is over 50 years old now. Somehow, it just keeps becoming more and more accurate a look at American society. Yes, Bradbury nailed the American apathy and isolationism of his complacent 1950s world. That's still there. He also scores a bullseye on the eternal button earplug, always there to drown the real world with its soothing, private murmur. His video walls look increasingly familiar, as home theater becomes more common and as the 60\\" screens give way to 80\\" and 100\\". And, of course, the book-bannings. We have those in plenty, based on every ism in the catalog. Sexism, satanism, racism, to name a few, along with the anti-evolution nuts. Bradbury also foretold the decay of personal relationships, giving examples that sound bitterly like today's front pages.He got one wrong, though. Bradbury seemed to hope that nuclear war on US soil would cauterize the social wounds. We've seen a bit too vividly what a house of cards we live in, how sensitive the power, health, communication, and even emergency infrastructure are, how tiny outages cascade into national-level failures. The nuclear fallout would be bad enough, and Bradbury seemed to hold the \`50s idea of a winnable nuclear war. I just don't think he appreciated the enormity of the general collapse that would follow even one major city falling - but he didn't have our examples to learn from.Half a hundred years later, this book is painfully pertinent. And, in the blackest of ironies, Bradbury's warning against censorship and bowdlerism has itself been subject to censorship and bowdlerism. Read it to find out why. If you've read it, read it again.Who knows, your memory may be the one that keeps this book alive.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"...Very few people see the obvious in this masterful work by Mr. Bradbury...It's not only a political commentary against anti-intellectualism ( President Bush...are you paying attention?!)...But this work is also a clever love story...There are enough admirers of Bradbury's work reading here that may have noted the old triangle Bradbury throws out about middle aged Guy Montague's married wanderlust with a much younger, teenaged girl...The old master doesn't carry this down the regular Valentine road though...He couches Montague's fondness and interest in the fetching young Clarisse around the subject and \\"love\\" of books...It is easy to see the sexual connection Bradbury draws via vivid descriptions on the smell and feel of books...Indeed, Bradbury makes the choice the characters in this most novel of novels must make between the constrained fidelity of 457's society of anti-intellectual constraints versus the uninhibited option of free love in not only one's thinking but in the individual's life and love as a decision a person must make with every bit of fervor and \\"love\\" that they have...Mr. Bradbury makes his choice for the latter in a most convincing, romantic, and egalitarian manner...His spectacular if somewhat cliche ending lets the reader know in no uncertain terms that Bradbury wishes the reader to make and promote the books point of being for knowledge or against it as the crucible of what to take away from this splendid tale...Enough so, that one may indeed wonder what beautiful depths and dimensions Bradbury might have added to this work by giving the character Clarisse more of a voice and part in the book...Certainly, the further fleshing out of the romantic attraction between Montague and Clarisse this reviewer doesn't believe would have detracted from the work, far from it, perhaps it would have added a dimension to the story that seems waiting to be told...Reading any of Bradbury's gorgeous work...\\"The Illustrated Man\\", \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", \\"Dandelion Wine\\", or any of his many short story compilations are absolute rapture for the true bibliophile...Sitting down with Bradbury is like being able to dream while you read...Both are things we don't have enough of in today's \\"Bush-whacked\\" culture...Pick up this one today and send a message to the Nascar set!..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND I HAD NOTHING TO DO SO I PICKED UP THIS BOOK, FAHRENHEIT 451, BY RAY BRADBURY.

IN THIS NOVEL, FIREMEN DO NOT EXTINGUISH FIRES BUT IGNITE THEM USING KEROSENE. THE ACT OF SEEKING KNOWLEDGE IS FROWNED UPON AND THOSE WHO INSIST UPON READING AND ARE CAUGHT WITH BOOKS HAVE THEIR LIVES BURNED TO ASHES.

It made me think of what life would be like without books, cause that's basically what Ray Bradbury is trying to portray. Sure, some people say it is far fetched, but you never know what things are going to be like in the future. I would have given this book a 5 Star Rating, however, the thing I didn't like about it was that it was very confusing. It kept switching from one thing to another.

There is true wisdom and serious warnings that Bradbury writes about, and I encourage all of you who had to read it for school and hated it, pick it up again sometime in the future when you are ready to really think about it and act on it. It is something everyone should read sometime in their lifetime."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a prescient, cautionary tale about the dangers of censorship and the stifling of reason and empathy.Guy Montag, the protagonist, represents the moral conscience of a society gone mad. In the imaginary, hellish society created by Bradbury, Montag has conformed to the prevailing irrational belief that books are for burning--and, by extension, that the fire of intellectual curiosity is something to be extinguished. Yet persistent reminders of a time when people could think for themselves compel him to look for the causes of his own as well as his society's senselessness. A beautiful girl reminds him of the simple power of nature and art. An aging professor extols the virtue of great literature. In the process of Monatag's search, the reader, too, explores the nature of curiosity and the forces that would squash it. For example, we come against the deadening superficiality of television and the unyielding closed-mindedness of the authority figures in total control.Unlike 1984, another dystopian novel pitting man against an irrational society, Bradbury offers a hopeful, uplifting ending, where those who would dare to think are about to escape to start a better world. This injection of cautious optimism is but one of the masterful flourishes Bradbury offers that make his work stand out from others of this genre. This is a magnificent story of the triumph of knowledge over artificiality and pretense."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The unfamiliar circumstances in this story are analogous to the present in several aspects, conveying a relatable character in a strange world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader.

We may not literally make books illegal, but socially, they already are. In this tale, Guy Montag is a fireman whose job is to burn books, and the houses that contain them. Then a \\"17 year old and crazy\\" girl puts some questions into his mind. Then he meets an old professor who brings on more questions. These characters make Montag question the society, and as a result, his life gets turned upside down.This book was published way back in 1953, when society was just starting down the road that leads where it is today. Many things foretold in this book have come true in one form or another. Most people have become mentally stagnant. TV and video games have replaced books and creative thinking. I knew very few people in high school who enjoyed reading anything besides web-pages and TV guides. This book is worth reading just to get a kick in the stomach at how closely the book's society mirrors our own.Many people have complained of the confusing writing style the Bradbury uses. I agree that it is a little difficult to follow at first, but you get use to it rather quickly. The only time that I had excessive trouble understanding what was happening, was the last couple of pages. I found the ending to be confusing. But, I just read it again and found some cliff-notes online, and now I understand what happened perfectly. Personally, I like the writing style because it is somewhat confusing. It makes you think for yourself in order to understand what is happening.So, if you are looking for a great book, this is one of the best I have read. I highly recomend Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 to anyone. Please read it so you can understand where our society is headed. Please read this book and aide in avoiding this very probable future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451* over 50 years ago; it's theme of the 'Big Brother' autocratic society, has often had it compared to Orwell's 1984.Before I read this book I knew absolutely nothing of the story or its draconian motif. So finding out the altered definition of 'fireman' that this book refers to was a revelation, to say the least.The story: *SPOILER*This is the tale of Guy Montag, a 'fireman' within this repressed society; a society in which 'happiness' is permitted and even encouraged, but free thinking is frowned upon in the strongest terms. And what is the most obvious example of free thinking...why books of course. Thus we discover that Montag is a 'fireman' and his job is to burn books; burn books, so that no one in the future will every get a sense of history or get any ideas about changing the present regieme into a free thinking society. Montag's problem is that he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right; thus his personal revolt begins, and not surprisingly he finds friends and enemies in unexpected places.I liked the style in which Bradbury developed Montag; Everyone in this society is suppose to be happy, but Montag is increasingly unhappy. He is constantly talking to himself, always doubting himself and his new, 'radical' thoughts. It's not difficult to feel empathy towards Montag as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his position and he begins to question his thinking and his own sanity. His wife (and her friends), his job and his desire to read books all contribute in ways to reduce his ability to handle his increasingly difficult situation.Subjectively, I liked the first 2/3s of the book better than the latter; not knowing anything about this tale added to the intrigue and mystery at the beginning, making it hard to put the book down. I didn't find the latter 1/3 quite as 'believable' and that compelling sense of urgency that defined the first part seemed to disappear, and for this I took off 1/2 Star.Conclusion:A great book, much different than I'd expected. Well written, with a wonderfully developed hero; giving us many glimpses of a distressed and complex personality who is in an ongoing battle with his own inner demons, and a waffling conscience that's unsure of it's moral obligations as it fights to maintain his sanity.Interesting to see that some of Bradbury's thoughts of the future are not all that far off in certain parts of the world today; some maybe closer to home that we'd like to believe.* 451 deg. Fahrenheit, is the temperature at which paper begins to scorch and crumple."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first encountered this book at the age of 13, I was more accustomed to 'choose your own adventure' books or pulp science fiction. I'd never heard of Bradbury, but realized as I fought through the first few chapters that I was in over my head. I stuck it out however, and when I was done, my life had changed forever. Since then I have read this book many times, and it is always with a particular fondness because this is the book that taught me to read. To read as more than someone who desires nothing more than to be entrained.That is not to say that Bradbury isn't entertaining. I've always found him to be one of the most successfully entertaining science fiction writers of all time. FAHRENHEIT 451 is on of his best. Conceptually simple (books are outlawed and the world has become a dreary, dystopian place where cheap thrills and wars fought with disease bombs are the norm) but wise and deep in substance, Bradbury successfully weaves characters and plot into a profound statement about the essential nature of human kind and how the best of our writing can, if used (read) properly, even save us from ourselves.There are few accolades that I can give this book that have not been already said more eloquently elsewhere. This is book filled with profound truth, a book that inspires, and a book that illustrates the best and worst of what men are capable of. Ultimately about the hope we have in the sum of human knowledge, few other books will make you treasure the act of reading and the privilege of owning books like this one will."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a journey through the future of what our world turned in to. Guy Montag was a firefighter, but instead of putting out fires, they started them. In their world books were illegal and anyone who had them in their home would be removed and their house would be burned. Montag has burned many houses, but this one burning really struck him and he took a good look at reality. He never noticed the importance of books and goes through many, many adventures you'll just have to read for yourself.I personally don't like science fiction, but this book really grabbed my attention. At the beginning it was a little difficult to understand what was going on and it was hard getting into the story, but as you read on everything starts to fall into place and make sense. The thing about this book that I found the most interesting was I read it and almost felt as if things in that book were true. It seemed like our world would end up like that in their century, this book was very believable and made me want to read more. Everyone should read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" at least once in their life because it is very well written and a truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's classic, Farenheit 451, he describes a terrifying but all-too-real world of sensory overload and thought-depravity. Guy Montag is a fireman, but this fire brigade doesn't put out fires (for houses are fire proofed with plastic coatings), but instead starts them, burning houses (and often people) where books are found. And people, for the most part, don't question the way of things; in fact, most people simply contributed to them, reading less and less, being less and less interested in dissenting views and complex views of reality. Instead people opt for graphic novels filled with sex, and talking \\"parlors,\\" living rooms with televisions on three (and sometimes four) walls that surround the viewer in a virtual reality that becomes family, friends, entertainment, and knowledge. There is no taking walks, no late evening chats on the front porch; in short, little or no thought. But Guy slowly emerges from the haze of this contrived reality, as he first encounters a strange girl who doesn't seem to be charmed by the way things are, and then comes to see his own duties as a fireman as brutal and senseless. Didn't firemen used to actually put out fires? he wonders.Montag, now repulsed by his occupation, starts looking for a way out. And on the way, he begins slipping books into his coat as he is burning houses, one here, one there, until he's got his own little library. But soon his captain, Beatty, is on to him, and the mechanical hound, the instrument of doom and seeker of people and books, finds him out. Montag is left with the choice, burn his own house or admit guilt. He starts his house ablaze, but then turns the flame thrower on Beatty and on the mechanical hound and makes a break for it. He is now a man on the run, but a free man for the first time. He finds himself among a group of run-aways along a deserted railroad track, and discovers they are former professors and preachers, and each one holds inside him a chapter or a book. One is Thoreau, one is Marcus Aurelius, one is Plato's Repulic, and so on. Montag is the book of Ecclesiastes. And as their civilization seems to be spiraling toward an end in a huge and destructive war, the wisdom of that great book, that everything has a time and a season, seems a pointer to the possibility of a new reality, a fresh start.Bradbury's Farenheit 451 is a prophetic novel that bears freightening resemblance to our world today. Our culture resembles the reality he paints in its obsession with virtual reality (think \\"reality TV\\" and our obsession with this fictive family or friend network, as just one examle), media saturation, and shallowness. Our politics are driven by sound bites and media experts more than they are driven by policy positions and reasoned debates. Marketing is more important than product quality. And this is just the beginning. Reading Bradbury's classic is like a wake-up call to appreciate the wisdom of the ages, the beauty of friendships, the value of family, and the wonder that is a quiet walk in the woods. It is truly a treasure trove of reality, all tinged with the hope redemption."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book deals with the still-controversial issue of government censorship-the worst case scenario. Not only does the government limit people's ability to think for themselves, but the entertainment and advertising industry picks up their slack. This possible universe contains 3-D televisions to live in, cars that travel more than 100 mph, and radios that can be plugged directly into the ear when there's nothing else to do. A society in which presidential elections and the declaration of war is no cause for concern, and certainly not more important than what's happening on the most popular television program.A world where the acquisition of knowledge isn't a goal and where there are no books. In fact, books are illegal, and when someone concealing them is found, their books are burned as well as their house. And if the person doesn't come out of the house...it's a shame, but nothing to lose sleep over.That is Guy Montag's job; to burn books and this is the world in which he has lived, and it is the only world he knows. Until his life is changed forever by a series of revelations, including a friendship with a young woman named Clarisse who tells him what living really means and shows him that his life has really been a ghost-life. After that realization, his life fell apart. He realized he was living an empty life with an immoral, mindless, violent job, a wife he doesn't know-and doesn't love-and no one he could truly call a friend except Clarisse.Confused and distraught, Guy fled to find guidance about books, the future, life, and-most of all-himself, from the one man he thinks can help: an old professor by chance. From there, his journey takes him on a whirlwind of soul-searching and discovery, which will shake your beliefs and force you to reconsider your ethics and all else you hold dear."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 1953 phantasmagoric blockbuster \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", written at the height of the fabulist's authorial powers, is a tale of a world gone mad, a topsy-turvy America in which black leather-clad firemen race laughing on their steely Salamanders on midnight alarms, not to quench fires but to start them.The firemen of the nightmare world of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", of which the novel's hero Guy Montag is a dedicated one, comprise an army turned against an enemy far more insidious than Flame: they mobilize against ideas, and turn their napalm hoses on the feeble paper on which those subversive ideas are printed, and on the vulnerable binding in which the paper is housed.When I first read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" nearly two decades ago, I felt beaten down, nauseated and fatigued. I believed then, and believe now, that it was the most scarily bleak and mercilessly depressing book I had ever read. Even then, I felt the cushion between Bradbury's 24th century nightmare and what we call modern reality was thin and worn.Bradbury gave us until the 24th century to submerge ourselves in the dark, sedated, media-slaked night of \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Looking around me, I have come to the conclusion that Bradbury was a pretty optimstic guy.Like Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a dystopian vision, a glimpse into a future America that is frighteningly familiar and yet horribly wrong. It is a technologically advanced, subtle, sophisticated world, full of high-definition television screens that take up an entire wall and beam 24 hour programming to a vacant and eager television audience, 24-hour Reality programming that serves up a TV \\"Family\\" more engaging, more lifelike, more agreeable, than their own.This is a world where bored, vacuous housewives exchange barbs on the latest presidential contenders laced with observations on which candidate is the most handsome, and which has the most noticeable (to the Television Audience, naturally) facial bunion or boil. It is a world of 'seashells', tiny earphones designed to nest in the inner ear and breathe a sussurus of music into the mind of a medicated listener.Like his English counterparts Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury has served up a soft tyrannical state manned, not by the zealous, but by zombies. It is a world ruled by the media-addicted, the apathetic, the listless, the medicated, the overdosed, the sleeping. Books have been banned, and consigned to the Flame, not because of a despotic regime, but by the common, courteous consensus of a modern democracy desperately eager not to give offense to anyone.Sound familiar?Much like \\"1984\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" works because it drills down on an unlikely protagonist. Guy Montag, at least when we meet him, sincerely loves his job. His fellow firemen are not zealots or fascists, but simply pragmatic working men who enjoy what they do. There are unpleasant aspects to the work, naturally---among them the incineration of an old eccentric woman who prefer to die with her beloved books---but like most of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"'s society, Montag prefers not to think about it. Take a pill, or better still take two---and don't call me in the morning. For Montag, truly, it is a 'pleasure to burn'.Like most revolutionaries, though, Guy Montag is simmering from within; dissatisifed with his wife, whose stomach must be pumped on the very evening he returns from the euphoria of the Burn; dissatisifed with the apathetic society in which he lives; dissatisfied with a job which fails to give expression to the rebel soul that burns within, that impels him to challenge his wife's brazen, flippant friends.There are three catalysts that propel Montag to rebellion: the girl Clarisse, whom he befriends; the immolation of the old woman at the Fire; and his own clandestine book collection.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" succeeds as both jeremiad and prophecy, true, but it also engages because Bradbury is a literary master: his spare, mechanical narrative of Montag's wife having her stomach pumped by two callous, dirty, jocular technicians practically breathes pure horror, and is one of the most soul-deadening passages I have ever read.But \\"451\\" also succeeds because it is a mirror of our own increasingly apathetic, violent, media-saturated world: is it so hard to see ourselves in Montag's trackless, cookie-cutter suburban landscape where bookish teenage girls are run down beneath the wheels of speeding pranksters, themselves bored and looking for the cheap thrill of ultra-violence? Is it so hard to see ourselves in the avidity of the Television Audience, watching the panicked, doomed, frantic rictus face of the condemned man stalked by the mechanical Hound, the images of his death broadcast back by the electronic antennaes on the monster's back? Isn't that merely COPS or \\"Survivor\\" with a bite?I've seen the Future, and it works. Because it is our world I see, our world upon us---for that reason, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the most terrifying book I have ever read.JSG"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury does a great job of capturing the future of man, in his desire to reject thinking and embrace mindless leisure. The future world involves a backwards world where firemen start fires to rid the world of books, because that is in the best interest of good social order. But our hero is a fireman who develops a conscience, after meeting a spunky 17 year old who has dreams and challenges our man that the world may have been different in the past.The tension between our hero and his fire captain boss, as well as the tension with his mindless wife, are excellent. The whole story is an eye opener, full of compelling action and riviting philosophical discussion.I enjoyed the notes from Mr Bradbury in the 50th anniversary edition where he admits he subconsciously gave our protagonist the name of a paper company, and the name of his professor friend from a pencil company.This is a classic that will endure for centuries, despite whatever firemen exist in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At some point, Ray Bradbury states in his novel \`Fahrenheit 451': \`The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies'. Bearing this in mind, it is doubtless that Bradbury is included among the good writers. In his novel, he managed to create a parable about the intellectual wakening of a man and the dangers of censorship, in a society where people are not allowed to think.In an undefined future, the firemen job is to start fire. They are supposed to burn books, and the houses of people who keep published material. Guy Montag is a fireman who has never questioned the pleasures of burning, until one day when out of curiosity he takes a copy of a book home and together with his wife he tries to read. However, they have never read a book, and while they can read, they are not able to understand, to connect the sentences. This is just the awakening of Montag's mind. We know there is something about him, and that he won't be the same until we reach the last page.Rather than being far fetcher Bradbury created a timeless story. Things like those describes in the book have been happening for ages. We may not literally burn books, but books, newspapers and magazines are burnt everyday. Like he describes in the book it began with one minority ripping one paragraph, then another, then one more... until the day that it would be better to burn the whole book. We live in the age of minorities, and we should watch out some request.The present edition is followed by an \`Afterword' and a \`Coda' written by Bradbury in first person. In the first he tells specifically about this novel, the process of writing and once more give voice to his characters to talk about themselves and they world they --and us-- live. In the second part, the writer talks about how timeless his novel indeed is. These two last chapters are very clarifying and help a lot in the understanding of the book. My suggestion is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day. And then do your part to avoid things in this book becoming real, because \`Fahrenheit 451' can be anything, but far fetched."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of the people I know who have read this book, roughly three-fourths of them loved it and the other fourth hated it. I would be in the former group.Fahrenheit 451 tells of a not too distant future where all books are banned, and anyone caught with even one book has it, and the rest of their belongings, burned. It describes a future where human life means next to nothing and war is not uncommon. I won't go any further into the plot, as many other reviewers already have.Ray Bradbury has a mastery of the English language that requires the book to be read slowly in order to be fully understood, but it is ultimately very rewarding. For the type of book it is, it is the perfect length. It has just enough details to keep you interested, but not too many to bog down the enjoyment. And it is paced perfectly.I've seen this book getting quite a few comparisons to Orwell's 1984. I have read both books, and I don't think they really compare. 1984 is a slower, much more detailed look into a government, while Fahrenheit 451 is faster paced and focuses on one aspect of the government of the future.I've read the book no less than four times, and enjoy it more each time. It is now one of my favorite books.It does have to be read slowly due to Bradbury's metaphorical way of writing. I consider it Bradbury's masterpiece, and while all may not agree, you should at least give it a try, taking time to absorb exactly what it is Bradbury is saying."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have conflicting feelings for this book. I appreciate the disturbing, yet very real, idea brought to light in this story: what if books really were burned, and that was normal? What if the majority of society was just a slew of brain-washed followers? Those themes, among others, in this book are important to consider, in my opinion. I, for one, cherished books and the freedom to own them more after having read this book. Unfortuantely, I didn't really enjoy the actual reading of this novel. The writing seemed, if not flat, then more devoid of emotion than it ought to have been. I like writing to be descriptive and fulfilling, while still understandable. Bradbury's writing is, at times, flowery past my point of immediate comprehension, and at other times, not quite creative enough. There are certain lines in this book that didn't read quite right, and some ideas I didn't think were adequately explained. The mechanical dog- interesting idea, vague deliverance. The 'family' was interesting as well, though I don't think that Bradbury explored it enough. This novel's main flaw was, in the most extreme sense, flat writing. My opinion might be more biased because of a rather severe project I had to do on the book after having read it, which deflated my liking for it a bit, but I hope I've been as objective as possible. I'd recommend reading this book, as it is a fine piece of easy-to-read literature and a fascinating look into the future of books, though don't expect for a masterpiece on your hand. The writing could definately have been better filled out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read Ray Bradbury in my literature book, in English class. I was instantly hooked. His writing has a simplicity to it, but at the same time, an amazing profoundness. I immediately went out to the bookstore and bought a book of his short stories--then another, and finally, I read Fahrenheit 451. His style is constant--his use of metaphors has more of an impact than any other author I've ever read. He has a rare ability to deviate from the regular stereotypes of the future, making the settings as believable as if they were set in the present time.I immensely enjoyed this. It really conveyed the image of what a world would be like without books--lacking substance and meaning; having pleasure at violence and taking for granted what they had. Mr. Bradbury never ceases to amaze me. The character, Montag, was a perfect balance of the influences society had impacted him, and his own emerging understanding of reality.I'm greatly inspired by this, and I hope to mature enough to write something of as much quality as Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sure the story of a nightmare world in which free speech is forbidden, as a parable for the directions our real-life society is going, has been done a million times - both before and after \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" So why is Bradbury's book a classic? The key is his superior writing skills and offbeat social subversion. In Bradbury's world, free speech has not been suppressed through a fascist exercise in social control and forced conformity, as in Huxley's similar \\"Brave New World.\\" Instead, in this book free speech has been eliminated indirectly through what would now be called rampant political correctness. Every single piece of free speech might be offensive to someone somewhere, so all books and entertainment are eliminated so the masses can waste away in feel-good conformity. Ignorance is bliss in this world. This is a groundbreaking concept for a book written way back in the 50's. Bradbury must have been terrified by the PC hordes that broke out 30 or 40 years later. The one major problem with this book is the characters. The protagonist Montag is ultimately narrow and undefined, even though most of the story concerns his inner struggles. The other main characters - Beatty, Faber, and Granger - exist only as longwinded speechifiers for Bradbury's ideas. But the book is saved by the real sense of creeping dread and social agony lurking in the background, all highlighted by Bradbury's intriguing prose and curveball plot techniques.Be sure to read an edition of this book published after around 1980. Prior to that, editors had abridged the book without Bradbury's consent, removing some troubling passages for the sake of helpless schoolkids (or more likely, their holier-than-thou educators). This is the ultimate irony - censorship of a book about censorship! Be on the lookout for an edition containing Bradbury's \\"Coda\\" (or epilogue) - a blistering indictment of this issue in which Bradbury essentially tells all opponents to kiss his you-know-what, in a quite scathing way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I guess I've always wanted to be an individual, to look deeper and find the rich goodness of life and freedom in being me. I have found this richness through books. When i discovered Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, it was the book that defined my love of the me that I am. I think Faber said it best, when he told Montag &quot;I don't talk things, sir; I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know I am alive.&quot; After I read this book I knew I wasn't the only one who craved a richer life through the great world of imagaination and books and knowledge. You see, I am alive and thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have really enjoyed reading the book Fahrenheit 451. The book takes place in a society which is completely different than ours, at some point in the future. In this society it is illegal to have books of any kind, and the story depicts the man whose job it is to go around and burn these books. The fireman, Guy Montag, begins to go against his job, and sneaks books so that he can read them. I am not usually a fan of many books, so I thought that a world without books would be a great place to live. After reading this Ray Bradbury novel my view has changed. Because there are no books in this society there is no way for the people to express themselves, and everyone ends up being almost exactly the same. This type of uniformity was the direct result of not having books for people to read and allow them to write to express their feelings. This story has taught me that books are an important forum for expression, and when a book can keep me interested and reading throughout, and send an important message, that is a quality book in my mind. That is why Fahrenheit 451 got a four star rating from me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A nice easy read for someone who may be interested in a futuristic fun read. Guy Montag brings to the reader a whole new life style that no one has ever experienced. I enjoyed reading this book because there was never a moment when I felt bored with what I was reading or thought of putting it down. I recommend this book to the young adult who is looking for an a relaxing, fun read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451: less than 200 pages and has an interesting title. If these two facts weren't enough to make me pick a book to do a project on, I don't know what else would make me. Fortunately, my interest in this book would later become much deeper than simple laziness.What started off as a series of stories in a science fiction magazine would become a novel set in the future world. Books have been banned, and there was a strong force to enforce this policy. Guy Montag, the main character of this story, was one of the many who set ablaze to homes containing books. Montag was happy in a world where the role of the fire department had been reversed from years ago. That is, until he meets a young lady named Clarisse. After a couple of pleasureful conversations and her sudden disappearance, Montag's subconscious dislike of the society he lives in is unlocked. He realizes the shallowness of society starting with his own wife who thinks of her family as three television screens in the parlor. He is also particulary bothered by a woman who was willing to burn with her house after being caught with books. It is all now clear that this society and its censorship has gone terribly wrong.What Bradbury wants to bring our attention to is not that books have been banned, but that restricted society didn't happen in a matter or 24 hours. One word banned over the airwaves leads to another, leads to another leads to another. Pretty soon, free speech and thought aren't even tangible. Though this is a ficticious society, it is realisitic that this type of thing has happened in past civilizations and is still being tried in other areas of the world.At first a slow read became a blazing pace through words of predicition and fear of what could theoretically happen to a society in this world. The fact this could happen will stay with me for a long time. The book makes me want to keep my mind open to everything that i can. I think that's a pretty good thing to come out with after a short 2 hour read. And finally, if I had never heard of the book, I wouldn't know that i really could use the cardboard dish used to cook instant brownies in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of all the Distopia oriented books I have read this is my favorite. It's also the one that I think had the most probibility of actually happening. Not necessarily book-burning, but the whole complex of censoring things to make everyone happy. That sort of stuff is happening more and more everyday.Nothing else to say besides it's frightening and brilliant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed this book to an extent. I disliked a lot of things about it also. This book is about a futuristic time where censorship has been taking too far. The idea that as we keep censoring different things to please different minorities we sometimes lose a lot that is good I found very appealing. It seems as if society today does seem to censor too much and is it fixed on appealing to everyone.In this book we find what would happen if we did try to appeal to everyone and not offend anyone. It shows the future without books as being filled with people that have no personalities. People pretty much become drones, each person exactly like the last. The main character, Guy Montag's wife is a perfect example of this. She has no life outside of watching television, which is how most people spend their time in this story. Montag is a fireman who in this day burns books rather than put out fires. He later meets characters who intrigue him and get him to start stealing some books to read and find out what they are about. He soon finds the problems with his society that he is a part of and understands the importance of books.Although this book did have some great points to the negative side of censorship I couldn't really enjoy how unrealistic it was. I just couldn't get over the fact that all people had banned books completely. It was just an unrealistic future in my eyes and I couldn't get over it. Overall, I would recommend this book to all readers even with my dissatisfaction of it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For Guy Montag burning the books is a way of life. Never once did he give a second thought to the fact that there was a time, and could again be a time when firemen prevented fires instead of starting them, and book were meant, and allowed to be read, not burned.My favorite aspect of Fahrenheit 451 was how real it was. Although it is a fictional, futuristic novel, the sense that the senerio could happen is chilling to a society that prides itself on freedom of speech and equal liberties.I like Bradbury's writing style also. At first I had little faith that this book could keep my interest, but not too far into reading I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The language kept you hanging onto every word. Not only was it catching, it was easy to understand and read, yet had a sense of maturity to it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;, you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read by my mom after she read the reading list Mrs. Spehar gave us, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book where I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Before I decided to read this novel, I knew one thing and one thing only about this book, and that was that it was about burning books for some reason. Now that I have read it, I am blown away by how this was written and how thought out it was.The novel starts out set in the future, the main character and the protagonist in this case is a man by the name of Guy Montag. Montag takes great pleasure in his profession, which is a fireman. I like how his job is not to put the fires out but to start them. The fires they start are the burning of contraband, which in this case are books. You aren't allowed to read in the future because reading causes people to think by making them curious and the government jams what they want you to think down your throat. Which isn't too different with today's society, with the video games and television, the reading of books is decreasing, causing people to become less educated. Now a day's television programs force feed you their biased opinions which I think isn't too different from what Bradbury describes. The reality they live in isn't a pretty one. Drivers instead of having a maximum speed limit, have a minimum one. This forces them to drive at blazing speeds and they actually run people over for fun and wars come and go numerously which is absolutely insane.Montag soon becomes bored with his job and his life in general. He steals a book from the collection he was supposed to burn as a means to lower his increasing uneasiness. This leads up to my absolute favorite part in the book. The owner of the books he stole which is an older woman refuses to leave her home, which is to be burned to the ground. Instead, the woman sets fire to her house herself, and stays there as her books and she are destroyed. It makes him realize that the written word is a very valuable thing and only the very enlightened know that.The next thing I liked was that, after hiding the books he had stolen, he was forced to burn his own house and all of his possessions which is a great turn of events. He then gets into a scuffle with his boss and he is warned that he will be dealt with severely. Montag then kills him and is soon perused by a Mechanical hound, which can track anyone down. He then kills that with a flamethrower and retrieves his books.This leads me to the part I disliked, the ending. Montag essentially meets up with a group of intellectuals and hides out until it is once again safe to print books. When bombs destroy the city, they sift through the rubble and begin a new society where man is free to learn and prosper. The reason I disliked this is because it really didn't describe what the new society would have been like. I really wish Bradbury went more in depth on what the new society would have been like.Lastly, although I loved this novel, it could have been way longer, perhaps by not ending the novel where he did and maybe going more into the future and explaining how everything ended up. All in all I am very happy I read this book, and I would recommend this to everyone. Not just the guys."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This story of shattering the oppression of American literature has raised many questions among readers of all walks of life. Guy Montag's expedition was one of self-realization and immense resolve. The inspirational journey involved self-discovery and social hardships. Fahrenheit 451, lets the reader into Guy Montag, a fireman who is slowly but surely seeing his warped world for what it is. The author, Ray Bradbury's clear and descript way of writing shows the reader what type of man Montag is. Bradbury also opens up a new world in describing the city and its citizen's beliefs.Being one of the most unique books of its kind, it's no surprise Fahrenheit 451 has been read and analyzed over and over. The story begins with Guy Montag happily burning books, but by the end of the story, his entire perspective of fire itself had changed completely. All in all, Guy Montag learned that burning the fire is the only way to cure his war-torn world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a student at a high school and I finished reading &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; in a week and a half. I was very much impressed by the story and how it gets better after the introduction I thought it would be boring book about a firemen but it's a story that takes turns all around. The characters are all taken very much into mind. He gives them all unique personalities, although it's a short story, each chapter is like a bio on one of the many characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very good story about a struggling public servant who is deeply confused by the twisted world that surrounds him. As a fireman in this backwards society, he is expected to burn books and the houses that contain them, but can no longer bring himself to do it as he once did. Books are outlawed and burned because they are the source of much confusion and varying points of view. The government could not bear it any longer, so it opted to simply destroy the books. Firemen are now employed to start fires instead of stopping them. The main character is Guy Montag, along with his wife Mildred and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag tries very hard to beat the system by hiding and reading books, but cannot contain his frustration. He is found out and flees to save his life.Guy Montag is my favorite character in this book. He goes through many changes and has quite an adventure. In the end, in order to escape and be free, he has to defeat his boss and kill the deadly Mechanical Hound, which is a machine used to track down fugitives.Fahrenheit 451 is also a story about the contradictory principle of censorship. Ray Bradbury shows what the effects of censorship are mental unrest and dissatisfaction with the quality of life. He writes about it hoping to get the attention and open the reader's eyes to face this evident threat that is in fact a reality.I can, in some way, relate to Montag. He was different from most people and managed to beat the system in the end. Although I have never killed any one or burned down houses like he did, but I do share the same spirit of dissatisfaction with the rules of society. There are many things wrong with this world that I am not happy with. Much of my unhappiness is towards hypocrisy. For example, how can the government mandate that an 18 year old male go and die for the US, yet he cannot be declared financially independent until he is 24? Or how can this same 18 year old male cast a vote to put a man into office and elect a president, but he cannot have a drop of alcohol until he is 21? Like Montag, I also struggle with society's rules and points of view. We may differ in cause, but the spirit is the same.I enjoyed reading this book. Mr. Bradbury knows how to tell a good story. I especially liked the climax, which was, of course, the best part of the book. The only thing that I do not like, perhaps due to my impatience, are the long and wordy monologues. But then again, these are essential to the storyline of the book. This is how Bradbury is able to explain confusing parts in the story. He uses them as a movie would use flashbacks. If it were up to me, I would just put a little more action in these parts.Of course, as would almost all readers of this story, I highly recommend this book. Students from grade level 9 and up will be able to truly appreciate it. Perhaps the misfits and outcasts in this society will enjoy it more, but in all, this is a good book for every one. Fahrenheit 451 will fit well in any literary collection, be it political or sci-fi or both."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What can I say that has not already been said.

In this story the government has become so corrupt that it has banned the ownership of any sort of literature. It is not until the day when protagonist Montag realizes, while talking to a young girl, how unhappy and naive he actually was. Bradbury takes the idea of a Utopia society and turns it completely upside downThis book shows the damaging effects on the censorships of books and stresses the importance of literature. This is a highly recommmended book to those seeking to open their eyes and realize the truth of how society can be. However, the story moves at a slow pace and many undifined things are exposed in the begining. Other than that, this is an exceptioally good book with an even better moral."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was an interesting book, not because of it's plot, but because of the way it made you think. It's exemplification of the way too much censorship can ruin the world makes you a little more aware of censorship everywhere. The book is about Montag, a fireman who starts fires that destroy books. In this futuristic world, Books are not allowed due to the controversy they create. People who do not follow the strict code of staying home and watching TV are persecuted. One day, after a meeting with a girl, Montag begins to realize the true beauty of books. Not a terribly hard book to read, Fahrenheit 451 had a few difficult vocab words and a few chaotic scenes, but mostly kept the plot simple. I would recommend this book to 6th or 7th graders trying to expand their vocabulary, or anyone else who wants a book that makes them think. I give this book a 7/10, only because I like more complex plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury once called himself a writer of &quot;speculative fiction.&quot; He most certainly based that statement on this very book. Bradbury's view of the future from 1953 is proving its merit now that it is beginning to come true. Similar to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's 1984, Bradbury's novel tells of a world in which the government has entrapped society in a web of propaganda. Bradbury's novel differentiates itself from the other two, however, in that it focuses on this oppressive government's censorship of literature and the &quot;firemen,&quot; who burn these illegal books. Fahrenheit 451 also is far more entertaining to read, as it is in pure Bradbury style, with vivid, colorful writing, and Bradbury's standard metaphors at every turn of the page. A great read for any Bradbury fan, a science fiction reader, or anyone who wants to see society with a whole new perspective. in sum, this book proves that Ray Bradbury has got the future's number. That number is, of course, Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"That's all there is to it. I enjoyed the story somewhat, but it was nothing to die over: there are better dystopian novels to come out of the Cold War years. But what made me love this novel (notice the 5 stars) was the poetic, eccentric narrative. Some pages depart from prose, and actually become poetry, and then revert back again.Due to the short length, this book can be done in a few hours, which is ideal for any casual reader. I would advise anyone to find the time to read through this book, just to enjoy Bradbury's prose, which has made a fan out of me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a utopian novel much like Huxley's Brave New World, Orwell's 1984, or Rand's Anthem. It is a startling depiction of a life where books are taboo, and reading is illegal. Instead, the people are dumbed down with constant noise and emotion devoid of purposeful thought. This novel is enthralling. It is vivid and potent because the telltale signs of demise are familar in our everyday lives: the importance that people are placing in TV (i.e. entertainment), the growing violence in children, the dumbing down of literature, and the impersonal relationships between family members. Bradbury has reminded me how much I love literature and impressed me to guard the gift of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For grade levels 11th and up, Fahrenheit 451 is sure to please readers of all intrests.

In the well-known novel Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. The story takes place in the near future at a town were the fire fighters don't put out the fires they start them. The fire fighters have five rules that they need to stick to 1) answer the alarm quickly 2) start the fire swiftly 3) burn every thing 4) report back to fire house immediately 5) stand alert for other alarms. So when the fire fighters hear the siren it means that someone in town has been caught with a book in their house. It is the fire fighters job to race down to the house and light it on fire whether the person living there is in or out of the house. Guy Montag, one of the fire fighters that takes pleasure in burning books is confronted one day by one of his new neighbors Clarisse McClellan a seventeen year old, she meets up with Guy a few times, but in their short time period's together Guy's world is thrown upside down. Clarisse questions him and tackles him about his job. She asks him what's the point and why does he do it. What's so wrong with book? His reply is that books are illegal. After all of the questions Guy became curious and takes books away from the burning pile. Little by little he starts wondering what was wrong with books, so he asked a professor to teach him.Ray Bradbury born in Waukegan, Illinois, on August 22, 1920. Ray wrote Fahrenheit 451 when he was 22 and has won many awards for his writing such as the O. Henry Memorial Award, the Benjamin Franklin Award (1954), and the Aviation-Space Writer's Association Award for Best Space Article in an American Magazine (1967), the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. His work was also included in the Best American Short Stories collections for 1946, 1948 and 1952.He has won all of these awards because he writes with a breathtaking style. This book has a fabulous plot that makes you think about what might happen in the future years if people keep watching more and more television and reading fewer and fewer books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved reading Fahrenheit 451, it was very enjoyable. I can see why it is considered a classic by many people. Also, it deals with issues that are more vibrant in our country today than when the book was originally published. The scary thing is, the society in the book has many striking similarities to our own today, especially now that Bush is in office again. Anyway, I reccomend this wonderful book to everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is about the future and what censorship can do to society and the importance of our free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree with them or not. First off it's about a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job is not to fight fire and put it out but to start the fires. At this time books are forbidden from people unless they were government writings. That is how the government controlled them: by not letting them learn. Although one day he can't help but read a line from one of the books he is about to burn. Of course he becomes curious and steals some books so that he can read them for himself. After starting to read the books he goes to an old professor to see if they can reprint some of these books. One night he came to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection. The fire captain drowns her books in kerosene except the old woman lights herself on fire along with her books. After seeing this Montag becomes disgusted and decides not to be a fireman any longer. Montag decides to go to work for just one more day and surprisingly they get a call to go to his house where he is the one to light his house on fire. Instead of lighting a match he kills the other men and goes on the run eventually meeting up with a group of old college professors in the woods and eventually becoming one of them.I disliked this book for a few reasons. The first one is because it is a futuristic book it is hard to follow in some places and the author describes some things in a way that is very difficult to understand.The reasons I liked this book is the fact that you have to create what you think the author is trying to make the future look like; and because Bradbury is a very descriptive writer he helps you create a picture of what you are reading. Another reason I liked this book is because I can relate to it. The people in our society are reading less and enjoying television and radios more than they should be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to \\"Seashell Radio\\" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The \\"normal\\" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose \\"family\\" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books \\"treacherous weapons,\\" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the \\"Book People,\\" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The plot of this book is based on the future and it's difference from the past. Perhaps the greatest difference is books and how people see them. Guy Montag is a fireman who realizes the significance of books. The twist is however; his occupation involves burning books because people are afraid of them.This novel has very interesting significance because it uses symbolism to give important lesson in knowledge. Books and knowledge. Books and knowledge are what gives us freedom.Learning that we take thoughts for granted is what makes Ray Bradbury such a great author. He managed to give a plot with a sudden turn into the jaw dropping conclusion of Fahrenheit 451. Using symbolic words and quotes of characters, he gets his message out loud and clear.After reading Fahrenheit 451 and learning about how much freedom every person has, Ray Bradbury's words are descriptive and share an important moral about life that the decisions we make can affect everyone else."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off this is an excellent book. I'll not bother to say what it's about \`cos everyone else has already done that. What I will say is that this book was written for all of you out there who hated it and want to see it burned. This book tells what is today so very well, with the poetic pose that Bradbury alone can use. No wonder he's only the second person EVER to be printed in TIME, and virtually every major magazine. In one sceen Montag reads poetry to a room of guests, they all burst into tears. The reason for this? They have never heard anything like it before, and can't understand it. Step into any high school English class and you'll find the same thing, kids not understanding and hating the book. Many people hate this book, they don't understand it. It describes mode day perfectly. Look at any college library were they have books that have been banned for being \\"intororant\\" \\"Little House On The Prairie\\", \\"The Bible\\" books that offended. In the world described in this book all, books offend, nobody understand them and if one person doesn't get it WHOOSH! up in flames it goes. That's why student's today read dull gutless books by contemporaries, instead of books to make you think like something by Dante, or Milton. God forbid the poor kid not understand something. A 12-year-old wrote, \\"This book is supposed to be about the future, but talks it resembles today\\" NO KIDDING! This alone shows the greatness of this book, it was written 50 years ago, and tells us about ourselves. They also claimed they could \\"not relate to anyone in the book.\\" What a shock! Got news kid this was written for adults, of COURSE you couldn't relate, how could you? Unless you're abnormally intelligent they couldn't. The teacher who assigned this book to a class of 12-year-olds should have their head examined; they weren't going to get it. Some people say Bradbury has a negative outlook on the future. Anyone who was read a book by him knows that. The reason? Bradbury has a firm grasp on reality, and knows that humans are evil, and will ultimately destroy themselves. He has good cause to be pessimistic, he looks at the modern world and shakes his head, and then try's to do something about it by educating us. For those of you who want to be educated, and are bright enough to understand this book, and the truth it shows, buy it. For the rest of you. Buy a meaningless book by I know not who, and find why nobody knows who they are. And leave book meant for bright people with eyes in their heads alone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never really enjoyed science fiction, but something about this book caught my eye. The story revolves around one lone fireman, Guy Montag, who, oddly enough, sets fire to books instead of putting them out. He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, &quot;thinks,&quot; not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My daughter has received this for the second time now as required reading for school (summer reading requirement). &quot;Oh Mom this book is awful&quot; she said, now for the second time. She read me a paragraph of the book and sure enough, it does sound awful when you read small snippets of the book. This book is not an easy read at all, not because it is overly intellectual -- it's not written very well, sorry Mr. Bradbury -- the author wrote in the afterward, that he wrote it in his early days of writing in various rooms of his house, finally ended up sequestered in his garage. I imagine that if the book was written later in Mr. Bradbury's career, that it would have been written far better than it was -- this is no literary masterpiece, but the concept it contains is a timeless one.That said, my daughter gave it to me to read and I read it in one sitting, wondering what was going to happen to the main character and how this book would end. This book is about a future society where books are illegal. The government has built a society where simple pleasure is the main goal in life, not meaningful pleasure. People live their lives around TV that takes up entire walls of their homes, no truly educational programming is allowed for the same reason that no books are allowed. The TV in this book creates not just light programming for society, but a family in the wall/screens -- it is mind numbing for that society. People become puppets where they live their lives out in simple ignorance and if you dare question the way things are or attempt to hide any books you are persecuted for it. People are simple minded and unquestioning. Enter Clarissa, the sweet teenage next door neighbor who takes simple pleasure in taking walks, letting the rain fall on her tongue, staying up late in the night actually talking to her family, no TV walls active in her home -- people actually listen to each other. The government is suspicious of her family -- not because they are subversive or publicly questioning society, but because of the way they live and think. Though Clarisse is a character in the book for a very short time, she makes an impact on the main character, Guy the fireman, who envies that she and her family talk to each other, listen to each other, and care so much for each other in a society that only cares about keeping the status quo and not getting in trouble. He begins to question what he is doing, burning books -- not so much because of the book burning itself, but for the lives of the book lovers he wrecks in the process. He begins to wonder what is inside the pages of books that people are willing to die for them and steels one of the books from a home his is destroying. He adds this book to the huge stash of books he has already hidden in the air ducts of his home and actually begins to read them and thus begins his own persecution.Though this isn't a literary masterpiece, as I said earlier, it is engrossing and very disturbing. The future society created in the pages is a nightmare. The importance of education, reading, and simply caring about your fellow man are the concepts the reader walks away with. I suspect that's the reason it is tirelessly assigned to kids at school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read F451 in high school... and was moved by it. This was a book that at once fueled my teenage-born desire to fight \\"the man\\" and inspired me to become a science fiction author myself.So why am I writing this review now, more that a decade (sadly, much more than a decade) after high school? Well, I just read F451 again. It is now April, 2004. I am amazed at just how accurate Bradbury's future is. If the \\"slaves to our TV's\\" accusation doesn't strike close enough to the bulls-eye, just look at the role of war in F451 and then turn on CNN and watch for 5 minutes.Bradbury has hit the nail on its proverbial head; in his verbose-yet-eloquent style he has painted a horrible and terrifying future where man fears and scorns knowledge and wisdom. It has gotten to the point where firemen no longer put out fires, but start them--to burn the books which embody everything that is dangerous to a society that fears free will.Reading this again, now, I couldn't help resurrecting a memory. I was at work in the high-tech field (before the crash)... I make a habit of either reading or writing during my lunch hour, and a coworker had made a comment along the lines of \\"why on Earth would you read a book when you can get all the entertainment you'd ever want online?\\". Reading F451, I remember this person, and imagine them in a \\"parlor\\" with their fabricated online \\"Tv walls\\" that cater to their egos and their banal desire for raw and stupid entertainment.My advice to those who don't typically read, those who have siblings or offspring who do not read, and those who think anything that isn't digital is unworthy of their attention: Read this book. The main story (sans afterword, etc.) is only about 160 pages long. There's no excuse. read it.Those who do read (and especially those who write): this is a classic for a reason, and Bradbury's poetic quality is very enjoyable. He creates only a few characters in this book, but from the start you have such depth in the lead man (montag) that you feel pity for him as his wife's stomach is pumped, and you understand why he is drawn to the spirit that is Clarisse. Because you will have the privilege of reading this far beyond the time in which it was written, you will both fear the \\"hound\\" and relate to it. You will also relate to the TV walls and (unless you live underground in isolation) you will begin to fear what the modern media has become.[edit - You shouldn't burn books. Certainly notCluck: Murder Most Fowl. I wrote it, so please forgive the self-promotion, but also please check out my book. Thanks, -edk]"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not a fan of science fiction, and so when my book group chose this book as its monthly selection to read, I was dubious. But then I started reading this small, seemingly simple little book and I was hooked - completely. Yes, it's science fiction. Yes, it requires the reader to accept the reality of a world that is a figment of the author's imagination. Yes, it deals with censorship and book burning and the dangers of mindless feel-good entertainment. And yes, it has a great plot and tells the fast paced story in a mere 165 pages. But in this case, the total effect is much much more than the sum of its parts.There's the quality of the writing first of all. The words run across the page with searing intensity, pulling the reader into a world that feels real and creepy. It pulsates with its theme, which is of fire and firemen and the cruel act of destroying books. It's intelligent and literate and uses some direct quotes from revered thinkers. And then there are some parts that were so humorous that I laughed out loud. Every line resonates with tension. It is a wonderful tale. And, to top it all off, it is optimistic.One of the joys of reading this book is that we have the hindsight of understanding it was written in 1950. The author has that that hindsight as well, and there are an additional 23 pages in the paperback edition, written by the author more than 50 years later. These few pages add dimension to an already complete book and should not be missed. I have no doubt that Fahrenheit 451 is now seared in my mind as being one of the finest books I've every read. It gets my highest recommendation. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is, in my opinion, Bradbury's absolute best. Bradbury's excellent prose allowed some of his novels to escape the \\"science fiction ghetto\\" and surely this is one book that made the jump over the barbed wire.The plot is simple but shocking; books are dangerous to a trivial and controlling culture--therefore, burn them. Without books, there can be no memory of how things were or should be. Montag is a fireman who's job is, of course, to start fires and create bonfires of contraband books. His wife is absolutely shallow and \\"normal\\"--she watches the daily soaps on TV, which in this futuristic society are full wall-sized plasma screens. She nags Montag to earn more so she can install a fourth screen and surround the room with the escape from reality. Even some part of her, however, senses the bleakness of the world, and witlessly tries to escape in an overdose of drugs.Montag is dedicated in his work, but perhaps his investigative nature leads him into the world of the contraband book-hoarders. What drives a man to leap upon a funeral pyre of his library? A shaken Montag must find out.Bradbury sketches the frightening world of a society with non-readers and non-thinkers, dumbed down by design. What did he see in the 50's that we are just realizing today? He was not only amazingly prescient in his description of wall-sized flatscreen TV, but in the trend to a world where education, reading, and reason are being made extinct, if not downright subversive. Read this novel and marvel at Bradbury's chilling insights."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book for a number of reasons: Enter the protagonist, Guy Montag. Montag has been a firefighter for 10 years and has always loved his job...as a fireman of the future, he sets fires to houses instead of putting them out. The reader learns from the back cover that Montag has never questioned his duties &amp; has always loved the thrill of a midnight run. However, a mere three or four pages into the book, Montag meets a free thinking seventeen year old girl who makes him realize that he has wasted the last ten years of his life. The reader never gets the sense that Montag was ever really serious about his job...we have to assume he was simply because the back cover says so. So, in a matter of about four days, this seventeen year old girl (Clarisse) has managed to turn ten years of Montag's beliefs upside down. This might not be so unrealistic if Montag &amp; Clarisse had become involved in a meaningful exchange of ideas but, as it stands, their longest conversation lasted only two minutes. A bit too far fetched for me. Then one day Clarisse disappears &amp; we never hear from her again. We get an &quot;explaination&quot; from Montag's wife, but it is just a theory...we never really know for sure what happened to her, leaving the reader to constantly wonder about her. No satisfactory answers are ever given. Nonetheless, she apparently had a profound impact on Montag because she fuels him throughout the rest of the novel. It's just a little hard for me to believe that 8 minutes of one-sided conversations from a 17 year old could change 10 years of beliefs.The book never gets any better. Montag goes on to meet an old English professor who just happens to share Clarisse's beliefs. What happens between them is, in my opinion, just as unbelievable as what happened between Montag &amp; Clarisse. I realize this is &quot;science fiction&quot; and a lot of it is supposed to be far-fetched, but very little of this book could actually be considered science fiction...perhaps the robotic dogs, wall to wall television and those little green ear bullets are science fiction, but not too much more. I found the characters to be more unrealistic than any of the fancy, technological advances of the future.But, I will say this about the book: I couldn't wait to finish it...not because it was an exciting page turner, but because it is a short book and I knew I would be through with it fairly quickly, even though the temptation to just stop reading it was there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I give Fahrenheit 451 five stars because it is very interesting and pulls the reader into the life of Guy Montag, the main character and narrator. Ray Bradbury uses great imagery in this book so that the reader can picture exactly what Montag sees. Another thing that makes this book so great are the ideas that we take for granted such as thinking. In this book there are very few people who can think for themselves. It also makes you question things like, if there were no book would people still be able to think for on there own? This is a really great book.In this book you will read about a society that is very different from our own. This society takes place in the future. All the houses there are fire proof making firemen obsolete for their old job. There the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Instead of using water they now use kerosene. Their job is to burn books and the houses they are in as soon as they are found. They follow strict rules which are1. Answer the alarm swiftly, 2. Start the fire swiftly, 3. Burn everything, 4. Report back to firehouse immediately, and 5. Stand alert for other alarms. According to them the first firehouse was built in 1790 to burn books. The first fireman was Benjamin Franklin. All books are banned from everyone. Being caught with a book is a punishable offense.This was Montag's job. He never questioned why he burned them or anything else in his life. Until he meet a girl named Clarisse McClellan who helped him start to think for himself. She asked him questions he never thought of before such as if he was happy and she pointed things out that he never noticed like how the billboards got longer because the cars got faster. All these new realizations helped Montag open his mind to start thinking and opened his eyes to what the government was doing.Clarisse spends her days outside exploring her environment and thinking about how strange the world is. She does not go to school because people think of her as anti-social when she just has a different idea of what being social is. Montag sees her doing some of the most peculiar things such as shaking a walnut tree or knitting a blue sweater. He saw her outside one day in the rain and she explained that she loved the way the rain tasted. Montag had never thought about how rain tasted and that day on the way to work he tilted his head back and opened his mouth to taste the rain. This was not the only time she told Montag something that got him thinking. One morning when they were talking and she told him she thinks dry leaves smell like cinnamon. Her odd revelations to him helped him think more and more.Montag starts to question all the people around him but mostly his wife, Mildred. She does nothing all day except watch her three-wall TV. He realizes he does not truly love her because he does not really know her at all. One night Mildred has two friends over to watch the three-wall TV. Montag listens to there conversation. They were talking about the up coming war and one woman said that her husband is in the army. She talked about how her husband might die but its okay because it's the third marriage for both of them and she won't have ant trouble getting over it. This shows Montag that people are incapable of feeling also. They can't think or feel they just live life and care only of themselves.Another person that helps Montag to start to think and question authority was an old professor called Faber. Montag had met Faber in a park a long time ago and Montag decides to call and then visit him. Faber tells him of a time when people read books and were not afraid of being caught with them. Faber lost his job as a professor when one year he came back to teach and only one student had signed up for the coarse. Faber thinks of himself as a coward because he loves book and believes that they should not be banned but he does not do anything to stop it. He was there when books were being banned and he said nothing because he was afraid. But Faber's compassion and wisdom give Montag courage. Faber stays in his house all the time and creates new inventions. One invention is a little speaker you put in your ear so you can talk to someone. Montag and Faber use this to there advantage.These characters help Montag a lot through out the book. If it were not for them Montag would have never started to realize what he has to do. He must change the society in some way but how? He is only one man. It all starts when he confronts his fire chief, Beatty. But to find out what happens read Fahrenheit 451. This book is a page-turner and you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is ironic that Ray Bradbury's dystopian classic about the horrors of censorship has been on and off various \\"banned books\\" lists pretty much from the time it first appeared. That alone should be enough to pique one's interest. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman. He doesn't fight fires - he starts them, in order to destroy books and any buildings that conceal them. He's happy with his job and always has been. But an unexpected series of events causes Montag to begin questioning the things he has hitherto accepted as undisputable. First he sees a woman burned alive in her home when she refuses to surrender her books. Then, Montag meets two people who expose him to ideas he has never before considered - one is a young girl, a new neighbor who proclaims herself \\"seventeen and crazy,\\" and the other is an aging professor with memories of a time before...When I first read the book over a year ago, I paid attention mostly to the plot alone, did not give the book as much thought as I should have, and therefore was not particularly struck by it. Re-reading it a few weeks prior to writing this, I concentrated more on the underlying themes of the book and gained a greater appreciation for Bradbury's creation. Originally written in 1950 as a short story entitled \\"The Fire Man\\" and taking it's final, full-length form in 1953, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is just as relevant today as when Bradbury first composed it at the cost of a dime an hour in the basement typing room of the UCLA library. It takes a head-on look at the ways in which censorship dulls the mind and seeks to undermine independent thought.The form of censorship we encounter in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not the same type of thought control found in books like \\"1984\\" by Orwell. In a way, it is even more insidious. There is no Big Brother figure trying to manipulate the minds of the people. Rather, books are taboo because the people themselves don't want them. The general public has lost all interest in reading. And no one wants that interest revived. Instead, people spend their days in front of enormous, wall-filling television screens. When Bradbury wrote the book, television culture was still in its earlier stages, so the novel shows great prescience when compared with the world of today. Now there are televisions in every home. Televisions are baby sitters, time fillers, background noise. When we're bored, we just turn on the TV and let the real world fade into the back of our minds.In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" we see this overwhelming dependence on television highlighted as a form of escapism from the reality of the world. Montag's wife spends every waking moment watching \\"the family\\" on the walls of the parlor. If Montag suggests that she do anything else, or even turn the volume down, she becomes distraught. She is literally lost without the world on the screen. It provides an insulation to cushion her mind from facing the darker things that hover just beneath the surface. And Mildred's repeated sleeping pill overdoses are evidence that such darker, depressing thoughts really do await her if she ever stops to ponder the world in which she exists, and just how lacking in substance it has become. In fact, the frequent references to other citizens' suicide attempts give us a clue to the very widespread nature of the problem.These are all things well worth contemplating in today's world. Fewer and fewer people take the time to read nowadays. News can be obtained via television or, as is increasingy more common, via the Internet. Entertainment can be had in the form of movies, video games, and the like. And of those that still do read, simple throwaway novels are becoming keen competition for the classics and other books of real substance. The incidence of depression in our society is increasing rapidly. People are constantly looking for ways to escape the world and to avoid having to think about it.Bradbury's book addresses all these issues and forces the reader to consider where our culture may be headed. Additional insight into the author's thoughts about and struggles against censorship can be gained by reading the Coda and the Afterword at the end, appended to the novel in 1979 and 1982 respectively. In these short passages Bradbury reveals the processes that went into the creation of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the incidents that inspired and shaped it. He also gives us a heavy dose of irony by relating just how frequently others have sought to censor this very book. Admirably, he has turned down every such request, even at the cost of lost business, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" remains unaltered from it's original form. The story itself is short, simply written, and can be read quite quickly and easily. But it is worth considerable attention and thought, and deserves to be read by all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451At the tender age of 9, as my 30 year old father lay in a hospital dying of cancer, my grieving young mother packed me off to a theater nearby. The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them. Reading is indeed the antidote to blind faith in bad leaders. This movie carries a timeless message, one I have shared with my children and grandchild, and everyone who I have lent it or given one to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my absolute favorite dystopian novels of all time. The book is exceptionally well written, is very fast paced and is filled it political and social commentary. The book follows the life of a fireman... in this dystopia a fireman does not put out fires but instead his job is to start fires in order to burn books and the houses of the people that they are found in, as literature is banned. As the book progresses the main charater starts to question the legitimacy of his job and finally has one experiance that pushes him over the edge. Finally, one action takes him beyond redemption where he is targeted by his own ruthless government. The end of the book is wonderful, and it reminds me of the Book of Eli.I definately recommend this book as it is a great, fast paced, exciting read. Once you start you will not put this book down for a second, and you will be done in 1-2 days. Additionally, this book is one that you will want to pick up and re-read over and over again as you always find something new. It should be noted that this book was considered so inflammatory that it was secretely censored by the published without Bradbury's knowledge. You can not go wrong with this book and you will not be disappointed. This is my favorite classic, and I garuntee you will love this one as much as I did! Go and buy it, this is a great book to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury wrote this futuristic tale of a dysfunctional society where literature is unappreciated and virtually gone from the society. Individuals become sloths in and disregard books as an important part in the development of a society. The protagonist, Guy Montag is a fireman that burns books for a living. A young girl named Clarisse opens his world to new perspectives. Montag experiences a break down that changes his thoughts and feelings about books. From there he seeks the help of professor Faber who assists him in understanding books. After lashing out at his wife, Montag becomes a fugitive and he joins a group of intellectuals called the Book People. This story highlights aspects that are now seen in today's society- books have been translated into electronic forms and more and more people watch television and laze around. To me, the only thing interesting about this story was the plot itself, the style of writing was utterly uninteresting.When I embarked on reading this book, I couldn't get past the first 30 pages; Bradbury's style was boring and could not fully retain the reader's attention. However, it's because of its reputation as one of a kind during his time, that people read it. The characters themselves did not have that much depth to their personality. Montag's wife, Mildred is a small minded individual that cannot grasp the simplest idea of the anything. Bradbury killed off possibly one of the possibly interesting characters, Clarisse. She was like the last hope in adding creativity and depth to the writing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the idea of the story and the plot line but the way it was expressed was not good. Overall, despite the negative comments I made about the story itself, I would recommend this book to readers out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Are you looking for a book that has the perfect mixture of real and make-believe? Written in the 1953, Bradbury wrote this book describing an altered society taken over by the media (sound familiar?), lacking freedom of speech and individuality. Today's world--especially the U.S. is highly consumed in the media and Americans are decreasingly reading books. So how did Bradbury predict this media phenomenon about fifty years ago? That is the genius behind it; he writes this novel with such intricate detail and creativity in regards to technology and societal thought, making it seem as if the happenings of today's and the future's society were happening at the time it was written.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman-- a fireman that starts fires, that is, in order to burn books. The government of this society has decided that all books should be banned, and burned. In other words, an extreme case of censorship. You can't help but think that this is like the censorship of today of government records or media that attacks the government. Books expose people to new ideas and provokes the mind to think outside its bounds. If people have this exposure then surely they will speak out against the system and create great controversy. If books are taken away along with people's freedom of speech and expression, then everyone will be alike, leaving no space for individuality. This is exactly what happens with the characters, especially Montag's wife who sits and watches meaningless soaps and advertisements all day--they have become like robots. In Montag's quest to find a specific book, he experiences great emotion which he is struggling to express, leaving you (the reader) attached to his struggle.The suspense and vivid descriptions Bradbury creates leaves you on the edge of your seat, anxious to know what will happen next. Maybe the surrealism Bradbury illustrates will turn into (if not already) realism. Bottom line is, it's an all time classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's clear why Ray Bradbury didn't care to have his novel compared to Orwell's 1984. Orwell's antagonist, the totalitarian state, was effectively one dimensional. Bradbury's protagonist, by the time the novel opens, is ourselves, infected by omnipresent fear. Early in the story, when Montag meets Clarisse, he finds her to be somehow uninfected. In modern parlance, she hasn't drunk the Cool Aid. \\"I'm anti-social, they say, I don't mix. I don't think it's social,\\" she says, \\"to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? We never ask questions, they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film teacher. It's a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom and them telling us it's wine, when it's not.\\"Fahrenheit 451 is a very frightening book, and the reader is drawn in immediately. When Montag goes home, he faces the other end of the spectrum from Clarisse; he faces his wife, who has been thoroughly brainwashed into submission. The tension rises dramatically, reaching a climax when Montag is forced to torch his own home. When he turns the torch on his boss, Montag becomes a fugitive and eventually settles with the hobos along the railroad tracks, all of whom has memorized a book in order to preserve it after all the physical copies have been destroyed.At 50 thousand words it's what would today be called a novella, meaning no agent would touch it. And an editor would have problems with some of the more egregious loose ends, including the characters of Clarisse and Faber. But it has struck a chord with an American public which fears the encroachment of the government in our daily lives. And it is always fascinating to compare the futures envisioned by writers of science fiction with the way things ultimately turn out. Bradbury's inclusion of mural-sized TVs and people mesmerized by reality shows displayed remarkable foresight. And that, too, is terrifying."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After reading \\"The Time Machine\\" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything \\"upsetting\\" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times.

It has really opened my eyes. This book is a must read and is definitely one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Update: The initial photo shows the anniversary paperback version. The NEW amazon listing for hardcover is to be avoided at all cost. Another reviewer added a photo of the hardcover version (the darker cover with orange border). It is a tiny little book (3x5 I think) with minuscule font and cheap, see-through low grade recycled paper. I returned my copy, and I recommend you do the same. The paperback is of better quality. I would never spend $10+ on such a shoddy hardcover. I expect this from unscrupulous 3rd party sellers, but not from amazon.com's actual listing.-----------------------For those who have not read this novel, or not have read it since school (as in my case); it deserves a thorough read. Many of the concepts that Bradbury wrote about were alien to me in my teens. Now, barely over 30, I find that my life experiences as well as influence from other literature and film have helped me to develop a better responsiveness to this work.The novel is quite short and even reading it carefully and thoroughly took me a couple of visits to my local coffee shop. The book does contain some grammatical and spelling errors, but remember that Bradbury wrote this at a very young age (as a series of short stories first), and without a formal composition or literature degree.The message is one that surely hits home in these times: people are often in such a rush nowadays. Literature is being overlooked by many, television is the most utilized media, advertising is rampant in the society, and people have a million little 'diversions' such as twitter and facebook and video games to occupy their free time.I believe that the most unsettling aspect of the novel as applied to todays society is thus: people never officially banned books to begin; instead they just forgot about them and pursued other interests.For any true book lover this is a must read. Again, it has it's problems, but it is an entertaining, mind opening novel deserving of another (or a first) read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury takes its name from the temperature at which books burn. The story takes place in the future and it follows the life of a fireman called Montag. Fireman in our current time have the job of putting out fires. In the time period that Montag lives, fireman make fires, burning collections of books since reading books in that time has been outlawed.Ray Bradbury's book is a welcomed defense of book reading that is still relevant considering that many young people only read books because their English teacher assigned them for class. The novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" also champions the free press. At one point in the novel, it is explained to Montag by his boss Beatty that the opinions argued in books led to more arguments and that it was best to not allow people to read in order to avoid arguments.As the book progresses Montag becomes more and more disenchanted with his job as a book burning fireman. On top of a defense of literature, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" also makes a fulfilled prediction that people in the future will sit around with earphones listening to music all the time (in the novel the earphones are made of seashells). Sound familiar."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the story of how, in a future time when books are outlawed, a man goes from burning books to preserving them. It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farhenheit 451 catches the reader from the start. The brillant start to book about burning and changing not only sets up the book's major themes, it also foreshadows Montag's transformation. Then the book offers an exciting plot with a backdrop of an intriguing false utopia. Suddenly the book ends -thirty pages before it actually ends. Bradbury seems to put the last events on cruise control. The contrived ending sort of gives the book a bad after taste.However, this book is fantastic even with the flawed ending. The dialogs surrounding books and the concepts they contain often make the reader pause and reflect. The fact that sitting and reading can be deemed revolutionary is something every reader dreams of. If only once, this book is worth the read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was book about a fireman whose job is to start fires. Montag had been a fireman for ten years.

I rated this book 4 stars because it is a great book that really gets the reader involved.To describe the book, I would say think of todays world and completly flip it around! This book is a twisted version of life as we know it. It is set in the future where firemen no longer are called to put fires out, but, to start them. There hoses dont spray water, but, they spray kerosene. Now that all houses and buildings are fire proof regular firemen are no longer needed. Instead they are called apon when some one has broken the law and has posetion of a book. Then these people are called apon to burn them and punish the owners. A typical room in a house in this time setting would be walls lined with T.V.'s and at the fire stations they have robotic dogs that kill people. Guy Montag was a firemen who played by the rules and never questioned why he did what he di until one night he met a young girl named Clarisse and she told him about a world in the past where people uses to read books and firemen uses to put out fires instead of starting them. After hearing this Guy Montag stars rebelling and he starts questioning the theory behind his job and he starts taking some of the books.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an exciting book that will push your mind to the limit. It is almost as if the science fiction book takes all known reason and throws it out the window!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a twisted novel where everything you had previously believed in, was proved wrong. It created a world where fireman started fires instead of putting them out. It was a time where houses were all made fireproof. It was a world where people didn't just sit and talk, and have educated conversations, there was actually very little exchange between people. Its quite on the contrary, it's a world where TV's lined whole walls, and if you pay extra they can even say your name! The fireman lived in firehouses, but had robotic dogs that were trained to attack and kill! The story is about a fireman, Guy Montage, who meets a young girl who tells him how life used to be, and about what can be found in books. Guy then steals books and reads them. In reading these books he has discovers the truth, he discovers the way life was and should be, he reads about philosophy and poetry, even the bible. His wife rats him out to the fireman and they come to burn down his house to destroy all the books kept inside. He then becomes a criminal running from everyone. His goal is to set up fireman across the world by planting books in their homes, therefore destroying all firemen and hopefully returning the world to the way it used to be like in the young girls stories.This was a very exciting book, and very colorful. It painted a very beautiful painting in my head and described things so thoroughly that I believed that a world like that might possibly exists somewhere out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is the main character of the novel. He is a fireman and his job was to burn books. Books, you see, were illegal because they upset people. All books were illegal because all people had to be made happy. This is a future where the TV is as big as the walls in the TV parlor, pills make you happy and Mechanical Hounds hunt down people on national TV. A future where houses don't have a porch, where trains' PA system broadcast radio adds all the time and social people are thought weird.But what happens when Guy starts to question it all? What happens when he starts to wonder what is in the books that makes them so bad? What happens when Guy gets away from all the noise and starts to THINK for himself?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a personification of the human spirit. In this story he is given a new insight by a young babbling teenage girl, Clarisse. With this sudden and mysterious revelation, Montag begins to see that the world around him is very synthetic, no can think about what they feel or feel what they are thinking - only the now exists and no concern for actions or consequences. Montag is centered and yet torn between two archetypes, Captain Beatty and Professor Faber. Beatty is an evil and heartless intellectual barbarian, a man possessing an illegal library in his home and claiming to not read a page of it. He is without a doubt a coward hiding behind brute force, whether it be by tongue or kerosene. Then there is Faber, a kind and fearful man who provides sanctuary for Montag.

It's chilling how well Bradbury was able to make such an obvious stance, yet still write a beautiful, well rounded novel. This is a book that I hope everyone reads, it makes you a better person. It makes you want to do good in the world. I think Bradbury wants people to ignore things like television, and sit around with one another and talk, debate, discuss. Ironically, this is a book that forces the reader to do just that, perhaps Bradbury's greatest feat.Absolutely timeless novel, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an intelligent story filled with adventure and suspense. It takes you on a journey through the development of Guy Montag, a man who is fed up with a corrupt system. What I like most about this book is the writing style of the author. I find it incredible the way he can capture the way the characters are feeling. For example; \\"He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water. Himself dark and tiny, in final detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact.\\" Page 7. It's almost as if Bradbury is writing poetry, but it is not to the extent that he is rambling on aimlessly.The theme of this book is rebellion. The story fallows Guy Montag through his path of change from being part of the system to a leader of a rebellion against it. Slowly but surely, Montag discovered more and more things that aid his transformation into an independent man. I fully agree with Montag's decision to rebel and I Truly look up to him for his bravery in doing what some thought to be impossible. His actions relate closely to my life because I as well, am not the kind of person who is willing to do what I am told to do unless I agree with it and find it worthwhile, so if someone tries to force me to do something against my beliefs, I will fight them to the fullest extent.I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone out there that is either; looking for a futuristic drama, into sci-fi, or simply just anyone looking for a good read. I recommend this book because at first, it did not look to appealing to me, but after about 45 pages into it I realized that the good characters, interesting story line, and a whole new way to look at the world and government. I know that if you give this book a chance, it will completely change the way you look at such things as limits by the government, literature, and relationships. Fahrenheit 451 is a well-rounded page-turner that pushes the limits of our minds and expands our knowledge of the cruelty of the world around us."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it was very boring and i did not lik it at all. it lacked a basic plot and character development. i was very disappointed with the novel and with Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough.

I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is more important today than it was on the day it was written: it is terrifying to see how many things described in this book are coming to pass. It makes you wonder if a future in which books are burned and readers are chased like criminals is indeed so impossible or fantastic. This is in fact one of those books with &quot;plenty of ideas per square inch,&quot; so much so, one could be discussing it for days, and indeed using more than the 1,000 words you are allowed to use here: the character of Beatty, who sincerely believes that books make you unhappy (and of course, he is right), but at the same time he's aware of the fact that books also give you power; the dislike of controversy and all things &quot;difficult;&quot; the hate directed against outstanding people; the watering down of art and literature through political correctness; the brainwashed TV people who think themselves happy but are in fact dissatisfied and violent...I find this book very moving and not &quot;confusing&quot; at all. In fact it is written in a very clean and economic style, with all that purple prose that ruins so many other books by Bradbury kept to the minimum. If you liked this book, check out the movie by Franois Truffault. If you missed Clarisse in the book, you will be glad to know that Truffault thought the same and her role in the movie is much more developed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the year 1953 Ray Bradbury wrote a book about something that, I think, could very well happen in the year 2000 and the years thereafter. The whole book, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, is about the banning of books. This issue has gotten worse over the years and if it continues maybe firemen will indeed be paid to burn our books.In &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who realizes people should have the right to read books. He realizes that books mean a lot to the people who own them and after years of never thinking twice about burning a house down he watches a woman burn herself with her house because she wanted to die right along with her books. Guy comes up with a plan to get revenge on other firemen in an effort to stop book banning.At some points of the book Ray Bradbury's writing was a bit confusing. He brought up different characters and stories out of the blue and I really had to think to figure out how those events pertained to the main story.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was the second science fiction book I've read by Ray Bradbury. I also read &quot;October County&quot;, a book of short stories. I do have to say that that book was also confusing, but was good because of the author's great description of places and people.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is good if you like to think while you read. I think it has a good message about the banning of books and I'm glad I spent my time reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Another dark, gloomy, mildly confusing, Blade Runner-ishview of the future lacking in any redeeming qualities.&quot;In the future, Firemen burn books&quot; -- Bradbury createsan inventive premise but his own gloom overtakes the story.Fraught with loose ends, this is the last book you readbefore you set yourself on fire."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this for her as she needed it for her english prep class.

He was a fire fighter, a person who burns books and had everything he would ever need to be happy. But something is missing and all Montag wants to do is figure it out. Could the books he has been destroying all these years be what have been missing in his life? Is knowledge the power that Montag needs? Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will open your eyes and make you realize how much the little things you have in your life mean.Guy Montag is a true hero who battles against himself and the way of the world to find the truth. Montag was a firefighter who started reading the books instead of burning them. His wife never loved him and Beatty is out to get him. But this doesn't stop Montag. He kills Beatty with a flame thrower and then proceeds to run from the law until they kill an innocent bystander to make a good television show. Now Montag is just one of the few that must rebuild the world.This book shows just how much we should appreciate the things we have, like books. People committed suicide everyday because they could not take the pain. Something was missing from their lives, and Montag discovers that books are what his life is missing. His wife, Mildred tries to kill herself by overdosing because she can't take the hurt. The book teaches you to appreciate the things you have in your life and how much it hurts when they are gone.Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes you realize where our world may be going. Books and newspapers are being dumbed down so that nobody will be offended or discriminated against. Just like in the book, could the pain from the missing of good literature cause people to be unhappy and eventually commit suicide? Could we become like the people in the book?Fahrenheit 451 is an eye opening book that makes you appreciate what you have. Montag had no idea what he was missing until he began reading books. This book opens your eyes to the dangers of not having good literature and how the little things in life are never fully appreciated until they are gone. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life.--V. McGee"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Possessing books is illegal, for which your house may burn.

Whereas \\"1984\\" took me two days to complete, I read through \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" in an afternoon. Additionally \\"1984\\" ends with an feeling of hopelessness, whereas 451 ends with some degree of optimism for the future.Overall, 451 still stands out as one of a limited number of dystopian stories whose message remains as vital today as when it was published."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story overall was great. The setting however may be confusing at first.

Ray Bradbury, the author of the book, tells his vision of the future which is definitly technology enhanced.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who loves fire. In this time it is firemens job to start fire to a house of those who have disobeyed the law, like possesing a book. The people of this society are to think the same and to know of no different. Guy Montag is of course one of these people. However this soon changes when he meets a young girl names Clarisse who is quick to change Montags beliefs.Montag begins to realize that that book burning is wrong and the thing that he loves burning is the very thing that spreads knowledge and opinion. After he realizes this he is tempted to steal one of his own. He does this and the plot begins to unfold. He tells his wife of his secret and that he actually has stolen many more. His wife disagrees with him that this is the right thing to do and turns him in. Guy Montag meets new people along the way that have the same opinion about this stuff and they help him. Montag tries to rebuild his society with new freedoms after it is destroyed in war.I enjoyed this book becase Bradbury's descriptions and vocabulary usages are amazing. I liked how he showed that the things we think so little of are really very important to the life and freedoms that we have today. He also shows that sometimes inventions can get out of control and we forget how to do the simple things becase the machines do it for us. The author creates a world that is threatening and exotic but at the same time is is familiar enough to seem real. I enjoyed this book even though at times it could get confusing and complicated it is definitly one of the better thought-provoking books I have read yet."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. In Fahrenheit 451 the way that Ray Bradbury uses his imagination to visualize the future is great. His future had shells for head phones and walls for screens, that is so cool. Except for the fact that everyone has lost there mind the story is extremely interesting.The way that Mr. Bradbury depicts the future is almost real in the sense that what if we really do forget what books are used for. The way that Montag gets interested in the books and has to try to hide it from every one he knows.The detail that Bradbury goes in to about Montag keeping his secret is great describing him sweating out every second.

I believe that Bradbury succeeded in is book although I believe it is increasingly weird.It gives brilliant depiction into his mind and his imagination. Mr. Bradbury I believe has a way of striking to the core of a person. A way of showing a side of a thought that no one has ever thought about. I personally have never thought that our inventions could be bad. This shows that what if change is really bad."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are a thinker, Faherenheit 451 is book for you.

One of those amazing stories that you see reflected in so many other stories today. My only complaint is that the writing style to me felt like I was reading one long runon sentence. Amazing read none the less. :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this directly after1984, and thus Bradbury's vision of the future seemed positively quaint by comparison. Later, I learned that crafting an unimaginable dystopia was not Bradbury's intent: instead of offering a forecast of runaway state power, Bradbury's book was about the corrupting influence of television and its deleterious affects on the population's literacy. The fire chief actually explains this to the protagonist, but I took it not as exposition (as it was intended), but as a red herring... I guess I was giving Bradbury too much credit. The book is not about censorship at all; not about the horrors of the omnipotent state, even as most readers interpret it as such.In this way, Fahrenheit 451 can be viewed as a failure: the message the author intended to convey is not appreciated by the bulk of the book's audience. But that is not to say the book is no good. It is an insightful and entertaining read; stylistically superb, exceedingly well written, with plenty of memorable characters and potent imagery. But the actual theme is less poignant than the one imagined by most readers, which is why I think it failed to really satisfy me as a profound piece of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While a good read with strong themes, I struggle to grasp why this book is considered such a \\"classic\\" by so many. I'll admit - I am no one to judge what a \\"classic\\" is, but it would be nice if someone could explain it to me - as there are other books out there that drive at similar points but are considered far less noteworthy.That being said, there were some strong themes running through this book that seem very prophetic - the book was written in the 1950s, and I caught myself more than once drawing on Bradbury's \\"exaggerations\\" (at the time) to current society. Such as the mass media (or propaganda) and mind control - crippling people's ability to think for themselves - and in fact doing the \\"thinking\\" for them. This is a central theme and one of the reasons behind the burning of books - as books make you think and loosen one's ability to control. And similarly, the (television) media's creation of short attention spans (immediately looking for the climax of a story - otherwise attention drifts) - creating a society that shallowly drifts from one climax to another, without every really grabbing a hold of anything. Senses have been dulled to the point where no one actually sees anything - to the point that it's suggested that society wouldn't know what grass or flowers were - only if you showed them a green blur would the recognize grass (as they are so busy driving fast to get to their next \\"climax\\" they don't see anything else). Both of these create a mindless society that lacks anything beneath the surface. Bradbury displays the deterioration this causes with the Mildred character - Montag's numb wife whose only satisfaction is her television \\"family\\", and who presents a shallow faade of happiness - but who in reality is miserable (poignantly displayed when she attempts to kill herself towards the beginning of the novel). I think she represents society in general - what Montag is \\"supposed\\" to be but is breaking free from.Although interpreted to be exaggerations at the time - one can link these ideas to current society (in the 2000s). The ever shrinking attention span as technology develops new and newer media outlets (television, video games, Internet, iPods - all moving us further away from books). The mindless shows and distractions we watch to help us escape from our own lives (I don't mean to sound like I'm on a high horse here - I do the same thing); the mind control of masses by spin networks and political twisting. One reviewer mentioned the absurdity of intellectuals being banished to the far forest outside the city (in the book) - but what angle do you think \\"political strategists\\" are playing when they label President Obama an elitist, or rave about the liberal academia? The tension between knowledge and ignorance was one of the main reasons for the banishment of books in the book. I'm not suggesting that book burning is around the corner - only that the seeds that seem to have created Bradbury's fictional society are the same seeds that are present today.Overall - as mentioned a good book - and one that continues to grow on me (perhaps it is a classic after all?)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Excellent Service!

It's supposed to be an exaggeration of what might happen if we continue to further censorship. Ray Bradbury wrote this book to warn you of that. And if you're reading this, don't say, &quot;What censorship?&quot; because you know what I'm talking about, banning books from schools, not allowiing certain things to be spoken on television, and now maybe even the internet at the rate of how things are going! Sometimes, you need to say things to get your point across, whether that's a weakness or a strength of yours. For me, it's a weakness, and I'm sorry for that, but I don't need censorship to ruin it.

Anyway, at first I hated the fact that nothing had a definite conclusion. Also, you never know if the &quot;book people's&quot; goal was successful. What happens? Even before the book begins, there are several questions that remain unanswered.

I find truly disturbing the sheer number of young people who have sent in reviews describing the book as &quot;boring, unfulfilling, poorly written, confusing&quot;, etc. Of all the &quot;dystopian&quot; books in the lexicon, I find this work to be the most straightforward and unambiguous(sp?). Judging from some of the vitriolic reaction above, it seems Bradbury's predictions are well on their way to coming true. The fact that so many find the book &quot;confusing&quot;, points out the failure of an American education system that emphasizes self-esteem over actual achievement, learning by rote as opposed to the actual accumulation of knowledge, and crowd control over teacher-student interaction. The book is challenging, but hardly the murky horror described by so many above.

But now after having read it I see the importance of it. It forces the reader to look at the effect that technology has on our lives and what direction this increasing technolgy could lead us. The plot is interesting and mind opening. The story would have had a stronger impact had Bradbury left the main character, Guy Montag, mentally stable at the end of the novel. I felt,as the reader, that his craziness led to a unreliablity in his character and his actions. This unreliablity in his character left the novel with a weak ending, instead of a strong one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am 26 years old and, although I have read hundreds of books, I have never read this book before.

Even though this book is written about the far future we are getting there and its only the matter of years.

I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person. A must read for any would-be scholar."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this day and age, with the internet, and TV, the printed word is becoming endangered.

Yes, I think most people who love books, value free thought and expression, and worry about our personal freedoms being taken away one by one (which they are, folks) can identify with this story. Guy Montag wakes up one day to realize that all the material possessions of his life, indeed, his whole way of life is empty and meaningless. In Montag's world, the powers that be want everyone to be lulled into a state of false security. No one is allowed to stir the pot (remind anyone of the recent political conventions where anyone who protested anything was beaten and arrested?). Yes, anyone who can't see the symbolism so blatantly laid out before them is probably on a school board somewhere and wants to ban this book anyway. I read this book when I was about 12 years old, and I understood the implications at that young age. I think I read To Kill a Mokingbird the same year. When I moved to California in 1984, One of the North County School boards had banned To Kill a Mokingbird and it was quite a fight that took place. I re-read this book at that time, and every few years since. It's message is timeless, and if anyone has seen the advertisements for the Flat TVs that you hang on a wall, you may get a bit frightened by Bradbury's vision of the future. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn, by the way. This should be standard reading for everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is not a standard SF and it is not meant to be. The idea is VERY plausible. Written 50 years ago, the idea of TV being a national obsession was ludicrous. Who knew? The white clown is very similar to the extremely violent shows that we let be on TV. And the books. . .the censorship. This is what will happen if we let censorship go any farther. And the scene where the women are discussing their children, absolutly scary. Good book. Read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is almost uncanny that Bradbury depicted this as the exaggerated furture for books. Certainly this is not an action packed blood bath but it is excting. He shows all to well how books full of literary beauty will be removed from view in public schools, libraries, etc. If you want to read a classic book this is just what you are looking for. It is set in the future where media dominates the earth and reading is believed to be a rash on society. As you read through and discover how well he depicted what is happening you will be vastly impressed how right he is. This is a must read book for those who want a good read and for literary knowedge. Despite all this, the reason I didn't give it five stars is because I do like action and this lacks some of what it could have."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very good. It was about censorship of the future that the government has to keep people happy. People aren't allowed to read books it was forbidden to the law. Can you imagine the world without a book? The people will think the same things, and they won't have any things to talk about because even jokes come from books. When I was reading it I thought, 'The government is wrong they should let people read books. If some people aren't happy because they can't read books, then the government is making them unhappy.' I like the books very much and if it is our future I probably can't live the one moment of it. This book was hard to understand at the first time, so I read it again and enjoyed very much.

Thank you.)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This one of a kind novel by Ray Bradbury is an interesting story with many twists and turns from its almost boring beginnings to its dramatic and action-packed closing. As a soft science-fiction novel Mr. Bradbury made a powerful statement about what he thought the world was coming to with its ever evolving societies. Already some somewhat small groups of people are forbidding the reading of certain types of literature. In my personal opinion, I think that every person on the face of this Earth deserves to have a chance to read, Even if this book that a person decided to read went against all the morals that the society currently values."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like to read about the future, this is a great book to read!

But that's not the way that life is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recommend this novel for those who like to read interesting things. This novel is about how books cannot be read at all in society; it was against the law. Imagine just listening to the media all day and radio stations, where would they get all their facts and information on human nature, or nature itself? The firefighters in the story create the fire, rather then putting them out. Picture the future with just technology and no books? This book sort of gets you curious about what is gonna happen towards the ends because of all the killings and interesting talks a man Montag had with a seventeen year old girl named Clarisse. I don't usually like to read books but when I read this one, I wanted to know what happened next or why the people in the story were acting like that? It was easy for me to imagine. So for those who would like to read a short book about a hundred and seventy- three pages, I recommend this one. Below is a quote from the story and my commentary about it. So here and take a sneak peak:1.) \\" He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were farsighted. He held it close, as if he were blind. \`Montag!' He jerked about. \`Don't stand there, idiot!' The books lay like great mounds of fish left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone. \`Kerosene!' They pumped the cold fluid from the numerated 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book; they pumped rooms full of it. They hurried downstairs, Montag staggering after them in the kerosene fumes. \`Come on, women!' The women knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag. \`You can't ever have my books,' she said. \`You know the law,' said Beatty. \`Where's your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. You've been locked up here for years with regular dammed Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now...\\" (38)The problem here is that they are called to put fire to a woman and her house for having books. Montag hesitates and tries to encourage the women to leave while she. The women, Captain Beatty and Montag have an argument about books and set the house on fire.In this scene, it doesn't seem like Montag wanted to burn the lady and the books. He seemed hesitant by warning the woman to get out before it's too late. Books seem to be some people's most prized possession. In these books, there are problems, trials, death, and unrealistic acts. They feel that there is no purpose in reading these books because it will corrupt what the society runs now. When he states, \\"The people in those books never lived. Come on now,\\" they feel there is no purpose on how these stories will benefit you positively, but only negatively."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's amazing how a book that was written nearly half a century ago continues to captivate the interest of any reader, aand especially that of a fourteen-year-old like myself. Fahrenheit 451 has managed to do this. Now one of my favorite books, I can sit back and wonder &quot;what makes this such a good book?&quot; I feel the answer is that F. 451 is a slap in the face to Americans living in this day and age. The fact that it appears this is where America is headed - wars (war with Iraq, war with Afghanistan), censorship (parental advisories on cds, ratings on movies), and just a general air of disaffection to the world can be seen every day. America: read this book! We'll be better off for it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age of pervasive conformity and the overwhelming prevalence of worthless television such as American Idol, I find it refreshing and inspiring to read such a profoundly original work like Fahrenheit 451. If we allow our brains to wither away by watching wasteful drivel like Guy Montag's wife, Mildred, we surrender to the system, and hence, become nothing but another brick in the wall. Ray Bradbury writes as lucidly and fluently with as vital a message as any of the other infamous dystopian novels such as 1984 and Brave New World. Just as Orwell and Huxley champion the cogence of individuality over mere conformity, so too, does Bradbury.Although Guy Montag is the endearing protagonist and his Captain Beatty the intrepid, yet enigmatic antagonist, it is none other than the characters of Clarisse and Mildred that most intigue me. They emanate resoundly as complete foils for each other. Whereas Mildred woefully lacks even any remote semblance of vision, love, passion, or originality, Clarisse conversely possesses an abundant amount of vigor, vibrancy, ingenuity, and genuine zest for life. Guy undergoes an epiphany upon the inscrutable disappearance of Clarisse that, in turn, galvanizes from within his desire to live again. Not only does he begin to read books again, albeit surreptitiously, moreover he also embarks upon a journey to think for himself again, as it were. No longer allowing Captain Beatty or the Mechanical Hound to motivate his conformity through fear tactics, Guy Montag begins upon a new and unchartered path - one that will undoubtedly lead to happiness in the absence of conformity. Fahrenheit 451 is undeniably a timeless classic and should thus be treated as such. 5 HUGE STARS."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is pretty up to date, and reflects society, since the concept of different ideas and philosophies is ignored in favor of TV, and remembering the dull words of pop songs, and the dull and almost pointless existences of some people, reflected rather grimly in this book. It was very powerful, and a very remarkable book to say that least. Probably the most realistic and the least sci-fi influenced of all those 'utopian society' novels."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, a thought-provoking book about censorship centered around book burning, seemed to get off to a slow start by following the life of the main character, Guy Montag, a firefighter who does not put out fires, but rather burns books for a living. Some of the descriptions given at the beginning of the book were confusing at first, like those of the parlor walls, which really turned out to be futuristic video screens, and the mechanical hound, a robot which is used to track and kill people by the chemical scents they leave behind. However, as I got into the book more, I felt that the almost boring way Bradbury wrote the introduction helps give the reader a sense of what Montag's life was normally like, and allows the reader to see the vastness of the changes he encounters in his lifestyle.I also felt that as the plot thickened, Bradbury did an excellent job of giving Guy human qualities, such as making him impulsive and sometimes hot-tempered, and showing how he strove to do what he thought was right. His interactions with other characters are very real, especially those with his boss, Beatty. When Montag starts to regret burning books, and starts to perceive that there is more to the books he burns for a living than he and most other people believe, Beatty senses Montag's change in emotion, and does his best to set him straight, telling him that books are only filled with useless thoughts and people and places created by writers that are long gone. This is the main conflict that leads to the rising action of the novel. Montag is told that books are bad, and thus by human nature becomes even more interested in them. However, the conflict is greater than this, as it is not just Montag versus Beatty. Besides also trying to get his ditsy wife interested in books, Montag faces an internal battle with himself. He has to weigh the consequences of getting caught with books with the rewards of what he could possibly gain by reading. I especially appreciated the effort Bradbury went through to bring the feelings and emotions Montag goes experiences to the reader by his word choice, and the way he showed the reader how Montag was playing a sort of tug-of-war in his mind.I think Bradbury did a good job surprising the reader whenever possible, such as with Montag's actions. Just when you begin to think that you might see how Guy will act in a situation, Bradbury twists the outcome, keeping you on the edge of your seat in some cases, or at least wondering what will happen next. Such is the case with Faber; a man Montag becomes friends with who also has interests in the forbidden world of books. Just as Bradbury leads the reader to believe that Faber will be somewhat in control of how Guy responds to the remarks of his boss Beatty, Montag leaves Faber in the dust, taking matters into his own hands and acting on impulse.Bradbury uses a serious tone throughout the novel, which helps to bring forth the importance of the subject at hand. I liked the serous way in which Bradbury presents the world Montag lives in, a world without books or leisure reading material. This made me question what I would do if I were in Montag's situation, even though in this day and age it is quite unlikely that books would suddenly be totally banned. It really got me thinking about censorship in general, and how at times in the past we made steps toward making Montag's world a reality by banning books from libraries and bookstores. On the other hand, in brought to light the fact that the bans placed on many books were lifted after such acts were declared unconstitutional, which somewhat renewed my faith in the ability of our government and society to recognize and correct some of its mistakes.The novel is still thought provoking, however, because no matter what kind of society we live in today, we can all imagine living in one that is totally different, one we do not feel comfortable in, one that we let our imaginations run wild in creating it, making it painful to think about let alone live in. I enjoyed how the novel made me realize how many freedoms we have nowadays, and how they can easily be taken away.Without spoiling the ending, I just want to say that I thought it was very fitting. As Granger says near the end of the novel, \\"You're not important. You're not anything.\\" Montag and his group would have appeared to be insignificant to any unsuspecting stranger, even though they were the keys to a vast world of knowledge, one they hope someday the world will get to experience again.Though I do think that Ray Bradbury did a very good job of writing Fahrenheit 451, I feel that it has a few weaknesses. First would have to be a shortness of description, especially at the beginning of the novel when the reader is trying to form an image of the world Montag lives in. His short initial description of things such as the parlor walls and the mechanical hound left me somewhat confused about what they really had to do with the novel. Another case of confusion occurred with the mechanical snake that was used to empty Montag's wife's stomach and change her blood while she was sleeping after Montag found out that his wife, Mildred, had swallowed some thirty sleeping pills. It is not so confusing how this event happens but rather why it happens, and it does not seem to be important later in the story.Despite some weaknesses, the main point of Fahrenheit 451 is clear, and makes the book a definite \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel of the dangers of a world without books is extremely insightful. It follows the story of Guy Montag, a firefighter who starts fires. Burning books is his true joy until a young girl and a professor show him the true light. Althought it is a relatively easy read, it is though provoking and enjoyable. The tale warns of editing and being afraid of stepping on others toes. This book speaks out and is not one that can be kept silent. Its powerful words tend to remain even after the last lines have been read. This is a must read for all, and a novel that will be savored until the very last words."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it. If you can only read one book your entire life, make it this one. It is the masterpeice of the modern era from the man I would consider its finest writer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is considered by many a highly acclaimed novel that remarkably illustrates the corruptive paths that our future may hold in store for us because of the effects of censorship. It drasticly emphasizes ceonsorship and the devestating impact that can take place from it. Some people believe that censorship has advantages in that it prevents exposure of inappropriate media to the youths of society. Farenheit 451 offers a different view on the subject. The many wars that people gave their lives to could very well be considered in vain by the destruction of books in Farenheit 451. The characters played an important role in bringing across this point. I strongly believe that Clarisse McCleannan in the book was that of one who was living in the past in in a way much like our opinions would be towards the sitsuation. She spoke of the past in ways we would speak of our present. I believe that this is a message about the calamities of nesorship that the writer is striving to get across. Although a novel relating to sceince fiction you might consider the various conversations between Guy Montag and Clarisse McCleannan to be heated debates on censorship and what can take place from it. Once again I stand forth and strongy believe that Ray Bradbury, author of Farenheit 451, is not making a science fiction novel for his well being, but to try to put out a powerful message on censorship and the drastic effects it can have on ourselves and freedom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I purchased this book for my teenaged son to do an English class book report. He was impressed by the way the author was able to imagine the future considering this was written in 1953. I do not recommend for under the high school level."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My name is Karina and this review is for my pre-ap summer project for Jarman Middle School. I thought this book was every interesting to read.I did kind of think that some of the future idea where a little weird.But over all the story plot was great.I wouldn't recommend this to people my age.Why not? Well, as much as I enjoyed it on some parts I had a little trouble focusing. Also I sort of didn't understand some of the text.Now these are some of my opinions and other people may have liked it alot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has been one of my favorate stories and thought it would be nice to have a audio version for travel. Mr. Bradbury's voice is gruff and adds to the theme of the story, but also distracts. that is the only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a futuristic where all books are banned, and simple things, such as being a pedestrian can get you arrested. The book was written around the end of World War II, and was probably influenced by Nazi Germany because of their effort to censor everything. The main character is named Guy Montag, who is a firefighter. He is not a typical firefighter that we would think of though, his job is burn books. His life changes one day after having a conversation with his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who asks him if he is happy or not. After this conversation he ends up on a wild journey that then leads him to fight to save the one thing that he used to destroy.This book has stood the test of time and is a true classic. It has been referenced to in many other books, TV shows, and movies since its publication in 1953. Ray Bradbury does an amazing job of writing the novel, with numerous twists and turns. It had me on the edge of my seat while reading the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of course this book is written about the obvious theme, censorship, and many in this day smugly state how well it applies to the current administration. But by digging deeper, you also find a personal struggle within Guy Montag, who transforms from the book burner to reader. By using such an everyman character as Montag (even the name Guy suggests the usual Joe), Bradbury avoids browbeating the reader with his ideals (in spite of the image of fire), and gently helps the reader understand the beauty of the written word. This does in fact contrast with an image of big government controlling lives. It is personal, not necessarily political."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's novel tells of the future. Not of the \\"future\\" more commonly seen in science fiction movies, but more of a society in the future. The main character of the book is Guy Montag, a fireman for the city. The firemen during this time do not have the same job as firemen today. These firemen burn books. They start fires instead of extinguishing them. In this society, books are illegal because people do not want to debate topics or feel what a character is feeling in a book. The primary form of entertainment for the society is large televisions called parlors. Some people, like Montag's wife Mildred, depend upon these TV's and the \\"relatives\\" on the programs for emotions. Montag and the other firemen's job is to ensure that everyone is \\"free\\" from feelings.Guy Montag is a very dynamic character. At the beginning of the novel he accepts his society and his job, until one very influential character, Clarisse McClellan, crosses his path one night on his walk home from work. Until her disappearance, Clarisse shows Montag everything there is to enjoy outside of what society says you should enjoy. At the end of their first walk, Clarisse asks Guy, \\"Are you happy?\\" Guy thinks and realizes that he is not. Guy is not the only person that realizes that they are unhappy. When he returns home he finds his wife to have committed suicide. He calls in an emergency and two handymen come with small machines and heal Mildred. The men say that these cases of attempted suicide are so common that the doctors don't even bother to handle these cases anymore. This shows what how miserable everyone is in this society. Another influential part of Montag's realization in the flaws of his civilization is when he burns a lady that refuses to leave her books. Montag tries to figure out why someone would sacrifice their life for a book. He decides to investigate how a book could cause someone to give up their life. He obtains a book and is able to hide from the fire chief, Captain Beatty. Montag starts to read one of the books that he has acquired, but is unable to understand it. He seeks the help of a retired English professor, Faber. Montag and Faber agree to try and save society by destroying the firemen. Montag eventually joins a group of rebels against the unhappy society, but before they have a chance to act on the city, a bomb is dropped on the city. This gives Montag and his group a chance to rebuild the once damaged society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it's just amazing.aside from that, i have a leather bound edition signed by ray bradbury himself, seeing as how he's my good friend's godfather.and yeah.it's one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written-truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will make you think. As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love books like this more than I can express. Utopian society type books are probably my favorite things to read. So, naturally, I picked up Fahrenheit 451. I had heard great things about it from everyone except a good friend of mine who said simply that although he didn't by any means despise it, he thought it was a tad corny. I began reading the book and immediately fell in love with the style of writing. But, as I read on, I found that the book just felt a little... off. I think that it may have been a little unbelievable really, especially the Mechanical Hounds and such. I was also disappointed about Clarisse, although I won't go into detail about that. The thing that I really liked though, was that Bradbury hit the nail on the head when it comes to the development of political correctness. Overall, the book was alright. It was a quick read and I am still certainly glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Here's another book that I should have read in school, but somehow never did. In a future where entertainment caters to the lowest common denominator, and in which books are forbidden, the job of the fireman is to burn contraband books. However, Guy Montag has a secret...he's a fireman who reads books. When his secret comes out, he has to flee for his life.Bradbury's writing is wonderfully evocative, painting clear pictures of his vision of a dark future. In this era of &quot;reality television,&quot; this book has a definite prophetic feeling to it, as if we were actually well on the way down the road Bradbury warns us about. The importance of books and literacy for preserving knowledge and ideas must never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a true classic that most people are required to read in school. I never had to, and I regret that. Having read it now, I can see what the benefit of reading it school would have been. Books read in school are discussed and examined in detail. This book would lend itself well to that type of in depth analysis.I am glad that I at least read this book, although I found it only okay. I think in a school setting I would have enjoyed it much more. I just didn't find it as captivating or emotional as other books I've read.I have the 50th anniversary edition, which contains an interview with Ray Bradbury about the 50th anniversary, and how he feels about the success of the book. It was quite insightful and interesting to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb.

It is now one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Got the book for my son's English Honors class and as he read it I actually enjoyed it. It was very interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is by the conventions of literature is not a great book, and Ray Bradbury himself admits so. It is far too melodramatic, and the protagonist Guy Montag uninteresting and merely a plot device. The writing is harried and convoluted, and the plot both unbelievable and shoddy. In many ways, it's a pale imitation of George Orwell's much darker and sinister \\"1984.\\" But it's a prophetic and haunting book that has predicted all too well the decline of a mass capitalistic society into a hedonistic lifestyle obsessed with instantaneous gratification.Even today, it's a compelling and frightening read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a seventh grade student, and when my teacher passed out this book, I figured it to be dull and confusing. Oh, how I was wrong. Ever since the first opening sentence, &#34;It was a pleasure to burn&#34; I have been hooked. Like the saying goes, &#34;Don\`t judge a book by it\`s cover. The plot has me wondering, trying to predict the ending, but I know I can never know the ending until I read it myself. The description is full of vivid detail, and you always know what the characters are feeling. I love stories that aren\`t always so happy and pure, but, I don\`t want a story that\`s so depressing that you cry and get emotional over every paragraph. So, this book is balanced out on both sides. It can become somber and maybe even make you shed a tear, but it can also be heroic, knowing that the main character, Montag , is doing what he believes is right. Even if it means breaking the law.I am writing my own books, and I will be using this book as an inspiration to further my career. Fahreheit 451 is truly remarkable novel that shouldn\`t be over looked."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a great concept who would ever think of making these ideas fire fighters burning books, and many more like extra long billboards because cars going so fast, or draining and replacing your blood for a drug overdose.

Thesetwo actions shake up his world.Beautifully written book, poeticin places. Recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury\\"It was a pleasure to burn\\" begins this story of book and house burning. On his way home Guy Montag meets his neighbor Clarisse McClellan. A long time ago firemen put out fires instead of starting them. Could people be arrested for being a pedestrian? Guy finds his wife Mildred in bed, an empty bottle of sleeping tablets on the floor. He called the Emergency Hospital. They get many of these cases. [The pay of Guy dates this book.] The firehouse has a Mechanical Hound. Clarisse describes schooling, they can't ask questions but are only given answers. People race cars on the edge of town. Some children shoot others. [Gang warfare?] The History of Firemen has been rewritten. Guy talks to Mildred.Mildred lives vicariously through the television programs. [Like soap operas or reality TV shows?] Captain Beatty explains that book reading makes some smarter, so they are burned to create an equal world. Sports are encouraged since they don't lead to thinking. [But are all players equal?] They keep people happy with trivial things (like game shows?) Houses don't have front porches, they don't want people to sit and talk, or even think. \\"Fun is everything.\\" Guy has saved dozens of books, a criminal offense. People can't travel around or revisit the past, but they can read a book. Flying jets make noise. The station house bell summons the firemen. Guy recognizes the house! Its windowpanes are shattered to aid the fire. Guy is chosen to fire the house. Who turned in the alarm? Will Beatty be fired up? The Mechanical Hound gets blasted too. Guy Montag is now a wanted man. \\"Watch for the running man!\\"The war is on, and Guy is running like the hunted man he is. Can his trail be killed by lawn sprinklers? The Police ask people to turn away from their TV screens to look out at the real world. Guy escaped into the river and floated downstream. The TV news shows another faked event, the death of Guy Montag. After walking, Guy finds a home with the outcasts of society, the book lovers who have each memorized a book. Their Book Culture is to preserve books in memory, like in the Dark Ages. The war begins, bombs fall to destroy the far-away city. Can they begin civilization again?The \`Afterword' tells how he wrote this book on rented typewriters in a University Library. This story was changed to the 1966 film. \\"Coda\\" tells about publishing for high school readers. There are many groups that want to censor books. His publisher censored sections of this book. Bradbury says those who do not like his stories should write their own. [But its always easier to criticize than to create.] This book was written in the early 1950s when reaction was censoring books in libraries, and the spread of TV led to less book reading. Military jets would often streak across the sky to create sonic booms. Popular culture also avoided radio, which allows people to work or do things, unlike a TV or book. TV became an agent of mass psychology to influence people's thinking and buying (like the jingle in this book). Is TV watching a necessity like food, drink, and sleep for most people? Can you go for a week without watching TV? Even though much of it is of little value? The idea of a catastrophic war was a common theme in the 1950s. Burning books was popularized in 1930s Germany, so too an emphasis on sports. They didn't want people to think too much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A highly prophetic story about the voluntary dumbing down of society that in today's day-and-age hardly passes as fiction (it's not really about government censorship, as some seem to believe). This is a must-read with a great (and alarmingly urgent) message. The only annoyance for me was the writing style, which I felt was a bit on the tacky side, but the core message here is too important and otherwise well-stated to let that influence my rating. Everyone should read this at least once, and hopefully we'll all learn something from it before it's too late; though the thought seems somewhat optimistic at this point."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. The people who reviewed it poorly actually help show why its so important.Their comments about how they were forced to read agianst their wishs parell completely with the books theme. The books view that &quot;books were banned because they made people think, when they didn't want to&quot; is proved to be much more prevelant now that it was in the 1950's. If you love books, bradbury, and have the ability to think then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451 is actually a pretty good book. I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that. I read that part over 50 times and I still didn't get it until I had to asked my brother."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting to read.

I had recently wrote an essay about censorship and with the help of this book clearly made it easier for me to understand the issue better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have previously read other book by Ray Bradbury, and it is true to say that I enjoyed this one the most. I don't really enjoy reading, but this book made me realize, maybe I should start. We were forced to read this book in school but, I didn't mind so much. This book really makes you thin of what the worls might become if we don't take action now. Technology will eventually get out of hand, and then we will need people like Granger to help us get our society out of the dilemma. I think everyone should read this book. Sure there are some boring parts where I found myslef falling asleep, but I recommend it to all ages."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can't say enough about how good this book is. To you who were forced to read it or think it sucks or couldn't understand it: you closely resemble the believably insane characters, i.e. Mildred Montag, that Bradbury created to display how a lack of literature can create zombies! How could you not understand it? It was written in easy-to-understand language! How could you think it sucked? It combined thoughtful themes with a racy narrative. And so what if it had loopholes in it? Every story does, and these loopholes are not the point of the book anyway. Shame on you for your pointless whining about being forced to read it in school. Shame on you!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought this book was going to be great since it is always on the teachers' lists of recommended readings. But I felt the story went a bit slow for me. The first half of the book, was not very interesting and it was a little confusing. But in the second half of the book the story really picks up. I would only recommend this book to people who like science fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Plenty of people have said how good this book is, so I'm not going to go on and on. Instead, I will oly say that the so called &quot;loopholes&quot; of this story are so stratigically placed to force the reader to thnk. Example: where is Clarisse? what trully happened to her? a loophole? perhaps. Or maybe, a weapon of Ray Bradbury to manipulate the reader into thinking, and not becoming Mildred."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An average book, canonized as a classic because of its &quot;important&quot; message. It's a favorite for middle and high school English classes because its theme dovetails nicely with the lesson teachers all over the country try to teach their students: &quot;Reading is good for you!&quot; Also, it expertly exploits those teachers' worst fear: that reading will become an irrelevant activity and that TV will permanently take its place. As far as quality is concerned, unfortunately, Bradbury's novel simply isn't good enough to merit its overblown reputation. Don't believe the hype."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Duh!! it is supposed to be unrealistic and outrageous it is Sci-fi. i though it was a good book but a little confusing i had to re-read it to nderstand it and i had to pay attention.

Anyways...read this book it'll make you think about real life and how lucky we are that society isn't as screwed up as it could be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a story about a sick and twisted future in which books are forbidden by a Totalitarian Regime. The concept of this story originates from the time of WWII in which Hitler's Regime was burning libraries across Europe in an attempt to prevent the distribution of knowledge and other negative ideas that could affect his rise to power. This book is an exciting tale about a world in which firemen no longer extinguish fires, but instead start them. The firemen in this world burn all books and the houses in which they are contained.We feel that this story, despite its dark tone, is a well-written modern day classic that makes the reader better respect books and not take them for granted. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to read a thought-provoking story that provides insight into our future. An interesting aspect of this novel is how well it connects with our world today. Our society is becoming more and more reliant on technology and is becoming less interested in education, which sadly enough, is the same story in Fahrenheit 451. Could this be a reality for our world in the near future?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is wonderful.

Bradbury is one of my favorite authors, I've read all of his works. I see that others may not have liked this book, but I suggest that you try it. Bradbury typically bases his books around the unwinding of human civilization, the villian is the technology we have created. In 451, he revisits the theme, and does a fantastic job. I love this book, and if you like try his others. If you've read and loved 1984, you will love the excitement of Fahrenheit 451. In short, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book hearing that it was &quot;pretty good.&quot; What I was expecting was a traditional science fiction novel of good vs. bad and a weird plot. But Fahrenheit 451 was so REAL, it left me in tears. On the surface, it's entertaining, and a person with little patience will definitely find it boring but this story carries an important concept: Is censorship REALLY ok? I know very well that this book was written nearly 50 years ago, and describes a dark vision of the future. But this so-called &quot;vision&quot; is terrifyingly similiar to our own society and its present situation. Are we truly headed for the same fate described in the end of this literary masterpiece?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today's society.

I still remember the book and how I felt about it as a child reading it. I vaguely remember my teacher at the time saying in certain places they have outlawed this book but have never thought of it until it was in a daily program on disney recently. I have never really watched this program as it is primarily a childrens show but the advertisement caught my eye as I was flipping channels. It was showing a teacher getting arrested along with his students for merely reading this book. This is when I remembered my teacher saying something about its legality in some states. Is this Union such that we have to hide to read such works of art? I think this action is exactly what Bradbery was trying to prevent in society. He may have been trying to show people what the world would become if we tryed to enforce a sort of literature policy. Where would we be if Shakespeare's works had been baned? I believe this was an excellent book and every child should have the freedom to enjoy it. I hope that when my son is that age he will have the same freedom that I enjoyed in school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can understand the fascination with burning, but why books? I read Fahrenheit 451 for class, and I enjoyed it, though it's somewhat disturbing. In a futuristic world, firemen don't put out fires, the set fires, and burn books. Guy Montag is a fireman, who has always been satisfied with his job, until he meets Clarisse, a seventeen year old who changes how he thinks about everything...Ray Bradbury has a very distinctive writing style, which I noticed in Dandelion Wine, which I read a while ago. I would say Fahrenheit 451 is a much better book; the writing is better and the subject matter more interesting. The society depicted in the book is really scary. Mildred, Montag's wife, is always watching her three-wall television (she wants a four wall). It's interactive too, so she can take part in the shows. She's almost always watching it or listening to her Seashell (earphones).Clarisse and Faber are both really interesting characters. I think I would probably get along with Clarisse. Now, books being really important to me, I found this book super disturbing, and not altogether unrealistic. Though written in the 50's, it bears a certain resemblance to the increasing consumerism of today. Bradbury builds suspense and dread with his foreshadowing (for example, the Hound not liking Montag).I've been planning to read The Martian Chronicles for a while now, and Fahrenheit 451 motivated me to do so. I would highly recommend this excellent Ray Bradbury novel. Update: Not going to read The Martian Chronicles. I don't like scary science fiction. That scene where the Martians pretend to be the astronauts' relatives and kill them is really creepy.[...]"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to buy the book right away, My son need for school. it was late at night. so just click it from amazon it is great to have that power"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Short book, wondering why the author didn't make it longer, and i wish this book had a little more action."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was not assigned to read it in school, so I wanted to know why it was such big choice of school districts.

He is just going through the motions, as he is a puppet. One day a girl named Clarisse opens his eyes and lifts the dark cover from is head and shows him that he is not really happy even though he appears to be as content as can be. He is also not living his own life as an individual but is living like the government wants him to.Fahrenheit 451 takes place sometime in the future in England. After Montag's eyes are opened he decides to do something about it. He sees how corrupt the government is and how it controls the people. Montag's given job, given to him by the government, is to burn books. He thought that that is how life has always been with firefighters burning books instead of putting out fires.All this time is a quest for Montag to find out how to be happy and to make life better for himself and everyone else. I think that the novel was an excellent reading experience. The words spoken really made you think about life now and how the book applies to yourself. \\"Ten minutes after death a man's a speck of black dust.\\" This is an example of the how deep the novel is.I recommend this novel to people who are over 14 years of age. Anybody who is younger might not be able to grasp the meaning of the deeper points and may not appreciate the novel as a whole. Also I recommend this book to people who like to read about the future and \\"what if\\" type of books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, Guy Montag, the main character is a fireman that instead of putting out fires, he starts them because reading and owning books is against the law. The book is set in the future, but we don't know when. We learn that Montag has a stash of books that he has been stealing from houses he had burned that are hidden in his air-conditioning vent. Beatty, his fire chief, tells him he has one day to decide if books are any good then bring the book to work to be burned. Montag had met a retired English professor named Faber at a park a year ago. He reads poetry to Mildred and two of her friends; they get scared and go home. Montag goes to work and hands over one of his books, then the alarm sounds, when they get to the house they realize that it is Montag's house. His wife and her friends had called in the report. Beatty forces him to burn down his own house then places him under arrest, then he turns the flame-thrower on Beatty and knocks down the other firemen. The Mechanical Hound that Beatty had set against Montag injects some anesthetic into his leg. He walks off the numbness and goes to Faber's house. Faber gives Montag some of his clothes and tells him to run out of the city. He follows an abandoned railroad until he finds a group of \\"Book People\\" that have memorized the great works of literature and philosophy.In my opinion, Fahrenheit 451 is hard to understand and enjoy if you don't like futuristic fiction. The plot seemed like it happened too quickly and it doesn't seem realistic. This would probably never happen because people enjoy books too much. The characters don't seem disturbed about the fact that books aren't part of their lives. All they do is sit in their \\"parlors\\" watching TV on huge screens. This book is made more for people that are interested in futuristic novels and censorship. The characters are only used to not having books as a part of their lives, the government controled everything that was printed until society decided that they didn't want books anymore, as to not offend anyone. The people of this society don't think freely or spend time by themselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of &#65533;Fahrenheit 451&#65533; is a story about censorship in the future. The character of Guy Montag is a firefighter, but his job is to set the fire rather than put it out. The firefighters aren&#65533;t burning the building down, they&#65533;re burning what is inside, books. The government in this time has ruled that a certain list of books must be destroyed. People don&#65533;t think too much in this era, and books make you think, therefore giving people a problem. They all just want to be happy, watching television and listening to the radio. Nobody really cares about anything but their own happiness, so the children are left on their own and sometimes kill each other. There has also been a nuclear war happening for quit some time. One day Montag meets his next-door neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. She was an exception to the rest of society. She always talked about nature and how beautiful things were. Stuff that Montag (and everyone else) had never even stopped to think about for a second. Claresse&#65533;s thoughts, and the way she talked about things, made her an outcast from this futuristic nightmare. She was considered antisocial because she talked too much. Her radical thoughts greatly opened Montag&#65533;s mind. When he would go to a house to burn the books, he&#65533;d take a book or two and hide them in his house. Montag&#65533;s wife, Mildred, was just like everyone else. She didn&#65533;t talk or think very much. She would just watch T.V. or overdose on sleeping pills. So when she found out about the books she called the fire department to burn them. Montag was astonished to pull up to his own house and have to burn his stolen books. Luckily he hid them in his yard earlier. The fire captain, Beatty, instructed him to burn the house, and Montag did willingly because he had nothing to loose. After he burned the house, he set Beatty on fire, and then he skipped town. He followed the train tracks into the countryside where he met a group of ex-college professors. They all felt the same way about books. Each one of them had a book that they memorized and were one day going to write them down again. Their mission was to put things back the way they used to be decades ago.I can relate to Montag and the ex-college professors because they kept doing something even though it was a crime. They were standing up for what they believed in and were willing to die for their cause. It&#65533;s self-realization, knowing what you believe in and not letting anyone tell you different. If people didn&#65533;t stand up for what they believe, than we probably wouldn&#65533;t have cars or even electricity. New ideas and free thinkers are what made our lives so easy today.I liked this book because it is so much like our society today. The way that people drive fast, the way people use drugs, and people are lazy and hardly go outside anymore. Also the way the government controls and limits our freedoms. They tell us how we can and can&#65533;t express ourselves. New ideas are becoming scary to the average person, and we can&#65533;t do anything without offending someone. It&#65533;s really freaky how much it compares to today considering this book was made in the 50&#65533;s.I think people should read this book if they want to open their eyes a little bit. I think what happened in &#65533;Fahrenheit 451&#65533; is happening to our world, and it is kind of scary because it is all too possible. But it won&#65533;t happen if people get involved in their politics and tell the government what they want, rather than letting congress do what they think is necessary to make the people happy. So think a little more, and we won&#65533;t be horribly destroyed by a vicious nuclear weapon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 takes place in the near future where firefighters no longer put out fires they start them.

A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; five big stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a world that is overloaded with censorship, has a lack of knowledge, and is full of ignorance. I was quickly captivated to read the book after the first chapter when I learned the main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who's job is to burn books. This makes the novel begin with a very unique twist since the world is accustomed to firefighters putting out fires instead of starting them.Bradbury takes us though Guy's experiences that change his opinion of book burning. Starting with his encounter with a young girl named Clarisse McClellan, Montag is intrigued with her love of people, nature, and her stories of people who were not afraid of books. She causes Guy to see how dissatisified he is with his life. I feel for Montag as he goes through several disturbing events (his wife attempts suicide, an old woman chooses to burn with her books in her house, and Clarisse was hit by a car) and I understand why his eyes are opened to the bland life he has because of how censored the world has become. I would feel the same too, if I lived in a superficial world were everything is based on fast cars, TV, and radio and didn't include time by yourself, time to enjoy nature, independent thinking, books, and meaningful conversations. Nothing would be left in the world. That's why this book almost frightens me because it shows where censorship can lead to. What if our society just decided to get rid of free thinking to stop conflicting opinions? This novel makes you respect freedom after you begin to wonder if world could one day become like Montag's.At least there was hope for Guy as made friends with a retired English professor (Faber) and decides that Faber can help him understand the books that he hid away from his own fires. The most emotional moment was late in the novel when the fire station gets a call. Montag realizes it's his own house and his wife turned him in. It's sickening how everyone turns against him because he wants to gain knowledge about the old world. This lead to an intense chase that makes you almost want to cheer outloud for Guy as he escapes the Mechanical Hound, Beatty, and other firemen.The final chapter left me somewhat satisfied. It's vagueness at the end makes me yearn for a sequel. That's about the only problem I had with the book. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is unique in its own way. What goes on in here is not what people usually want to hear. Burning of houses, burning of sacred classics, even burning people. What makes this book likeable is that it makes you step out of your comfort zone into reality. As if it was going to happen if we don't stop doing what we are now. I like this book because of the interesting technology and characters. Clarisse of course is my favorite character. She reminds me of the bright, young, smart, and clever people that live in this world.The main character in this book is of course Guy Montag. He is a fireman, that burns books. Unlike other firemen, Guy Montag is more friendlier. Even Clarisse said so herself. She said he made her forget about him being a fireman at all. Which sets apart Montag from the rest of his group. Which makes him special.What happens is that Montag is apart of the fireman group 451. Being tempted, Montag steals a book, and more and more with each job he does. His captain of course notices, since near the end he said every fireman does this one time in his career. But, soon enough Montag is caught. Therefore being caught, he is forced to be on the run constantly, in fear of the Mechanical Hound, the invention used to catch \\"criminals.\\" Yet, there is a surprise ending, and to see what it is, you'll just have to read and find out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What if the Nazis had won WWII? Would the world change for the better, or worse? Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury deals with a society controlled to the point where firefighters and firemen are used to start fires in the middle of the night. Animals are no longer living, but programmed machines, and thinking out of the ordinary is considered blasphemous. This is the exact type of lifestyle the Nazis would have enforced. Guy Montag, a fireman, questions these ethics after a book burning at an old woman's house goes terribly wrong. This incident inspires Guy to question his type of life and the government's thinking. As society and the fire chief catch on to Guy's unorthodox behavior, Guy finds himself a target by society and the hunt for his life begins.The setting of this book is very difficult to follow. Ray Bradbury does a poor job of showing or even telling where the story takes place, and what the date is. Because of this, you find yourself wondering throughout the piece about simple things like where Guy is and the city he lives in. However, this sketchy plot gives you the sense that the city could actually be anywhere, which seems to be the goal of Ray Bradbury. When he first reveals to you that the city in which Guy lives is called City, it makes you wonder where in fact this story takes place. You do get clues about the type of lifestyle people live, like TV's in every household that are the size of whole walls, and the mechanical pets that are in each household. When reading this book I found myself picturing where I thought Guy was. So this was an effective way of writing to me. When Ray Bradbury describes Guy's wife driving on an isolated road in a forest, running over small mechanical animals at will, you know that the area must be in an area that has a temperate climate like Europe.I believe that a major fault in the book would be the main character Guy Montag. Guy pretty much has two personalities: the one where he doesn't think for himself and the one where he does. His ideas and attitudes change quickly in the beginning and then they stay the same again for the majority of the book. However, the supporting characters were developed quite well and I especially like the fire chief. As Guy's main antagonist, the fire chief played a pivotal part in the transformation of Guy.The plot on the other hand is done quite well. The first half of the book slowly sets the tone, and introduces and develops the characters. As soon as you switch over to the second half of the book, you are just blown away. The second half deals with Guy's struggles in his quest to find the truth and flee from the hell in which he lives.It is very simple to tell when the book is in each of the action stages and when the conflicts change. The books builds up so well to the climax that you can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next. The climax keeps you glued to the book and never gives you a chance to take a break.The theme and topic are very unique and are what keep you interested. I couldn't put down the book because I just wanted to see how a society so influenced by specific rules would turn out in the end. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy science fiction books and suspense novels. This is one of Ray Bradbury's best pieces and I think everyone will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book takes place in a futuristic society (around 2500 probably). It was written in 1950 and many of the predictions Bradbury made back then are happening right now. It really is scary when you think about it.Guy Montag isn't a regular fireman. His job isn't to put fires out but to burn houses with books in them. In Bradbury's futuristic society books are illegal. People who read them are called crazy and usually put in an asylum. Montag really loves his job and has fun doing it, until the day that he meets a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse isn't like other people - she likes to smell flowers, to climb trees, and to talk and think, which isn't something most other people care about. In this society, people watch their TVs, go to work, and sleep. No one talks, no one thinks...Clarisse starts Montag thinking, &quot;What do books say? Why were they banned?&quot;. I can't say much about the plot because I'd be giving away a lot of interesting things about the book but I can say, you won't be disappointed.

The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered \\"dangerous\\" if people are exposed to them.

The tension of the ending was well worth the slow reading in the beginning. In the beginning we get to find out the life of the main character (Montag). We are given an understanding of what his every day goings on in the future are. We are told what his job entails and how important it is for the society that he lives in. The middle and end of this book is when the story gets good. We learn how unneccessary books are and why they are seen as evil. We see Montag go from anti-books to pro-books with the help of a freind (Faber). We watch as Montag comes up with a plan to try to make books a part of society again. Fahrenheit 451 is the degree at which paper burns. This is a good title because the whole story is about how books are as illegal or even more illegal as present day drugs. Books are to be incenerated. They are worthless in the future. All in all Fahrenheit 451 is a good science fiction book. Once the reader gets past the slow beginning, they are in for an enjoyable treat. The reader will be swept away into a future where reading is considered useless because nothing will be gained except confusion. This is not true about this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As I looked up this book after reading it, I saw it had an average rating of only four stars. What was wrong with it?

And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.&quot; -Ray Bradbury (Coda, Fahrenheit 451)This book is outstanding! It is a book for people who love books. It is a testament to the power of books and the importance of the knowledge they hold.It reminded me a lot of 1984 and Brave New World. If you liked either of these two novels, you will like Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag, the fireman turned fugitive, is a lot like Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 because he is forced to hide from an organization that wishes to destroy him. He is also like John Savage in Huxley's Brave New World because they both come to see the importance of literature, art, and beauty in the world. All three men are trapped in societies that are all about a quick fix, the easy way out.Fahrenheit 451 offers everything: action, drama, suspense, inner struggle, inspiration, faith. There's isn't really any romance, but the connection between Montag and his young neighbor Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the world around him, is one of the best I've read.Bradbury makes it clear that this novel is anti-science science fiction.

He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, &quot;thinks,&quot; not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We were assigned to read this book in our English 9 class, and never before have I read something nearly as interesting as this.

It's not simply the fact that books are burned that's dangerous, it's what's destroyed with the books. The people in Bradbury's dystopian world have been effectively trained to enjoy simple, mindless stimuli, such as television walls that feature characters who are your 'family' and your 'friends.' The rationale is that books are sources of a vast amount of ideas, many of them in conflict with one another, and this clash of ideas makes people unhappy. Burning books is one of many ways to reduce sorrow and confusion in the world, though more to the point it's a way to control people through blissful ignorance.Bradbury's concerns are still pertinent to society today, and in fact maybe even more pertinent. We are a culture obsessed with entertainment. We love TV shows, and some of them are incredibly mindless, though I don't think Bradbury would condemn all TV shows. Some certainly are thought-provoking. Advertisements permeate our culture in just about anything, from what we wear to the places we go, and they can be quite effective in making us feel hungry for a cheeseburger. Many of us have such busy lives that we hardly have time for friends and relatives, much less time to think. Our hectic, stressful lifestyles have certainly taken their toll. Suicides have become increasingly common. They are a way of saying that something needs to change.Fahrenheit 451 is a thought-provoking read. Some of the dialogue and the technology seems archaic today, but that adds to the charm. The mechanical Hound, with a syringe for injecting morphine into its victims, is particularly strange, but oh so devious. As archaic as some of his dialogue and his technology might seem to us now, the novel feels surprisingly contemporary, like it was written today and not 70 years ago. And that's what's frightening."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really wish this book had been written for a higher reading level. I loved the idea, but I felt like it was cut short. I felt like I really missed out on the entire picture, or like this a portion of a more elaborate novel. I loved it, but was definitely left wanting more. It would have been perfect if it were longer and had a little more detail!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am fascinated by the idea of this book. There is always debate in our society about the freedom of speech and I don't think that the prohibition of books is that different; especially since there are many occurrences each year of people demanding that certain books be banned from schools/libraries etc.I think that even though he's a complete jerk, Beatty is a genius; an evil genius of sorts. He moderates the book burning firefighters and strives to make sure that no one who is found with books goes unpunished.I'm not sure if Montag is a hero or a kind of anti-hero. He was a fire fighter but his curiosity about books is inspiring. I wonder about Beatty's true self. I am unsure about his knowledge of books; he could be using his knowledge as a two-faced approach to catching the rule breakers. But part of me wonders whether or not he's actually a closet intellectual who is torn by his passion and his civic duty.I love Beatty's insistence that the first fire fighter was Benjamin Franklin. It's the evil genius side of him that I kind of admire. (I mentioned this in a discussion of the book with the club mates). What made Franklin such a great diplomat was that he not only knew how to listen, but knew how to subtly sway people to his lines of thinking, but could also sway them to do has he wished in financial matters which is no small accomplishment. Those traits mirror Beatty, though Beatty is perhaps a bit more sinister.I love that the message of the book is a little open-ended, at least in my opinion. What I take away from the book is that prohibition or censorship may seem like it puts everyone on the same plane it also has the ability to cause a fair to significant amount of dissention. Bradbury leaves the question as to whether or not that is a fair compromise up to the reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well, I consider myself really late in joining the wagon of Fahrenheit 451, considering it is written in 1953. Maybe it is because it is outshined by the other more well-known dystopia: 1984 and Brave New World. But again, better late than never.The book tells a story from a world without books, when you have a Gestapo-like-secret-police (which is played by fire fighters! believe it or not), which will burn all of your books if you are stashing them.The idea itself quite surprised me, especially since it was written before the era of TV and Internet like nowadays. Only a genius can write something like this, predicting the future decades ahead. The writer concerned about the decline of reading culture, taken over by audio-visual culture, such as TV and now, the Internet. When everything is about entertainment, politics, news, even crime scene and the advance of REALITY SHOW!. How close can it be to nowadays reality.His premise is quite believable. Even some publisher in my country are afraid to print books which are sensitive, afraid that it might offend certain group. Just months ago, the publisher burn the book because of the pressure of religious group, a book writer which are beaten because her ideas are blasphemous. If this continues, the days when publishers stop publishing books about ideas, because it might offend people, are closer than we think.This books are inline with Marshall McLuhan's The Medium is The Messageand Neil Postman'sAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. They are the prophets who shout in the middle of the desert, \\"Beware you commoners, thy world is bleak as long as you are stuck in front of your TV! Read books! Think for yourself.\\"This book remind me why I love sci-fi books. Because of its prophetic nature. The only cause I do not give a five star is because its rambling dialogue. I still prefer Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, even though it is a non-fiction, because it is more entertaining."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A compelling book, creating within a desire - a thirst - for knowledge, and a sense of need - need to be an agent of change. Bradbury uses the illustration of an elder who has passed, and when the elder is passed, the mournfulness isn't for the elder but for the what the elder will never do again; hands that had always been active, creating, crafting, and mending would never again create, would never again craft, would never again mend, would never again influence the lives of those around them. For what will you be remembered; for what will you be mourned - for what will I be mourned.Read it - and be changed.\\"And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\\"Rating System* = tripe** = okay read*** = good read**** = excellent read***** = life changing read"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very interesting perspective on what the world might be like if automation took over and humanity accepted it !!!Kind of scary to think about.Classic book that I have been trying to find time to read for years.Glad I did."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book because of all the suspense it has to offer and just the fictitious setting in the near future. Montag, the main character in this book is a firefighter, but he is not your average firefighter. Firemen now start fires instead of putting them out; and they fuel the fires by burning books.This book has a very futuristic setting to it. People watch television on screens that are as big as the walls because books have been outlawed because the higher authorities were becoming offended by what was said in them. Therefore, soon it was impossible to write something without offending a person, which made literature dull and all the same. The world is going through very harsh times, there have already been a couple of wars since 1990.Montag is fed up with life until he runs into an open minded younger girl named Clarisse. She is different from most people at the time with a passion for nature and a love for other people. After Clarisse dies, Montag begins to turn to books for answers as to why they are being burned. Montags firechief Beatty finds out and gives Montag 24 hours to read as much as he wants. Montag will later find out that his wife betrays him because she is disgusted that he is reading and leaves him. Beatty orders Montag to burn his own house then places Montag under arrest only before Montag turns and burns Beatty alive.Montag then has to escape the law from a mechanical hound that is out to get him. In the end, Montag joins up with a group of \\"book people\\" that have memorized great literary pieces and are basically outlaws on the run. He stays with them and helps to rebuild society.When i got done reading this book i was very surprised to think that this is the way society is slowly becoming. Many more things are being censored now for fear of being chastized then in previous times. Kids nowadays are also much lazier and much less reading is being done by newer generations. This book, although fictitious, still shows what a world without books could do to a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people.

There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books. Nature is presented as a force of innocence and truth with one of the characters.Blood appears throughout the novel as a symbol of a human being's repressed soul or primal, instinctive self.

Becuase of its size I would say it is worth reading, only 100 or so pages. But the actuall writing of the book is not so good.Bradbury has an amazing story, a great one, but he doesn't know how top wright based on one word &quot;was&quot;. That word makes a good story seem boring, long, and like &quot;how many mnore pages? Boy this sure is a good book!&quot; Even though You can enjoy a book it may be boring to read.

But if you are reading this I will actually type my opinion. WARNING: Not suitable for children under the age of 10. This book is good for anyone who enjoys burning things. I enjoyed reading this book because of all the fury and held in rage I have consumed over the years from reading [bad] books. I also enjoy burning misc. things. This was one of the better books I have been forced to read in school. I do not read much and when I must do book reports it makes school worse and worse but this book was not so bad. I do not usually get assigned good reading books as assignments. Reading is good for you. Stay in school. Read this book. I do suggest this book, however, to read this book even if not assigned. It will keep you wondering what will happen next. Keeping me on the edge of my seat is a good combination for a book when mixed with only 180 pages. This is a good book to read if you like to read AND if you hate reading and need a book report because of how short it is. I have given this book 4 stars for a good plot and it's worth reading. Writing 250 words is usually hard but when you write on constantly about nonsense it becomes easier. If you are being forced to read this book, do not fret, read it. It's not so bad. Thanks for hearing out my opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was read in my Sophomore English class, I liked it, but I only understood it after my teacher's explanation. I recommend this book to people who like sci-fi, because the things that I didn't get, were futuristic things from the author's imagination. Once you actually get a picture in your head of what these futuristic things look like, the book is really good, and the author makes a very good point. I only give it three stars because the author doesn't describe the unknown things better to the reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book that I am reading is called Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury and it is about a sheltered community who has banned books from the community to read. The problem is that there s always some one or people with a little bit of curiosity to find out what is out there beyond their whereabouts and what is in the outside world. In this town the fireman are paid to burn books and this keeps everyone the same, happy, and not wanting/wishing to leave their perfect town and go search new surroundings.I think that this was a great book to read. It kept me on the edge and scared for what was going to happen next for the main character. Like when Montag's boss came to his house while he was reading a book and he hid the book but while he was talking to his boss, his wife was cleaning and almost found the book. I got really scared for him but I could help but think it was really strange that the firemen burned books to shelter the people. But what they don't know can't hurt them. Right?I think that Fahrenheit 451 is a book mostly for the teenage mind because littler kids wouldn't understand why the people had to be blinded from the outside world and such. This would be very interesting to read for the more mature age in high school. It would go over a lot better in their minds."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book painted a very dark and bleak future for mankind. Part of the future is firemen that don't fight fires but rather burn books. Why? Because the powers that be determined that what was in books could offend, confuse, depress, and sadden people, etc.Fahrenheit 451 depicts a society where it is best to make books illegal and burn them in order to keep society &quot;politically correct&quot;. Just keep people happy watching television and and doing other mindless activities.I thought the book was well done in depicting the dilemna one firefighter faces and the actions he takes while living and working in such a world.The book probably deserves 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This Book is very cool.

This book is really cool."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought Farenheit 451 was a good book. It takes a while to get to the point though. It just starts of a little slow thats all I Mean. I really enjoyed the description done by Bradbury in the book his detail was very distinct. In the first half of the book the main character Montag a firefighter trys to discover himself. After all a firefighter starts fires in this story, and that might get to a person after a while. He wants to know why firefighters are supposed to burn books and why books are so bad.In the second half of the book Montag starts to use his head and stop letting everyone else control him. He becomes a fugitive and this is where the action begins. He ends up being chased by mechanical dog's and hellicopters and gets in fights with flamethrowers. I think that sais it all for the second half of the story. The soft Sci-Fi novel was very interesting and gets you thinking.

This book by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 is eye catching. It's an easy read and won't take you a long time to read it. Bradbury's writing style is very compelling in nature. He depicts a futuristic society where the government controls everything. In this book he tells the story of a man (Guy Montag) that works for the government. He is a fireman who gets paid not to put fires out but to start them. In the society that Bradbury builds, the job of a fireman is to burn all books. The government feels that books make people anti-social and is the reason why there are so many problems with people in their world. Guy Montag upon many events in the book starts to struggle with his on self. He starts to find a new found love for books in which he is intrigued by. He struggles with this throughout the book. He is disregarded by his comrads and they are displeased with his change in attitude. Throughout the book the heat gets intense as Guy struggles with his own feelings. The government is on the look for him and out for his arrest. Will he survive? or Will he fall under the governmental society? Hope you read it and find out. This is a great read an will give you a deeper feeling of what to think about in the future. This book will give you an greater insight on what may and could happen in the future.

This book takes place sometime in the future. It is a story is about a fireman, he is not a fireman that you and I think about; instead of putting fires out he starts them. He is a book burner. Because in the society that he lives in books are outlawed and are to be burnt. There were four main characters in this story. The most important was Guy Montag. He was a tall black haired man that questions society and himself. He is a fireman that burns books for a living. He makes a lot of changes throughout the book buy the end of the book he is a wanted man. The next character was Clarisse McClellan she is a young girl that is not like everyone else. She is a free thinker she helped Montag get started on his journey. Montag's boss is very important in the book. His name is Captain Beatty. He is a fat black haired man. He seems grumpy and he enjoys burning books. Towards the end of the book he is murdered. Professor Faber is an old professor that helps Motag learn about society and how it used to be. He is weak and cannot act out what he wants to , so he and Montag act as a team. Mildred Montag is Montag's wife. She is the perfect example of the rest of society. She believes that books are horrible and have nothing to offer. All she cares about is her family that was on T.V. and not much of anything else, just like the society she lived in.While reading this book I could relate to a couple of the characters. For example, Guy Montag questions his job and what he wants to do with his life. I have done this. So I quit my job and made the decision to go back to school. Another character is Clarisse she is outgoing and enjoys to be outside. I also enjoy going outside and I am always ready to try new things.I liked this book very much. It kept me interested the whole time. My favorite part is when Montag burns the other firemen and starts the chase to the river because it made me want find out if he was going to get caught. My least favorite part is when his wife called the fire alarm on him for hiding books in their house. As a result, Montag is forced to burn his own house.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes books about the future and what it holds for us. If you are young or old you will enjoy this book. It is a fast paced book with many exciting parts that will keep you reading and guessing the all the way to the end. If you have free time or need to do a book report go out and get a copy of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is a good book. buy it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a man Guy, Montag who questions why he is a fireman that burns books instead of reading them. The firemen of our society put out fires and help people, but the firemen of their society are futurist cops who burn books. The main character in the book is Montag Guy who is works for the \\"fire department\\". Montag meets a women named Clarisse McClellan who changes his mind about what he does as a fireman. Montag runs into many problems after this, when he decides to change his mind to not burn books. Captain Beatty is Montag's boss of the fire department, who eventually finds out that Montag is hiding something. Montag's behavior creates problems for Montag that put his life at risk.Montag is my favorite character in the book because he is an exciting person that does a lot of interesting things. You don't know what Montag will do next while he is on the run from the law.I compare my self to Montag because I remember when I was told what to do all the time. Just like Montag was told what to do by his society. Montag did not know that burning books is wrong because he had grown up in world that told him to it. Now that I am 18 years of age my parents can't tell me what to do anymore. It's like I am responsible more now than ever. I can start my life and do what ever I like. Montag is trying to fight for his freedom by getting out of his society so he can start a brand new society which is just and fair.This is a great science fiction book that will keep you guessing all the way through the book. My favorite part in the book is when Montag is forced to burn down his own house while Captain Beatty is waiting for him outside. After that he is arrested by Beatty. Instead of giving up, he turns the flame thrower on Captain Beatty and burns Beatty to death. I loved this part because the hand exactly symbolize what Montag's hands are doing to Captain Beatty-like they have a mind of their own. If I could change something in the novel it would be that Bradbury had more of the young women, Clarisse McClellan, because Montag talked to her a lot in the beginning of the book. I would have liked to see if there would be more of Montag and her interacting.I would recommend this book to people who like science fiction.

Although I found this book somewhat akward, I do still find it an alright book and well written, that is why this book is awarded three stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an interesting book to read because it is set in an alternate reality that broke off just after Ray Bradbury wrote the book [This comment might be hard to understand if you don't know a bit about alternate realities and other alternates] The book is set in a alternate future that the government doesn't like books because every book makes someone feel bad. Firefighters in this alternate future created by Ray Bradbury start fires using books to feed the flame that they cherish. The reasons that books were turned to ashes were that people didn't like some books because they were opposing their beliefs and religions. Also books were also most likely burned because some of them gave revolutionary ideas. Fahrenheit 451 is a little hard to read because Ray Bradbury replaces some words with others. The replaced words make it hard to read quickly sort of like reading American writing with Japanese characters names inserted in instead of the American names. This book is best read by people who like reading quickly and can read Japanese fan fics for anime with the Japanese names instead of the American names. The words are not very advanced for vocab so that part of the book is really easy to read. For me this book was easy to read so I think that you should be at least 11 before you read this book because of the style of writing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering \\"wait... what happened?\\". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"highly recommended reading by Bradbury fans as well as those not familiar with his work"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very few authors have written a book this significant, this succinct, this brilliant. This is one of my all-time favorite books. I love how he describes everything; and furthermore, the ending was astonishing. The imagery, the action, and the meaning of it all was just stunning. Anybody who knows how to read, must read this book. Starts a bit slow, but once I got into it, I began to appreciate it for what it was. Starting with page 100, I couldn't put it down. I picked up the book at eleven o'clock at night, and by the time it was three in the morning, I was finished. It is that gripping. We need more authors of Bradbury's stature around today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This spare novel is as powerful today as the day it was written, painting a rich tapestry of what is to come and what, frighteningly enough, has already happened.I feel for the junior high schoolers who were forced to read this book--it seems that most of them aren't ready for this brilliantly rendered cautionary tale, judging by their myriad spelling errors alone.It's too bad, really. The book is truly stupendous and *meant* to be stark. I only hope that the disgruntled readers hang on to their initial reviews written here for a few years so that when and/or if they're ready to try it again, they'll realize their folly.And to those who burned the book, all I can say is I hope you enjoy asking, 'Do you want fries with that?' for the rest of your days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A cynical, yet prophetic view of the world as it is today. The upside-down trick (making fire instead of extinguishing it) has been used to great effect before ('freedom is slavery') and perhaps better. Still, this book is worth the read, if only for the moral warning to society it contains."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, was a good yet weird book. The author tells of a story of a man who finds that what he once thought to be true and right was wrong. The story then takes you through some strange events while you meet different characters. Although the book was sometimes random, it was a fun and exciting book. The book was good, it really seemed to relate to the world we live in and the everyday choices we make."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this book was almost as good as Brave New World and 1984, but I determined that this was not quite up to the standard that these respected authors set. i am not degrading this book at all. it presented some very valid arguments, such as the degradation of the human mind through the removal of books, and thus, most of the conscious, independant thoughts. Also realistically presented was the cause of the forced demise of books, through minorities. i am personally very apprehensive of various minority groups compaining about anything that is not what they desire to hear. i personally support equal rights, but many of today's minorities seem to think that equality is not reached until their rights surpass those of everyone else. if any &quot;questionable&quot; material is released that disagrees with their views, the government must do something to maintain that minority's felicity. for more on this topic, i suggest reading Bradbury's &quot;Coda&quot;. however, it remains somewhat inferior to Huxley and Orwell's dystopias because of the tendency of the book to remain at times too superficial. I understand that the author only spent about a week on the novel, so it is understandable that it would rank in just below these paramount paradigms of the dystopic future of mankind. the massive, forlorn, wretched world of hate created by Orwell is just more in-depth and depicts more intense scenes of the injustices that humans face. Huxley's world, as well, allows for the reader to get more acquainted with the main characters, and thus the readers are more shocked when Winston is torn apart emotionally by the man he once thought he could trust as a fellow usurper of the power of Big Brother.if only Bradbury had gone in-depth, such more could have been reached by the book.however, it remains a classic nonetheless, for the accurate prophecies portrayed and the fears of dehumanization and antidisestablishmentarianism."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book to sit side by side with '1984' and 'Brave New World,' Bradbury's classic on censorship is less bleak in execution than 1984 and more focused than 'Brave New World,' resulting in a thoroughly readable tome that remains as relevant today as it was years ago. Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.You'll note, 9 out of 10 bed reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough) Rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view...these narrow-minded, ignorant little children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future, no?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel is about censorship and how a single thought can change your whole life. The main character, Guy Montag is a fireman of the future--paid to set books ablaze. In the beginning, he finds comfort in this. Then he begins to question authority and the sensless laws set forth by a faceless government. From beginning to end, this story is a thrill ride, cover to cover. Mr. Bradbury has you guessing. His characters are so unique, and at the same time, truly everyday people. This book is truly enjoyable. Younger readers will not get the symbolism; however, older readers will see just how close we probably are to this virtual insanity of lies and deception. In the end I was left wondering, &quot;Who saw that books were so harmful?&quot; Was it one man or the whole nation, slowly evolving from our current lawsuit happy world, to this insane world of deception? I just have to wonder. I would recommend this to teachers. For the student's sake, it is a fairly short story but there is a lot that can be done with it. I would reccomend this to students, except that they will probably have to read it some day for school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As an English teacher who uses this novel in a high school class I may be accused of being biased but this novel is one of the most chilling and prophetic novels ever written.I will agree with some readers that Bradbury's writing style may be lacking but should readers choose to focus on the minor details instead of considering the themes which he addresses then they are sorely missing out on a wonderful experience. With each new reading of this novel, I discover new aspects and facets which mirrors our society in this country and throughout the world. Analyze the novel while looking deep into the problems of our country alone and a reader cannot help but be moved.This book isn't crying to save all books. It goes far beyond that. It examines the power that people have in shaping their culture, their future and their history. What is freedom and at what price do we preserve every single person's individual rights? Is the power in the society, or the individual?Thank you Mr. Bradbury for providing us with such a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love to read, always have, and this book has shown me why. The slow build-up Bradbury uses to show the awakening of a numbed mind is almost brutal. Reading along as Guy forces himself through the ashes of ignorance and blind faith which cover his artificial life, and into the stiff wind of knowledge and understanding, I understood. He begins to possess an amazingly powerful tool: the ability to use his mind to understand his world and why it, and we, are the way we are. Farhenheit 451 is an incredible book that, like the Handmaids Tale, is there to remind us (those of us who care) that the world may one day go wrong. I was very sorry to read some of the negative reviews though, like the others that loved the book, I noticed they came mainly from those who were forced to read the book in school. The book requires a certain mindset and understanding of what people are capable of doing. Students still in grade school or even high school are not ready to understand and see what the implications are if censorship is allowed. Ray Bradbury did a marvelous job in bringing home the importance of reading, and the resposibility that comes with it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I ordered this book for my lit class, since we were about to start reading it. I read the description and such, and understood it to be a pretty big book, dimension wise. I got it in, and the dimensions of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" were a lot smaller than what I had expected. Overall, great product, great service, and it's the same book that the rest of my class has, regardless of size. Good story, I have enjoyed it so far."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I remember reading this in high school, pretty much because I read everything back then, and my chief impression then was...hmmmmm, ok. It was an ok book. I appreciated what it had to say about censorship, about the power and value of books, about the sad distance between people. And it was a fast-paced and readable novel. It paled compared to Something Wicked This Way Comes, but overall, it was fine. I was glad that I could say I read it, even if it failed to provoke a strong reaction from me.So, it's now been about a dozen years since that first reading, and I found myself needing to reread it because some of my students are reading it. So, I started it one evening and had it done by the next. Normally, I don't get anything read that quickly, what with work to go to and papers to grade, etc. But this time, Fahrenheit 451 was something that I could more than appreciate. It hooked me. I both enjoyed it and appreciate it more deeply than I did a decade ago.What stuck out to me Bradbury's fury at the fast-paced, mind-numbing, loud, hateful, drunken, addled culture that we keep making worse and worse. A culture that abstracts us from the earth, from our neighbors, from our history, that hinders us from the contemplation of deep questions that makes us human. I think that working where I work (with cell phone and tv obsessed students) and living where I live (near DFW) Bradbury's vision hit me hard and with urgency. I fear that what Bradbury has to say in Fahrenheit 451 may be more important and relevant now than it was when he wrote it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first it seemed like a stretch, but the more I read, the more I realized that this book is telling the truth about society. People dictate the way we think using the media. In the past, everything reflected truth and reality. Now, everything goes deeper and deeper into nonsense to the point that the truth is not a value at all. This book helped me to realize that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Come on - a classic. Montag is iconic and impervious to criticism; c'mon, he hates burning books and he's a 'fireman.' Bradbury has created one his best stories in this tale of the near future, which tragically, is beginning to mirror our own. How many young people to I hear say 'I don't like to read, not my thing.' Are we so far away from Fahrenheit 451? Five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the top classic sci-fi novels. This heavily influenced me as a teenager.The main character struggles with himself, as he begins to balance his livelihood -- burning books -- with his realization that maybe free thought is a good thing.In this dystopian future, books are burned to keep people from thinking too much. This is the ultimate form of propaganda, as ALL information is limited to what the government distributes.Like 1984 and other dystopian literature, Fahrenheit 451 serves as a warning to prevent the very society it predicts."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a true classic. The story remains relevant today...and I would think should enjoy a resurgence during the current craze for the dystopian.Bradbury imagines a future that seems imminently plausible. But, more than creating an interesting world, Bradbury captures your heart and soul. You become emotionally involved in this story. You eagerly look forward to the next sentence. You wish there was more when you're done.Readalbe. Entertaining. Thought provoking. Everything you could ask for in a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was surprised by this book. I knew of it but did not know what it was a about. Firefighters now take away books from the people who love them and the knowledge they bring but in this world knowledge is considered something bad they want people not think for themselves.I also feel like there is more to this book that i am not saying. It is a book that I think if you read over and over again you will understand more of the world. Sometimes that is what I have to do with Shakespeare's books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Love the book. It turns out as noone expects it.

SORRY, so stop reading this if you haven't read this book and for some insane reason, want to. This book is just plain terrible. Ray Bradbury seems like a depressed, misogynistic misanthrope who can't tell a good story either. Can't we find something else for our high schoolers to read? Just how old are the people who make the school board decisions about what is considered literature? Are they just too lazy to find something newer...like written in the last half century? I liked Ray Bradbury back in the early 70's when his books seemed somehow daring or antiestablishment, but now they just seem outdated and depressing. There is nothing \\"classic\\" about this book either. Reading this book makes me feel suicidal, and not in a good way. Principally because it is just so boring and unbelievable and well, weird. I reread it when my daughter had it for 9th grade English and couldn't believe the crapola of it. Please, there are so many better books for kids to read now. FInd something else and take this \\"literature\\" off the list of required reading.

The songs have a very authentic Latin sound. It's almost like she took the last song from Mi Tierra and continued on with the songs on Abriendo Puertas.The songs have a New Year's and Christmas theme, with messages about starting over, sending good wishes, as well as about just having fun. &quot;Mas Alla&quot; is the softest number, so lovely it brings a tear to your eye. &quot;Farolito&quot; is the most interesting, because of its tribal blend of chanting and rhythmic hand claps.There are many different Latin and Caribbean styles, which Gloria has written about prior to the lyrics of each song. She tells what styles you'll hear in the particular song, where they come from, and the instruments that are used to get a particular sound.This one isn't translated like her two other Spanish CD's are. So, even though you may not get the lyrics, the message of loving life is clear throughout the entire CD."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"I have an earlier edition--the third edition, published in 1997.

It's modern, up-to-date with information, and is definitely a 'bible' for EFL teachers, or those who wish to become one. The first few chapters are introductory and provide some informaiton about various language degrees and certifications, and general information about working abroad and some of the potential problems/concerns you might have. The second part of the book -which takes up a majority of the pages - has a page or so devoted to all major countries in the world. For each country the author describes the EFL scene - whether jobs are plentiful, the amount of schools already in place, etc. and how difficult it will/won't be to get a work permit. There are also some leads for language schools in each country, with information about salasry, who to contact, requirements to work, etc. The unfortunate part about this book is that EFL comes across as a field that is non-lucrative and difficult to break into (especially if you're an American wanting to teach in the EU). Many of the country listings, when the author describes the prospects for teaching, are not encouraging at all, and have made me less interested in pursuing this line of work. The book, however, is a great resource if you're looking for EFL positions and further information."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"I highly - HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who wants to teach aboard. For the record, I'm American, and while some of the information does talk about interviews in the UK or whatever, I've found it to be a HUGELY helpful resource for job-hunting. The GF and I are using the book to look for jobs in Asia, and it's been invaluable.This book will answer your basic questions about almost any country in the world: what's it like to live there, what are the teaching conditions like, how much will I be paid, what's the cost of living, etc. It also lists reputable schools in each country and gives their contact info - a REALLY REALLY valuable resource!The information in the book is clear, straightforward and well organized - pretty much the opposite of searching online. I really can't overstate how immensely great this book is - especially compared to the other options: Google searching, forums full of trolls, etc.Getting a job teaching English abroad could be as easy as:1. be qualified2. find a country you like in the book3. send your resume, etc to schools listed in the book4. hopefully get some interest, and some offersGood luck!"},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"A wonderful, mostly upbeat CD.

There are a lot of different grooves and styles of music and different sounds. Dulce Amor is a blend of cumbia and Columbian beats.

It's a far departure from &quot;Mi Tierra&quot; if you have heard that. If you read the insert, she explains which music styles she is incorporating.

However, it is not really very useful for Americans and other non-Brits. because a lot of the information is irrelevant or even misleading to non-EU citizens. For example, the book devotes too much space to jobs in Western Europe and not enough to areas where non-EU citizens can work legally, such as Latin America. It also concentrates on recruitment organizations and school groups which insist on teachers being interviewed in England. So I think Americans and Canadians should look for books which more directly address their job needs. One possibility is Jeff Mohammed's &quot;Teaching English Overseas.&quot; It's shorter, partly because it has fewer ads and anecdotes, but it has more relevant information. There may be other similar book also."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who lived abroad. Unfortunately, it did not apply in most cases to the 20 countries in which I traveled and tried to find work, not only because I'm American and this book is aimed at UK natives, but because of the brevity of info offered.Americans and Canadians have a more difficult time finding work simply because of EU citizenship requirements, though it is also true that English taught with an American accent is more desirable. The latter, however, does not mean Americans will be better paid or even employed.Many times, schools fill positions with natives who studied English abroad, even if their command of the language is quite poor. British natives are often preferred over Canadians or Americans simply because they have no work or residence permit issues if you're in the EU. Americans, at best, can find tutoring jobs through placing an ad in local newspapers (and it helps to write the ad in the local language to attract students) and will not be paid as well...in fact, half the rate in many cases of a native speaking substandard English.In the majority of cases, some previous teaching experience, credentials and certificates are required in order to be considered for a position. In addition, some knowledge of the local language is extremely useful, often required. This book does not stress this. Standards have changed in the world, and those wishing to find a job simply because they know how to speak English is not enough. Buying and reading this book, however helpful it is in small ways, is also not enough.As with anything, there are exceptions to the rule. My best friend from California was placed in Poland, well-paid and provided housing for 2 years without any experience, certification or previous interview; last year he taught in Turkey during his vacation under nearly the same conditions. Another woman who contacted me for advice found a job in Romania quite easily and is having a great time. Sometimes it's about connections, sometimes about luck.If you're American, Teaching English Overseas by Jeff Mohamed is more relevant. Then, take a TEFL course, get a copy of Living Abroad Magazine, check the availability of jobs in local papers of the country(ies) you choose and have an agency place you keeping your options flexible to the many beautiful countries worldwide (South America, Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe). That's more practical and realistic."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"I always recommend this book to people who tell me they are thinking of getting into teaching English as a foreign language. I think it provides a fabulous overview of the industry, and the pros and cons of teaching abroad. The book helped me to narrow down what was most important to me in an overseas teaching position. I found the personal anecdotes to be illuminating, and they were one of many factors that eventually steered me away from teaching in Asia or the Middle East. ...Although the book does have a slant towards a British audience, this book is NOT only useful to Brits. I am an American, and it helped me to get my first job teaching in Europe. It also helped me decide where to get my TESL certificate. I sent away for more information from many of the TESL certification schools listed in this book, and eventually decided to do a Trinity College certification course in London rather than an equally expensive but non-Trinity, non-Cambridge course in the US. I have never regretted this decision for a minute, and in fact it led to an excellent job with excellent perks in Bratislava, Slovakia. (Yes, like most of us unlucky Americans, I eventually had to face reality and give up the dream of working in an EU country!)It is true that Griffith could spend more time focusing on job opportunities in non-EU countries, especially Latin America. Hence, only 4 stars out of 5. However, this book is an excellent starting point for those considering teaching English abroad. Naturally, no single book can cover all bases. It goes without saying that your experiences in a foreign country will be as unique as you are, and may differ wildly from the teachers quoted in the book. But for my money, this is the best introduction to teaching abroad in one single publication. Read and enjoy, and if you end up in a scrape in some dicey teaching position abroad, don't say that Susan didn't warn you!"},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"I have an earlier edition--the third edition, published in 1997.

All the info is pretty up to date, (this edition is in 1999) however the author is British and all references for North Americans are secondary, while info for those in the UK is a bit more comprehensive. Also, the author promotes 2 major schools which are located in the UK.

With \\"Mi Tierra\\" Gloria got back to the Cuban side of her Hispanic heritage and produced a milestone album. With \\"Abriendo Puertas\\" she mines the huge wealth of Colombian music to produce a gem.Open-minded Estefan fans are in for a treat. The songs are based on different local styles, as the liner notes usefully explain. There's an amazing variety of rhythms - all irresistible. The melodies are catchy and Gloria delivers them with her customary warmth and assurance.You don't need to understand the words in Spanish to enjoy this joyful music, but it's a real bonus if you do. It's notionally a seasonal album but unlike so many this one goes beyond the cliched trappings (chestnuts roasting, jingle bells etc.) and really connects with what the festive season is really be about - reconciliation, new beginnings, generosity, shared memories and good times together.\\"Abriendo Puertas\\" is perfect for any day of the year when body and soul need a little refreshment. GLORIOUS!!"},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"\\"Abriendo Puertas\\" just edges out \\"Mi Tierra\\" as Gloria's best album to date. (Both of those albums would be on my very short list of the best albums anybody released in the 1990s.) \\"Abriendo Puertas\\" (\\"Opening Doors\\") fuses a variety of Latin and Caribbean styles into something new, positive, and exciting. It is an outstanding concept album, greater as a whole than the sum of its parts. Gloria's singing is terrific here. Her greatest strength as a vocalist is her ability to effortlessly dance her voice through complicated rhythms that would stop other divas with greater range and purer voices cold. What also makes this album so special are the highly creative, challenging, energetic charts by Kike Santander, the just-right and seamless production of Emilio Estefan and Kike Santander and sound achieved by recording engineer Eric Schilling, and... wow... the searing performances by Gloria's band and backup singers. Everything is firing on all cylinders here. Don't shy away from this album just because you don't speak Spanish. (I don't.) You don't need to speak Spanish to understand and appreciate the vibrant energy and positive message of this CD."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"Abriendo Puertas is the second of Gloria's three Spanish CDs, but the last I became familiar with. At first I was disappointed as it seemed less &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;cutting edge&quot; than Mi Tierra or Alma Caribena, but increased familiarity has revealed its considerable charms.This is a holiday (Christmas and New Years) related album, but not really a Christmas album as such. All the songs are based on Latin dance rhythms and represent the kind of high spirited festival music that is popular at that time of year. This is as much composer/arranger/instrumentalist Kike Santander's album as Gloria's-- he has written 10 relentlessly upbeat, wonderfully arranged songs, inventive and polished to perfection. The details of the songs are quite wonderful, and Gloria's singing is ideal for this idiom.This is really a great album to put you in a good mood, as well as for appreciating top of the line musicanship. The Gold Star award for the songs must go to &quot;Felicidad&quot;, which is just that, and the impossibly infectious &quot;Tres Deseos&quot;, (try and play it just once!).All together, Gloria Estefan's 3 Spanish CD's are a real achievement, and prove that her real talent is in her Latin heritage, and not in the rather ordinary English language albums she is more famous for."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"In Part II, on page 344, in the section on Middle East, under the heading Saudi Arabia, Philip Dray is quoted:\\"I decided against Saudi Arabia. The money was most appealing, but I could not think myself into a situation where there was no nightlife, limited conact with women and no culture or history. A year may seem short when you say it fast, but you could get very depressed in a situation like that. Money is nearly everything but it can't buy you peace of mind. So I opted for a job at a school for boys in the U.A.E. which, from the description, sounds sociable, inviting and accessible.\\"Griffith elaborates on Dray's quote above, \\"After Philip's arrival at the Oasis Residence in Dubai, he was well pleased with his decision, since living conditions in his luxury apartment complex complete with pool, steam room, squash court and gym, were just as lavish as he would have been given in Saudi. High salaries can also be earned in the United Arab Emirates.\\"That is all the author has to say about the U.A.E. She goes into great detail describing how to get a job in Saudi Arabia and many other countries, while warning that you'll probably hate it. She has a separate section for each such country. Then she says under the Saudi Arabia section that the best option is definitely the U.A.E. And yet she made no section for it, and gave no contacts, as she did with the others.That is not a funny joke played on the earnest reader.Also, the author agrees with another source I have concerning Poland. Griffith says on page 293, first sentence under the section on Poland, \\"Prospects for English teachers in Poland, western Poland in particular, remain MORE PROMISING THAN ALMOST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.\\"However, she does not mention how much a teacher can save per month on average (as she does with most other countries). And from the looks of the numbers that ARE quoted, it doesn't seem like you could save anything, compared with the $1000 to $1500 per month you could save in the Middle East or Japan, or the $1000 you could save in Korea, etc.The author does give some seemingly useful tips, but it's difficult to trust the author who gives you all the information you could ever want on the countries you'd never want to visit, and none of the info you really want on the countries you want to visit.By the way, I am an American, but I have no gripe against the book being geared toward Brits, and I hardly think it could be more useful to either. The author does a fine job making it accessible to anyone with half a brain."},{"Title":"Teaching English Abroad, 1st ed","review":"This book has some good information, but it's like carrying a phone book, and a lot of the info is addresses.

Everything written is to the point, and it's a lot easier to carry."},{"Title":"The Rehnquist Court: Judicial Activism on the Right","review":"\`The Rehnquist Court' is a compilation of articles by different writers critical of Supreme Court decisions made during the last couple of decades. One of the main issues is concerned with the rollback of civil rights gains made in the 1960's. These include prisoner and defendant rights, affirmative action and access for the handicapped. The writers are quick to point out that the Rehnquist years are anything but a complete liberal disaster. In many cases the Supreme Court has upheld freedom of speech as well as generally maintaining the separation of church and state. Make no mistake, many civil rights have been maintained despite the objections of the Conservative trifecta of Justices Scalia, Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist.Taken together the articles paint a particular ideological trend. The Rehnquist court tends to favor states rights over federal rights except in the case of business where the federal government suddenly gets the last say. In one case a state law restricted tobacco companies from putting up billboards in sight of school buildings. The Rehnquist court abandoned federalism and declared the law illegal because it went above and beyond federal restrictions. The Rehnquist court has also been pro-business in making it more difficult for individuals to sue companies particularly in the case of environmental damage. There seems to have been an ideological influence on the Rehnquist court from the Chicago School of economics which teaches undying faith in the market and its ability to self regulate. The Rehnquist court has shown an indifference towards anti-trust laws and a sometimes counterintuitive and bewildering approach towards insider trading. The effect has been a considerable consolidation of wealth in a small minority within the last several decades.In the case of states rights superceding federal authority the writers astutely point out that in many cases this renders the Bill of Rights useless or as Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez might say \\"quaint\\". When tobacco companies are restricted from posting billboards targeting children the Rehnquist court is ready to sweep in with federal authority but when clear and undeniable bias is shown in the execution of blacks the Supreme Court defers to the wisdom of the states. The general trend of reducing individual rights has had the effect of dramatically increasing the percentage of incarcerated Americans in the last two decades as well as increasing prison sentences. Incarceration has become the number one tool of social control and prisons have continued to focus on punishment over rehabilitation. On the Executive end Attorney General John Ashcroft sought to have all prosecuting attorneys seek the maximum sentence in all cases which would end plea bargaining.It looks as if the Rehnquist years are just about officially over which leaves \\"The Rehnquist Court\\" essentially a historical compilation of specific rulings however the writers make it clear that the legacy is far from over. There have been a tremendous amount of 5-4 decisions and if the court saw a couple of more uber-Conservatives like Scalia or Thomas things could change dramatically."},{"Title":"The Palmer Method of Business Writing","review":"This paper back reprint version is too small and almost impossible to read.

She saw the book and was intrigued by the title. Later, as I waited in the minivan for the sightseers in my family to return from an historic site I did not wish to tour, I started reading the book. A &quot;nice&quot; girl, I was intrigued by the last sentence of the Prologue: &quot;No matter which sex I went to bed with, I never smoked on the street.&quot;I must be clear: I am not an intellectual, and Florence King is. I had to look up all of the Latin and French phrases the author uses, and she probably dreams in both languages. However, this is not an intellectual book.

The book would flow seamlessly if not for the reader's need to stop and snort, chuckle, gasp, or give a deep belly laugh. It is the first book that ever made me laugh out loud, and the first to ever shock me. I now consider it a must-read for all of my close friends.I believe all intellectuals of Miss King's caliber will find relief in this book, as it proves there are still people left on earth who are well-learned and don't go on Jeopardy; pseudo-intellectuals will bristle at the author's disdain for their kind, but should still find the story irresistable, and the rest of us will not be able to put it down. A disclaimer: the overly sensitive should avoid this book"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I was first introduced to Miss Florence King when I attend American University in 1983. One of my classes, The South Since Reconstruction, used King's Southern Ladies and Gentlemen as a text to study the stereotypes of the \\"white\\" south. From there I became a King fan and read everything - yes, everything (including The Barbarian Princess) that she wrote. And the joy of reading King is in that she writes so exquisitely.And it is that writing that makes this book - an autobiography - one half of the formula that works so well. Anyone can rattle off the stories of growing up. But it is King's mastery of English that takes the stories of her life and gives them life, and more importantly depth. Make no mistake, this book is hysterically funny, and these tales told by anyone else would be just that - laugh out loud funny. But King is able to take the people of her life transform them beyond characters on pages, but make them people of depth who deal with very serious issues of race, sexuality, fidelity and faith. And yes, these folks have their idiosyncrasies to battle with, but what family doesn't? King addresses them rather than skate by them. I can guarentee you that you will never look at a pickle jar the same way again.The title is a take on King's mother, who despite her mother's greatest hopes, is a failure at the task of being a delicate Southern Lady. Make no mistake when I say that Miss King's mother Louise was all woman, but the genteel arts of being a \\"lady\\" escaped her. So Miss King's grandmother set about turning \\"Florence\\" into a lady. Again, what emerged is a person who is a bright, engaging and all woman, but one that doesn't suffer fools wisely and one who doesn't aspire to make a dress from the curtains in drawing room. Added to this mix is Miss King's father Herb, the cool voice of reason and the counterpoint to the hot insanity that is Washington DC in the 1940s and 1950s when most of the action takes place.Yes, this book deals with some serious issues. However none of things contained in this book are so shocking as to make the children of today blush. And I will go one further. While this book does contain details about Ms. King's relationship with another woman, this is not \\"a book\\" about bisexuality as some in LGBT movement have decided that it is. In reading subsequent interviews and pieces by Miss King that was clearly not her intent.

Her astute observations about Southern women and men, as well as the culture as a whole, make this book a 'must read' for any Yankee that is going to spend time in the South or any Southerner (particularly females) who just wants to try and make sense of the m&eacute;lange of racism, classism, anti-intellectualism, gender bias, hospitality, community, cultural pride and good-ole-boyism that gives the South its flavor. Ms. King's wit puts it all in perspective and will make you cackle like a laying hen - even if you don't know what one is!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be a light fluff piece about the South being gone and all of that. I read it in a weekend, and I simply could not put this wonderful book down. I will warn the fainthearted, there are scenes in which two women are intimate with one another. The whole story is just wonderful, and growing up in the South, you simply KNOW what Florence is talking about. You just understand. Like being hot and sticky from the humidity in the summer, if you are a Southerner as am I, you will relate to many of the things referenced in this book. A great read. I am keeping my copy, but I do let friends know of the title. I have the original cover with the Confederate garter on the leg in the air. Cannot bring myself to share that with others."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I LOVE this book. I own few books, as I am a cheapskate and prefer to check things out of the library, but I had to buy this one.It had my snorting with laughter and nodding in agreement as I recognized the basic characteristics of my \\"shabby genteel\\" family in Florence's - my house is dirty but the silver is gleaming. I even copied my favorite quotes into my battered Bartlett's.There are a few books that I must reread every so often - To Kill a Mockingbird, Gone With The Wind, Lonesome Dove and this one. It's a classic."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I have neither a Yankee or British father nor a Southern mother, but I saw enough of my relatives in this book to make me stop and think about my childhood, then laugh so hard I cried!

I was really looking forward to a fun romp along the lines of Ya-Ya Sisterhood, but it struck me instead as a self-serving &quot;coming out party&quot; for the author. Rather than eliciting laughs, a couple of chortles is all I could muster.We read this in a book club and all 5 members gave it a hearty &quot;thumbs down&quot;."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I was rather bummed by this read after all those fabulous reviews. I found it to drag on and on! I did not think it was humorous or ingenious. I just wasn't blown away and I had so hoped it would. This southern transplant needed some downhome nostalgia but came up empty handed."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"Want to know what a Huggybear is? Or a Malkin? Or a Watery Mole? Or a Virago? You'll have to read Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady. Florence King (no relation to Stephen, I would add!) has a uniquely warm humor and a style that she can truly call her own. I roared with laughter in places, I choked back a shiver or two in places, I gurgled with contentment in places, and I reveled in the amazing writing that has become Florence King's trademark. What a remarkable lady. From a Southern family, raised in the racially segregated Washington, D.C. of old, King follows her own life through college, graduation and into adulthood, where she finds she is considerably more attracted to her own sex than the other. Though written in a style that is hilariously funny and relatively light-hearted, Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady also deals with deeper issues, like the definition of femininity. This added dimension makes the book all the more interesting, even for a non-female person (maybe ESPECIALLY for a non-female person!), and for those of us who enjoy something a little more cerebral than 'Noddy meets Goldilocks', Florence King's wonderful insights into growing up (and dealing with her sexuality) is a perfect companion to a blazing fire and a glass of good wine."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"Having grown up in Chicago with a Southern mother and a Yankee father, I always wondered why my family and its &quot;rearing&quot; techniques seemed so different from those of my peers. Then I read &quot;Confessions,&quot; and everything became wonderfully, wickedly, and deliciously clear. I laughed out loud and exclaimed in recognition throughout the book as I saw my Mamaw in Granny, my mother in Mama, my father in Herb, and myself in Florence. Ms. King is a brilliant writer whose observations are at once devastatingly, uproariously accurate yet lovingly conveyed. Her ability to break your heart and make you guffaw through the tears is unique. I have read this book over and over and have lent it to friends all over the country (sometimes it never comes back). Today I am ordering my third copy. I recommend &quot;Confessions&quot; to every reader with wit, intelligence, and a touch of lunacy. It will bring out the Southern in your soul."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"While this book didn't leave me laughing till my ribs ache ~~ it sure did give me an interesting perspective on southern humor. Florence King is an excellent writer who takes you down memory lane ~~ you cannot help but relate to her descriptions of people in her life. However, I am a pure Yankee ~~ so a lot of the humor about gleaming silver and dusty houses just flew over my head. (Up here in Ohio, we're neat and clean ~~ a Malkin society that Florence describes so wonderfully!) However, I enjoyed reading about Florence's outlook on life and how she handled her disappointments and her realization that family does matter ~~ all done with humor and dry wit.This is a quick read for me ~~ King keeps me riveted to each page with her descriptions of daily life in the south and with her love affairs. It was nice to read about someone else struggling with the society's mores ~~ and how she dealt with it. Though I may not have come up with the same conclusions as she did ~~ she handles her with lots of grace and laughter. A rare gift anymore in this staid society.Pick this book up and you'll enjoy it. Be sure to kick off your shoes, drink a glass of lemonade and swing on the porch. Enjoy the sultry summer heat of the southern humor. It's a great book to while away a lazy afternoon.5-28-02"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"A bisexual, gun-toting, fiercely southern woman who left the Republican party because they had turned into a bunch of liberal pansies?

Everyone I actually talked into reading it loved it. Don't doubt it, this book is a real treasure!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"As a feminist and a believer in the individual, I loved this book. Florence King is an intellectual in the best sense of the world, funny and erudite, never shying away from either the very coarse or the very fine. My favorite passage describes her first day in kindergarten, her first time in the company of other children her age (she was an only child). \\"I was miserable....

This is one book that I share with everyone (while I firmly hold onto my own copy!!) The characters come alive with such wit that you cannot help but reread parts that you just read but could not believe. Florence King has a knack for making you see the lighter funnier side of what is still an obsession er &quot;tradition&quot;. Rest assured, here in the South the southern &quot;lady&quot; or modern day &quot;belles&quot; are alive and well.Another great read in this genre is &quot;Hells Belles&quot; which will equally make you laugh till you cry or send you running for the bathroom. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I am truly a southerner, and Ms. King's irreverant approach to the traditions and ways of the south in the mid-twentieth century are so on target that it will startle the reader who is not from the south, and will sound all to familiar to the southern reader.I found her covert feminism during this time in her life very interesting and educational. It almost seemed like the fact that she was a feminist during this time in her life was unknown to even herself.Her honest talk about her sexual life I found startling.The way she challenged the cultural norms of that time is educational for anyone who is living under a cloud of opression, real or just real to you.it's a great read!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"When I first picked up this undeniably hilarious novel, it was the original edition with the Confederate garter on an extended female leg. Needless to say, I was intrigued. It is a fabulous book. King is not only an amazing writer, but a true intellectual. Though the book is funny and relativly light-hearted, King also deals with the deep, confusing topic of the definition of femininity. This added layer makes the book all the more three dementional, and for those who enjoy deep thought, even more enjoyable. &quot;Confessions&quot; is not for the faint-hearted, however. There is plenty of blantanly sexual talk and rather explict scenes involving heterosexual and homosexual encounters. Potential readers be warned. All in all, a wonderful book on all levels. The memiors of an early feminist."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady","review":"I was browsing through a bookstore in Chicago last week and came across this book and instantly gravitated towards it. Perhaps this is because I found myself, a southerner, emerged in the midwest, but I was feeling the need to explore the \\"typical\\" southern woman which I believe does not exist.This book is King's memoir of growing up as a Virginian in Washington, D.C. She goes to graduate school at Ole Miss to compare deep southern women with upper southern women. What she finds is the love of her life, a deep southern woman who challenges her beliefs and ideals. This book is a treat and something every lady should read."},{"Title":"Dirty Work","review":"Having read all three of the &quot;non&quot;-trilogy as the author puts it, I found all of the stories exceptionally humorous.

Read the first two, absolutely, but don't leave this one out. You will laugh, and it is worth the time."},{"Title":"Dirty Work","review":"\\"Dirty Work\\", the story of an unwilling hero, is a disappointment. Dan McGirt's first two books about Jason Cosmo are funny and entertaining, but with his third book, he fails to continue what had been a winning trend. His tongue-in-cheek humor goes over the top, with the characters being far too aware that they are in a story, and his best supporting character, Mercury Boltblaster, only appears in a small portion of the book. Read the first two books, but skip this one. It's not worth the money."},{"Title":"Dirty Work","review":"The highlight of this book for me was the reference to the Luggage of terry pratchett's discworld novels.The book was slightly funny in parts, but it lacked the spark that would have truly made it a funny satire/parody. It had the characters \\"break the fourth wall\\" entirely too many times and then had them go right back to what they were doing, as nothing had happened. IF they had made fun of the roles (which they did) and then proceeded to do something completely unexpected or at least original, it would have been funnier. But as it is, they did the equivalent of: saying, \\"I'm going to step right here without paying attention and slip on a banana peel, to humorous effect,\\" and then doing so. It just isn't funny.For a few pages, half way through, I thought maybe it would break away from this and be fresh and original for two minutes, but no luck."},{"Title":"Sonoma: The Ultimate Winery Guide","review":"As a winery employee, I would recommend this book to both serious and novice winery visitors.

(Discover Drawing)","review":"As a self proclaimed 'doodler' I've always been fascinated with how you can make a drawing look lifelike... and not cartoonish. I could sit for hours and doodle and copy almost any picture, but they never looked real. This book is written in such context that even my 12 year old daughter has now taken an extreme interest in pencil drawing. It could have something to do with the examples in the beginning of the book of portraits drawn by children as young as 11 years old and they are better than anything I had ever done! After one day of reading the entire book and acquiring the recommended supplies, I took a deep breath and started the practice sessions. At the end of the first day, I decided I wanted to try to draw the eye and the lips using the newly learned techniques and was absolutely blown away at the realism on my piece of paper! Now, I shall try to draw the other facial features and then an entire face. I can't wait for my next break at work so that I can do more."},{"Title":"Draw Real People!

Most of my artist talents come from self education not classes, and I have to say an awful lot of the how to draw books on the market are... lacking. They assume a LOT. This book is the first one I have found in a long time that teaches the reader how to draw in a way that is clear, concise, easy to follow. I seriously doubt you can buy this book, really use it and not improve your drawing skills. The skills it covers do not apply just to drawing people even though that is the focus of this book. Perspective, shading, dimensions... these things apply to anything you might want to draw, and this book covers them well. A great reference book for anyone trying to improve their skills!"},{"Title":"Draw Real People! (Discover Drawing)","review":"The title of the book is \\"Draw real people\\". However the book only covers drawing based on photographs; not based on drawing live models; \\"real people\\". Further it only covers the head; portrait, and not the whole figure; model. And it only covers drawing with a pencil; black and white; it doesn't cover charcoal, coloured pencil, pen, pastel, etc.The two key points in the book are working with a graph (a grid) and shading.A graph can work well when you draw based on a photo. When you draw based on a live model you need to translate a 3D form into suggesting that on a a 2D sheet. Key for that is good observation and translation. This isn't covered in this book. A graph may be a helpful step for beginners but in my view you need to leave that behind you asap. The pitfall is that you stay locked in the box/graph instead of getting \\"out of the box\\".This book uses a line drawing of a portrait as the starting point. This may seem logical for the beginner, but there are other ways, not covered in this book, that may work better, faster.How to use shading to suggest form in the portrait is covered unusually well; it's the key strength of this book.Further this book offers a number of usefull technical tips for drawing the eyes, nose, etc. It definitely will help you to make better drawings; also when you work from a live model.A pitfall can be that you work too much based on templates/molds, instead of on good observation of your model.These tips alone make this book good value for money. I'm happy to have it in my collection.The key drawback of this book is that it is not artistic. It's craft not art. You as a drawer, are primarily acting as a manual printer of portrait photos. The drawings basically all look a like in style and to me are not tasteful, they look dead; technical drawings; no artistic expression.There is so much more you can bring into and get from drawing; especially from live models, that this book doesn't even mention.Drawing is both craft and art. In the balance of good technical tips and the absence of art, related to the price of this book, it's good value for money so four stars.Benefit from this book, as one of many sources, and move beyond this level, into art, asap!"},{"Title":"Draw Real People!

At first, I thought that this book was too hard for a beginner, but I kept coming back to it.

The big secret is to draw less with the pencil and smudge and blend more with the tortillion (paper stump). If I had more time, I think I could get even better, but even with the little time I had, I was impressed with the method. So I think this book is great, but it takes some time to begin to &#34;get&#34; it.

(Discover Drawing)","review":"Although I bought this for one of our daughters in conjunction with some other sketching supplies for her birthday, the rest of our daughters and I have enjoyed going through this book. Each of our 3 children are naturally artistic, but this book is filled with some very good instructions and suggestions on sketching portraits.The illustrations are very well-done, and the author, Lee Hammond, appears to not only be a natural artist, but also a natural teacher/instructor. I have been sketching as a hobby for many years, but I have gleaned some very good information from this book as well. Noses, in particular, have always been the bane of any portrait I've done, but I believe I will approach my next portrait with a bit less dread when it comes to the nose after the very helpful information provided in Draw Real People!In my opinion, this is an excellent reference book for anyone who is interested in portrait drawing, from those who have never sketched a portrait to those who have, but who are open to suggestions and further instruction. I would feel comfortable giving this book to ages as young as 6 or 7 years old, depending on the child's attention span and his/her interest level.In my experience as a mother, I have found one of the most important things to do with a young person interested in art techniques -(or any other particular skill)- is to provide them with as much information/materials as possible while they have that passion and let them absorb and practice as much of it as they wish. It can be suprising how much a child will actually learn if it is something they have a strong interest in. This is what I have done with our children, who each expressed an interest in art at very young ages, each of whom have won awards/honors in art competitions, (please forgive me for bragging a bit on them, I'm just so proud of their hard work, dedication and accomplishments ;-)I highly recommend this book and will be looking for other drawing/sketch books by Lee Hammond."},{"Title":"Draw Real People!

(Discover Drawing)","review":"&quot;Draw Real People&quot; is one of the best art instruction books out there. Many art instruction books that teach you how to draw are too boring and difficult to follow, and the drawings aren't really all that interesting either. In Hammond's book she breaks down everything into simple steps. Hammond's techniques, gridding and shading, are so obvious that I wondered why I'd never thought of them before.Throughout the book you'll find step-by-step instructions, exercises, examples of Hammond's own work and before and after drawings of her students. After implementing Hammond's technique, my drawing skills improved greatly. Instead of looking cartoonish and sketchy, they looked realistic and smooth. I was so thrilled with my progress that I went and got the rest of the &quot;Discover Drawing&quot; Series. I was bit disappointed, however, when I saw that half of each book was devoted to gridding and shading. They were the same exact things Hammond taught in &quot;Draw Real People.&quot;I recommend to beginners to only get two of Hammond's books: Draw Real People (good for portraits) and Draw Fashion Models (good for people, clothing, hair, etc.). Once you get a hang of gridding and shading you can basically draw anything, so there is no need, in my opinion, to get the rest of the &quot;Discover Drawing&quot; Series. All you'll need to do after that is practice."},{"Title":"Draw Real People! (Discover Drawing)","review":"Hi. I'm thirteen years old, and drawing has always been kind of an enjoyable hobby for me.

My friends and family were amazed by the exact likeness of the portrait. This was on my very first attempt. I would highly reccomend her book. I plan on getting seriously into portraits now.

Lee goes step by step with each part of the face, then teaches you how to draw an entire face with important facts to remember (like there is one eye width between the eyes).

I found my drawings to be of much better quality if I simply looked at the picture and tried to draw it, as opposed to following the step by step instructions. Using this straightforward style, I started drawing people's faces, until I was recommended this book. I bought it, and it was a worthwhile investment.I'd never heard of this particular drawing style before, and I wish I had; it would have saved me much trouble. I wish I could post a before and after picture for you to see how much my drawing improved when I started using this style. Shading is explained thoroughly throughout the book, as is highlighting and many other important techniques. I recently painted an 8x8 mural of our school logo, a Native American, and this book provided priceless help. Though it might help to go through some trial and error first, I highly recommend this book to all classes of artists, beginners to professionals."},{"Title":"Draw Real People! (Discover Drawing)","review":"The Draw Real series by Lee Hammond are, by far, the best drawing books I've EVER owned. My art teacher even agrees and she has over 20 years of experience! When I first got the Draw Real books, I was an &quot;ok&quot; artist. My shapes were distorted a bit and the shading wasn't the cream of the crop. But after getting and studying the books for a while I did some of the best work I've ever done! I highly recomend the books for all artists, even the rookies. NOTICE: I don't recomend replacing hands-on help with the books. You'll get the best results with both a good art teacher and the Draw Real books. My teacher also contributed to my drawing success."},{"Title":"Draw Real People!

There's a surprising lack of step-by step on how-to-, where to draw each part of the body and so forth. They have only a few samples with the steps drawn in; I'd love to have more pointers!!And, it should be titled, \\"How to draw the head profile\\" instead of \\"How to draw real people\\", since the author did not include how to draw human figure, hands, arms, etc.however, it's still a helpful guide in giving the basic knowledge of how to draw the human face."},{"Title":"Draw Real People!

It argues that wealthtends to concentrate because capital is moreproductive than labor, and so it calls forpolicies to compensate labor with capital insteadof cash."},{"Title":"The Capitalist Manifesto","review":"The Capitalist Manifesto was written during the Cold War, when capitalism and communism were competing economic systems. In part one, Lou shows where he thinks Karl Marx made his big mistake and says:The path the capitalist revolution will take faces in exactly the oppositedirection from that taken by the communist revolution. It seeks to diffusethe private ownership of capital instead of abolishing it entirely. It seeksto make all men capitalists instead of preventing anyone from being acapitalist by making the State the only capitalist.Part two of the book is Lou's program for the \\"capitalist revolution.\\" It would help households become owners of corporate shares. They would pay for the shares through bank loans. Dividends on the shares would first repay the loans. After that, the dividends would be a major source of household income.Each element of the program calls for new legislation. One major government program would make credit easily available for households to invest in businesses. A \\"Capital Diffusion Insurance Corporation\\" would be federally chartered, to insure against some of the risks, such as the failure of a business to sell all of a securities offering and the catastrophe to a borrower from multiple business failures. This insurance is intended to lower the bank's interest rate so that the borrower's loan payments would be less than the expected dividends on the shares.To provide cash for loan repayment and household income, corporations would be required to pay out their entire net income in dividends. (Younger businesses could retain earnings for growth and reserves against risks.)Lou and I agreed about the need to broaden the ownership of capital and increase the number of individuals who could receive investment income, as a supplement to work earnings. We had three differences about how that could be done:1. Lou's programs placed an intermediary between the individual owners and the business. DPOs create a direct relationship between owners and management.2. Lou's programs require extensive government legislation and oversight. Direct offerings use the existing legal framework, without any special treatment.3. Lou's programs used Wall Street investment bankers, including Kelso & Co., in packaging and distribution. We have prepared electronic toolkits for use by the business itself in designing and completing direct offerings.Lou believed passionately that each of these three elements was necessary. He told me that the intermediary was needed because the new owners did not have the experience or training to manage direct investments. He said this was a temporary measure and could gradually be eliminated as more people became capable of capital management. In our direct public offerings, over 90% of the investors have never owned shares directly in a business before. Nor do they have an account with a securities broker. Nevertheless, our interviews show that they read the offering documents and perform the same \\"risk/reward analysis\\" as securities analysts and investment managers.Government intervention was necessary, Lou argued, because vast borrowings were required for workers to invest in businesses. The financial institutions would not extend that credit without government guarantees, tax benefits or other incentives. As to our direct offerings, one of Lou's followers referred to them as a \\"Marie Antoinette\\" response. (When told the French people could not afford bread, their queen reportedly said: \\"Let them eat cake.\\") The point of the comment being that households don't have money to invest, unless they can get loans that are repaid from the investments' income. However, we have seen that \\"workers\\" will choose to allocate money to owning shares in a business, rather than spend it on something else. The money is there, if it can be diverted from consumption. Government-supported borrowings are not necessary. (Ironically, Paul Samuelson, Nobel Laureate in Economics, referred to Lou's programs on television's \\"60 Minutes\\" as: \\"It really has a Marie Antoinette-ish ring to it. \`Let them own capital!'\\")Lou's programs are complex and require professional intermediaries and their advisors. The ESOP and all the other \\"_SOPs\\" involve creating trusts and intricate financing negotiations and documentation. There is clearly a role for investment bankers and their lawyers. Direct offerings rely on simple structures that have been used for centuries. We have demonstrated that they can be done without these financial engineers and sales forces.These differences do not detract from the benefits that I and many others have gotten from Lou's writings and examples of his theories in action."},{"Title":"The Capitalist Manifesto","review":"This is one of those books that need to be read from front to back.

I had a difficult time deciding whether to rate it a three or a four. I finally decided on three because, while it is an enjoyable read, it is not one of his best. Those who read and enjoyed the author's last book, \\"From the Corner Of His Eye\\", as I did, will, undoubtedly, enjoy this one, though it is not as good. If it is a great book by this author for which you are looking, then read his latest book, \\"Velocity\\". You will not be disappointed.Here, this genre bending book, written with wry humor, has a series of subplots and colorful characters with improbable names that propel the story forward. Twenty-eight year old Michelina Birdsong is a young and beautiful woman with a troubled past. Living in a trailer park with her eccentric aunt, Geneva, she lacks focus and is overly fond of lemon flavored vodka. It is as if she has lost the will to live.When she gets new neighbors in the mobile home next door, one of whom is the precocious and physically deformed nine year, Leilani Klonk, her heart is touched most unexpectedly by the pathos of her young life. As Leilani is living with a drug crazed mother and step-father, a sociopathic \\"doctor\\" who may be a serial killer, Mickey finds herself wanting to make Leilani's life better and in doing so, redeeming her own. When Leilani and her family precipitously abandon their mobile home one night, Michelina, fearing the worst for Leilani, springs into action and finds herself in hot pursuit of this family, hoping to avert a tragedy.Meanwhile, a young motherless boy, who calls himself Curtis, and his dog, a Labrador with whom he has a most unique relationship, are racing away from their own potential Armageddon. This boy, too, is precocious and quite gifted, but seems to lack a true understanding of the ways and customs of those whom he meets. He is just a beat off. Still, while there is something odd about him, it is clear that, though he seems to have unusual gifts, he has a pure spirit and is a good boy running from a great evil. His pursuers, seemingly invincible and other worldly, will stop at nothing to get a hold of Curtis and keep him from his mission. The journey that Curtis makes is quite astonishing.At some point the paths of these main characters improbably cross and all is made somewhat, though not totally, clear. The book, which is an imaginative blend of suspense, science fiction, and bioethical philosophy, has somewhat religious or quasi-spiritual overtones, as it boils down to the quintessential battle between good and evil. In this book, Koontz continues on the path he forged with his previous book, \\"From the Corner of His Eye\\". To where that path will ultimately lead, however, remains to be seen."},{"Title":"Afternoon of an Autocrat","review":"For years this has been my very favorite book. I am not good at reviews so please bear with me. It starts out with one of Norah Lofts wonderful discriptions of autumn and old superstitions which are fun. The autocrat starts out on his last ride and it gives you a good overview of what is to come. There is also a delicious haunting which comes in from other books by Norah Lofts. This takes place on The Lady's Ride. My favorite character is Damask but the other woman character is also very strong and brave. Damask has an unusual gift. It is mildly scary for those of us who cannot stand big shocks to our system or the endless cuss words that so popular today. I fear now to give away things and so spoil the book. Its a perfect read for the month of October. Do join us on goodreads for the discussion of it."},{"Title":"Afternoon of an Autocrat","review":"I read this novel as part of a discussion led by Werner at the Goodreads Supernatural Group.I find it's interesting to read books by novelists who reach back in time to write about a former era. Hey, what can I say? I did it myself with Moonlight Dancer.I think of Nathaniel Hawthorne, a 19th century writer who focused on 17th century New England in The Scarlet Letter. (I still love that book despite Hawthorne's derision of women writers.) I think of John Harwood reaching from the 21st century back to 19th century with his gothic novel The S&eacute;ance. In a previous post I compared Harwood's depiction of 19th century female sensibilities with those of Wilkie Collins. You can read that here.Today, we have 20th century author Norah Lofts writing about 18th century Suffolk, England. The setting is a rural community beset with the forces of those who would enclose the common land (the landed gentry) versus those who traditionally had free access to the land in question (the farming poor).Our story opens with autocrat Charles Shelmadine as he travels the countryside atop Bob the horse garnering support for enclosure. It's a neat literary device as we thus meet our cast of characters: Damask Greenaway, her OCD evangelist father, Damask's love interest Danny, forgetful Mrs. Parsons et al. The author does a good job of world-building via a leisurely pace, not unlike trotting down country lanes with Old Bob, inspecting turnip yields and cobblers' kitchens. (However, I did find some of the Amos Greenaway church-building ruminations tedious.) Still, along the way author Lofts entertains readers with her gentle satire, a style reminiscent of Katherine Mansfield.All is torn asunder when Sir Charles dies (not a spoiler as this happens early on and sets the plot in motion). Enter spoiled autocrat scion Richard Shelmadine and his delightful albeit browbeaten wife Linda. Soon, Richard's dissolute lifestyle leads him to unsavory Mr. Mundford-he who neither ages nor loses at cards. Mr. Mundford and Richard explore the mysteries of Mithras worship much to Linda's dismay. Meanwhile, feisty Damask ponders a power all her own. The question is, can Linda put all to rights? My lips are sealed tighter than the underground chamber chez Shelmadine.Finally, the lives of the community members coalesce in a dazzling, blood-stirring d&eacute;nouement well worth the wait.And, speaking of endings, a cautionary note. Our intrepid leader Werner discovered that not all editions of this novel are created equal. Apparently, some budget-minded publishers decided to delete the last chapter in later editions. Quelle crime! Cursed affront to authors! So, if you buy or borrow this book, make sure Chapter 21 begins thus: On an October evening in the year 1798, Matt Ashpole drove home..."},{"Title":"Afternoon of an Autocrat","review":"I love the writing of Norah Lofts and own most of her books but this is my very favorite one. I really like the character of Damask Greenway. She is tough and mysterious. This is also about the time when land was being enclosed and Norah Lofts explains this very well. You learn much of the history of Suffolk. Its also a book that is full of the supernatural so a great read for October if you like something a little spooky.To know who haunts the Lower Road you will need to read Bless This House next."},{"Title":"Afternoon of an Autocrat","review":"1795 England, enclosure was a major issue. Charles Shelmadine had resisted it all his life, but after his death, his son, Richard, has the land enclosed. Damask Greenway is a major figure in getting the process done. The division of the 'Waste' is unfair and unreasonable to most. This book follows these familes through this troubled times."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"I picked up, Journey to Portugal, excited to find hidden treasures from Jose Saramango's expertise on his native soil, instead it was a flop.My expectations were high because Portugal has such a rich history of intrigue within its borders. Instead Saramango's reference to its Jewish and Moorish past was nonexistent. This is shocking knowing that he has won a Nobel Prize in literature. Yet the past in which Portugal was framed like its other Iberian neighbor was purposefully withheld?A man of letters such as Saramango must realize that this past, as dark as it might be, should be addressed. Instead only a few lines were devoted to its Jewish and Moorish heritage as if to say, \\"ah, they(the Jews and Moors) did not make a big difference here\\"Mr. Saramango, this is what makes Portugal what it is, your dark past, surely you of all men should know that.You should know that the Inquisition, persecuted men as yourself, men of letters, who were associated with Judaism! Men who escaped their past by becoming adroit at wielding letters, instead of swords.

The traveller visits the tiniest villages and melencholy ruins; discribing encounters with the inhabitants and recording his moods and dreams. A treat!"},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"I traveled much of Saramago's route over twenty years after he did. I am reading this book six years after my journey. I am delighted with his observations, and amazed at little some things changed in the years between our two journeys--there is timelessness about some of these places. It is, however, difficult reading. His habit of referring to himself as &quot;the traveller&quot; in nearly every other sentence really interrupts the flow and I can not read more than a chapter or two at a time without becoming so annoyed that I set it aside, only to go back to it the next evening. I'm now about three quarters of the way through it and will definitely finish it. Mechanically, it is much more difficult reading than his novels; intellectually, it is much less challenging.I don't think I would be reading this book if I had not traveled in Portugal, but I wish I had had it with me when I did make that journey. It gives an insight to the people, places, and history that I, as a non-Portuguese speaking foreigner, did not get during my own travels. It is certainly bringing that trip back to me and I'm enjoying his view of the places I went and am regretting missing the places I didn't have time to see. If I am able to make another journey in Portugal, this book will go with me."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"I am sure Saramago's tales are more lively than they come across in this book. Although I'm certain it was translated with care, the third-person narrative doesn't quite do it in English. I wish I had bought the Portuguese book and worked my way through, it is surely more lyrical and less clunky than this version."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"I eventually struggled through to the end of \\"Journey to Portugal\\", more as a duty than a pleasure. After the first third, the sameness of the descriptions of churches, buildings and art works became a bit boring.Sarmago certainly writes with insights that would resonate with readers who are familiar with the history, culture and art works of Portugal. I am not, so many of Saramago's allusions and comments on the churches and buildings he saw were opaque to me.Having read (and reviewed) \\"Seeing\\", \\"Blindness\\" and \\"The Cave\\" by Saramago, I was a little disappointed at first with \\"Journey to Portugal\\". However, my disappointment was relieved by beautiful passages sprinkled through the text.Saramago was born in Portugal and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998. \\"Journey to Portugal\\" is nominally a travel book, but of a special kind: it describes spiritual as well as spatial journeys.The book is written in the third person, with Saramago referring to himself throughout as \\"the traveller\\".Reflective travellers will understand when Sarmago says \\"...when the street descends once more to the old cathedral so does the rain; it overflows the gutters and, as one idea follows another, the traveller remembers how the waters of the Minho ran down the hard shoulders beside the street, how small the world is, all its memories jumbled together in the minimal space inside the traveller's head.\\"He also gives beautiful little word pictures of the lives and people he encountered on his journey. These are the real gems in this book, and why it is worth reading.In one especially memorable story (\\"The Man Who Could Not Forget\\") Saramago gets into conversation with the waiter at dinner about his travel plans and learns that the waiter was born in Cidadelhe, one of the small, remote villages Saramago plans to visit.Many years ago, when the waiter was a child, his sick young sister died on the way to get medical help, because none was available in their impoverished village. The waiter has never forgotten this family tragedy. His emotions are still raw as he talks to Saramago, who asks the waiter to come with him to the village and show him where he lived.Saramago concludes thus: \\"The traveller returns to his room. He spreads out his big map on the bed and looks for Pinhel. There it is, and the road which heads off into the hills. At some point in this space a seven-year-old girl died; then the traveller finds Cidadelhe, on the heights, between the Rivers Coa and Massueime, it really is at the ends of the earth, the end of life. If there is no one to remember.\\"The book resonated with me for another reason. To quote Saramago: \\"The traveller preferred to admire the late afternoon gazing down towards the River Torto . . . . and then spent a long while leaning back against a wall . . . because from behind it there wafted the most exquisite perfume of flowers . . .\\"Far too often in our travels we are driven onwards by an inexorable schedule that allows little time to stop and actually enjoy moments such as Saramago describes."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"Those who have some affection for Portugal (like myself) will enjoy this book. It is not a travel book, rather, it's a collection of thoughts and rather low-key experiences that the author has while traveling through his country. The travels, and the writing of the book, took place over twenty years ago, and many changes have taken place since that time. Nonetheless it is still an interesting portrait of a place that I find fascinating."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"This is Jose Saramago's spiritual journey through (primarily rural) Portugal. It's not a light-reading travel narrative. The feeling of this book is something of a cross between Henry Adams and James Michener. It's a book to read slowly and savor, in order to appreciate Saramago's tremendous metaphorical skill. He paints the picture slowly, with deliberate brush-strokes that reveal the masterpiece when viewed from a distance.Yes, his descriptions of churches, winding roads, rain and his seemingly unconscious cultural insecurity (his came from a poor family and was not a university graduate) can become tedious, but that's only if you don't grasp the larger picture: Portugal is a settled land with hundreds of years of historic layers. Saramago wants to peel those layers back for you to expose the core. Only the reader can decide if he's been successful."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"A reminiscence of one's country through the eyes and mind of someone else's writing.

It is not filled with action, sex, violence, or touristic visions. It is neither efficient nor pragmatic. Nevertheless, Jose Saramago is a Nobel Prize Winner for good reason. He writes with a depth of feeling and intense love that cannot be missed. The translation loses, as most translations do, the poetic passions of the author. However, if one can accept a very different style of writing, one that is decidedly not British nor American, this work will indeed be a journey."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"We fell under Lisbons spell last April, so wanted more info on the magic.

Perhaps it suffers in Translation to English."},{"Title":"Journey to Portugal: In Pursuit of Portugal's History and Culture","review":"I am reading this book and am laboring through it hoping it will get to something interesting or useful because I am planning on traveling through Portugal later this year. So far it has been very boring. I don't get a great insight of Portugal's history or culture. It is mostly a travelogue of his town by town personal encounter with little to relate. So far its been very disappointing and I feel like its a waste of time."},{"Title":"Whiteout","review":"Anyone who likes mystery stories set in remote locations will find this one of the best books of this type.Harry Bowes, a representative from a manufacturing company, brings a hovercraft to remote Camp Hundred on the Arctic icecap. His initial intention is to demonstrate its advantages to the military in this unique location. Even before arriving at the base, he finds out how to deal with the bitter cold weather and how the people at the camp are isolated. As the story unfolds, Harry soon discovers that Camp Hundred, which is primarily underground and buried in the snow, seems to be having an unusual number of problems which suggest sabotage.Harry has his ups and downs with the military. At one point he and his hovercraft help the camp but then he is less well received. The author does an excellent job with the characters in the book, many of whom seem to have a real personality. He also does an excellent job in describing scenes depicting the deadly cold and isolation surrounding Camp Hundred. Noteworthy are the sections of the book describing action on the surface and the supply swing. The deep well for drinking water adds a lot to the story.Whether he wants to or not, Harry keeps getting involved with the problems of Camp Hundred. As he discovers things, he eventually finds himself a target and narrowly avoids disaster more than once. While the first part of the book is interesting, action increases later in the book as Harry gets more and more involved with the situation and action rolls towards finding the person and reason for the sabotage."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"Aliens are usually giant bears with human personalities...or giant cockroaches with human personalities, or giant somethingorothers with human personalities. In Black On Black and Stars over Stars, Kathy Wentworth has done something that few SF writers can: she creates two races of highly believable aliens, the Hrinn and the Flek...and she explores the issues of the differences in the minds of humans and aliens. Using Heyoka Blackeagle, the ultimate outsider, the Black on Black of Hrinn legend, who is raised as a Sioux warrior, and Mitsu, the human who is transformed against her will into a Flek hivemember, she explores what it is like to be human...and what it is like to be &quot;other.&quot; The Hrinn are neither giant wolves or giant bears or giant wolverines...they are simply Hrinn. Their culture and their personalities are clearly and carefully drawn. So are the Flek, which Wentworth transforms from a faceless and remorseless enemy into a people, worthy of protection and defense. This is a great read, as well as a deep well."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"It is no accident that K. D. Wentworth is a multiple Nebula Award nominee.In other hands, STARS OVER STARS, the second installment in the Heyoka Blackeagle saga, could be just what a surface reading suggests: an exemplary example of a military sf novel. In Wentworth's hands, however, STARS OVER STARS becomes much more than a straightforward non-stop action adventure. Layered into the straightforward oft-told tale of a group of military trainees learning to work as a team are two major themes Wentworth deftly explores.The book opens with Heyoka trying to train the first Ranger recruits from Heyoka's native planet. The new recruits, like Heyoka, are Hrinn, seven-foot tall furry wolf-like aliens. Unlike Heyoka, they were not raised in Human society and so are having difficulty adapting to Human standards and customs. Wentworth masterfully plumbs the social dynamics of the canine-like pack society of the Hrinn. Other authors might have stopped with this wonderful accomplishment, but Wentworth uses it as just the wedge to pry open the real themes of the book.Beginning with the struggle of the rebellious Hrinn recruit Kei, and continuing with the inner anguish of the Human Ranger, Mitsu, Wentworth explores the twin themes of self-identity and where that identity fits within the larger social group. Wentworth never preaches it, never blatantly hits the reader over the head with it, never for one second stops the seesaw planetary battle, but each character in the book goes through the struggle to find self and to find one's place in the larger group: Kei; Mitsu; Heyoka himself; the treacherous Skal; the priestly Visht; the cull Kika with her secret. Even the gentle insectoid Laka and evil Flek characters go through this inner journey: Fourth Translator and Second Breeder, World Architect 459--no character is immune. Even whole societies must face the change these questions bring.STARS OVER STARS offers its readers what a good military sf novel should: carefully crafted alien cultures, detailed small-unit tactics, an endorphin-draining frenetic plot. Yet, with Wentworth's buried twin themes, STARS OVER STARS has a resonating depth to it that gives its readers that extra kick only a great novel can give.Whether as a standalone or as the sequel to BLACK/OVER/BLACK, read K. D. Wentworth's new STARS OVER STARS."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"On the planet Oleaaka, Ranger Sgt. Heyoka Blackeagle, a lupinoid hrinn who was raised in the Restored Oglala Nation on Earth, is struggling to make a going concern of the first integrated human-hrinn Ranger unit. The hrinn are fierce fighters, but they have absolutely no concept of chain of command and hate sitting around and waiting to get in on the fight they've been promised against the insectoid flek. Heyoka's second and longtime partner, Cpl. Mitsu Jensen, is still recovering from the brainwashing she endured as a flek POW. And Oleaaka has what everyone assumes to be a native species of its own, the laka, who supposedly--nobody yet understands how--drove the flek off 48 years ago. Entirely by accident, the Ranger unit discovers a hidden flek transport station, and everything starts going downhill from there. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the multiple pov's may be a bit hard to follow--we get the chance to see through the eyes of just about everyone, from Heyoka and his kinsman Kei to assorted laka. But what makes the book work, like its predecessor, is Wentworth's amazing ability to put herself into the skins and minds of her nonhuman characters and portray them as true aliens, with their own cultures, concerns, and convoluted ways of thinking. In the end there's an opening left for yet another book in the series, as Heyoka's unit literally saves the day (it's been two years since the book was published; I can only hope that the author is putting the finishing touches on the final conquest of the flek!). Of course, I knew very early on that Heyoka was going about his program the wrong way, but given his raising that may be inevitable, and at least he realizes eventually that he can't, and shouldn't try to, make hrinn into carbon copies of humans. At the same time, his weirdly assorted group wouldn't survive if it hadn't had *all* the beings in it that it does; each plays an important role in the final triumph. Excellent military sf and a vivid portrayal of an alien, yet ultimately comprehensible, people."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"There has been a recent fad in the US for pet wolves or wolf-cross dogs. The owners of such animals will explain that they are perfectly tame and can safely be allowed to protect and romp with children. The problem that many of these people fail to recognise is that such an animal may be tame, but is not domesticated like a dog, who has thousands of generations of genetic coding behind him that tell him humans are boss, no matter what. To the wolf or wolf-dog, the human is boss only so long as he remains strong in the wolf's eye, remains worthy to be alpha male of the pack. All too often, the owners of such animals find that they do something totally natural... which the wolf interprets as a sign of weakness, and the wolf makes his move to be alpha. Among wolves, this is a natural occurence, and, as soon as the weaker animal submits via body language, the other animal is genetically programmed to literally be unable to continue the attack; but if the weaker does not submit, the stronger will kill it. Humans, unfortunately, cannot signal submission in the proper mode, and so the owner suddenly finds his pet trying seriously to tear out his throat and may or may not survive, but will certainly be hurt.So what has that got to do with a science-fiction review?The Hrinn, an alien race who make up rather more than half of the &quot;good guy&quot; characters in this book, are basically seven-foot-tall wolves with double-thumbed hands. Their society is organised along the lines of the Terran wolf-pack, and they have the same built-in dominance/submission reflex to determine packleaders.They also have the ability to &quot;blueshift&quot; -- basically to shift into a hyper-metabolism state in which they literally can move faster than human eyes can perceive. The time they can blueshift is, necessarily, limited by available energy reserves stored within their bodies, and too much blueshifting exhausts them or, in extreme cases, can even burn out the ability to blueshift.Which is what happened on a previous mission, to Heyoka Blackeagle, a hrinn raised on Earth by a human -- an Oglala Sioux. (That would be in &quot;Black on Black&quot;, the prevous book by this author)Heyoka, along with a human partner, is assigned to teach an experimental Ranger team composed of mixed human and hrinn personnel how to work together in a military structure in order to fight the insectoid flek, a race that lands, kills off the local inhabitants, and then transforms conquered worlds to match their smoky, heavy-metal rich homeworld.The problem is that native hrinn, raised on their homeworld in their native society, cannot or will not set aside their natural dominance/submission instincts, and cannot seem to learn the human concepts of obeying orders not because the person issuing the order can kill you if you don't but because he is in command. They also have no concept of military strategy, being suublimely confident that nothing can stand up to them head-on. Oh, and they regard humans as inherently weak and inferior and not worthy to command because they cannot blueshift.So, here on a world that the flek began to &quot;terraform&quot; and then, for no known reason, abandoned, this ill-conceived and inherently unstable military unit is training and doing maneuvers.And then someone discovers and accidentally activates, a flek transport grid that beings the flek's attention back to the world, as the hrinn/human interface begins to fall apart.Meanwhile, over in the communities of the laka, the natives, yet a third story strand begins, as something is going wrong with the attitudes of some members of the thoroughly-controlled, rigidly-structured laka society... some of the breeders are beginning to remember racial memories of &quot;fighting&quot; and &quot;attacking&quot;...All three strands will eventually come together and form a pattern -- an aspect of hrinn religion says that all of life is controlled by patterns, and the current one may well be &quot;stars over stars&quot;... if anyone can determine what it is and what it means.Another reviewer apparently compared the previous book in the series to Heinlein's &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot;; having not read it, i cannot speak to that. However, what this book rather more reminds me of is a typical Andre Norton &quot;juvenile&quot; from the same period -- a world that is essentially a puzzle set for a relatively young protagonist who discovers that he is, somehow, the focus of Great Powers which he must learn either to control or to avoid in order to solve the riddles he faces and save the situation in the end.Done well, this is formula almost always yields a strong story. While not up to Norton's level yet, Wentworth gives us a generally-satisfying tale that, while it may disappoint in some ways (i have a few problems with the whole concept of the hrinn as a race, which cost the book at least one star in my rating) still pretty well delivers on what the author intended.I shall probably make it a point to read the next volume, in order to see if Wentworth can keep things together and moving forward."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"K.D. Wentworth's fast-paced (and beautifully written) \\"Stars over Stars\\" has to be one of the weirdest, and yet most fascinating, contributions to the \\"military\\" science-fiction subgenre.A sequel to \\"Black on Black,\\" it contains a veritable cornucopia of whacked out humans and aliens. The fun starts before you even open the book. Look at Patrick Turner's brilliant cover, which shows a wolf-like biped (Wentworth describes the critters as wolf-bear-cat combos, but never mind), clearly male, looking over his shoulder at a tiny human woman, who looks as if she'd rather be anywhere else than where she is (they're framed against a background of crystals--you'll soon learn why) while toting so many guns and ammo that it's unlikely she'd have a chance to use any of it before being toppled over by anything incoming. And she seems quite aware of this. \\"What am I doing here, with this big bad critter?\\" she seems to be asking. (And maybe you will be too.)The lupine is Heyoka Blackeagle, a member of the race of Hrinn who have definite issues dealing with authority figures and chains of command (they're used to solving disputes the way Earth's wolves do), who serves as a sergeant in the human-led intergalactic ranger corps, and the woman is Mitsu Jensen, his corporal. Jensen has just recovered from having been brainwashed by the insectoid race known as the Flek (the story told in \\"Black on Black\\"), and the still unstable woman thinks she sees them everywhere. But they've abandoned this planet, which is now occupied by the peaceful Laka (who also seemingly have all sorts of mental problems). The possibly still-addled Jensen seems unable or unwilling to tell the difference between Laka and Flek.And then, just when Heyoka and all the other members of the platoon are convinced Mitsu's brain is indeed seriously fried--yep, here come the Flek themselves. And then things really go bananas, as the tale tumbles on in a multiple POV fashion (all the significant characters get at least one turn at bat). The details of the tumultuous efforts to keep the planet Flek-free will not be divulged here. See for yourself.A great piece of work. More please!"},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"Having read K.D Wentworth's BLACK ON BLACK, I kniew what to expect -- somewhat. This time she focuses on three alien species, not counting the humans, and brings them all off well. She has the ability to make the reader care about even minor characters. The story is pretty traditional SF again, which is not my preferred reading, but Wentworth's book kept me up late at night after I should've gone to sleep &quot;just gotta finish this/the next chapter.&quot; While not perfect, this is a very good read."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"Oh, wow.That seems a little inadequate for a book which kept me up past midnight just to finish it. Kathy Wentworth has a real gift for bringing situations and people to life, including even the sketch-glimpses we get of the flek, and the color-sketch of the Laka.I really liked the development of character in this book. Blackeagle and Mitsu both overcome major limitations in their mind-sets and grow to meet new challenges, and I had a lot of fun following the ways events kept backfiring on the flek. Even the minor characters such as Kei were worth knowing, and it was fun watching each of them deal with the mess into which they were pitched.About the only negative comment I have is that the cover isn't nearly as good as the one for &quot;Black/On/Black&quot;, which was much more evocative. This cover is truer to the content of the story, but definitely not as much of a sales point. I bought the dead tree &quot;B/O/B&quot; on the basis of the cover alone, then got blown away by the story in that book. You don't, by the way, have to have read the first book in order to follow this one, but you'll have a lot of fun if you do.I sincerely hope this won't be the last we see of the *Avalanche/In/Motion* pattern that are Heyoga Blackeagle and Mitsu."},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"Dear author of \\"Stars Over Stars\\",Have you considered having your work edited?

Heyoka has \\"Other\\" inside of him, that is not human.4. Heyoka feels guilty for Mitsu.5. Heyoka feels guilty for not interfacing furballs into the military better.6. Mitsu is crazy.7.

So I bought it. The book starts out rather slow and if you have any military experience you will really get annoyed around half-way through the book. I do not expect a Master Sergeant to make rookie mistakes, seeing one make them was a sign that the author really has no exposure to such people.The book does pick up again as it goes on, but there were still a lot of issues she did not explore that she (IMHO) should have gone into more. The hero really knows nothing of his people, at this point he's spent some time with them, but still not enough to understand them or come to grips with what they are and what he is. I think if she had played that angle a bit more over making military people like what you see in newer hollywood movies and TV shows, it would have been a much better book.(The Rationale 'we can't afford to get rid of him because we're too few' while employed often in movies has never once been employed in combat, if they're not on your side, they're gone.)"},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","review":"A delicious read!

Mitsu who'd been brainwashed to believe she was a Flek spy drone suddenly having flashbacks and seeing Flek where others say they aren't.The individual Hrrin finding their place within the pattern of Stars Over Stars and how they come to finally understand that they do have to adapt to some of the human ways of thinking, how some of those human ways just won't work and a need to hold to tradition...The Flek and the Laka as a people then just a faceless, remorseless enemy.For Space Opera, this is great.

Liked it alot, and that's saying something - i started to run out of things to read, and have been searching desperately ever since seventh grade. i'm in high school now, and i really enjoy this book and was glad that i found it. unfortunately, lack of a credit-card, birthday or other holiday which results in gift-cards has prevented me from getting my hands on the first one (a repeating mojo for me) and i would appreciate if amazon.com could put one of those cool \\"Look Inside\\" things on the first book so i could have a sneak peak.this book was great; don't be afraid to take the advice of us ppl putting it out there on the post-it, i know i was but i don't regret getting this book, and it's been almost a year since i bought it.it's an awesome story that keeps you hooked till the end, with lots of interactions and different points of view to spice it all up, esp. with a couple of action scenes and a small surprise for all of you who kept up with the first book and were worried about Heyoka's . . . condition.a small plea to the author - i noted the dates for publication from your first book to the second . . . will we have to wait till 2003 for the next one?

What a lively and colorful culture! If you want to get a sense of life among Puerto Ricans in the 1960s who exist low on the economic scale, this book will tell you everything you could possibly want to know about their individual lives from their perspective.

Every day I looked forward to &quot;living&quot; with this family."},{"Title":"La Vida: A Puerto Rican Family in the Culture of Poverty--San Juan and New York","review":"I recently returned from Puerto Rico and on my walk up the coast to old San Juan saw a jagged hillside on the beautiful ocean filled with cardboard homes built on slopes and stilts. It struck me as very odd; the gorgeous Ocean with this somewhat small enclave of slum housing... surrounded by the beautiful streets and history of old San Juan. I then saw two little girls in Catholic School uniforms, giggling and running down to the steps into the Slum. I asked a travel partner who explained that the place the little girls were running to with the windows that were open holes, the trash and bums in the alley, was one of the most notorious slums around; La Perla.I left Puerto Rico with the thoughts of my wonderful hotel and gorgeous dinners but I could not get the picture of La Perla out of my mind. It was such a strange sight; again a slum of all slums on one of the most goregeous pieces of world I've seen. I became enthralled and interested in what made this small piece of the earth they way it was. In my research, I came across Oscar Lewis' study of this place. Interestingly enough, he wrote it in 1964.... and it seems this small slum hasn't changed at all since then.I am about a quarter through the book and am absolutely enthralled. The tragedy of poverty and how it repeats itself is evident very early on in this study.The main character, Fernanda, (Nanda) a child of poverty of which this story begins, goes on in interviews about her life. From her childhood, being at first abandoned by her Mother then to reuniting with her Mother, all the while being abused physically and emotionally by all in her life. She becomes a \\"bride\\" at 14 having a child thereafter by a man her mother 'adores' and yet her beats her. This is normal life.Nanda's children lives are also captured in their own voice with an earily similar account. I've found myself confused... thinking I've already read passages... I have but it is of other characters in the study. Poverty breads poverty.I'll let you know what I think when I finish the entire study; it is detailed and intense."},{"Title":"La Vida: A Puerto Rican Family in the Culture of Poverty--San Juan and New York","review":"This book really touches a nerve amongst Puerto Ricans (como yo). I've entered into numerous discussions and been hit with many opinions on this book. Many feel Lewis has a motive in focusing on the ugly, and even call it racist. I think we confuse ethnic stereotypes with economic stereotypes. I found it a bit redundant though. I had some trouble keeping track of the characters as every female is a child-beating prostitute and every male is a wife-beating drunk, and found my interest waning by about page 400 of this 667-page book. The first half was interesting and heart wrenching. And of course there is the issue of the foreigner airing the dirty laundry that a lot of folks don't like. Probably the same way Jews don't like people talking about atrocities being committed in Palestine."},{"Title":"La Vida: A Puerto Rican Family in the Culture of Poverty--San Juan and New York","review":"A popular field of study in the l960s was the 'culture of poverty.' Anthropology had the advantage of being familiar with such culture in most parts of the world. Lewis first wrote about it in Mexico.Five FamiliesWhen he turned his attention to Puerto Rico, he had a significant reputation behind him, and La Vida attracted much critical attention. It did not meet the high standard he set in Five Families, but the work is important because of Puerto Rico's centrality in New York as well as it being a part of the United States.Lewis' obvious empathy for his subjects while maintaining objectivity as well as his clear writing make the book well worth reading.ernestschusky.com"},{"Title":"La Vida: A Puerto Rican Family in the Culture of Poverty--San Juan and New York","review":"this is one awesome book! it's a classic read and gives you much insight on puerto ricans living in the us and how they deal with their daily lives. must buy!"},{"Title":"Dynamics and Relativity","review":"It says in the book review that this book is for undergraduate students.

He only gives a mathematical treatment of the laws of dynamics so that you have no idea what physics you are learning.Writing books like this and putting them on the market with the risk that a certain professor somewhere in the world might use them should be a capital offense. Look this book up in the library and once you're finished attempting to read it write a review about my review thanking me for saving you 70!! bucks.Buy understanding physics by Mansfield and O'sullivan instead.

I love his book, Buffalo Wagons, but if there's one that's nearly as good it's Texas Rifles.

In Kelton's Texas Rifles, we are presented with two variations on this. The first is a military man who's young daughter was taken by the Comanches and who exacts his revenge as he tries to find her. The second is a woman who was taken as a child and raised by the Comanches and is now being reintroduced to &quot;civilized society.&quot; Sam Houston Cloud, the man at the center of the novel, serves under the former and falls in love with the latter. This makes for plenty of dramatic conflict and character development, putting this a notch above the typical action-potboiler. But don't worry, there's plenty of action, too, and the book moves along at a good clip. Things get resolved a little too neatly, but the book was published in 1960, before westerns got literary.

My 5-yr old son begs me to read it to him and can read a little from the text himself. We like that it has 4 different, fun stories, each about one of The Dark Knight's traditional villains. My son likes the Catwoman story best - especially the passage where Batman announces over the police radio: \\"this is Batman! A police car has been stolen!\\" It is a quality product, well-bound hard cover."},{"Title":"Scholastic Reader Collection Level 3: Batman: 4 Adventure Stories","review":"My four year old son loves this book.

So I can read it to both of them!"},{"Title":"Scholastic Reader Collection Level 3: Batman: 4 Adventure Stories","review":"First off, my seven year old son is an above-average reader and way ahead of his peers in terms of reading ability and comprehension. When he chose this book I still thought it would be too difficult for him, or that he would lose interest because there is more text than what he is used to reading. Was I wrong- he took it to school and read it on the bus, after school waiting for the bus, and all day until he finished it. He loved the stories, and I thought the content was age appropriate for a Batman book. The stories are interesting and seem to capture his attention. I would recommend introducing this book to readers who are getting ready to start chapter books."},{"Title":"Scholastic Reader Collection Level 3: Batman: 4 Adventure Stories","review":"This is a great book for younger kids who love superheros--the stories are very entertaining but do not have the over the top gore of some of the more recent superhero stuff.

I read this to my 5-year old and 4-year old at bedtime, dividing the stories into episodes. It takes 5-6 nights to read the entire book (15 minutes per night) if you leave time for questions. And my two little detectives have lots and lots of questions.None of the stories are too dark for young Batman fans. There's a good mix of illustrations but not so many that the book turns into a comic book.As for the added value, older Batman fans will pick this book up again and use it as an early reader. This book will spend many years on our sons' bookshelf."},{"Title":"Yoruba Proverbs: Their Meaning and Usage","review":"This is the book I have been looking for my entire life.

It was there factionalism that created an identity and led to their defeat in 1948. This is a fascinating and well written book on the various factions among the Palestinian Arabs between 1918 and 1948. It deals with the late period 1939-48 primarily after the Arabs had been defeated in the revolt of 1936. Interesting work.Seth J.

This is good, because this way it represents what is really going on in personality psychology, instead of what has been going on. One might want a better integration, but this simply does not exist as yet. The two alternative books that one might consider (and there are only two of them) are &quot;Personality&quot; by Caprara and Cervone (social cognitive approaches are better represented but almost no biology at all), and &quot;Personality traits&quot; by Matthews and Deary (has a narrower scope). All other personality textbooks are just outdated (starting from the table of contents)."},{"Title":"Personality Psychology: Science of Individuality","review":"I have had an interest in personality for some time, but tired of books that seem to have simplistic theories based off 'folk knowledge' or just random speculation. MBTI theory is interesting, an (E/I)NFP myself, but this book was truly great b/c, as the authors state- Freud, Jung and others may have nice theories, but these authors are interested in the scientific approach- objective, tested by hard data, and controlled experiments. Not that the book is unreadable- I found it very easy to follow- and fascinating b/c - again- not just theories- but paradigms backed by experimental data. A must read for anyone seriously interested in personality!! Among the areas I found fascinating was the research on identical/fraternal twins reared apart/together to see the correlations btw the twins interests, career choices, extroversion etc...and tease out how much is driven by genes vs. nurture & choice. And the Big 5- the more scientific approach to arriving at and validating a view of personality akin MBTI. I read it cover to cover & enjoyed every piece of it!

The Cookie Book","review":"I've been baking cookies for over 20 years and never before have I ever come across a book as informative about baking cookies as this delightful book. This book helps explain why some cookies turn out chewy, and why others turn out crunchy. There are recipes for various kinds of chocolate chip cookies - classic, thin and chewy, thick and chewy, crisp and crunchy, double chocolate chip, peanut butter, etc. Apart from cookies, there are also recipes for biscotti, shortbread, macaroons and meringues, amongst others. This is not only a book for beginners, it is also a book for the cookie connoisseur."},{"Title":"Got Milk? The Cookie Book","review":"There are so many books about cookies that it's very difficult to tell what's good and what's not. Despite its simple title, I reach for this book when I'm in the mood to make cookies and/or have a question about them.Of course there is the requisite introduction on equipment, technique, ingredients and storage of cookies. Chapters here include an entire section devoted to chocolate chip cookies, based on whether you like them thin and chewy, thick and chewy, classic, etc. There are loads of variations on the different recipes, as well as helpful tips. There are also delightfully creative cookies like the stained glass cookies, which involve cutting out smaller shapes from a large cookie and melting hard candies inside them.I have not stopped baking from this book since I bought it, and every recipe has turned out beautifully. This book is recommended for beginners and advanced bakers alike. PS: The Utterly Buttery Shortbread recipe (pg. 61) is to just die for!)"},{"Title":"Got Milk?

It is smaller than some of the best selling cookie books out there, but I was very impressed. But I'd rather have a small book with great recipes and photos and cookies I'm interested in than a huge book with only a few good recipes. It is also informative about techniques and results; I learned quite a bit and I have baking books and magazines galore! The pictures are beautiful and so far the recipes have been great! Simple enough for beginners, but appreciated by this experienced baker. Money well spent!"},{"Title":"Got Milk? The Cookie Book","review":"What a perfect gift for the holidays!

Mocha Choc. chips, chewy cc, fudge tops, stained glass sugar cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies-- all easy- all a hit! Great directions and pictures too."},{"Title":"Got Milk? The Cookie Book","review":"This is really a little gem of a book. It has wonderful pictures and you can see they took their time to take care of the graphics (as usual with Chronicle Books).It is clear that it was written with the beginner baker in mind, therefore it is very easy to follow the recipes, but it is a nice addition to anyone's cooking library! It is divided into several chapters, each devoted to one kind of cookie, and the introduction to each chapter is really chockfull of information about the different steps of your creation, in fact they contain all the tips you ever dreamt of! Some recipes include interesting variation that you can easily try, once you get the hold of it. It includes all the classics (there is a section on Chocolate Chip Cookies and one on Shortbread, one on Meringues and Macaroons and more), so it is good for all those people that are looking for easy, foolproof recipes for the old staples (with a twist), but if you are looking for new original creation, you should think about something else.Personally I found great cookies, that got me a reputation as &quot;artist baker&quot; when I gave my creations at Christmas! The gingerbread cookies and the snappy sugar cookies were big hits, together with the chocolate swirl meringues (easy, really easy and yummy!)I'm really glad I found this book, as it has the no-fuss, super tasty cookie recipes I was looking for.

The Cookie Book","review":"My roommates gave me this book for my birthday last year (partially because they knew I'd love it and partially because they were hoping I'd bake every day). I was very excited because the cookies looked simple enough to make, but the pictures showed gorgeous cookies.I have tried quite a few recipes and they aren't as simple as I'd first thought. Many require a fair amount of time and effort, but if you're a true baker, you won't mind the bit of extra work. I also found that many of the recipes only produce 15-20 cookies and with the way my family consumes them, I have doubled many recipes.But what I really love about this cookbook is the variations on classics. There are tons of recipes for chocolate chip cookies depending on your preference, plus shortbreads, double baked cookies and much more. I highly recommend - but not if you're in a hurry."},{"Title":"Got Milk? The Cookie Book","review":"If you only want about a dozen cookies at a time, this is the book for you.

The Cookie Book","review":"I went by the reviews and thought I couldn't beat the price, but received the cookbook today and I was very disapointed. First of all, I like pictures of the cookies when I'm trying a new recipe, and most of the recipes have no pictures. Also, I love chocolate chip cookies, but do we really need 5 different recipes?? I did enjoy the little info given for some types of cookies, such as the biscotti. But all in all, would not recommend this book, too few recipes, no pictures, so glad I only paid 4 bucks for it.

I had to laugh to myself, thinking that me as a middle-aged woman must be a teenager mentally.

Cheers to Eddie Beverage, who knows his subject matter well and who writes with shocking overdoses of passion, purpose, and honesty.Beverage constructs a semi-autobiographical story involving chemically-enhanced Orlando teenage ravers. Nothing is so important to his characters as drugs, danger, and camaraderie. Sound a little familiar?You won't find any PC, &quot;all-American&quot;, leave-it-to-beaver crap in this story; only beauty attained through suffering, ecstasy and agony brought by chemicals, and the naked truths of life , maturity, and sexuality as experienced in the chaotic minds of this self-dubbed &quot;breakbeat&quot; generation. This is America. This is us. This is how we feel on drugs: homo-erotic, unloved, and insane.A must-read for all Americans either involved with or ignorant of the true history of the last ten years of American counter-culture. You are due for some fun and education and you will get it!"},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"To be honest, I have not managed to finish reading the book because it's self indulgent and dull. I have read the 'Ecstacy club' by Douglas Rushkoff and it's along the same lines as this. If you want to understand more about the rave scene, '200 BPM' definitely gives you an accurate picture of the drug scene - the immaturity of the ravers, the escapism, the pathetic search for the next high, the selfishness of party scene and the stupidity as people throw away challenges to face life's realities. If you want to read a good book, this isn't it. The hero wallows in his own self interest, with endless descriptions of his current altered state of being - hardly an interesting topic. You want to shake him and tell him to wake up and start really living life - have the courage to spend days and nights awake and fully conscious. I personally look for books in which at least the hero is inspirational in some way - this isn't that type of book. Definitely not for me."},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"This book was very compelling and Eddie Beverage when describing the graphic drug details was obviously speaking from experience, however the plot was predictable and the ending was very weak and disappointing."},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"In this short but action-packed novel, Eddie Beverage tries to counteract the popular media portrayal of the &quot;rave culture&quot; as mainly being about drugs, sex, violence, and a slacker ethic. What he succeeds in showing is that, in fact, the &quot;rave culture&quot; is about drugs, sex, violence, and a slacker ethic.And did I mention drugs?I can't imagine that anyone could find the protagonists in this book sympathetic, or even particularly interesting. Aside from the perfunctory declaration of peace, love, respect, etc., that is the pledge-of-allegiance-like mantra of the rave culture, these guys apparently stand for nothing except their own aimless self-indulgence and a voracious appetite for drugs, which they consume in endless quantities and varieties.Even the material about the music, which could have been the most interesting part of the narrative, is fragmented and perfunctory. The author drops a few names, provides some very basic descriptions of differing electronic music styles, and then quickly returns to his real focus, the drugs.The young people whose misadventures form the basis for the novel might easily have portrayed as confused and harmless, but Beverage actually shows them to be monsters of a sort. In one section, they invade a private home to use the telephone, but when the homeowner returns unexpectedly, one of the group, high on drugs (of course) beats the hapless gentleman into a coma with a golf club. The reader is &quot;relieved&quot; to learn, however, that the merry band of ravers escapes without arrest and then quickly forgets about the whole incident--hey, whatever!If Beverage thinks he is going to create sympathy for the rave culture through this kind of effort, he is mistaken. Actually, it would not surprise me at all if the book is a kind of put-on, a parody, or perhaps even something created by a member of the Christian Right in a &quot;mole&quot;-like attempt to make the rave culture appear far more dreary, corrupt, and hopeless than it actually is.The only reason I gave the book two stars instead of one is that I am guessing the book is the novelist's first book, and he should perhaps be cut a bit of slack in its debut :-)."},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"I would call this reality-based fiction. It is a fictional work (I imagine), but is based in the real life world of the underground dance clubs. This is a wild scene that Mtv and Madonna, with their poor attempts at techno music, have unsuccessfully tried to exploit for cash. The author here hits the mark where they missed - and vividly describes this environment as the setting for a really cool story of friends. I think the media and music companies are now downing techno and the scene, because they couldn't make $, and miss the point with the music and the culture, because it's not about idol worship and product placement, but about young people going out all night and getting crazy with the people that they love. Great job - Eddie! Amazon: Do you have anything else by this author?"},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"to compare this book to the Ecstasy Club is such an insult. yes the characters are self-indulgent. yes they're selfish, bratty and irresponsible. that's the whole point. does anybody get it? it's about what happens when youthful ideals and naieve blue-sky optimism are corrupted by drugs and greed. this is the dark side of the moon. explore it."},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"A modern 'Catcher in the Rye'."},{"Title":"200 Beats per Minute","review":"Eddie - I love you, I remember you as you were struggling withthe world, the book agents, st. martin's press, and raveculture.I remember your excitement in this publication 4 years ago.I remember reading your new manuscripts for &quot;Broken&quot; justlast year - and I eagerly await the release of your newbook.

Not what I like in Penny Jordan style of writing."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"I studied finance in college and I think I could have just read this book instead of most of the finance classes I took.First of all, \\"The Money Game\\" starts out with the thesis that the stock market and all other equity markets are just a game. It is not long-term investing that wins in this game for most. This would be heresy for most finance professors and financial planners out there. One example from the book involves a family that passed IBM stock down from generation to generation, it was only sold to cover estate taxes. Many members in the family became very wealthy. However, they worked just hard as their cohorts with no money, and the buy and hold stretagy profited them almost nothing despite the fact that they were \\"wealthy.\\" Another example is a man who died in the late 1800s with a portfolio worth over $1,000,000. By the time the inheretence was passed down, the portfolio was worth 0, as the companies had gone out of business.\\"The Money Game\\" gives a great explanation of crital issues such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, mass psychology, mutual funds and their managers, \\"performance\\" vs. more conservative funds, accounting practices, random walk theory, \\"valuation\\" of equities, and most importantly the money game itself.Ever wonder how a company like Priceline.com could be worth more than the market capitalization of all the airline stocks put together? This book explains how something so out of whack can happen and gives many examples.In this game, money is how you keep score. When someone is making lots of money, they are winning the game. When they are loosing money, they are loosing the game. But the game is there to be played, win, lose, or draw. For the players, it's just too tempting to stay in, it is vital, it is life for many."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"This is a great book on many levels, for both investors and non-investors.The setting is Wall Street in the late 1960s. Alcohol flows freely, and smoking is not taboo (don't forget about sex, these were the \\"Go-Go Years\\"). It is an almost exclusively male, smaller, whiter, and more white-shoe environment (most women in the book are referred to as \\"pretty young things\\"). Nevertheless, don't let the differences fool you; there are many things to be learned in this tale told from the inside.New York has come into its own as a financial center in the 1960s, and the electricity in the air is communicated through the pages. London, which was more of a co-equal in the prior, twenties bull market, is now a shadow, with Wall Street houses decorating their dining rooms with (page 223) \\"...paneling [that has] been flown over from busted merchant banks in the City of London...\\" The foundations of the confident World Trade Center are being drawn up. Older Depression-era Wall Street hands are still dominant, but as the Vietnam War hovers in the background, cracks in the establishment are beginning to show as twenty and thirty something \\"gunslinger\\" investment managers show up on the scene.Almost every major investment paradox or problem we face today is foreshadowed in miniature in this book. As a work of literature, it combines an engaging text with profound underlying meaning. The chapter \\"What Do the Numbers Mean?\\" on aggressive accounting was eerily prescient.The constant presence of John Maynard Keynes and Sigmund Freud as background figures to the culture of the times left an odd taste in my mouth, but the author (George J.W. Goodman, writing under the pen name \\"Adam Smith\\") never missed a beat in deftly applying their insights to the world of finance. The book has a strong undercurrent of behavioral finance, but it's about much more than that. There's a lot of humor, but there is also tragedy, when he recounts the tale of burnt-out and broke ex-millionaire Harry (many names are changed in the book to protect anonymity):(p. 93) \\"Time is getting shorter,\\" Harry said. \\"I'll be forty soon. You have to do what you're going to do. All professionals use leverage. You have to, or you end up just another face in the crowd, someone who worked on the Street thirty years and saw a lot of markets and retired with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars. That's no reason to be on the Street.\\"(p. 96) \\"[Goodman comments on Harry's misfortune] We all know what a millionaire is, and when the adding machine says, \\"$1,000,000,\\" there is a beaming figure facing it. But when the machine says 00.00 there should be no one at all because that identity has been extinguished, and the trouble is that sometimes when the adding-machine tape says 00.00 there is still a man there to read it.\\"Read this book, whether you are an investor, English major or engineer. You'll get a lot out of it."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"I've read hundreds of investing books; skimmed hundreds more; even written one myself. But dare it be said: This beautifully written work may well be the best book on the subject ever written. Not because it covers everything, or promises to make you rich. But because it offers timeless insights into how players, amateur and professional, really do play the game, and thereby gives you rich food for thought on how, or whether, you should play. Sure, you won't find anything on program trading, IRAs, 401k's, the great fund boom, or dot com stocks. However, that just goes to show that you needn't read today's papers to truly learn today's market. A bestseller in its day, there is still something for everyone here.

The book's content actually came from a group of (in)famous essays submitted by the fictitious Mr. 'Smith' to a variety of financial publications during the Fabulous Go-Go Years which spanned from about the mid-1960s to early 1971.In this book, we see the market revealed for what it truly is. All markets consist of people, and contrary to popular belief (and all common sense), not all people participate in financial markets to make money. Such insights make up the core theme of the book, and Mr. 'Smith' explores this theme in detail in the first part of the book. While it is true that many people do come to the market to make money and hopefully get (filthy) rich, and equally true that most people exit the market chastened, embarassed and with empty pockets, wallets and bank and equity accounts, most secretly approach the market as either a diversion from an otherwise staid and desultory life, a form of entertainment and excitement, or as some sort of perverse challenge. The truly successful in the marketplace, however, approach it as a game, like any other, and as such have acquired a philosophical outlook on the markets and life. As such, shades of Nasim Nicholab Taleb's remarkable financial book, Fooled by Randomness, resonate with particular force with this book. Thus, Mr. 'Smith' admonishes the reader to understand our reasons for participating in the market, and along the way, he divulges the real secret to getting rich in the stock market (besides either running the market or being some sort of middleman in the market). Mr. 'Smith' also admonishes potential players to look upon the market as a Game (with a capital 'g'), and this particular insight makes for the second major theme of the book. Here he relies on the words of Lord Keynes and the legendary founder of the Fidelity Group for support.In Part Two of the book, he puts both ivory tower foolishness and market foolishness to the test, and as most intelligent readers might accurately guess, both fail spectacularly. Based on his treatment, we learn that the random walk theory and the Dow theory share opposite sides of the same coin. Adherents to one or the other champion them with equal fervor (and trash their counterparts with the zeal of religious fanatics), and while one says that prices can be predicted from the past moves, and the other says no such luck, both profess to be the one true path to riches. Part Two really gets to the heart of investing. Who has the best system? It turns out that nobody does, and that is the central message, along with the fallibility of numbers, trends and past data (and the slavish and potentially bankrupting reliance on computers and programmed trading). All 'systems' for money-making depend on the analysis of the past to determine the future, and though this works well in the controlled environment of the science lab, it fails spectacularly in the uncontrolled marketplace.In Part Three, Mr. 'Smith' paints a disturbing picture of professional money managers. The reader gets to see the pros in action, and even though the pros have more money and information, they too often act as clueless as the Little Guy whose money they take and quite often berate. Part Four of the book allows us to partake in a little roasting of the financial doomsayers, ever-present then as they are now, and always seeing signs of the Apocalypse in every upward or downward movement in one or more economic indicators. Here, Mr. 'Smith' reminds us that goldbugs and other fear mongering speculators and opportunists will always be with us so long as there are marketplaces in which to trade.Part Five winds up the book, and Mr. 'Smith' reminds the reader that in the end, the market and investing are best approached when looked upon as a Game. Whether it is the Go-Go Sixties or internet New Economy Nineties, the players and their passions, hopes, dreams and desires all remain the same. Change the names and the dates and you really couldn't say for sure if you were in one period or the other. The wise reader would do well to look inward first before making any outward financial moves going forward. Readers of this book who desire to learn more about the history and cyclical nature of business, industry, markets and money may want to read Devil Take The Hindmost by Edward Chancellor."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"I gave this book 5 stars for a few reasons, it kept me entertained, it is funny, it is very true, it also relates perfectly to todays markets and market participants.\\"The more things change, the more they stay the same\\" I don't know who originally said that, but it really does apply to the financial markets. The author paints a great picture of the markets during the 60s and you will have a hard time reconciling the fact that he is not talking about the present day.Its a good book and I recommend it highly for any investor."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"Much to my surprise, I find myself in agreement with a prize winning economist. (Paul Samuelson has dubbed The Money Game a \\"modern classic,\\" and it is).A brief but insanely great read, Adam Smith made me laugh out loud at least half a dozen times with his dry sarcasm and sardonic wit. If Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is an all-time ultimate classic for traders, then The Money Game is one of the all-time ultimate classics for investors.Written almost a decade before I was born, the book is just as relevant today as it was in the latter half of the sixties. The high flyers Smith writes about are so similar to those of the 1990's bubble, it is literally as if nothing but the symbols have changed (and perhaps the clothing styles). Sixties screamers like Brunswick and Solectron were bid up to hundreds of times earnings, then flamed out and fell through the floor with spectacular declines of 90% or more... just like the JNPR's and CMGI's and JDSU's of our more \`enlightened' age. The Great Winfield, master tape reader of his day, is the perfect 1960's equivalent to the dotcom daytrader banging bids on Island or Selectnet. The technical analysts of the sixties, with their punch cards and their vacuum tube computers, are in perfect harmony with the high powered number crunchers and stochastics trackers of today.And when Smith discusses the complete and utter wackiness of corporate accounting methods, complete with a hundred and one ways to massage earnings statements six ways to Sunday while technically remaining within the law, you would swear he is foreshadowing the fall of Enron. And of course there is good old John Jerk, proud representative of the uninformed public... buying high, selling low, and generally getting taken behind the woodshed, just as he still is today.The old hands are always saying that the game is the same. (Jesse Livermore said it 80 years ago... no doubt some ancient mariner passed such words on to him.) Young gunslingers and wet behind the ears traders nod and smile, because they know the old timers are wise--yet the youngsters are still nave enough to harbor doubts in the back of their minds as to whether it is true. Is the game really and truly always the same? Couldn't it be different this time? Couldn't it?The Money Game goes a long way in putting the question to rest. There is no way a book written in 1966 could sound perfectly suited to 2001, no way that bowling stocks and fiber-optic packet-switching stocks could give near identical performances under mania circumstances, unless the game is indefinitely, immutably the same.And why shouldn't it be? We can put a man on the moon, but we certainly aren't any more humble or mature than we were yesterday. Our collective knowledge may increase, but greed and fear do as brisk a business as ever.Bravo Adam Smith (or should I say George Goodman). I don't know if you are even still alive to read this praise, but your book is as fresh today as it was the day you wrote it."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"It is difficult to express in words what a joy reading this little gem was. Very little escapes Smith's survey of the market, its nature, its winners, its losers and (importantly) its dreamers. Smith's keen observations combined with his wry wit make \\"The Money Game\\" a pure pleasure. No, it didn't make me millions (it's not designed to), but the understanding I gained about \\"the game\\" makes it hands down the best work on the stock market I've ever read.To \\"useless book\\": come back to this book in a few years. What seems useless now will be gold by then."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"Written in the late sixties the book reflects its times in the boardrooms and trader pits of Wallstreet. Condesending toward women, hostile to ethnics and gays the book shows a somewhat rough hewn side of the men in the grey flannel suites. The game of generating money from speculation, mass physiology buttressed by modern economic techniques and monatorist policies could be taken from todays headlines. A very entertaining and informative book both from a historical and investing perspectiv"},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"A book written in the sixties, that just as well could have been written today (except for a few details). This is proof that most investment bankers and fund managers are complete morons, especially in the light that they haven't changed in over 40 years (same mistakes and bad attitudes year after year).This should be mandatory reading for anyone considering a glamorous career involving trading or any type of Exchange. If you are not into these kinds of fun, avoid it, as it probably will be very boring without some knowledge of how these markets works."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"Sophisticated or not, YOU NEED this BOOK !!A most creative piece of complete writing [ as real literature, an insider's nearly-journalistic report: if not how-to, perhaps how-not-to and here are you consequences; ]....Hard to imagine that the depiction of computer investing applications of 25 years ago would be insightful and contemporarily funnier than one can imagine.

And certainly the opportunity to do practically unimaginable things with it,Who would believe that the 'new economy', 'new concepts', 'nifty-fifty' go-go era of the previous generation looks like deja vu- all-over- again, with respect to hightech electronics and the 'net.If you're skeptical that anything THAT OLD could be applicable to our high powered nouveau 'we're- so- much- more- sophisticated', real-time capabilities, perhaps it's time for you to visit, or revisit...* the gunslingers of the past, barely out of adolescence- invincible and bulletproof;* the earliest portrayals of computerized trading, and finagling;* 'the Great Winston' and the Kids: you think 1000 x earnings, and dreams versus reality is a new- millenium concept? * 16th century tulips..It's inciteful, more sustainably clever and funny than the topic of wealth generation schemes should be possible...

This is probably what most people would say.But look in the abyss, and it looks back at you. Is the answer that they can't help but Play?--SC"},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"In this small, short, quirky, and often humorous book, Adam Smith covers such diverse subjects as crowd psychology, inkblots, and random walks with an irreverant and original point of view.Although this book was originally published in 1976 (and some parts as early as 1967), it still has a good amount of information that is relevant today and goes to show that the saying 'There is Nothing New on Wall Street' is as true today as it was then."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"As a teenager I read this book when it first hit the shelves. It started my early education in managing money and great nonfiction writing. The Money Game is a series of vignettes and stories about people trying to achieve fortune and fame and peace of mind on Wall Street. It is not a textbook, although you will learn the fundamental principles of fear and greed and the basics of investment strategies as told through a specific story or person.While The Money Game is a book about money, it is an excellent example of first rate nonfiction writing. In my own writing throughout a long publishing life in academic publication, I have returned to The Money Game for examples of well structured chapters and nicely turned sentences. 'Adam Smith' (the pseudonym for George Goodman) is one of the best writers I've encountered. His style is made more apparent through reading the following companion book to The Money Game, Super Money. If you read both books back to back, the structure and style jumps out almost like a teacher writing an equation on the board."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"\\"If I really had a system for making money in the market and it worked all the time, first of all, I wouldn't tell anybody and second of all, I would soon have just about all the money there is.\\" Adam Smith p. 122Thank you for being so honest. Amazingly this book has helped me more than all the other \\"How to make millions in the stock market\\" books I have read. It is well-written and filled with information, humor, advice and wisdom. It touches on everything from the fabled Mister Johnson (I have a strong suspicion that Peter Lynch got his inspiration for One Up On Wall Street from this book) to charting and random walk theory. The reader is encouraged to find his own trading style and use the wealth of information from the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"I have recently been reading books about investing written (or revised) before 1980. It is amazing what you can learn from history. Let me tell you, nothing is new in the investing world, at all, and this book really shows that. This is a great book that can really help provides perspective for thinking about contemporary issues, you should read it."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"A humorous but instructive read for anyone who's interested in the stock market. George Goodman's prediction of brokers going public did come true, for better or worse. The cocoa chapter will convince anyone to avoid commodities.Like others, I first read this book many years ago. I was wondering if I'd still find it as enjoyable and relevant as I did then. The answer is yes.The investing world has changed, of course. Huge conglomerates of unrelated businesses eventually broke up, for example, and we no longer have to wait for the morning paper to find out closing prices... in 1/8s. But the personalities \\"Adam Smith\\" introduces us to are a constant, still playing The Game, and his Irregular Rules still apply."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"\\"The Money Game\\" was a game changer for me. It helped me get my first job in the investment industry in 1979, and it has helped me to see my way through financial crises ever since.I first read \\"The Money Game\\" just before going to an interview for my first job in funds management. I got the job. Since then, I've re-read \\"The Money Game\\" several times, mostly during financial crises such as the 1987 stock market crash, the 1997 Asian economic crisis, the Internet bubble and again during the recent subprime mortgage debacle and European financial crisis.There are many insightful and quotable lines in this book. One of my favourite quotes is: \\"The identity of the investor and the investment decision must be coldly separate .... for the market has a way of inducing humility in even its most successful students ... you have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself objectively.\\"\\"The Money Game\\" is not a book about stock selection techniques, though the writer gives a witty overview of the main approaches. It is a book about market psychology. Reading \\"The Money Game\\" helps you cultivate the right mental attitudes to be a good investor. Written during the 1960s the humour is not always correct by today's standards. However, it is insightful, witty and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"This is a classic about the stock market and investing. George covers a breadth of topics in that area based on his insider experience. This includes the psychology of the investor (\\"you\\"), IT systems and their impact on the investing field, the professional money managers and their role in the Game etc. The concepts are introduced in an accessible, and often humorous style. While the author does not offer direct investing advice, he does expose what he calls \\"the biases\\" that exist in the market - that are essential to take into account to be successful together with good judgment.George is very successful at immersing the reader into the culture, the psychology and way of thinking that dominates the financial markets and its participants. While this book is dated, most of the concepts discussed still apply to the financial industry today. A recommended read for anyone looking to gain more insight into the Stock Market.Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1) \\"If you are a successful Game player, it can be a fascinating, consuming, totally absorbing experience, in fact it has to be. It it is not totally absorbing, you are not likely to be among the most successful, because you are competing with those who do find it absorbing.\\"2) \\"The irony is that this is a money game and money is the way we keep score. But the real object of the Game is not money, it is the playing of the Game itself. For the true players, you could take all the trophies away and substitute plastic beads or whale's teeth; as long as there is a way to keep score, they will play.\\"3) \\"In short, if you really know what's going on, you don't even have to know what's going on to know what's going on.\\"4) \\"You must use your emotions in a useful way...Your emotions must support the goal you're after...You must operate without anxiety.\\"5) \\"The strongest emotions in the marketplace are greed and fear. In rising markets, you can almost feel the greed tide begin...the greed itch begins when you see stocks move that you don't own.\\"6) \\"If you know that the stock doesn't know you own it, you are ahead of the game. You are ahead because you can change your mind and your actions without regard to what you did or thought yesterday.\\"7) \\"Who makes the really big money? The inside stockholders of a company do, when the market capitalizes the earnings of that company.\\"8) \\"What you want is the company which is about to do that (compounding earnings) over the next couple of years. And to do that, you not only have to know that the company is doing something right, but what it is doing right, and why these earnings are compounding.\\"9) \\"What I have told you is a set of biases so you can make your own judgement.\\"10) \\"It is an informal thesis of charting that there are roughly four stages of stock movement. These four are: 1) Accumulation: To make a perfect case, let us say the stock has been asleep for a long time, inactively trade. Then the volume picks up and probably so does the price. 2) Mark-up...Now the supply may be a bit thinner, and the stock is more pursued by buyers, so it moves up more steeply. 3) Distribution. The Smart People who bought the stock early are busy selling it to the Dumb People who are buying it late, and the result is more or less a standoff, depending on whose enthusiasm is greater. 4) Panic Liquidation. Everybody gets the hell out, Smart People, Dumb People, \\"everybody.\\" Since there is \\"no one\\" left to buy, the stock goes down.\\"11) \\"Does this mean that charts can be ignored? Perhaps charts can be a useful tool even without inherent predictive qualities. A chart can give you an instant portrait of the character of a stock, whether it follows a minuet, a waltz, a twist, or the latest rock gyration. The chart can also sometimes tell you whether the character of the dancer seems to have changed.\\"12) \\"The computer is going to sanctify charting. The Chartists are on their way.\\"13) \\"The characteristics of performance are concentration and turnover. By concentration, as I said before, I mean limiting the number of issues. Limiting the number of issues means that attention is focused sharply on them, and the ones that do not perform well virtually beg to be dropped off...Furthermore, you are going to be scouting for the best six ideas, because if you find a really good one it may bump one of your other ones off the list. Turnover means how long you hold the stocks...All that turover has doubled the volume in the last couple of years, and the brokers are getting very rich.\\"14) \\"The further we come along, the more apparent becomes the wisdom of the Master in describing the market as a game of musical chairs. The most brilliant and perceptive analysis you can do may sit there until someone else believes it too, for the object of the game is not to own some stock, like a faithful dog, which you have chosen, but to get to the piece of paper ahead of the crowd. Value is not only inherent in the stock, it has to be value that is appreciated by others...It follows that some sort of sense timing is necessary, and you either develop it, or you don't.\\"15) \\"The aspiration of the people are a noble thing and no one is against jobs. But it does seem easy to produce them with currency rather than productivity. Central governments soon learn the utility of a deficit. It is convenient to take the views of the economists who followed Keynes and spend money during recessions. There are even problems on that side of the equation, because even with the breadth of statistical reporting and with computer, speed, this kind of economics is still inexact, and the central government can find itself pressing the wrong lever at the wrong time.\\"16) \\"The love of money as a possession - as distinguished from love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life - will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.\\""},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"I found it a great book.it's not \\"technical\\", but showed me many new things and approaches to the market.it's not a novel, but I assure I laughed out loud in the middle of the night!it's not about \\"psychology\\", but the last chapter made me understand much more about my inner thoughts on me-as-a-trader than a whole book...I would recommend for the ones who, having red about ten books on \\"how to trade, and be a millionare....\\", would like to taste something different.but only if they like, also, reading good books."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"It's an actually must-read for all investors. This is an extreme excellent book and can be treated as one of the first pioneer books about behavior finance. All the ideas in the book are what behavior finance scholars try to model.

Moreover, George Goodman's witty nuances show that he knows economics much more than the average finance journalist. His descriptions of technical analysis and efficient market theory are superb... Perhaps most amazing is the similarity of the passages on the 60's high tech bubble to the late 90's madness."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"That's the beauty of this book, it's based on actual experiences of a Wall St Insider during the '60s. I have to give it 5 since there just not many investment related books out there that are funny, informative, and a good read."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"If you liked Livermore'sReminiscences of a Stock Operator: With New Commentary and Insights on the Life and Times of Jesse Livermore (Annotated Edition), you might like this book about the stock market from the late 1960s. The book certainly gives you a perspective of the markets at the time, written by somebody who probably considered himself more thoughtful/analytical than Livermore. The author is more analytical than Livermore, but not much. Most of the essays have a very smug style as opposed to curious. The book is written by somebody that was centrally positioned in the investment social network at the time. With such a position you get the conventional wisdom, which most of the time is fairly correct. However, it does not make for interesting insight. For instance we get the standard trashing of technical analysis without any curiosity whatsoever. I do not particularly like war stories, so I cannot say I enjoyed this book very much. However, the book is well-written and a minor classic according to some that I do not know. If you like war stories you will probably like this book. Personally, I would only consider this a two star book."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"This book is an excellent take on the Wall Street speculator-financial manipulator crowd as it existed in the late 1960's when the regulatory apparatus had not been captured/deregulated and was still in place to protect the \\"sober \\" people from the Wall Street crowd of projectors,imprudent risk takers,and prodigals,to use the description of the original Adam Smith.The only problem with this book is that the present day writer who calls himself Adam Smith does not cover the real Adam Smith in a satisfactory way.He does understand his Keynes from the expose made by Keynes in chapter 12 of the GT(1936) about the deleterious impact of the speculators on Wall Street on the economic prospects of Main Street."},{"Title":"The Money Game","review":"The book was written to summarize the experience of the 1960's.

The book doesn't offer a hint. The author tells about what technical analysts do, what fundamental analysts do, and how the random walk behavior of stocks thwarts both types of analysts. After reading this book, one would think the succesful investors just have a feel for &quot;the game,&quot; but the author does not do a good job telling the reader how the succesful investors apply technical and fundamental analysis. To be fair, he does mention some anecdotal reports of some investors, but he does not publish the record of these investors in a way that would make me respect their philosophies.If you want to learn how to apply analysis for making money in the stock market read Peter Lynch's books Beating the Street and One Up on Wall Street, read Malkiel's book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, read Jack Bogle's new book on mutual funds, read all of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reports, and subscribe to Outstanding Investor's Digest.The one interesting point in The Money Game worth learning is that corruption has ALWAYS been a part of Wall Street. All earnings reports should be taken with a grain of salt unless you're an expert in analysing them! Companies have been managing their earnings for decades!

This also gives a great meaning for faith. Noramary trusted God with her decision and though she suffered along the way, she was happy and blessed with a wonderful life. I would recommend this book to anybody with a interest for romance books!I know you will enjoy it along with the rest of the series.

Normary had no backbone whatsoever- first she marries someone she doesn't love to make her aunt happy, when she is already in love with someone else. It is said she does it out of duty, but what about her promise to the one she loved (Robert) that she would marry him? Didn't she have a duty to fufill that promise? After marrying a man she hardly knows, and falling in love, he gets mad at her for no reason and treats her horribly because of unfounded accusations. He doesn't even give her a chance. I think at the very end when they reconcile was rushed and unrealistic. If he wouldn't believe her before, why would he suddenly believe her then? I disliked both characters immensly, as one was a wimp and the other a hothead. Not a good combination. Hopefully the other books in this series will be better."},{"Title":"Valiant Bride (Brides of Montclair, Book 1)","review":"I read many of the books in this series when I was in middle-school, being obsessed with romantic & idealistic notions. I sat down to begin re-reading this cute series only to discover that it is still enjoyable, despite some of the rather simplistic ideas & scenarios. This book is great for reading in a couple hours, as well as being a sweet little twinkie.Noramary loves her childhood best friend, Robert. They intend to announce their engagement to their families once he has completed his education & is settled into his medical practice. However all of her hopes & dreams are dashed when it is discovered that her cousin, engaged to wed the handsome & wealthy Duncan Montrose, eloped with her French tutor. Having been raised by her aunt & uncle as one of their own, Noramary is requested to take her cousin's place as Duncan's bride in order to save the family's finances, as well as their dignity. Seeing no way out, Noramary fulfills her obligations, never realizing that it was in fact she that Duncan had desired ever since their first meeting, not her cousin. What follows is a series of events that would challenge even the most loving & devout bride, let alone a young girl still coping with the loss of her first love & effectively forced into an arranged marriage. Of course, it's all wrapped up quite nicely by the end, & one can hardly remember what all the fuss was about.Simple & sweet. If you're looking for a fast-food read, this is it."},{"Title":"Valiant Bride (Brides of Montclair, Book 1)","review":"To fully appreciate this book, one must be willing to step into a culture of a different time. The colonial setting lends itself to a story which shows self-sacrifice and redemptive love. The story of Noramary will make you cry, laugh, and smile. It is a story of true love. This romantic tale deserves more than one reading."},{"Title":"Valiant Bride (Brides of Montclair, Book 1)","review":"In the first book of the \\"Brides of Montclair\\" series, Noramary Marsh marries Duncan Montrose as a \\"substitute bride\\" when his fiancee, her cousin, elopes with another man.

Noramary is determined to put the past behind her and look to her future as the mistress of Montclair, and as Duncan Montrose's wife. She hopes she will find happiness and purpose in her new life.I would have loved this when I was younger, and, actually, I quite enjoyed it now. It's an interesting story, if perhaps a bit unrealistic--I hope--and although the heroine may be a little too good and too lacking in self-confidence, the characters are well defined. More importantly, this book made me truly feel emotions for and along with the heroine. It genuinely touched me.It's nice to have books about a romance that don't include anything more graphic than a passionate kiss--not that I'm a prude, but I don't feel like I need to read all the details of someone's sex life. Or maybe I am a prude. Either way, it's nice to not have to deal with it, because it means that what's really important is not the sex, but the love. This is a story about a couple falling in love. There are easy times and hard times, there is happiness and misery, and there is love. It's the kind of thing there should probably be more of.There was a lot of mention of Christianity and G-d. I could have done without that, but I didn't really mind it. Maybe this was written to be a Christian book (that would explain the lack of sex), although I don't recall there being as much mention of that stuff in the two other \\"Brides of Montclair\\" books I'd read as a child--of course, I didn't notice anything Christian about Narnia when I read it as a child either. Regardless, I didn't take it as preachy, because I think it's appropriate for people of that time period to be devout Christians and, moreover, to think about G-d more often than I assume Christians nowadays do.The only thing that bothered me at all about the book was the fact and the way that slaves were included: the heroine is introduced to the black household staff, who were described as \\"servants.\\" Presumably this term is a more child-friendly way of introducing the topic, which is in some ways admirable but in other ways a cop-out. I honestly don't know if it would have been better or worse to just call them slaves...I mostly wish that the issue didn't exist at all, but it's an unerasable part of American history. At the time and place that this story takes place, there was obviously slavery, and it would have been unrealistic and unnatural for there not to have been slaves in the story, but it still made me uncomfortable. What made me positively cringe, however, was the accents that the so-called servants spoke it. Again, this may have been realistic, but it was uncomfortable to read."},{"Title":"Valiant Bride (Brides of Montclair, Book 1)","review":"Granted this review won't be as &quot;great&quot; as the previous but simply put I love this book!! It's been some time since I first read this book so I'm going to try to give it the credit that it deserves.I was very young at the time when I read this book (I was around 12 years old) but I have to say that if I hadn't read Valiant Bride I wouldn't have read the other books in the series! As the previous person mentioned the book is very realistic, but that's what makes a wonderful tale! You feel what Noramary felt!A great book!! I have to admit I did cry at the some parts, but you just had too!

Still, in spite of it, Peart is a magnificent writer."},{"Title":"Valiant Bride (Brides of Montclair, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it was pretty sad.

And the woman, Noramary Marsh, seems to have to backbone in which to stand up for herself. She gives up the man she loves, Robert Stedd, to fill the spot of her older reckless step-sister,Winnie, who left Duncan Montrose for another man. She marries Duncan without a complaint to anyone because her stepmother wishes her to, and says she loves him. It is all just really unbelievable that she could get over her first true love so quickly.

I only wish I could re-experience reading it for the first time, and watching my life change as a result. A Call to Joy has in fact helped me continue to move forward on my journey ever since I first read it - two years ago.Matthew Kelly is an astonishing young writer, only 23 years old when he wrote this book. That alone should be enough to pique your curiosity about A Call To Joy. Further than that, he shares wisdom in this book that I can hardly fathom is gained in a single lifetime, let alone from that of a young man.Simply put, Matthew Kelly's writing is a lot like prescription lenses - he helps us see things in this world, in a practical sense, the way they are. In that, he helps his readers live their lives to the fullest. He strengthens our relationship with God, and gives us much needed persepctive on living in this day and age.I recommend A Call to Joy to everyone. It has the power to change lives. I truly believe that every word written in this book is the truth. Every word in this book is A Call to Joy."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"I was given this book to read by my father, who is a Catholic deacon. Since we don't share similar views on Catholicism, Christianity &amp; the church, I was skeptical. I became more skeptical after realizing this was written by such a young man from Australia who says that God spoke to him at the age of 19! But I continued to read &amp; became deeply interested in his writings. He shares a lot of the same thoughts &amp; beliefs that I do, but he is much better at writing these thoughts for others to understand &amp; apply in their own lives. While his application of these beliefs are more Christian-centered than I am, it was still very interesting &amp; similar to the ways I try to develop my own spirituality &amp; beliefs. I consider it much more universally spiritual than some other Christian-centered writers."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"A Call to Joy is just that-- a simple invitation to finding true happiness. Matthew Kelly empowers us to find that true and deep nugget of joy by simply becoming the person God created us to be. Simple, but not always easy. Herein lies the difference between this &quot;call&quot; and 99% of the other self-help/ psychology/ motivational books on the market. . . we can't do it alone. We shouldn't pretend that we can do it alone. Get God's grace. This is a great read for anyone seeking to get closer to God, even if you've never been involved in any organized religion. It will strike your core."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books! I've read it three times (so far).

This book will truly bless you if you allow it to."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"This is a spiritual gem. His other books -- I think his ego intrudes. But this book is from god. IMHO."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"Matthew Kelly's first book, Call to Joy, is a wonderful study of how God speaks to each of us in our lives and how we respond to him. Inspired by his own personal story of hearing God's Call to Joy, the author takes us through a spiritual journey that shares God's message in a straightforward way.I read this book entirely while sitting in my car during soccer practice, carpool, etc. Knowing the book was sitting in the car waiting for me encouraged me to leave early just so I could sit in the car and read for a longer period of time. Matthew's writing is beautifully comforting, peaceful, uplifting and encouraging. We can all learn to listen to God's call for our lives. If we make prayer a priority in our lives and put God first, we will hear the message of Joy that He wants all of us to hear.I'm notorious for talking a lot and constantly surround myself with noise throughout the day, so Chapter 6 - Silence & the Presence of God - really struck home. Matthew points out that silence is necessary to be close to God. \\"Silence increases our receptivity of God's grace.\\" Silence is something I struggle with.In addition to silence, we are called to put God first in our lives and use prayer to find joy. Prayer needs to be a priority every morning that sets our day in perspective, and every evening to reflect God's influence throughout the day.This is one of those books I want to reread every few years, because A Call to Joy is a spiritual exercise to enrich our prayer lives and bring us closer to God. Through his writing, Matthew Kelly teaches us how to recognize God's presence within us.A Call to Joy - Living in the Presence of God"},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"I've read several of Matthew Kelly's books and finally read this , his first. This book brings you to the beginning of his life changing experience with the Divine and makes you want to change your life too. For someone so young to be able to share his change of heart makes it somehow easier to start or continue foreward with your own journey of the soul. I've read and reread the book over the last several months and always glean new insights to help me on my journey. Following his guideline for silence and solitude has brought me so much peace, joy, and happiness, I want everyone I know and love to experience this incredible gift."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"The book is very well-written and organized. Clearly, the author has been blessed with insights uncommon for someone so young - or anyone for that matter. Probably because of his age at the time of writing, the principles he describes so well are not always extrapolated for the reader. I suspect his relative lack of worldly experiences just doesn't offer him the opportunity to apply his tenets to daily life. Where he did do so it made the foundation of the book so much stronger and applicable.This is definitely a reference book as well as a read through. One needs to read it with a highlighter handy."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"Matthew Kelly shares an inspirational walk with God and how to dilute meaningless &#34;stuff&#34; in our lives that keep us from being close to God. His insight to listening is very good - he hits the nail on the head. He also distinguishes the difference between blessings and what we Westerners perceive as our rights. An overinflated ego doesn't notice the miracles in life which keeps God's plan hidden. I shared this book with my 25 year-old son. He is reading a little of it everyday."},{"Title":"A Call to Joy: Living in the Presence of God","review":"One of the best books,great read,can change your life,if you apply what's in it,it will help you to find Great joy and inner peace."},{"Title":"Little Deaths: 24 Tales of Sex and Horror","review":"While many people know Ellen Datlow for her Fairy Tale series and her Years Best Fantasy and Horror collections, few people seem to have stumbled across Little Deaths, a true gem of an anthology.

This particular book is an assortment of stories dealing with sex and horror.In \\"Hungry Skin\\" by Lucy Taylor, a young woman finds there is more than meets the eye in her late, estranged father's erotic artworks, and eventually finds herself in them as well. A man desiring revenge on his ex-wife finds an opportunity in the form of a young prostitute with a familiar face in Harry Crews' deliciously cruel \\"Becky Lives.\\" Love and devotion among freaks is examined in Wayne Allan Sallee's \\"Lover Doll.\\" Dan Simmons takes us to frightening foreign lands in the chilling \\"Dying in Bangkok.\\" A traveling student learns the power of memory in Stephen Dedman's \\"The Lady of Situations.\\" And Clive Barker revisits a world from his novel 'The Great and Secret Show' as two rogues are enlisted to rescue a man from the dream-sea, in the very funny \\"On Amen's Shore.\\" (One need not have read the novel to understand or enjoy this story.)There are also memorable pieces from Pat Cadigan (another very funny story), Jack Womack, Nicholas Royle and Kathe Koja.Only a few are a bit weak. Richard Christian Matheson's entry, like most short-shorts, is unsatisfying, while Joyce Carol Oates' and Joel Lane's are relatively pointless exercises.Overall, a good variety of styles and content is represented here - subtle or explicit, from earthy suspense to happenings of a more surreal nature. There's probably something here for everyone. This is an exceptional collection worth looking for."},{"Title":"Little Deaths: 24 Tales of Sex and Horror","review":"Little Deaths gets its title from a French term for orgasm, le petit mort. But this collection of erotic horror misses the mark. Not only is the eroticism missing from many of the stories but the connection between sex and death, the supposed purpose of the collection, is sadly lacking from almost all of the tales. In many stories the two, if the exist, are completely unrelated, i.e. on character has sex and another kills someone ten scenes later.The final story by Dan Simmons is probably the best at sticking to the ideal theme of the book. It is not that the other stories are bad. No, many are really quite good and would have shone in an unthemed collection. It is just that I cannot see why the editor chose them for this particular collection. The opening story is supposedly the keystone and the first story chosen but it is lacking in death and pretty much devoid of horror. The characters are interesting as is the revelation but it just does not fit the bill.My advice is go ahead and read the collection, just skip the introduction so you won't be expecting something different. Then just enjoy the stories for what they are and don't worry about what they are not."},{"Title":"Little Deaths: 24 Tales of Sex and Horror","review":"While many people know Ellen Datlow for her Fairy Tale series and her Years Best Fantasy and Horror collections, few people seem to have stumbled across Little Deaths, a true gem of an anthology.

In part I got the book becasue I'd heard so much about erotic horror--but still wasn't quite sure what EXACTLY erotic horror is when I was done. Well, from a lot of stories in this book, erotic horror is men meeting dangerous women (or men), having sex (or bondage or something similar) with them, and then dying. Not exactly earth-shaking. This is not to say that I don't get the connection between sex and death and horror--because I do--but I don't feel this anthology states it in a way I like. So maybe someone else would like it. One story that stood out was Harry Crews' really nasty &quot;Becky Lives&quot;; a story that I didn't find erotic but did leave questions open... In Lucy Taylor's story a woman had sex with stone statues carved by her late father and THEN died. But while I can't say the anthology was BAD, I can't say it was all that good either. In the end, it just left me with no impression at all."},{"Title":"Little Deaths: 24 Tales of Sex and Horror","review":"I fount this anthology to be average.

I'm sure many might find it...nice. Just not me.What really bugged me was that the deck that arrived had several duplicate cards and was missing some cards entirely, even though still sealed. This, and the somewhat flimsy card stock told me that whatever job the deck's creator had done, no care had been taken by the publisher.

This is not another &quot;theme&quot; version of the Waite deck, rather, Genetti has taken a fresh look at the philosophy of Tarot to produce her deck. Vibrant colors draw the user in, and the cards are full of details which will generate new interpretations for many readings to come. The images are very diverse, drawing on many cultural, geographical, and spiritual correspondences. To allow the user more possibilities of interpretation, the pip (Ace-10's) cards have no humans in them. Court cards are identified as Prince, Princess, Knight, and Queen. For once, we have a book written by the designer of a deck which is concise rather than written in &quot;mystic-speak&quot;.

Immediately, my readings took-on an almost surreal depth that consistantly (and utterly) blows me - and everyone for whom I read - away.These cards are Art, with a capital &quot;A&quot; ... with a depth and humor that often brings joyful tears to my eyes.Alexandra is a sweet, good-hearted, talented, knowledgeful genius! I am honored by her presence (through this deck) in my life.Namaste, Alexandra Genetti!"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Change Tarot","review":"Initially I was a little ambivalent about buying this deck. The artist's style is much different than the styles that normally appeal to me, and I will warn that some of the human figures are annoyingly cartoonish. However, after working with the deck only a short time I'm already enjoying it tremendously. The illustrations are extremely complex visually and symbolically. Although the deck is for the most part bright and inviting, Genetti does not gloss over darker aspects of the cards. The perspective is vaguely Pagan, but Genetti draws her inspiration from a very eclectic mix of sources. The deck contains motifs from cultures all over the globe, both past and present. The majors are for the most part traditional, but there are some unique interpretations. The Devil is a Pan figure, and Genetti's take on the Chariot is very unusual. She took more liberties with the pip cards. Many have traditional or near-traditional meanings, but others have been significantly reinterpreted. The pip cards contain no humans, a convention I often find difficult deal with in a reading. However, Genetti's choice of symbols, such as halved-apples for the 4 of Disks or an oil refinery for the 6 of Wands, are so intuitive I'm finding them easy to work with. I also love the court cards. She uses the traditional titles of Prince, Princess, Knight, and Queen, but none of Genetti's court figures are the usual throned monarchs or horse-mounted warriors. Each one has a unique personality which is readily apparent by the context. The Knight of Swords is a scientist in his laboratory. The Queen of Disks is a basket weaver seated among a bounty of produce and farm animals. The Knight of Cups plays a saxophone outside a department store to collect money for the homeless. I would recommend the Wheel of Change to anyone looking for deck that utilizes a lot of modern or multicultural symbolism."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Change Tarot","review":"This is quite simply the nicest deck I have ever seen. And I've seen many many decks. I'm a professional card reader and this is the only deck I have in which every card speaks to me. In other decks you have a couple \\"uglies\\" or some cards that just are unpleasant. The \\"dark\\" cards in this deck like death and the tower still have power but they are beautifully rendered.The pips are the strength of this deck. Aside from the court cards, the pips have no people pictured. There are sea shells, dijeridoos, shards of glass, apples and assorted other objects to represents cups, swords, staffs and disks.If the style of artwork appeals to you, then get this deck. You won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Change Tarot","review":"I am a certified professional tarot reader, and I use these cards in my practice, regularly. They are one of my favorite decks. The art work is astounding! There is so much detail in each card, that you have to look at it for awhile to take it all in. At first it was overwhelming, but when I started to use them in readings, I realized how specific they can be for answers. My clients love the cards. There is such a variety of different cultures represented, that provides so much more material to add to a reading. I love that she chose to join together and unify all cultures/people. Yes, the card stock quality is poor, due to the publisher, but I don't love them any less. I looked at the book a little, and it seemed like she put a lot of time and passion into the writing of it, in addition to the already mentioned artwork of the deck. Give this deck a chance, and I guarantee it will grow on you. Btw, this is the only deck that I have, in which I love every single card, and my favorite is the Death card!"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Change Tarot","review":"I have had these cards for about two years and I continue to find new intuitive insights in them each time I read with them. The first nifty feature of this deck that I wish more artists employed is the color-coded borders so that one may see instantly how many Majors, Disks, Cups, etc. one has in a particular spread. Second, the art of the Majors and Court cards appears simple and almost primitive, but each card contains a wealth of symbolism, and I like the fact that the people represented on the cards are varied and interesting, rather than vapid Ken and Barbie clones. Many important images, such as the sea of stars veiling The Fool, recur throughout the Major Arcana, providing a consistent \\"narrative\\" thread to the Majors. Third - and by far the most striking feature of this deck - the pips are illustrated, but for the most part, contain no people, featuring instead pictures of bowls of grain, ants, crockery, toolsheds, wind mills, even a slain deer amongst an array of flint arrowheads. It's as if one looks through a window into an endlessly-varied landscape of interesting images to trigger a deeper reading than can be had simply by combining number and suit - yet they are not so limiting as fully-illustrated RWS-style pip card illustrations can be.If there's a weakness to this deck, for me, it's simply that I could not connect with the book or the author's interpretations, but your mileage may vary, as they say. Furthermore, it's a testament to the artist's talent and inspiration that she created a deck that could be used with great depth and success even by someone whose interpretations differ from hers as deeply as mine do. These images truly have a life of their own, drawing from a vein of meaning far deeper than one's political ideology.All in all, a wonderful deck, one that many readers will be able to \\"live with\\" over many years, all the while deriving more and more insight and better readings."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Change Tarot","review":"Genetti has created a wonderful new deck for students of Tarot.

When I got the deck I was overwhelmed by the 300 plus pages in its instruction book, but at the same time that was the sole reason why I bought it.I really couldn't read with this deck out of the box and it told me stuff I didn't find to really resonate. I did find Genetti's card meanings very useful even when using other decks. If there was a meaning to a card that the traditional Rider Waite wasn't covering, I found this book to be an excellent resource to fill in the void.The images on the cards were a little tooo crowded to the point it was intuition overload and that's due to the artwork itself and maybe some more editing needed within the process. I do enjoy the very multicultural aspects of the cards and how it applies to the card meanings. Like Princess of Pents and Queen of Pents, where the Queen is a member of an African village tribe of which she singlehandedly holds down the task of feeding and cooking and minding the children of the village using the bare resources of the land.After putting the deck down for 2 years, I've recently picked up this deck and changed my approach to readings. I no longer use reversals- this has improved the accuracy of this deck by miles. I've been able to use this deck really well for spiritual readings with extreme accuracy and insight into a situation. For example I asked about work and I got 10 of wands of which this card is described as a situation of battle where others may have the chance to work together to create a common goal/good, but instead the environment is one of subterfuge where people don't let their work speak for itself but that they demean the work of others in order to allow themself to shine. This card was soooo accurate as to the mentality of my coworkers.For spiritual guidance on romance I got 6 of cups which speaks of someone holding onto a relationship that no longer serves its purpose. This was very accurate also.Though her explanation for each card is long and sometimes arduous, they make total sense with this deck and to not read the meanings would do your reading a disservice. I do admire the fact she spends equal amount of time on describing each card in the deck so it feels like you've really gotten an education.Excellent deck if you are intuned with her type of artwork and understand the pagan culture. Even if you're not a pagan (like I'm not) you will still find deep insights within this deck.Genetti's meanings for the cards are different the RW standard, but don't let that keep you from using this deck."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Change Tarot","review":"I really like this deck. The artwork is beautiful. I really like the way the cards are portrayed with vivid color. The images give you a lot to work with and feature modern symbols. The card stock is a little funny, but the awesome images on every card make up for it.However the book is lacking and I don't think I will ever use it."},{"Title":"Germans in Wisconsin","review":"From 1820 to 1910 German-speaking immigrants immigrated to Wisconsin in search of new homes, opportunities, political and religious freedom. By 1900 Wisconsin had a wealth of German farmers, merchants, manufacturers, editors, educators, churches (both Catholic and Lutheran), and communities making up the Wisconsin social, political, cultural, and economic landscape. With his seminal treatise, Germans In Wisconsin, Richard Zeitlin describes the values and ideas Germans brought with them to Wisconsin as he highlights their achievements in both rural and urban settings over the course of the last 150 years. A &quot;must&quot; for all Wisconsin school and community library collections, historical photographs enhance Zeitlin's informative and engaging text."},{"Title":"Germans in Wisconsin","review":"A wonderful small book packed with wonderful information and pictures of the mass migration of the Germans to Wisconsin.

By the author of THE SALEM FRIGATE."},{"Title":"Satanta's Woman (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"The two main characters in this book--Kiowa Chief Satanta and a 35-year-old grandmother (Adrianne Chastain)--are based on real people. We come to know them through great dialog and well-researched, well-written descriptive passages that can stand alone but are important to developing the story and its characters. I found reading this book a real treat. For the west Texas business woman (Adrianne Chastain), October 13, 1864 did not seem an auspicious day for beginning a great romance. The woman had been married and widowed three times, but had never known love. On that October day the chief and his warriors slaughtered whites mercilessly. He claimed this white woman as his own, took her to his people's camp, and to hunting grounds beyond. An appreciation for the gentle side of Satanta of the home fire led to respect and love. In this historical novel the reader comes to respect and admire several people from drastically diverse cultures. We, and Adrianne, come to know Satanta and his first wife, Woven Blanket, through their deeds and conversations. &quot;Perhaps it is becoming necessary to make peace,&quot; Satanta observes. &quot;But . . . the peaceful Indians are soon starving, while the fighting ones are given talks and gifts and food. If the white men are afraid of us, we can have a satisfactory peace.&quot; Woven Blanket describes her people's predicament to Adrianne: &quot;In the past we often have had trouble with (Indian) enemies. . . . Now it is the white man, but he does not just come and take horses or fight warriors. The white man kills us all, even the babies. He does not go away and let us rest from killing. He chases us about, looking for more killing. Why is this?&quot; Unlike a mystery story, this western novel invites multiple readings, first to learn how the story turns out, and second to savor the revealing dialog and gripping adventures. If you read only one western this year, let it be by Cynthia Haseloff. Satanta's Woman is recommended as a great start. See if you can resist another. I couldn't and did not."},{"Title":"Satanta's Woman (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"First of all this is fiction however Chief Satanta was a real Kiowa Chief. The captive in this book, Adrianne Chastain, never existed. There is absolutely no historical evidence that Satanta took a white captive. It is an insult to the descendants of Satanta.This is your basic unresearched western about a smart beautiful white woman stolen by savages, raped, watched as her lover slit her son's throat but yet she falls head over heels in love with him. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. No sensible woman could stand by and watch her captor murder her child then fall in love with him.The Kiowa culture and tradition is tragically inaccurate in this book.

How can a woman watch her home be destroyed, her possessions stolen, her children killed or abducted and yet find peace and acceptance from the very people who did it? Read this book and you will know. It's only fault is that it is far too short. Be warned that there is a high degree of violence in keeping with the times and circumstances.

L.B. Cobb is herself an attorney, and is a product of a Tennessee upbringing. Now a resident of Houston, LB Cobb follows up her first novel, Splendor Bay.Talk about women who have it all until it almost kills them, and you'll find Virginia Rodriguez. As a prosecutor for the DA's office, Virginia works nonstop while she manages to bring up her son, Nick, and try to remember to let the dog, Denver, in and fill its food dish. In the meantime, there has been a murder committed of a powerful federal prosecutor, and his wife is found in the hotel room with a gun in her hand. Is she guilty?Virginia thinks at first this will be an open-and-shut case. Enter Leo Zachmann, a defense lawyer of some repute and intelligence, who can see from the start that the case doesn't add up. He's been hired by a gruff voice calling almost immediately after the murder was committed:\\"'Why, Virginia, I see blinking cop cars and rowdy reporters and I just have to see if there's paying work I can hustle up,' Leo dead panned. 'You know how testy the state bar gets when you send runners in to sign up clients, so I like to do the signing up myself.' 'Right. I was told Mrs. Fullerton hasn't said a word, but it looks like she managed to sneak a call to a lawyer.'Leo and his wife, Miranda, also a lawyer, manage to dig up enough dirt to indicate that \\"some other dude did it.\\" Indeed, the absence of evidence is in itself fishy and causes Leo to latch on to another line of inquiry...of the feds. In the meantime, Virginia's case dissolves as Leo's case widens. Virginia has yet another issue begging for attention, a budding relationship.Promises Town is a splendid follow-up to Cobb's debut novel.

When Virginia arrives at the murder scene in a posh Bayou City, Texas hotel room, the federal prosecutor's wife has been found with the gun, he and a lover have been found dead in bed together, the motive is obvious, and the wife has been arrested. It looks like a slam-dunk case to Virginia. Enter Leo Zachmann, a shrewd high-profile defense attorney who challenges Virginia to look deeper into the facts -- facts that don't seem to add up to the wife being the murderer.As Virginia and police detective named Smitty delve into the inconsistencies, they come to realize that maybe the wife has been set up, but by then a dismissal of the charges isn't that simple. Powerful people, including a man from Virginia's past, want a quick prosecution and conviction . At the same time, Zachmann and his staff are conducting their own investigation which indicates there's a political conspiracy behind the murders.The story is masterfully told from a point-counterpoint perspective, interweaving the prosecution and defense point of view as Cobb takes the readers through a criminal investigation, into the courtroom, and then on to the unexpected ending. As in L.B. Cobb's debut novel, SPLENDOR BAY, twists, turns, and action keep the pages of PROMISES TOWN turning. It's also filled with deliciously complex relationships, suspense, humor, and some very memorable characters.

I couldn't even get past part one. Yes, there are two parts, and I am certain that the second half is just as bad as the first. The whole story was just describing Professor Aronnax's daily life on the Nautilus, which was completely repetitive if you ask me. The only SOMEWHAT interesting parts of the story was when Professor Aronnax is in danger of being attacked by natives, but Jules Verne just HAS to say it in the most boring way. Jules Verne also spent entire pages describing totally boring conversations between Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax. These conversations were not only boring but confusing. Jules Verne used way to many technical words, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong- I have a big vocabulary range, but that was ridiculous. And who cares about finding the Nautilus's exact location on a map using latitude and longitude lines? Why couldn't Jules Verne just say, &quot;IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN?&quot; If I were you, I would stay away from this book. Don't even THINK about reading it, because you'll just be bored to tears. I know you will, because I was.

I found it odd how he would somewhat drift off into the sub-class, genera, etc. of a cod during some of the most exciting parts of the book. Nevertheless this is a great read. I wouldn't recommend it though for any individual who is either not into science or wants just excitement out of a book"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"In the year of 1866 a mysterious creature from the water was attacking ships all over the world. The creature was believed to be 100 feet long with a long thick, sharp, and strong tusk that could break a steal hull. The group finds out that the creature is a submarine called the Nautilus. The group along with Captain Nemo went on many adventures such as visiting Atlantis. The Famous Maelstrom hits the Nautilus and the submarine can't escape. The group tries to escape from the Nautilus. The group gets knocked unconscious, when they wake up they find themselves on land.I first heard of this book when one of my friends gave me the book along with many other classics. I think that this is one of my favorite books. Some other books I like are Robin Hood, Mutiny Aboard the HMS Bounty, and Kidnapped!. I like this book because it has so much adventure. I like anything that concerns with the ocean. I also like Mystery stories.My favorite part was when the group asked Captain Nemo if they could go and hunt on land. To their surprise he allowed them. When they landed and were cooking their meat a bunch of cannibals came and started to attack. When the group returned captain Nemo opened the hatch and kept it open. The cannibals then tried to enter, but then every time one tried to enter they would run away screaming. Then the professor finally understood; the ladder, hatch, the hull, and most of the rooms were electrical, so the captain could stop anyone he did not want there."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Jules Verne was one of the founders of the Science Fiction genre, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is one of his best known works. Like other Verne stories (Around the World in 80 Days, Journey to the Center of the Earth) 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is written in first-person perspective but in the form of a journal reminiscing on an adventure; because of this style the action sequences are somewhat summarized; but it is still a very entertaining and informative book. In all, this book is a must read for Science Fiction fans everywhere."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Jules Verne was one of the pioneers of the Science Fiction genre and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is probably his best known work. Verne's stories are always told from the point of view of someone reminiscing on an experience and as such they come of a bit staid; the action is described in very general terms and not real-time. However, the characters of the story are very well developed (even if Professor Arronax acts just like Phileas Fogg from Around the World in 80 Days and the Professor of Geology from Journey to the Center of the Earth) All in all; this is a must read for all true Science Fiction fans."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"the book is horrifying yet funny.

This review is of the complete edition (not the bowdlerised children's version) and references the translation by Mendor T. Brunetti.This was a reread for me. I read most of the Verne books when I was quite young, and lately wanted to revisit some of my favorites. When I was younger, I was very much (like Captain Aronnax) taken with the catalogue of undersea marvels that Captain Nemo and his Nautilus enabled us to visit. Reading it this time around, I was quite struck with the political picture of Captain Nemo. As a man from an unknown country who has lost everything at the hands of men, Nemo becomes what we would today call a terrorist. He funds freedom fighters. He takes his revenge on the men from the countries who hurt him and his. The portraits on his wall: John Brown, Kosciusko, Daniel O'Connell. I think that I'm going to add The Mysterious Island to my list. I had never read the sequel in the past, and I understand that it provides more background about the mysterious captain.Readers who aren't familiar with this book are encouraged by this reviewer to rapidly amend this sad condition. I also have to say that I first read this when I was nine (the full version, not a children's edition) and I can't imagine what really needs to be cut to make it suitable for younger folks. I'd hand them the whole thing with a confident heart."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I loved this classic French novel by Jules Verne and found it to be very entertaining from start to finish! I was very surprised that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.... I figured \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", like many classic novels, would be boring, but Jules Verne is a marvelous storyteller. He imbues this novel with lots of intrigue and mystery as you wonder how the story will unfold... There is lots of adventure and interesting predicaments, and of course, many unforgettable characters one comes to care about during the course of the novel. Also if you like science fiction then this is the novel for you! Jules Verne seems to be ahead of his time in terms of technology and creates quite a wonderful piece of classic literature that has stood the test of time.The attention to detail that Jules Verne used to capture the readers attention is marvelous... This book is written in the 1st person through the eyes of Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History. Professor Aronnax unfolds the story to the reader of this novel about several sightings of a mysterious object seen around the world by many different people.... Some believe it to be an island, others seem to think the object is a floating reef, a large whale or other large mammal and so on. It isn't until Professor Aronnax and his faithful Flemish assistant, Conseil, take part on an expedition aboard the Abraham Lincoln to seek out this unknown object once and for all. Eventually, it is discovered that this unknown object is a submarine named the Nautilus, on which Professor Aronnax, Conseil and Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, spend the remaining part of the novel sailing on the Nautilus through the various oceans of the world along with the crew of the Nautilus. What adventures they have while sailing on the Nautilus!! And the exquisite detail in which Jules Verne imparts is wonderful. One feels like they are truly reading the actually travel journal/diary of Professor Aronnax. Professor Aronnax writes from a scientific/natural history perspective as he is very much interested in the under water world of the worlds oceans.The only draw back I had with this novel was that some of the descriptions were a bit overdone or a bit too much to take in (like classification of animal species or various nautical terms).... These descriptions aren't overwhelming or occur that frequently, I'd just find myself skimming through these parts rather quickly."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"My husband bought this book for our son at a visit to an aquarium, even though I thought it was too advanced for him because he's only four and half. I was wrong - my son LOVES this book! I know the age range on it is 9 to 12 and I have no doubt those ages would also enjoy reading the book themselves, but my son is constantly wanting me to read this to him and is always begging for me to read one more chapter because we usually only read one or two at a time (I will admit, I tone down the scarier parts just a bit for him because he's only four). The illustrated pages help hold his attention while I read to him even though there is a significant amount of text per page, and even my two and half year old can manage to sit through a chapter most days. I love the combination of illustration and text that allows me to read my sons more involved and advanced stories without them becoming bored because there isn't enough to hold their attention to the story. My older son loves asking questions about the pictures, especially the ones in the inserts that have information related to different aspects of the story, and I have learned a lot from those too! I definitely recommend this book and am currently looking into buying my son some more books from the DK/Eyewitness Classics series."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The Easton Press edition of Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is one case to judge a book by its cover. Two other Easton Press editions: From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon are two more examples of this rule. To me, Easton Press has outdone itself with these gorgeous Verne covers. To brass tacks on the 20,000 Leagues edition: the English translation is by Mercier Lewis with an introduction by Fletcher Pratt and illustrations by Edward A. Wilson. One may have wished for one of the more modern translations, but the cover IS stunning."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"If you have been hunting for books with sea adventures, then the book 20000 Leagues Under The Sea is the perfect book for you. It's a bookwith two main characters named Captain Nemo and professor Monsier Pierre Aronnax. The professor studies about underwater living. He finds a large submarine which he thought to be a whale. Captain Nemo named it The Nautilus. The captain has a strange vow not to put foot on land people have been on land people have been on. He also explains that he only uses things that are from the sea. For example, his bed was made of soft eelgrass. On the voyage, the professor learns to hunt for pearls and sea animals. This book is also suspenseful because it leaves you in one question is captain Nemo still alive?I really liked this book because it had a leveled amount of description even though it is first person narrative. I would recommend this book this book between ages of 7 and 11. This book is also suitable for people who like to read. You won't feel disappointed after you read this famous book"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Who would have thought that a major contribution to the world of literature would come out of the Naval Institute Press! Normally, they come out with things like \\"An Illustrated Design History of the United States Destroyer.\\" I'm not casting any aspersions on such a volume, and I may own a copy or two. But Jules Verne, is an a class by himself as one of the great inventive masters of literature. He stands up there with Homer and Chaucer and James M. Cain. And what a superb edition this is, the translation impeccable and the annotations which include technical and historical explanations of the text and are invaluable. I have to confess, it is one of the few times (not including Nabokov) I actually read all the footnotes in a novel (or any book) and found them to be supremely enjoyable. Anyway, treat yourself to this marvel!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The book, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, is both amazing and suspense holding. Just imagine you're on a ship trying to destroy a sea monster. When that exact sea monster has sunken huge ships, small ships, and even war ships. One second you are asking a question, the next thing you know people are screaming, the ship is flooding, and you're knocked overboard with the beast. Get ready for whirlwind of an adventure!Professor Arronax becomes famous from his studies, but he never tells anybody about Captain Nemo or what they call a sea monster, but is actually a submarine. The professor after a few days figured that he has to get off the monster seeing the captain is nearly insane, but he refuses to get off because it is his. Those are not the only characters. Others are Ned Land, Consiel, cannibals, Commander Farragut, and crew men.Three-fourths through the book, people are going crazy. Worst of all, Ned is going so insane; he wants to swim thousands of miles to shore. He feels he just has to get off the beast, even though he's being well supplied with food. As days go on Professor Arronax is seeing Captain Nemo acting weirder and weirder every day, until finally Captain Nemo resorts to yelling at the Professor for no reason.I would recommend this book for ages eight and up. If someone is reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea aloud, it would be exciting for any age. If you like drama, mystery, action, or creativity, this book is for you. In my conclusion, this book is amazing and suspense holding. I loved it and would rate it ***** (out of 5 stars).

It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder. Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning. If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller. That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint). Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues. This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is without a doubt the best translation of Jules Verne's 1870 science fiction classic &quot;Vingt mille lieues sous les mers&quot; (&quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot;). This translation by two Verne scholars, Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, takes all the knowledge available on the book and its author to not only make an accurate and readable complete text (early versions often omit a full quarter of the French original) that fixes the many errors of earlier translators, but also purges the text of many mistakes that were made by the original French compositors. The research and work that went into this translations is really quite stunning, and the result is a text that really lets Verne's genius shine: &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot; is not only a brilliant piece of scientific prophecy, but also a thrilling story with superb, subtle characterizations.The plot is familiar: Captain Nemo, an enigmatic figure who has withdrawn himself from the world, tours the oceans in his submarine called the Nautilus. We see this journey of 20,000 leagues (approx. 43,200 miles) through the eyes of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a scientist who is both Nemo's guest and prisoner. Also aboard with Aronnax are his manservant Conseil and a gruff ship's harpooner, Ned Land. The Nautilus encounters many wonders and obstacles on its long voyage: underwater forests, giant clams, attacks by huge squid, imprisonment in ice at the South Pole, monster storms, a war with a pack of sperm whales, and the discovery of the lost continent of Atlantis. But as something deep and destructive gnaws away at Captain Nemo, his prisoners seek a way to escape from the miracle ship.In the English-speaking world Jules Verne has rarely received in the praise he truly deserves as a writer. People applaud his scientific foresight (while criticizing him for errors that were usually the fault of the translators), but shrug off his writing as inconsequential, with cardboard characters and plotless stories. If only these critics would read this translation of Verne's best novel...they would have to re-think their position on the great French writer! His genius for blending adventure, comedy, and psychology burst through in this translation. The book does veer into lengthy descriptions of marine life in places, and modern readers are likely to skim these parts (Verne even provides clues in the text to indicate when he's about to digress), but as a whole the novel is absolutely engrossing, throwing one stupendous adventure after another at the characters, while developing a mystery around Captain Nemo and increasing tension onboard the Nautilus so that the many different incidents hold together as a single plot. Even though submarines are commonplace technology today, Verne infuses his story with such awe-inspiring wonder that you can't help but feel the same sense of amazement as Professor Aronnax when he finds himself cruising the depths of the world's oceans. Real wonder never gets stakes, and no one was better at creating wonder than Jules Verne.Aside from the excellent translation, this edition contains numerous extras (if this were a DVD, it would be labeled as a Special Edition Director's Cut). The lengthy introduction explains Verne's background, education, the development of the novel, the many things that Verne accurately predicted, the book's unsung literary qualities, the different French texts, and the problems with earlier translations. All the original illustrations from the original French edition are reproduced in the text, and generous footnotes give the reader a guide through Verne's more obscure references and shed light on the author's scientific genius. As a bonus at the end of the book, the editors include a new translation of the relevant passages from &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; that discuss Captain Nemo's background (just in case you're too impatient to go read &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; for yourself to solve the Captain Nemo mystery). There's also a table of the measurements used in the novel for those readers who really want to test the author's scientific accuracy.There really isn't any other choice when it comes to translations of the &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nothing comes close to this: it will appease hard science readers, and it will open people up to Jules Verne's overlooked literary talents. With the wealth of background information available, this edition does better by Jules Verne -- ANY Jules Verne -- than has ever been published in the English language."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Most of Jules Verne's works were hastily translated, with many &quot;improvements&quot; made in the process, such as deletion of scientific exposition, as well as deletion of many moments deemed by the translator as dull.This, the Restored and Annotated version of 20,000 leagues, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions. The translation is very well done, and the annotations explain what has been changed and what previous translations accomplished.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"If you want to read the novel itself rather than a &quot;version&quot; based upon it, I recommend the relatively inexpensive 'Bantam Classic' edition of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Although the foreword by Ray Bradbury is negligible, the Anthony Bonner translation is a graceful compromise between the 1870 French and modern American English, catching the flavor of the period without burying the reader in pseudo-Victorian turns of phrase.That said, readers who come to LEAGUES from either text, audio, or film adaptations of the novel are likely in for a shock, for the original novel is quite different. Some basics, however, remain the same: Professor Arronax, his valet Conseil, and harpooner Ned Land are coaxed into assisting the United States in a search for a sea monster said to be terrorizing shipping lanes--but the monster is not flesh and blood. The three soon find themselves in the hands of the mysterious Captain Nemo, who has created a machine that glides beneath the surface of the ocean: a submarine named Nautilus.But there the similarity ends. While there are very clear similarities between the novel and the various adaptations it has spawned, the Verne novel is less concerned with story, characters, and adventures than it is in creating a plausible vision of something that simply did not exist at the time Verne wrote: a fully functional submarine capable of navigating even the most treacherous waters. Consequently, the bulk of Verne's text is concerned with detailed descriptions of the Nautilus and the sealife it encounters.Many modern readers may find it uphill work, particularly when Professor Arronax determinedly notes the sealife he sees to the point of scientific classification. But even so, and while it may not reach the level of &quot;great art&quot; literature, LEAGUES is a fascinating novel to read--fascinating as much for itself as for what it tells us about the world of the 1870s and what was believed to be possible. The vision that Verne had would indeed come to pass: there would be submarines, and they would strong enough to brave the polar seas. It is an impressive accomplishment--and a tremendously fun read.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process). At times I found myself mentally substituting \\"outer space\\" for \\"under sea,\\" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that, the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I could not believe this version of 20,000 leagues under the sea. I learned so much from this book. All the other movies and stories that I heard about Captain Nemo were not even close to all the adventures that he goes on in this book. When I think about the movie by Walt Disney and then remember the book I realize that the movie was about 1/4 of the books adventures.All the adventures that I never heard about before like the hunt on the sea floor with the electric bullets, the Arabian tunnel under the sea, Santorin Island the Grecian Archipelago, the volcanoes of the Mediterranean, the Bay of Vigo with all the treasures, the size of the mountains in Atlantis, the adventure at the South Pole, the fight with all the sperm whales, his home Island and the production of salt to run his electric engines.There is so much more to this story than what I have heard before and in this edition the foot notes are excellent. I especially like the story of Arachne and how the name of Arachnid came to mean spiders. The footnotes explain all the literary references which are helpful to understanding the characters. There is so much information here about the sea world in an adventure that makes each moment exciting.Verne must have done so much research for this book to get all the scientific information correct. I never thought they knew all those things about the sea at that time.I was surprised by the character of Nemo who never seemed to go after anyone unless he was attacked. The whole idea that he chased after all forms of warships was something made up in Hollywood. Nemo never seemed to want to even deal with people. The story of Nemo's life at the end of the book explains many of his behaviors.The description of all the types of food that they were constantly eating was interesting you never knew what they were going to catch in the Nautilus' nets.I thought the adventure at the South Pole was the best of all with the predicament that they got into. It was the most adventurous and had the most suspense.I do not know why a book like this is not required reading for high school kids they would learn so much as well as adults. There is so much science geography, ichthyology, astronomy practical uses of physics etc.I would recommend this book to everyone who likes science and adventure."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"One of the great problems with Jules Verne is that in the English speaking world he is relagated to the category of &quot;Boys' Own Adventures&quot;. On the Continent, however, he is considered a brilliant social commentator, and biting satirist, AND a man who predicted the future. This is a volume that helps set matters to the right.If you know of &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; already, you will find little different at first. The plot is still the plot. Nemo is still Nemo, Prof. Aronnax is still pompous and fascinated by the Nautilus and Ned Land....Ned Land is a flaming socialist.This is one of the major shifts between the original French and the &quot;cleaned up&quot; English editions. Most of the science of the day was pulled out as a &quot;dull read&quot; and all the Socialism, anti-English remarks, and other commentaries of a &quot;questionable nature&quot; were excised. We Americans have unfortunately been until only very recently only able to find these poor early translations, or translations based on these poor translations. There is much more to Verne than submarines and diving suits. He is a man with a vision of his times, both scientific and political, and his books underline this strongly.English readers, demand your Verne well-translated! Do not allow yourself to be fobbed off with bowlderized versions! To be able to read as he wrote himself (well, in English, for those of us who don't read French...) is a greater pleasure than merely an amusing old science-fiction story from the 19th century. Reading this book, as Verne /meant/ it to be read, if a pleasure, but also a struggle to understand ourselves and our relationship to the oceans themselves."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is Jules Verne at his best, creating the enigmatic character of Captain Nemo.The setting is the mid-nineteenth century. Deadly and mysterious calamities continue to befall ocean-going vessels, with wild reports by survivors that the culprit is a sea monster large enough to ram and sink ships. French professor M. Aronnax finds himself aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a ship charged with finding and destroying the beast. Accompanying him is his loyal servant, Conseil. The ship succeeds in locating the leviathan, but it, too, falls victim to a deadly attack. Aronnax, Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land are the sole survivors--rescued by none other than the \\"monster\\" itself, which turns out not to be flesh and bone, but the world's largest and most technically advanced submarine.They meet Captain Nemo, the owner, inventor, and sovereign leader of the flag-less ship, Nautilus. He explains that they're now his prisoners for life, though they will be treated well and are free to roam the ship. Thus begins an underwater tour of the planet, narrated by the fascinated Aronnax. With today's knowledge of the seas, some of the action is laughable, but at the time this was leading-edge science fiction. Verne's vision of submarine technology, the use of electricity, scuba operations, and various other things is uncanny and typical of great science fiction writers' ability to foretell the future. The ridiculous episodes include traversing an underwater tunnel beneath the Suez to the Mediterranean; a visit to Atlantis; and a trip to the South Pole under the ice, where they break through the surface for a look-see. This would be difficult, considering that the ice is more than a mile thick with a continent of solid rock below. But remember that when Verne wrote the book in 1869, Antarctica had not been explored and remained a virtual myth.The enduring lure of 20,000 Leagues, though, is Verne's Captain Nemo. It takes the entire book (and then some) to learn who this genius Nemo really is. What horrible ordeal has produced such a cynical man, one driven to build the self-sustaining Nautilus, to swear off all contact with the \\"civilized\\" world, never to touch land again, and to ruthlessly and brutally defend himself against any perceived threat? At one glance we see a maniacal scientist worthy of a James Bond thriller. But at closer inspection, Verne has captured the timeless personification of angst over the errors and excesses of Man's interminable war against Nature and himself. Aspects of this same character can today be found in political and environmental activism throughout the world. Actually, it strikes a cord with us all; everyone wants at some time to build what today would amount to a spaceship and shove off from this screwed up planet, saying, \\"Adios, idiots. It's your mess now.\\" --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Big Ice."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved. But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers English (or simply: Verne Vingt Mille English). The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a masterful science fiction classic and the crowning achievement of Verne's impressive literary legacy. While the story itself is absorbing, it is the character of the enigmatic Captain Nemo that makes this novel so successful. Many of the characters we meet in Verne's fiction are one-dimensional; while eccentric, a man like Professor Lidenbrock in Journey to the Centre of the Earth is easy to understand, seemingly driven by science and nothing else. In contrast, Captain Nemo is an incredibly complex man whom neither the reader nor the protagonist is ever really able to understand. He has forsaken all of humanity and retreated beneath the sea, yet he shows great compassion to his crewmen and to the poor on earth; he is generally self-absorbed and emotionless, yet we see glimpses of an emotional trauma that constantly afflicts him and is capable of destroying him. He has suffered a great loss at some point in his life, and his sorrow is matched only by a drive for vengeance against his unnamed oppressors. Captain Nemo is one of the most interesting, delightfully mysterious characters in all of literature.As for the story, a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner join a party in search of a giant sea creature which has attacked a couple of ships. They are knocked overboard and find themselves saved by the monster, which turns out to be a submarine manned by a mysterious crew of sailors. Captain Nemo requires them to stay on board the Nautilus permanently because he wants to keep the existence of his submarine a secret from the world. The three men sail on the Nautilus for ten months, exploring the world's oceans and seas. They marvel at the animal life under the waves; explore underground forests, oyster beds, deep trenches; gaze with somber eyes at great numbers of sunken vessels; fight off giant squids and dangerous sharks; cast their eyes upon the sunken continent of Atlantis; and burrow underneath the polar ice caps to emerge at the South Pole. All the while, they hope to escape and return to their homelands, although the naturalist hesitates to leave his traveling laboratory until such a time as Captain Nemo's emotions become dangerously unbalanced.All in all, this is an incredibly rich, fascinating novel with a poignant yet powerful conclusion. Contemporary readers must have been overpowered by Verne's descriptions of this unknown sailing vessel and the exploits the sub was capable of. That magical element is missing from modern reader's reactions, but this does little to hinder the overall effect of the story. There is one negative aspect to the book--the naturalist and his assistant go out of their way to name and catalogue virtually every animal, mineral, and plant they discover. This is interesting to a point, but the plot often finds itself bogged down for a couple of pages while the reader is bombarded with a veritable encyclopedia of scientific names which are virtually unpronounceable and largely meaningless to his/her ears. These interludes are the only things slowing down the story, however. It is a joy to read the adventures these men have under the sea, and it is even more fascinating to ponder the mind of Captain Nemo. Even the unseen depths of the sea cannot offer the reader a mystery as deep and powerful as that of the Nautilus' exceptional captain."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Many others have left very informed reviews, so I will simply say that it was a very interesting look at human relationships. My wife and I listened as we drove accross America, enjoying hearing words that are all but lost in modern culture.Rae"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The classic undersea adventure doesn't disappoint. Full of mystery, both in terms of the unknown element of the seas, but in the behavior of cagey Captain Nemo. Easily engaged, the reader will travel beneath the sea, visiting places of the imagination, and seeing phenomena that I hope a lucky few may have witnessed."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Books of Wonder)is one of my favourite books of all time. Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative. I can highly recommend this book to readers of all ages and I gave this amazing classic a strong 5/5. 5/5."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Jules Verne was a genius well ahead of his time. In this classic book he takes the reader through the unexplored depths of the ocean on a fantastic and breathtaking voyage fraught with excitement and danger.I have read several reviews of this book from a variety of sources. The biggest criticism that is offered by the reviewers is that throughout the book Verne, through the words of Professor Annorax, lists and describes a multitude of sea life, both flora and fauna. Many reviewers find this distracting and boring. My personal opinion is that the reason that many readers and reviewers criticize this is because they are comparing the book to the very poor Disney film interpretation and adaptation of the book.In truth, the book would suffer greatly without the detailed description of the flora and fauna observed by Professor Annorax. Why? I believe that many of the readers and reviewers misunderstand Verne's intention of who Professor Annorax is. Professor Annorax is a world renown naturalist and specialist in sea life. That is exactly what makes this story so wonderful. Verne takes the worlds foremost expert on sea flora and fauna and throws him into a world previously unknown to him. By observing the many life forms never before documented Annorax realizes just how much he does not know and becomes an even greater expert than before. The documentation of the many species is the natural response an expert naturalist would have to the sudden discovery of a whole new world of flora and fauna.Clearly, Verne had a vivid imagination by describing a functioning submarine well before the concept of a submarine had ever been dreamt of. The detailed explanations of how the submarine works and how it is able to produce electricity and power from nothing more than sea water is perhaps the best kind of science fiction, the kind that has a basis in fact. I have to believe that when the first submarines were being built that the inventors had to have made a serious study of Verne's Nautilus. To have come up with such an intricate, detailed, and scientifically sound description of a submarine in his time is absolutely astounding.Finally, the accuracy of the never before seen flora and fauna when coupled with the scientifically accurate description of the design and functioning of the Nautilus has to make one wonder if Captain Nemo and the Nautilus are really science fiction or if by some miracle they did actually exist and instead of fiction this story was a summary of a real experience Verne, as Professor Annorax, actually experienced."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was one of the best books of it's time and it's legacy still continues today. The author Jules Verne is able to create a world that is fantastic and believable at the same time. However there are moments in which the details become repetitive and rather insignificant.The main character Captain Nemo, it is never obvious if he is the protagonist or antagonist, has a personality that is quite paradoxical. He believes that mankind has wrecked the earth and has given up on the human race as so decides to escape it by traveling the seas in his submarine. However, he is compassionate towards his crew members. At most times he is emotionless, but it is his emotional trauma that bothers him more than anything else. He is a complex character who is interesting, mysterious, and quite interesting to analyze.The story line is intriguing and Verne's imagination adds to the impact of the plot. The story begins with a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner looking for a giant sea creature that has destroyed several ships. It turns out that this creature that they are looking for, and find, is Captain Nemo's submarine. Verne is also able to create a wonderful world full of different creature of the sea as well as the submarine it's self. At the time the book was written sea travel was common but submarines were unheard of. The description of the vessel and its ability must have wowed readers of the time.However, it's Verne's over usage of description and unnecessary plot that tends to ruin the pace of the story. For pages on end there is a constant rambling of encyclopedia-like information. Is it really necessary to know the name, size, origin, composition, weight (etc) of some random mineral that naturalist happens to find?Unfortunately these random occurrences make the book a little hard to follow, but in the end it is still a classic that everyone should end up reading."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under The Sea by Jules Verne is one of the bestscience fiction books. I would recommend the movie starring James Masonas Captain Nemo.

Sure, \\"20,000 Leagues\\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.Professor Arronax leaves a \\"normal\\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \\"modern\\" or \\"known\\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in......The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Oh my gosh, this book is so cool! And so very important in understanding Verne's place in literary and scientific history. This large format book is an annotated version of the most widely circulated English translation of t he Verne classic. And because of the annotations, we learn how HORRIBLY Verne's work was translated from the original French. A great example comes near the beginning of the book when the delightfully detailed annotation in the margin points out that the common edition translation talks of the narrator returning from the \\"disagreeable territory of Nebraska.\\" We learn from the annotation that this is a huge distortion of the narrator's personality and experience. Verne's original writing spoke of the \\"badlands of Nebraska\\" and actually had a favorable attitude toward the region. We learn from the annotations that there were dozens of such awful, misleading mistranslations throughout the common edition that so many people have read, with the author often criticized for errors the he should not be held accountable for. Some of the mistranslations are comical in retrospect. For example we learn in this edition that the common edition includes the phrase \\"at the expense of my loins\\" when, in fact, a more accurate translation would be \\"hurting my back.\\"Verne's book is so filled with cutting edge science of his day and the annotations enlighten us so much about them. Thus this annotated version makes Verne's story an even more interesting and multi-dimentional reading experience."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne is a mysterious adventure book about four voyagers pioneering the unknown depths of the sea. The main characters of this book are Pierre Aronnax, Counseil, Ned Land, and Captain Nemo. Pierre Aronnax is an assistant professor at a natural history museum and Counseil is Aronnax's 30 year old servant. Ned Land is an expert Canadian harpooner with an instinct to kill. Finally, Captain Nemo the mystifying captain of the ship takes them in and does not release them. The French narrator of this story, Pierre Aronnax, while intrigued by Captain Nemo and their many underwater excursions knows that he is still a captive and is planning to escape.Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Ned Land were all summoned to the Abraham Lincoln a ship designed to pursue the monster who was tormenting voyagers on the seas. They encounter a large and swift object in the sea and all three of them are thrown over board. The three men find out later that it was a submarine that attacked them and the commander of this submarine Captain Nemo brings them aboard his vessel. Nemo gives them a grand tour of the vessel. He still treats them like captives but grants them some mobility. Their first adventure with Captain Nemo is the Pearl Fields. The Pearl Fields are fields filled with pearl oysters but Nemo doesn't stop for any of them. He takes them into a huge cave and eventually leads them to a 7-foot long oyster with a pearl the size of a coconut. Nemo does not take the oyster but leaves it to grow. The next encounter is with a gigantic shark. The shark is preying on a helpless fisherman when Nemo jumps in to stab it in the belly. The shark overthrows Nemo but Ned Land is quick to defend him by spearing the shark through the head. The waters are foggy with blood but Nemo manages to bring the fisherman back to his boat and revive him. While these men are thrown together by chance they still show devotion to each other and acts of bravery and humanity. Still Arronax continues to want to escape. The last adventure these men have together is just off the American Coast when seven giant sea monsters that resemble squid attack their submarine. Just as they open the hatch a giant tentacle swirls down into the ship and grabs a hold of a defenseless sailor. As the squid's arm is slinking down Nemo cuts it off with a hatchet. They all fiercely battle the monsters as Ned Land barely escapes the jaws of one squid with Nemo's help. They soon fight off all the enormous squid and are on their way again. They come upon a whirl pool and as they frantically try to escape, a life boat is ripped from the submarine and Pierre Aronnax's world goes dark. What becomes of Nemo and his crew, Ned Land, Aronnax and his humble servant Conseil is the last part of the book.I thought this book was a great read and kept me guessing all the way through. It is not all violence and gore most of the book is about these adventurers discovering nature and the sea. The characters are interesting and very different from each other. Nemo is the caring yet stern captain of the ship while Pierre is somewhat shy and curious. I like both of these characters equally but respect Nemo more because of his strength and convictions. Ned Land is a hostile maverick with the instinct to kill while Conseil is gentle and barely expresses his personality except for his devotion to Arronax. I think Ned Land is a dangerous person to be with but he could save your life if you run into trouble and I admire Conseil's unflinching loyalty to Aronnax. The discovery and respect for nature is an underlying theme throughout the book and I was fascinated by this point of view because it was written so long ago. I can't compare this book to any other book because it is unique but probably the closest book would be Journey to the Center of the Earth which is also an adventure book. Anyone who likes a creative book with lots of adventure, action and heroics would find this book extraordinary."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

Well, a \\"classic\\" is merely a book that is still in print, possibly because the publisher does not have to pay royalties on public domain titles.

It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards. Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader.

There may be perhaps a bit too much of 'zoophytes' in it, but the book will hold it's own as a classic, regardless. For Verne's prowess was not how he told his stories, but WHEN.

The listener is swept, along with the narrator and his two companions, aboard the futuristic (but never improbable) submarine \\"Nautilus,\\" helmed by the mysterious (and ultimately tragic) Captain Nemo. The wonders of Verne's tale of adventure, as well as the tension and sheer terror contained therein, have never before been made so real in any performance of any adaptation of this novel. It becomes easy to empathize with the plight of the narrator, and, indeed, to share in his feelings and frustrations, save one -- the listener may not share the narrator's desire to end the adventure and go home. Ellison's vocal work is outstanding, and the direction of the adaptation is flawless.

Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist. Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself. He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress. He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile. Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive. His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"WOW--WOW--WOW---GREAT BOOK---WHAT A CLASSIC---CAN YOU BELIEVE THATIT WAS WRITTEN IN 1869???

Jules Verne is suprisingly accurate in his depiction of a modern-day electric submarine and its workings... although he doesn't go into the minute details that I was hoping for. The ending of this book is a tremendous let-down with regards to the character of Captain Nemo. Throughout the entire book, the Captain's background is built up to be a giant mystery... which simply begs for resolution. I couldn't wait to reach the end of the book in order to find out why Captain Nemo was the way he was. This resolution never comes. Never. This left me with the opinion that Jules Verne simply wasn't a talented storyteller, and never bothered to fill out and completely think about the character of Captain Nemo.

These satirical writers parodied a remark of Linnaeus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining that \\"nature did not make fools\\", and adjured their contemporaries not to give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens, sea-serpents, \\"Moby Dicks\\", and other lucubrations of delirious sailors.\\"The whole book is written like this. Also, it takes the book a whole page or more just to convey something as simple as \\"people were scared\\", and it uses obscure vocabulary to do so. I mean, seriously, is \\"lucubrations\\" the best word the translator could come up with there? It makes me think he does not speak English and was using babelfish online to translate it.However, if you enjoyed reading the excerpt I provided, then by all means go ahead and buy this version of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"We follow Captain Nemo, and his Nautilus - a sub that runs on batteries, in his travels around the oceans of the Earth. We follow him as he explores underwater forests, goes hunting dangerous sea monsters, takes from the sea what he and his men need to live, visits the South Pole and even shows us Atlantis.The problem is that about one third of the book is Jules Verne explaining EVERY tiny detail, from the family trees of fish and other sea creatures, to page after page on how the Nautilus works. The fight with the school of squid is only a few pages long.On the other hand, Nemo is not shown as a man trying to force mankind to improve as much as he is trying to live without contact with it (even when he helps some parts of it to fight back by giving rebels gold he finds on the seafloor). In the end, it is mankind who forces him to fight back, by hunting him down with warships.My book had an introduction by Ray Bradbury, which was very interesting, but did little to help the story itself.A good book for fans of Jules Verne, classic adventure stories and anybody interested in the sea."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Who is Captain Nemo? Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living, which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity, which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vein as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nation-less man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. The Nautilus produces all that Nemo needs.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, and it was not the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. Encouraging production and industry could have better provided for the people.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more that a narcissist!When Nemo brings the Professor on his trip, it becomes a conquest of the sea. Nature becomes a possession, no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world.It is Ned alone who sees the vanity of the voyage, but to no avail. All aboard become trapped in the world of Nemo.A world running from machine and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world which he takes freely from, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovery that there is, what it means to be human!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says \\"here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...\\").Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like \\"Vexed\\" \\"Zoophytes\\" and \\"Connoisseur.\\" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant \\"Narwhal\\" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure.In 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea The Brilliant minds of Captain Nemo and Professor Arronax save them in times of danger, Captain Nemo's knowledge of the sea allows him to guide his submarine across the world, confronting the sea's greatest beauties and threats. Jules Verne does a very good job of telling the story and making out every last inch of the amazing journeys taken place on board the Nautilus. In my opinion this was a very good book, there are times in the book were discussions between the captain and the professor take place that are extremely difficult to comprehend, but in the end I would say this book is definitely worth the money. However as I've said before almost every page has Old English in it and is hard to understand, the sentences are very difficult and there are some words which I'd never heard before in my life, so because of the books complexity I would have to say that only someone 13+ can read this, this would be great for adults even, but I don't think anyone below the 7th grade could fully understand it, a 6th grader could but not get the full detail of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo. The book Twenty thousand Leagues Under the Sea was veryinteresting. It is very suspensful and you are always thinkingthat the characters are going to die. Their are mant differentsurvival scenes. For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine.

And over all itwaas okay, but I wouldn't be caught reading it again."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"As I have mentioned in other reviews, Jules Verne is an author greatly at the mercy of his translators. Bad translations have cut and mangled Verne's writing, often making his style seem arthritic, his plots disjointed, and his thematic content insipid. Therefore my reviews of Verne's novels usually are concerned with a particular edition of Verne.This is a review of the 1962 Bantam Classic edition of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870). It contains an introduction by Ray Bradbury comparing Captains Nemo and Ahab. (Nemo is mad north-by-northwest, but Ahab is _really_ crazy.) The translation is by Anthony Bonner, which is generally rated as \\"above average\\" by Verne scholars. Bonner does maintain some errors from the older (and much inferior) Mercier Lewis translation. For example, Nemo still says that the steel plates on the _Nautilus_ have a density of .7 to .8 that of water. If this were true, the steel would be lighter than water! What Nemo actually says in the original text is that the specific gravity of the steel plates is 7.8. What a difference a few decimal places can make!But on the balance, the Bonner translation does very well in allowing Verne to exercise his scientific knowledge without cutting or mangling it. The discussion by Professor Aronnax of sea pressure and the type of creature that would have to withstand it, the details of the electrical system of the _Nautilus_, the shipbuilding figures for constructing the submarine, the calculations of the formidable Black Stream... all are detailed and concrete. (Though admittedly, there is electronic information that is withheld from us.) And there are underwater sights such as these:The sun's rays struck the surface at a rather oblique angle, and, refracted by this contact as if passing through a prism, they tinted the edges of rocks, plants, shells and corals with the seven colors of the solar spectrum. It was a marvelous feast for the eyes; colors criss-crossed one another in a veritable kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue-- the entire palette of an enthusiastic colorist! (113)And again, during an undersea funeral near a coral forest:The light [from our lamps] produced a thousand charming effects as it played about these brightly colored branches. I thought I could see these tissuelike cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the wavy motion of the water. Small, fast fish would would dart past like flocks of birds. I was tempted to pick the coral's fresh flowers and delicate tentacles, some of which had just blossomed and others scarcely yet opened. But if my hand drew near these living, sensitive flowers, an alarm would spread throughout the colony. The white blossoms would dart inside their red cases and vanish from sight; the shrub would change into a block of stony bulges. (175)The enigmatic Captain Nemo (sometimes vindictive and villainous, sometimes noble and heroic) promises his three involuntary guests: \\"You will travel through a land of marvels. Your mind will be in a continual state of astonishment and stupefaction. It will be difficult to get bored with the continual spectacle that will pass before your eyes\\" (71). And do you know, the Captain is right. The voyage of the _Nautilus_ is truly a grand adventure-- almost the archtypical extraordinary voyage-- from the undersea hunting party, to the encounter with the giant clam, to the visit to Atlantis, to the battle with the squid, to the use of Nemo's thunderbolts.Some modern readers grumble over the length and detail of Verne's descriptive passages. But remember: Jules Verne wasn't writing for an audience that had seen dozens of underwater movies. His task was to get people who had _never_ seen such a sight \\"to enter a new element\\" (71) and experience it for the very first time. He did this. And if you give Verne half a chance, he will do it again."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Almost twenty years ago, I took hold of this book and remember reading it in a day (though we all know how memory can trick you). I didn't recall much more of a narrative other than a general knowledge when I took it again, but I remember avidly my childhood experience and feelings which went hand in hand with this book. It was all about mysteries, about adventure, about submerging into the unknown depths on a strange vessel accompanied with a mysterious figure of Captain Nemo. I recall reading, after lengthy search, sequel of this novel, trying to fulfill the urge for finishing of the tale, and being astonished with events on mystery island that summed up the story. Verne was one of my first authors and first guide to the fantastic world of science fiction. Much has changed since those days. In part, I blame it all to growing-up, other parts would be too lengthy to mention. I picked this book again about a month or so, hearing the praise of this translation of Naval institute press, wanting to remember some of the experiences I had as a child. Effect was quite opposite. I was bored to death. And I saw too much. Somehow, when you're innocent in reading, when your voyage through world of books is only at its beginning, world seems much simpler and you take your story for granted. You're easily marveled by plot, by gadgets, by effects, by sheer promise of something unknown that unravels in front of you, failing to notice all of the work that lies somewhere behind. When you loose your virginity, when you spend countless hours studying the mechanism of narration, the idea of fiction and storytelling, those hidden things come before your eyes. And you start to see faults and errors, bad phrases and filler paragraphs, you begin to see colonialism, glorification of science, problems of liberty and equality and rhythm of the text and somehow it all falls apart. Instead of the wondrous book that you remember from childhood, you hold before yourself gigantic block of text without almost any kind of value other than historical one. Reader that exists today, one that grew distant from childhood innocence, keeps noticing the cramped language, keeps comparing Verne to other authors of the period and finding him outmatched, keeps noticing hasty structure with uneven tempo and failing rhythm, keeps noticing typified characterization and obsessiveness about scientific detail which painfully slows narration and cannot avert his gaze from all of that. It existed before, for sure, but being unaware of it, made \\"20 000 leagues under the sea\\" a fond memory. Today, it stands for concept of bad literature. I am aware that many of the Verne's fans out there could debate me on numerous points here but I do not wish to start a debate here. This text talks more about me as a reader than about the book in question, but in a way it is accounting of an experience and personal voyage through concepts of literature. If your views are similar to mine, it is likely that you will also be disappointed with this book. Maybe this should come with a stamp - not suitable for those above 14. And maybe, once again, I'm failing to see something of importance. Maybe another decade or so will shed some more light on it. Oh and, by the way, edition and translation is great."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book looks very nice, it is great to have the whole map on the cover so you can actually follow the travels.

And I think if u like Jules Verne's stories you should read twenty thousand leagues under the sea"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"A fantasy written long ago in 1887, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea started almost an entire genre of fantasy with submarines like the Tom Clancy novels. In this story ships all over the world claim to have seen a mysterious shifting black reef. Many thought it was just a rumor until it bore a hole into the hull of a steamer that had been able to make it back to shore. Pierre Arronax, a French biology expert, and his servant are invited on a ship going to hunt this creature. When the ship sunk, they found themselves captive on the creature that turned out to be a submarine, and it captain, Nemo, a genius who despised human society, showed them the wonders of the depths.Slow and plodding, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea does not match the excitement of more contemporary fantasy fiction. One reason that this book did not appeal to me is that, compared to the other fantasy book that I am reading, The Fires of Heaven by Robert Jordan, the characters and events are dull and boring. For example, a protagonist in The Fires of Heaven, Mat Cauthon, has two intriguing aspects. One is his incredible luck in games of chance. The other, most fascinating aspect, is that he has vivid memories of lives lived in the distant past. there is no character in the Jules Vern novel that can compare to such a riveting figure.Jules Vern's novel is flat and unimaginative in contrast to Robert Jordan's work. I was told it was a classic, but I was disappointed by its quality of creativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"okay i think this is a pretty good book but it's not that intresting.

But the sea creature turns out to be a submarine, the Nautilus, and they're joined by the harpooner Ned Land in being rescued/captured by its crew when their attack on it fails.I definitely encountered this book far too late to fully enjoy it. Like when I tried re-reading Tolkein a couple of years ago, I found I lacked the patience to read through pages and pages of interminable description. There were several times when I just couldn't stand it any longer and I'd put the book down and go do something else. Only sheer stubbornness made me finish it.The story itself was interesting, though the style of the times was a bit of an obstacle. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is never fully explained, nor are the professor and his two companions. It's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks. The professor's unconcern about his imprisonment on the submarine is partially explained by his fascination with the undersea worlds he encounters; the complacence of his assistant and Ned Land are less understandable. Ned Land does try to escape occasionally, but he's portrayed as narrow-mindedly violent because of that, which I found peculiar.I do see why films were made from this--condensing those descriptive passages into scenery would make the action and adventure parts of the story stand out more. I've never seen one, but I'm thinking of adding one to the Netflix queue. Any suggestions of which version to try?In short, I'm giving this 4 stars for the story, but 2 stars for the pain of reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Unfortunately, \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic.

But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it.

If you are into marine biology you might appreciate the detailed descriptions of undersea creepy crawlies better than me but I still made my way through them.The other descriptions are rich in detail, it's been a while since I saw the movie so Verne's descriptions of the ship were in my mind's eye and I felt like I knew what it was like to be aboard the Nautilus, in the dormant volcano, walking through the ruins of Atlantis.When it comes to the action scenes they are also descriptive but they move quickly as the crew and passengers battle with various sea monsters and go through the wild maelstrom that may, or may not have, destroyed the beautiful, magical Nautilus."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I want to read it again!

Some of these sightings are far apart from one another. With no other logical answer, some fear that it might be a sea monster.An expedition is established under Captain Farragut, with the U.S. Naval frigate, Abraham Lincoln. They are firm in their resolve to find this monster.Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Paris had written articles about the phenomenon of a possible sea creature and he is asked to join the others, as is, his man, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land.Once they are out to sea and have traveled far in their search, something is sighted. Ned, Pierre and Conseil take a small boat from the Abraham Lincoln with Ned's harpoon. Ned tries to harpoon the object but their boat is overturned and they are picked up by the submarine, the Nautilus under Captain Nemo.They are held in polite captivity as the Nautilus travels the world. Captain Nemo has constant proclamations of where they are and Pierre tells the reader the importance in history of what they are seeing, such as, a sunken ship with riches in it. The men are anxious to be free and have their escape at the earliest opportunity.The writing style is dry and without much emotional comment. The style is so different from much of today's literature that it is challenging to get into the story line and become involved with the story.It is interesting to see Jules Verne's ideas of deep sea diving equipment and his idea of 20,000 leagues under the sea-which is more than the circumference of the earth. It is also noteworthy to see where literature and adventure fiction has come to in the last one hundred years."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This review is for the Easton Press leather bound 1977 edition of the Mercier Lewis first english translation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne.Anil Menon notes in a 2006 examination of 'The Politics of Nemo' that, \\"Verne liked to place his human characters in enclosed, self-contained, unique spaces of one kind or the other-- heavier-than-air flying machines, isolated islands, floating cities, villages on tree-tops, the earth's core, cannon-balls to the moon, steel submarines 20,000 leagues under the sea-- and send them out for a spin. For the most part, his people are two-dimensional cross-hairs; their main role is keep track of places in the reader's mind.\\"Most English-speaking readers are familiar with the image of Captain Nemo as an escapee from human society driven by hatred to live a life separate from humanity in general. Verne appears to have endeavored to use his story as a vehicle for some sort of political message or commentary on the conditions of his era though. One quote in the book offers a glimpse of this dark motivation: , \\"I've witnessed the destruction of everything I loved, cherished, and venerated--homeland, wife, children, father, and mother! There lies everything I hate!\\"Due to the politics of his time in France, Nemo fails to properly identify precisely who inflicted the personal pain on him. It is speculated that Nemo originally intended to point the finger at Tsarist Russia for their victimization of the Polish people, but France was friendly with Russia at the time so Nemo chose to leave the identity of his victimizers to speculation. That is unfortunate, because it causes Nemo to be more of a 'stick-figure' for the story than might otherwise have been the case.Regardless of this, the story of Nemo and his submarine continues to this day to intrigue readers as it always has. The problem for us English speakers however, is that Verne wrote his original story in French and the numerous English translations differ widely in terms of how accurately they reflect Verne's original story. Unfortunately, Easton Press chose to use what is generally considered to be the worst possible English language rendition of this famous book; the Mercier Lewis translation.Mercier Lewis went after Verne's story with a scalpel, cutting and removing entire sections and altering the meaning of many French words and ultimately, the story itself. When he was done, Lewis had removed over 20% of Verne's manuscript, paying particular attention to the removal of any comments that might contradict the Christian Bible. The result is that the reader of this translation is far less likely to gain an accurate appreciation of the original novel.There are other, much more legitimate English translations available. One generally considered to be the best current English translation is the Walter James Miller & Frederick Paul Walter version completed in 1993 and published by the Naval Institute Press. Unfortunately, that version presently only seems to be available in paperback. The Easton Press leather-bound edition looks much nicer sitting on the bookshelf and that is the main reason many continue to purchase it. But if one is interested in genuinely exploring the world of Captain Nemo, the Navel Institute Press version by Miller & Walter is the way to go."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I loved it so much that I want to read it all over again!

The book's original title Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, the literal translation would be \\"Seas\\" which might imply the seven seas.The story is told from the view point of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a famous French marine biologist. The professor accepts an invitation to join an expedition to destroy a sea monster who is sinking ships. Along for the ride come Canadian harpoonist Ned Land and Conseil, the professor's servant.The expedition fails, the monster sinks it and the Professor, Ned Land and Conseil find themselves at the mercy of Captain Nemo, who commands The Nautilus, a submarine the likes of which have never been seen.I have read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in two languages and several versions. I have to say that this translation beats them all.The book shows Verne's genius which is tough to translate, the characters come alive on the pages and the adventures they go through are exciting. The comedic tone and even psychology show well in this wonderful translation.As in the previous versions I have read, there are many \\"lists\\" and descriptions of the ocean life. I have to say that I did skimmed through the lists but read the descriptive parts enthusiastically. With the exception of intricate scientific names, which lend credibility to this fantasy, I found the book absorbing and engrossing. I'm glad I read it again.While submarines today are common place and almost anyone of can go and visit one (there are several older submarines which one can go on), the fantastic voyages and imagination are inspiring today as they were in 1870.What I love about this book is that the translators took their time to write an excellent introduction and, best of all, wonderful footnotes which, as I said time and time again, make a translated book into a cultural experience and raises the level of enjoyment by multiple degrees.Not many people are aware, but almost a whole quarter of the book was literally lost in translation. This wonderful edition, translated by Water James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, restores those pages as well asIf you ever wondered what the big hoopla is about Jules Verne, read this version and you'll find out."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne? Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work. It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism. With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook. Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may. The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the \`science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the \\"speculative\\" portion to explore human nature. Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this. And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost. However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well. We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions. The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed. Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular \\"twenty thousand leagues\\" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks. There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly. Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base. Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as \\"inoffensive creature[s],\\" he gleefully slaughters a herd of \\"cruel, mischievous\\" sperm whales. Hardly sustainability at its best. But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology. Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design). Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented. Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by \\"foul air.\\"Verne wrote at an exciting time. The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid. We were just beginning to understand electricity. The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered. Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon. There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion. Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given. It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword. I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968. It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would). These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel. It also contains a \\"backword\\" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I did enjoy this book and I'm glad I read it but ... the introduction by Ray Bradbury was the best part of this book. If you are going to get a copy to read - get this one - specifically for the introduction. As for the book itself, well, the action parts and story line are great. The problem is that Verne seems to have felt that he needed to include every single bit of background research he did into the book. He didn't seem to waste anything he had found in in his research.. He goes on for several pages listing the types of fish that can be found in a particular area. Whenever we come across a sunken ship we are treated to several pages of the history of the ship and the ships that preceded it into whatever cove we are in along with who actually made it back to make the report. Some of this stuff is interesting, but mostly, it's unnecessary filler. I found myself skipping over the taxonomic lessons and skipping to the actual story line.The story line is great. Totally enjoyed it. Spoiler - they get attacked by 10 giant squids, not one. They also get trapped under the ice at the south pole and have lots of other adventures you don't see in the movies. All in all a worthwhile read, but it is a bit tedious because about half of the book is devoting to listing fish and their attributes (this one had a spotted tail with a blue underbelly, the next one had rings and a white belly and on and on and on.)Do I recommend it? Well ... yeah - good story, better then what they show in the movies, you just need to gloss over the endless filler."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Fantastic!! I devoured every word in a day, after some prompting from close friends. It remains to be one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Professor Pierre Aronnax does not travel to a depth of 20000 leagues under the sea aboard the Nautilus, if that's what you thought. What he does do is travel a distance of 20000 leagues while submerged under the sea inside the mysterious vessel.Boats and fishermen all over the globe have reported a leviathan attacking ships. Professor Aronnax accompanies a warship to attempt to destroy it, but falls overboard and ends up inside the sea animal. The \\"monster\\" turns out to be a secret submarine build by Captain Nemo. As a passenger aboard Captain Nemo's craft, Professor Aronnax is witness to the wonders hidden beneath the ocean waters.Written over a century ago, Jules Verne creates a fantastic setting that leaves even today's readers fascinated about Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Detailed descriptions about underwater life fill a majority of the book and create a rich setting, but can drag on at times.Water makes up the majority of the earth. As humans, we have only a mere understanding of the creatures and life forms that dwell within the depths of the oceans, and Verne expands on this unknown realm to create a powerful and lasting tale.Maybe it's a coincidence that I've read a lot of novels with aquatic settings (Life of Pi, The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick), but 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is another watery classic worth reading.8/10 -> 4/5"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is a very attractive edition of this book. The physical dimensions of the book itself, it's quite large, make it very easy to read. Additionally, the large plot-driven engravings found in the book are beautiful and the smaller engravings found at the top and bottom of each page are also very attractive. The fact that this book is Vernes' unabridged edition may turn some readers off, as he does go on ad nauseam, about the inner workings of the machine. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"'20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' is one of those classic stories by the wonderfully imaginative and clever Jules Verne that everyone has heard of but, alas, few have read ... at least here in America. I decided to give the book a try having just read (and enjoyed) the author's other classic 'The Time Machine'. '20,000 Leagues...' is a far more ambitious novel and, overall, even more enjoyable.The story is set in the late 1860s when the book was written. Due to unusual circumstance (..no spoilers here) three men (a naturalist, his manservant, and a whaler) are taken against their will onto a (then unheard of) submarine by the enigmatic Captain Nemo. For many months they circumnavigate the globe and cross all the oceans. Along the way the encounter the fantastic, some dramatic episodes, and even fleeting moments of comedy. The author goes into great detail of describing the wonders of the submarine. While of course much of the science he describes is a bit silly most of it is remarkably true to life. I am especially amazed at his foresight into electricity years before the lightbulb was invented. Monsieur Verne was truly a genius. And thankfully, he was a pretty good writer.But this book doesn't hit all the right notes. All the in-depth descriptions of amazing underwater flora and fauna gets rather repetitive. The middle third of the book is a bit of a tedious read. Thankfully the story tightens considerably towards the end, with a very surprising climax.Bottom line: an often overlooked classic that will probably bore younger readers but will enthrall adults. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Verne's prophetic masterpiece still thrills readers over 100 years after its publication. In this adventure, French naturalist Pierre Aronnax is taken aboard the Nautilus, a secret high-technology submarine capable of high speeds. Aronnax meets the enigmatic Captain Nemo, a renegade against society with a strong desire for revenge against the enemy that drove him under the sea. This novel is one of the first examples of modern science fiction. The world of science fiction owes Jules Verne a great debt.This edition is particularly valuable. Most people aren't aware that the standard English translation is filled with lots of translation errors which botch the science of Verne's masterpiece. Also, the standard version cuts about 25% of the original French novel. This translation fixes the errors, and returns 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's scientific accuracy (for that time). Also, the cut parts have been restored, so we can now enjoy reading a complete version of Verne's novel.If you love classic books, and you're interested in reading about one of the greatest characters in science fiction, you have to read this. Also fans of science fiction should read this to understand where their genre came from. If you've read the old standard translation, you have to read this edition to see it the way it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"My (10 year old) daughter got interested in '20,000 leagues' after reading the \\"Wishbone\\" version (go ahead and laugh). I went searching for the real thing to read with her, and came across this edition. With all of the missing content recovered, plus the annotations to fill in all sorts of additional information, the result is fascinating for adult readers. If you read the usual (butchered) version as a kid, you really owe yourself this one. All of the critiques of Verne over the years that tried to belittle his knowledge of science turn out to have been based on translations that whacked out what Verne really said -- they thought it was too dry and boring. Reading what he really said, plus the extensive footnotes that describe the state of knowledge at the time, make Verne's brilliance all the more astonishing. Just consider that he wrote about the Nautilus at a time when the Hunley was the state of the art!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I havent read many books in my lifetime but I'd have to say that this is the best one I' ve ever read.

I found myself wanting to be on the Nautilis, meeting Captin Nemo, and see the ocean depths with my own eyes.

This fantastic tale of the adventures of an under-sea craft (written BEFORE their actual invention) fires the imagination of readers young and old. Verne's genius was his ability to create incredible (in his time) machines, around which he'd write believable stories with admirable characters and meaningful morals. As with the submarine Nautilus, many of his machines have since become modern realities."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I can still remember reading 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for the first time as a kid. I was fascinated by submarines and captivated by the story of this wonderful ship, capable of making all my dreams come true. I wanted to dive beneath the waves and accompany Professor Aronnax on his incredible journey. Reading it again after many years, I find that I am still impressed by the story. Not only is it quite prophetic for its day & age, the fact that the story is STILL captivating after all these years just goes to show that great literature is timeless. In what follows, my comments shall refer to the Bantam version of the novel, translated by Anthony Bonner. This translation (or another suitably modern translation) is critical to getting the most out of this novel, as I will touch upon later.There is something for everyone in this book. On the one hand, the reader is treated to a very scientific (at times, \\"too\\" scientific for many readers) tale of undersea exploration, mixed with a tale of adventure and intrigue. The Nautilus carries us to every ocean of the world, exploring the South Pole, the lost city of Atlantis, shipwrecks, a mysterious tunnel between the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, and so much more. On the other hand, Jules Verne has also managed to flesh out a human story, one focused on Captain Nemo and his mysterious past and hatred for Western civilization. While the \\"kid\\" in you will have your eyes fixed on the Nautilus's glass portal that reveals the wonders of the deep, the \\"adult\\" in you will be rapidly trying to figure out exactly \\"who\\" this captain is and why he has built this ship, capable of removing him permanently from society.Many have complained about Verne's tendency to lose the story for endless lists of scientific classification. It is not hard to see their point. Verne does go on and on about species of fish in a manner that loses the reader's interest after a short while. But there is nothing to prevent you from skimming over these passages and moving onto the story. That's what I do and I don't think I've sacrificed a thing in doing so. Moreover, I would recommend that you keep an atlas or wold map handy when you are reading. It is much more fun to read this novel if you can actually track where they are at each point in the novel.Those coming to this novel from the movies will either be happily impressed or disappointed. While the films borrow heavily from the novel, they tend to focus on certain elements of the story (enhancing the action) while forgetting about others. This is not the tale of a madman, destined to hunt and destroy ever ocean-going vessel he comes across. It is so much more than that. In fact, my only complaint (and I have similar complaints for many authors) is that Verne seems to have been at a loss for how to end the novel. Therefore, he hands us a \\"deus ex machine\\" ending, of gigantic proportions. However, despite this minor flaw, the novel still holds up to modern scrutiny and remains enjoyable throughout.While this translation is much, much better than the cheap translations you find from the \\"bargain\\" publishing houses, I have heard that the recent, fully-annotated version is even better. Make sure that, when searching for a copy, that you get one of the modern translations (like the Bonner) and stay away from \\"quick & dirty\\" versions that you can find for a couple of dollars. Many of these cheap translations omit a full quarter of the novel and contain numerous errors. Additionally, they render the French into archaic English, ensuring that you will not enjoy the novel as much as you could. So, my advice is to stay away from the \\"bargain\\" versions-they aren't a bargain at all. But do read 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is a story about three friends aboard the Nautilus, a cantankerous submarine-like vessel that is commandeered by Captain Nemo, an elusive figure with a mind of steel and a impenetrable purpose in life. Captain Nemo has long ago turned his back on the world, building this vessel with the intent of making it his home, staffing it with the most loyal of crews, and arming it as though it were a fortress. And a fortress it is. Captain Nemo and his crew live beneath the sea in this fascinating underwater vehicle as solid as stone. They never touch land, and are prepared to spend the rest of their days living underwater. The world has learned of this vessel, but rumors of its nature abound. Most think it is a sea monster of sorts, and the great ship the Abraham Lincoln sets out on a voyage to find and destroy the Nautilus. On board are Professor Aronnax, underwater expert, his loyal subject Conseil, and a Canadian whale harpooner named Ned Land. These unfortunate characters are tossed into the sea while heavily engaged in a confrontation with the mighty Nautilus. Hours later, they are picked up by the Nautilus, having been clinging to it's topside for safety. They are held prisoner within, but never have prisoners of war had such luxury and freedom. What follows is Monsieur Aronnax' account of the adventures that abound as he travels around the world underwater, seeing sights never before seen, engaging in activities he once only dreamed of, and enjoying times never meant to be had by man. When his companion, Ned Land, becomes restless and wishes to escape the Nautilus, the story heats up. Throughout, Captain Nemo is a mystery you will wish revealed.

For many years \\"20,000 Leagues...\\" was available to us only in Louis Mercier's abridged version. It was not bad, but it was not as Verne intended it to be. But in recent times, we now have three wonderful modern and unabridged translations from which to choose: F.P. Walter's, Anthony Bonner's, and Mendor Brunetti's. Walter's is more readily accessible (both for free and for purchase) because at least one version of his translation is in the public domain. To read it go to the Kindle store and type in: Verne Vingt Mille English. The other two are both copyrighted and limited to their respective publishers which makes them more difficult to locate and definitely not free. Having said that, Brunetti's translation is particularly readable. The true Verne fan (as in fanatic) may wish to read all three to compare. Just don't expect major differences; they mostly differ in style of expression. I first encountered Bonner and liked his translation.

Can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"My first Kindle e-book (see also free book) and I loved it.

The hardcover is strong and the silk bookmark is useful. The only thing that bothers me (and is somewhat minor) are the footnotes. The translator added footnotes throughout the book to explain some words, names, and cultural references from long ago. Some were useful, but others were so painfully obvious and still part of modern cultural memory that I wonder why the translator even took the time to footnote them. Also, the translator mentions in one footnote that he chose to omit a passage where Jules Verne explains in great detail the books which are in Nemo's library. In English classes I was always taught that one of the most interesting aspects of a book is what the author had the character(s) reading. It may have been a long and painful passage, but I would have rather had the choice as a reader to skim over an unending list of French titles from the 1800's rather than have the translator make that decision for me.Additionally, there are questions included for discussion at the end of the book. Without getting off on too much of a tangent, the questions remind me of all that is wrong with shallow and inane stock questions in books. I'm tempted to cut the last few pages out of my copy.Despite my views on the footnotes and questions, I love this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I highly recommend it.---Alex"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 League Under the Sea begins with the world's seas being menaced by an unknown force. After several shipwrecks, the Abraham Lincoln is dispatched to kill what the world believes to be some kind of animal. After a battle with the \\"creature\\", the three main characters, Professor Aronnax, his servant/research assistant Conseil, and Canadian \\"King of the Harpooners\\" Ned Land are swept overboard. When they awake, they find that they are prisoners aboard the Nautilus, a submersible vessel under the command of the mysterious Captain Nemo and his equally enigmatic crew.Captain Nemo refuses to allow the three men to leave his ship, but otherwise treats them well. They are allowed the run of the ship and Professor Aronnax soon becomes quite taken with the research opportunities afforded to him by the submarine. His assistant Conseil is happy to do whatever his master wishes, but Ned Land becomes increasingly agitated and determined to escape as the story progresses. Dominating the tale is the figure of Captain Nemo, a man who has forsworn his allegiances to country and humanity to command his own destiny under the world's seas and oceans.The Nautilus takes the men on many strange and exciting adventures. Verne peppers the story with scientific detail. It's mostly fascinating, although the multiple listings of fish, fauna, and flora can become cumbersome at times. The novel is at its best when Aronnax is wrestling with the mystery of Captain Nemo and his motives, as well as his own conflicting desires to remain on the Nautilus and explore the reaches of the deep or to join Ned Land's quest for freedom.Stirring in places, the story of Captain Nemo and his amazing undersea vessel shouldn't be missed by any fan of science fiction/fantasy. After all, Verne helped create the genre. The version of the novel I purchased was the Signet Classic series translated by Mendor T. Brunetti, who also provides a foreword. Walter James Miller provides a fascinating afterward concerning the inaccuracies of previous translations."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite by the sea books.

However, it has been my experience that many of their novels by foreign authors can be found to contain older and flawed translations.This specific Easton Press contains the Mercier 1873 translation that edits out 25% of the original text. The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated. This translation is true to the original text that shows Verne's actual correct calculations as well as including the 25% of the text lost to English readers for over a century. Happy reading.Peace, Ben"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a science fiction adventure by Jules Verne. The story starts when a strange type of sea life surfaces and a crew is sent out to find what this creature is. When the creature is found, the crew immediately attacks it. The strange creature succeeds in destroying the ship. Two passengers, Ned Land and Pierre Aronnax, survive and board the strange creature, which ends up being a submarine, named The Nautilus. Ned and Pierre meet the captain, Captain Nemo, and they discover a whole new life under the sea, with the help of Captain Nemo. Captain Nemo hates war, and throughout the book. He uses his submarine to destroy all kinds of war-connected ships. The nature and stuff that Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I think this is a very fascinating and marvelous classic and truly amazing to any reader who enjoys suspense and excitement."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is Jules Verne's most famous novel, and it still holds up pretty well. It has a slower, more deliberate pace than today's readers are probably used to, but it is still a good read. I don't think I need to say much about it, because the story is pretty well known. But I will say that Captain Nemo is a very intiguing character, and people interested in Victorian Era fiction should definitely get this book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is a masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone. In this book, the reader is taken on an unbelievable journey aboard the Nautilus, an ingeniously built submarine, venturing the mysterious waters of the world. Jules Verne chooses to describe marine life in incredible detail (or maybe even overboard in detail) in this fictional novel. One may wonder how much research Verne did on the ocean in order to write this story. I believe readers who find life under the sea interesting will best enjoy this book, but the rest may still be fascinated. Not only is this novel a great learning experience of the sea, it is also packed with surprises, which includes a visit to the legendary, sunken Atlantis. Verne even decides to include a bit of mystery in the story. During the sea-voyage, the submarine undergoes a mysterious collision that the captain refuses to tell. I found myself dreading to speed through the pages to complete the book, hoping the author would reveal the solution to this mystery towards the end. Even though I was greatly fascinated by this novel, I still admit that I was disappointed in some ways after completing it. After finishing the book, I had discovered that the title of this book might have been a little misleading. Instead of descending a total of twenty thousand leagues under the sea, the Nautilus actually travels a total of twenty thousand leagues submerged in the sea. One may even find the ending of the story a little too spontaneous and shortly written. As a conclusion, I must say that, even though I did encounter some disappointments, I enjoyed reading the book and I do not regret reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"First of all, I was disappointed when I realized that we're going 20,000 HORIZONTAL leagues while under the sea (not to a depth of 20,000 leagues). But my main disappointment with this book is the lack of development or progression. It's just a travelogue. You could scramble the order of most of the chapters, and it would still read the same. And how dare Verne take us to Atlantis and spend less than two pages there? None of the characters is any different by the end of the book, and we never really find out what it is that makes Captain Nemo the way he is.That said, the nineteenth century science fiction is wonderful. Verne's visions of technology and even geography are fascinating. Will modern science fiction be so accurate in 100 years?"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The begining of this book, really attracts and I read it excited thinking that the rest would be interesting, but as it continued I really was getting bored, so I just read the last part and quited reading it.

You will be taken into the world of the ocean, and youwill be lead into adventure by Captain Nemo himself!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Unfortunately, \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic. This is one of the few cases where a movie has an advantage over the written word."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The story basically begins with the very intelligent Professor Arronax calculating basic mesuremenets. He's a modern french biologist during this time period. The professor had somewhat of an understudy, an apprentice if you will, named Conseil. Conseil was just about as skilled as the professor as far as classification, and knowing so much information about just about everything. One day, the professor got a letter that invited him to go on a select trip to hunt the killer narwhal. Mysteriously, several ships had been rammed, and had a triangular shaped scar on the spot where the uncanny shipmates had decided that the narwhal hit. So Professor Arronax and Conseil went to examine the accidents.They get on the ship and meet a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land. He told them that he was the best at what he does, and that he was ready to take out the narwhal. After a while, they come across the infamous narwhal. They find it strange that the narwhal is about three times as long as the ship they're on, and that it glows. The professor's ship is attacked, and they are stranded in the ocean, they climb aboard the narwahal to find out that it is in actuality a submarine. They finally meet a strange man named Captain Nemo, who explains to them that it is his ship and that the professor, Conseil, and Ned Land can stay as long as they go with him on a trip around the world in his submarine, the Nautilus. They begin to go on amazing trips, and don't know what exciting thing is to come up to them next."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"It is a good book, but overall, felt like half the time he was overly descriptive and made it DRY, got 70% done and tried to finish it, but had to come back to it... Felt as though the Prof does want to stay but the other part of him wants to leave, half the time is spend describing things, or fish, or coordinates, and history, it is a very descriptive book, but it does get very dry at times as you want to just move to the next page to stop reading the over drawn descriptions"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"As someone who tends to enjoy older adventure fiction more than the average person (I quite like Conan Doyle's non Sherlock books, like most Stevenson, love Sabatini, etc.), I was looking forward to plunging into this classic tale of adventure and exploration. Somewhere near the middle its narrator captures the essence of the book with the following unintentionally prescient sentence: \\"To anyone but myself, who had a great love of the sea, the hours below must have seemed long and monotonous.\\" That's an excellent summation of Verne's story of the almost magical electric submarine The Nautilus, it's imperious and mysterious Captain Nemo, and the three outsiders who circumnavigate the globe in it. Basically, unless you have some kind of strong interest in marine biology, it is an incredibly tedious read. Granted, it is an impressive feat of imagination for its time (the 1860s), but the amazing technologies described don't pack any kind of punch for the modern reader, and the exotic locales are now the stuff of the Travel Channel.The story is very simple. There is some kind of large creature menacing sea traffic around the world, so an international expedition is launched to try and find it and capture or kill it. Among those joining this voyage are the famous French naturalist Professor Aronnax, his heroic servant Conseil, and legendary French-Canadian harpoonist Ned Land. When the American frigate leading the expedition finally encounters the beast, combat ensues and they are thrown into the water, only to wind up the prisoners of the Nautilus. Captain Nemo decides that having seen his vessel's interior, they must remain prisoners for life. Thus, they embark on a grand tour of ocean with this man who has forsaken mankind and its evil ways.Alas this tour turns out to be a barrage of naturalist classifications of everything they see, complete with Latin names and various characteristics. This is fairly evocative the first time, but by the third has gotten repetitive, and by the tenth just downright sleep-inducing. Not to mention a litany of latitudes and longitudes to mark their path, as if one were reading in one hand and following along with an atlas in the other. Which is not to say that stuff doesn't happen, it does--it's just not very interesting. They visit underwater forests, the South Pole, Atlantis, coral reefs, famous shipwrecks, encounter danger from a tricky passage, icebergs, giant octopi, and fierce island people, and yet none of it is particularly dramatic or well done.Matters aren't helped by stilted scenes where Professor Aronnax asks Nemo how some aspect of the submarine works and receives a lengthy lecture outlining the scientific basis and processes for how such and such works. There are far too many instances where Aronnax is simply playing the straight man to Nemo's genius: \\"Gosh, we're really in a jam now Captain Nemo, what are we going to do!\\" \\"My dear professor, yet again you underestimate the capabilities of the Nautilus, all I have to do is....\\" etc. In that sense, Verne's imagination is deployed in a relatively wooden manner which does little to make it compelling for the modern reader.Finally, the central conflict of the three captives versus their captor is lame. They're stuck, they can't do anything to escape, and that never changes until the merciful end, where they are whisked away yet again. Again, no tension or drama. The one really intriguing character is Captain Nemo, who rails misanthropically about mankind and refuses to divulge his nationality, and speaks to his crew in an unrecognizable language. Throughout, one keeps waiting for a revelation as who he is and why he hates the world of men, but other than brief allusion to his having had a wife and child who were killed, there's no payoff! This final straw is an infuriating end to a stultifying book. Sometimes the \\"classics\\" ain't what they used to be."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"So, nearly 150 years have passed since this book has been published... and much of it has become just boring. I'm sure back then the description of how under-sea boats and suits work was thrilling, but now it's kind of... yup, I know that.He goes into deep detail about the marine life, many a time, and I just skimmed and skimmed and skimmed. Honestly, by the end of the book I just wanted it to be over with. It could possibly make a 4-star movie with the right effects today."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"A mysterious creature is haunting the seas, and Professor Aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast. However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This version is Verne's original and it is the best. I love the book! Also it is nicely done, easy to read and I think probably the best version out there."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"When you consider that Mr. vernes wrote this undersea adventure about a submarine, when steam engines were the rage. And underwater boat was unheard of. By todays standards the book is not very exciting, but for its time it is very adventerous. The endless cataloging of the undersea life and the operation of the submarine all come out of the autor's head. There is one thing to note that I first read this book in grammer school and just re-read it. It is a shame that what was once considered a childrens book, has vocabulary that most of the Worlds High School students can not understand."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The other reviewers have noted how the editors...both experts on Verne and the Victorian era science that guided him.. have gone back to the original French manuscripts, collated them to use the best, most reliable, paragraphs and phrases from each, and annotated the book to reflect on Verne's social, political and technical background as if affects the story.If all this sounds like the book is some kind of dull scholarly treatise, rest assured that the novel as STORY is not harmed, but actually improved by the editors' restorations and fix-ups.My own path to Nemo and the Nautilus was watching the Disney film version when I was 11, then getting the Classic Comics version, and finally going to the available butchered translation. Even that version captivated me, and sent me to the dictionary to decipher some of the hifalutin 19th century phrases.Now, as then, I gloss over the endless catalogues of marine biology classification --- Verne as well as Victorian science fans were captivated by the then new interest in categorizing flora and fauna into genus, species, sub-species, varieties, etc. This stuff can be skipped without losing the story.What interests me is the adventure under the sea, and the way in which these fellows are able to watch the wonders of the deep through the window of a plush 1860s salon. I am also interested in how Verne envisioned the workings of the sub. Interestingly, in 1904, just before his death, he wrote an article for Popular Mechanics in which he updated his thoughts on the future of the submarine, based on the Simon Lake and John Holland boats of that day. He had to explain to readers that he was NOT the inventor of the submarine, as popularly believed.All in all, the editors have done a wonderful service in bringing the real \\"20, 000 Leagues\\" to light. I hope it will attract the interest of many bright and curious young boys and girls of the 21st century when the Sea Wolf and Virginia class subs of the USN have finally equalled the performance of the Nautilus of 1870."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it's not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"For some reason, a few of Verne's many works have become famous in the English speaking world and have even gained some kind of \\"classic\\" status. Unfortunately, these are in my opinion his more superficial and uninteresting novels. 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is a perfect example.Most people would have heard of the idea through some part of culture - the story of Captain Nemo in his submarine (Verne's alleged prophetic vision) and how one outsider is forced through circumstance to join Nemo and his crew on a host of adventures across the seas. This is fine, and that's what the book is. BUT, unlike many better Verne novels, this is ALL it is. It's an adventure story mixed with a description of the various wonders of the udnerwater world (including Atlantis). Don't get me wrong, Verne is good at describing all these things and it's interesting and certainly makes you think about worlds other than your own.What I love about Verne's works such as the Mysterious Island and the 500 Millions of the Beguma is that this is used as a vehicle for some deeper or more interesting messages. Here, the main \\"deeper\\" message is the study of Nemo as a recluse from society - a kind of conscienscious objector (or even hater of humanity if you will), surrounded by his cold machine-like submarine and the predator-like amoral underwater world. In the hands of most writers, this would be sci-fi schlock and it is only Verne that makes it into a good book - but this should not be the work he is renowned for.This book is actually the 2nd in a trilogy, the 1st being In Search of the Castaways and the 3rd being Mysterious Island and I reckon they get progressively better so read the third one!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book is about a man who finds an underwater secret boat.

To be frank, I wavered for about 4 minutes on how to rate this book. Was it a 3 or 4? In the end, I chose the 4 star rating. This book had a wonderful story line, the characters, and the setting where also both wonderful. The things that really drug this book down where Verne's consistent descriptions of things that really, in actuality, could have been left out. He goes on and on classifying fish and giving very, very detailed descriptions of the submarine (The Nautilus), the way it worked, and the things on board. I guess I can understand this, I guess Verne was just trying to give a believable and complete description of the things the characters saw on their journeyIf you could, somehow, get an abridged version, I would reccomend it. This book is great and truth be told, it was worth my time reading it. I just think that unless you're a marine biologist or are just, for some reason, very interest in the classification of oceanic plant and animal life, that 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea would be best read, and probally more enjoyable with some of the 'unimportant to the story' detailed descriptions of the above-mentioned things ...in frank, LEFT OUT. Now, this is not to say that you shouldn't read this book, you should. I'm just forewarning the prospective reader that they will find some parts of the book to be 'boring' with VERY in depth classifications and descriptions. On the other hand, the story is one of great splendor and excitement. Try to remain focused on the story line and keep a clear mind that the descriptions are just Verne's way of trying to give the reader the most in-depth and detailed assessment of the voyage. Now, I know that what I have written so far is not a 'review'. I'm just trying to let people know what kind of a read they will be in for, if they so choose to read the book. Now, as for a real 'review' on what happens in this book? ...Nahhh, read it yourself. I will say this, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea takes you to places,in your mind,betterthan any book I've ever read. You will become attatched to the characters every move and sit in anxiety, with great with anticipation, eager to find out what will happen next in this Sci-Fi classic. So, with all the above information on how the book will lag a bit at times ...I finish with this, Verne's descriptive writting leads many modern day readers into boredom and complaint. If you really open your eyes and embrace Verne's descriptive style, you will learn to enjoy this work, and have an admiration for this classic story and classic storyteller almost unequaled in all of literature. For what it is, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea couldn't have been written better by anyone, ever. Keep your mind open and don't give up on it.

Outside of the three captives, no other characters were well-developed. I would have liked to have gotten to know Captain Nemo a lot better, and what happened in his past that led him to isolate himself from humanity. Since his character is never developed, Captain Nemo ends up being a one-dimensional character with an inexplicable aversion to civilization. The ending is a big cop-out, where no explanation is given in how the characters arrived where they end up. In addition, since the book was originally written in French, it was difficult to read at some points because the text is not well translated, and reads awkwardly. I expected a little more from a book that is regarded as a classic."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is by far Jules Verne's best book. It is a lot better than some of his other famous works (Journey To The Center of the Earth and Around The World In 80 Days for example).

This is viewable on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" with Amazon.All of the other myriad editions seem to be re-issues or adaptations of the first English translation done in 1872 by Lewis Page Mercer (who cut about 20% of Verne's original text and made hundreds of translation errors).The choice between the translations by Frederick Paul Walter and William Butcher might well come down to a matter of style - rather than accuracy in translation - or a preference for a hardcover over a paperback edition. I own the Naval Institute Press edition. I have only seen the other editions on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\".Frederick Paul Walter's Evertype hardback edition (ISBN 978-1904808282) is typeset in \\"Fournier MT\\" which gives the text something of a nineteenth century appearance. There are also black-and-white illustrations - as there are in William Butcher's OUP edition (ISBN 978-0199539277) - which are of the period (but not necessarily thereby of great artistic merit). The dustcover of the Evertype edition shows - for some inextricable reason - a modern photograph of a stingray (where a squid, at least, might have had more relevance to the book).If I were just interested in reading the story I would probably buy the OUP edition which - like my copy of OUP's \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" (also translated by William Butcher) - could be expected to brown-up within a year or two as it's printed on cheap paper (the same as the Penguins of old). If I were buying it as a gift I would probably be tempted to select the Evertype hardcover translation by Frederick Paul Walters (even though I don't know what quality of paper it's printed on or whether the pages are sewn together in quires or just glued together like a cheap paperback)."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is actually my favorite book of all time next to Ivanhoe, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Man in the Iron Mask, and The War of the Worlds. I read this book in fourth grade and absolutely loved it. Now that I'm 3 years older, I appreciate it even more. Though there were some hard words, I loved the dialogue. There is even humor when Professor Aronnax explains how pearls are made and says, &quot;Yes, my boy, oysters can produce many sharks&quot; because he is scared to go shark hunting. Captain Nemo is a mysterious yet interesting character. My favorite parts are when they are at the sunken ship in the Mediterranean Sea, when they fight the giant squid, and when they are at Ceylon. Some of their other travels take them to the lost continent of Atlantis, a tunnel under the Suez Canal, and through the Great Ice Barrier. This is my favorite Jules Verne book, though it has some competition from Around the Moon and Journey to the Center of the Earth. This book is a must-have for science lovers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and the ocean. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"It's a great story, no question.

Not only is it a riveting novel with a brilliant plot it is also an accurate prediction of the future. I have never read a book that is so flawlessly combines the disparate worlds of science and story telling. Verne's writing style grabbed me from the get go, yet he never sacrifices any detail. Verne pulls you into another reality and where you never know what is going to happen next. Even in its most technical moments Verne's masterpiece demands your attention. Most people know the gist of the story. Three men are held captive in an extraordinary submarine vessel, the Nautilus, led by the Captain Nemo, a man who has left the human world to live under the sea. If you read the book you will find that there is much more to this story than you originally believed. Verne is also very accurate in predicting how a submarine would work. His Nautilus uses many of the same devices as the real submarines of the future!Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"In English speaking countries, 20,000 is considered a classic boy's book, but in France, it is considered a work of literature. The two translators of this version have gone back to the original French, and made a new translation. Turns out, the common translation that we are used to is full of mistranslations and ommissions of anti-English sentiments. Frankly, I didn't think the new translation adds that much more to the story, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and annotations. The translators take a boyish glee when they find and error or ommission that, to me, added a bit to the story. I'd recommend this version over the older translation. If you've read this story before, I think you will enjoy the annotations most."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Jules Verne wrote this book in 1870. It has startling technological references (even in the concept of the submarine) but even more stunning was the Nuclear Reactor on board.I feel that some episodes of Star Trek (the original series) are models on Jules Verne, because behind the backdrop of the technology and adventure, there exists the social evils of slavery, colonialism and nihilism as well as genocide.The story is about Captain Nemo who is epic, driven and something good that is so strongly polar he is actually lead into a path of destruction - and his crew. The story is told through the eyes of Professor Aronnax. The usage of an observant intellectual to explain the dark pathos of a main character was rather popular in that era (think Watson and Holmes).In this instance it is important because Nemo destroys a vessel with all hands and then bows before a picture of his wife and children. The implication is that his family where kidnapped (or killed) as slaves.At anyrate, if you love steampunk culture, Star Trek social complexity, and classical literature you will love 20000 Leagues Under the Sea."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"For some reason, even after reading this book, my brain still translates \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" to mean 20000 leagues DOWN instead of a DISTANCE. What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.\\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was one of the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"ok its a good book with a plot that a 3rd grader can understand i know this because i read it in second grade so a 3rd grader should have an easier time. and as far as the word that someone complained about you need to read context clue plus they are not that hard. this is a good book and show the predictions that Verne made. like scuba diving and nuclear power in the 1860's. and btw thats scuba diving with tanks of oxygen and thin wet suits to keep you warm truely he was a genious. i would buy this book read the whole book 3 times during the year but only when i am boged down or i have trouble with my studies."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book is, by far, one of the best books I have read in the last year.

I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising. And there's an entire website devoted to blue prints and 3D models.Closing thoughts: I much prefer the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

The narrator, Dr. Arronax, is a French naturalist who goes on an expedition to hunt down a mysterious sea creature spotted by many sailors. However, in an interesting turn of events, he finds out that the enigma that roamed the oceans is in fact a futuristic submarine (the Nautilus) built by Captain Nemo. Dr. Annonax, along with his Flemish companion Conseil and Canadian harpooner Ned Land, are held hostage on the Nautilus and through their time aboard they experience the great wonders of the seas. Giant squids, ice caps, pearl hunts, close calls with Papuan natives, are only a fraction of the exciting events they experience.Using Arronax as the narrator, Verne gives us a look into the mysteries of the deep seas. While Arronax often gets carried away labeling and categorizing sea life, it makes the narrative seem more authentic. I felt a little cheated about not learning the life story of the brilliant and enigmatic Captain Nemo. We learn that he is driven by revenge, yet we don't know exactly why and who is his unfortunate target. However, this lack of revelation allows the reader to create his/her own theories, which can be quite fun.This book may not be for action junkies, as shown by previous reviews.

Swim with them in this watery book!Opinions:1. This amazing book tells a tale of adventure with a subsurface of mystery. There are ocean bottoms hit and secrets kept, poles reached and mysteries left unsolved. What really kept me going while reading this book was the sheer anticipation of what was yet to come. It is wonderful material for people like me to get their hands on. I like to learn a little bit about the world while still reading a book that is fictionous and fun to read. For example, it talked about the main characters going inside an extinct volcano while describing the chamber of the volcano in explicit detail.2. The book tells the reader a bit about what life was like 1866 while still being an adventure-themed and fun to read book. It described many daring actions and risks, while still giving facts on geography I never even knew about. It told me about how a boat was run back then and also spoke about some species of fish through Conseil's classification.3. Jules Verne never explained why the title mentioned 20,000 leagues. The Nautilus never went farther than 4000 leagues down under the waves.4. I believe that this book is meant for people ages 10+ because some of the things in there might not be comprehensible to a person aged 9 or lower.RecommendationI would recommend this book to people wanting to be oceanographers because it talks about some things you may not have known about the sea.

There is something to be said about his incredible imagination and his grasp of scientific principles that were well ahead of his time. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is the voyage of Prof. Arronax, along with his companions Ned and Conseil, who have found themselves on board the Nautilus, an incredible submarine designed by the mysterious Captain Nemo. The Nautilus crew lives esclusively in the oceans and seas, surfacing only to replenish oxygen. Throughout the journey, they experience breath-taking sights, heart-pounding adventures, and perilous obstacles. Jules Verne does a beautiful job constructing this submarine world, even inventing new sea creatures to fit into his story. Scarcely a chapter goes by without some new or legendary creature sneaking in to liven up the seascape. However, I think where this story falls short is in its flow. I understand that the story is written from Prof. Arronax's point of view, which is that of a scientist, but each chapter contains several paragraphs of virtually useless information, be it readings from the nautical instruments or long lists of aquatic animals (including their class, genus, and species). This detracts from the overall flow of the story and I believe could have been left out.

The United States Government sends Professor Arronnax out to sea on the ship called the Abraham Lincoln to search for the monster. Professor Arronnax and his servant, Conseil, set out on the adventure.Professor Arronnax soon learns that the monster is really a steel-plated submarine, called the Nautilus.

Nemo rams the Nautilus into a war ship one day because he believes the people on the ship are responsible for killing his family and taking everything away from him that he loves. Professor Arronnax realizes that Captian Nemo is crazy and that they must escape. Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted plan their escape only to learn that the Nautilus was caught up in the Maelstrom, the most violent whirlpool in the world. No ship had ever escaped the current of the Maelstrom! Do Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted escape the Nautilus and the violent whirlpool or do they drown in the whirlpool and sink to the bottom of the sea?I chose to read this book because I like adventure books and this certainly has adventure and excitement in it. I think that anyone who enjoys reading adventure stories should purchase this book because the characters go to many different places and always are in constant danger. I could not put the book down! This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I think that everyone will like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea because it is such an interesting book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I think that someone who likes science fiction and mystery would like this book a lot. Someone who likes this book would also probably enjoy scuba diving, swimming, spear fishing, and boating. They also might enjoy oceanography, marine biology, hiking, and snorkeling.I really liked this book. One of the reasons that I liked this book is because it was very exciting. There was always action happening, for example, when the giant squid attacked the Nautilus. The characters were realistic and intriguing. I particularly liked Conseil because he was Professor Aronnax's servant and was extremely loyal. The plot seemed like it could be very real. I learned a lot about different geographic settings. The author frequently described the shorelines in detail."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"The best translation in English. Satisfies the intellect and imagination. Translated to show the truly beautiful qualities of Verne's writing that no other version can equal. The adventure comes alive by not omitting the breadth and depth of Verne's aesthetic ability originally entrenched within this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This is the first book that I &quot;experienced&quot; from Jules Verne. He is certainly a master in mixing scientific facts with literary fiction. A true visionary. Although I have seen various movie versions, I was still surprised at some of the events in this story. The book seemed to move along well besides a relatively slow begining. It has everything a great story should have. Mystery, adventure, action, exotic locations and even a bit of romance, albeit it is with Nemo and the Sea.This particular version was an &quot;audio book&quot; performed by Harlan Ellison. His narration was inspired. I also enjoyed his voice characterizations, especially the impersonation of James Mason's Captain Nemo. It had a reminiscent quality. Music and sound effects would have been a nice touch as long as it wouldn't be distracting. For me, the book ended too quickly. I wanted to hear more of their adventures and would have also liked to have read more about Nemo's past. Although, Verne does tell us more in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. Another book I shall look forward in taking up soon. I am sure it will be an equally pleasing experience."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"It's indeed ironic that great works of literature are censored, not only prior to publication, but also after the books hit the shelves. Depending on a period and country, even a incontroversial author like Jules Verne suffered from closed-mindedness. That totalitarian regimes see fit to burn books, or to actively block publication and distribution of some books, in hope that the nation will not see the uneasy point of view often expressed in books - that fact does not surprise anyone anymore nowadays. But that such practices have been utilized in the land of the free and the brave - makes us wonder how different these two systems are. What had poor Verne done to deserve censorship? \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" was censored prior to publication, and the original manuscript never saw the day during Verne's lifetime. Against his will the author had to cut the social commentary from his trilogy, of which this novel is the first volume. By today's standards, the punishment was incomparable to the guilt, but even then it was disturbing that a work of fiction, a splendid tale of adventure written for the purpose of entertainment and education of the reader, not a political pastiche, mind you, had to have been censored. In particular, the crucial part of the novel had been cut, one in which we learn what were the origins of Captain Nemo, his motivations and heritage. Only years later, after Verne's death, the original manuscript was published, to reveal that Verne originally intended Nemo to have been a Polish nobleman, who escaped his Vaterland after the failure of the 1863 uprising against the Russian Empire. Nemo decided to remove himself from the society, literally from human view - by constructing the famous Nautilus, a submarine, in which he cruised the tranquil abyss of the oceans, where no hand would touch him, and where he wouldn't have to stand the pettiness and cruelty of his fellow human beings.Thus, if you happened to have read the censored version, you would be genuinely puzzled as to the motivations of the Captain. Today, many abridged versions of Verne's novels appear in print, where most of the content is done away with, and what is left is the bare-bones action storyline. To mutilate the book in this way is to commit an unforgivable crime in general, and to hurt the author and readers in particular. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" deserves to be widely read just as it had been intended by the author, with its wealth of scientific and prophetic information left untouched, with the commentaries and philosophical musings intact. Only then, within the grand context, the adventure makes sense, only then it is art. I have read this novel circa twenty times; I have admired Captain Nemo for years; I have held my breath in the depths of the Golfstr&ouml;m in the Norwegian Sea during the storm, and during many thrilling moments in the book, not to mention the unforgettable conclusion of the novel; I have tried to solve the mystery of the waterborne ship made of steel, with its many complicated instruments; I have followed the arguments hurled between the Captain and the involuntary passengers of the Nautilus; and finally, I was trembling all over whenever I reached the culmination of the adventure. Verne was a genius, and Captain Nemo was his most original character creation, one I am very fond of for personal reasons, as is I am sure the case with many other readers of the prophetic French author."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"THIS IS A CLASSIC THIS IS A CLASSIC.

Although they are in a sense prisoners, they are allowed to use all the facilities aboard the submarine. This submarine, powered by nuclear energy and christened the Nautilus, is one of Verne's many brilliant predictions of modern life made throughout many of his works. This like may others was correct. Through out the book, the reader gains a vast knowledge of marine life, and the lives of people in distant lands.The book begins when Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of the story, boards an American frigate commissioned to investigate a rash of attacks on international shipping by what is thought to be an amphibious monster. The supposed sea creature, which is actually the submarine Nautilus, sinks Aronnax's vessel and imprisons him along with his devoted servant Conseil and Ned Land, a temperamental harpooner. When they are returned to their senses, the find themselves inside a dark, gloomy, desolate, endless, predicament. They are locked in a cell. However they soon meet Captain Nemo who agrees to let them move about the ship freely on one condition. They must remain aboard the Nautilus. So begins a great adventure of a truly fantastic voyage from the pearl-laden waters of Ceylon to the icy dangers of the South Pole, as Captain Nemo, one of the greatest villains ever created, takes his revenge on all society.The detail that Verne pours into this book is amazing. This is one of the few books that are capable of making the readers feel that they are actually there. His descriptions of how the Nautilus operates, how Nemo's crew harvests food and his account of hunting on Hawaii are excellent, and the plot never falters. The characters are wonderfully scripted; each one having their own unique personality, and they are weaved flawlessly into the awe filled spectacle.This is the book that predicted that there would be submarines, and that submarines would eventually go to the South Pole. It predicted the development of the SCUBA suit; it even predicted nuclear powered ships. The technology used in this book makes it easy to understand even today. This book is widely recognized as a classic- in my view, correctly."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"this is William Robson's translation, which was published around 1853.

Every intelligent person with an open mind will find this book a must read."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Jules Verne's, &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read, possibly the best. The book is so easy to follow and read. The book seems to just flow as you are reading, for there are many stopping points in the book; unlike some books which contain 30 paged chapters. This book has a total of 46 chapters, none of them being more than fifteen pages long. I enjoy these kinds if books because it lets you read 5 or 6 chapters at a time, and not make you go so into extreme detail so you do not get bored. The main character, Professer Aronnax, tells the book. He is a very intelligent individual who is a Professor of Natural History in Paris during the late 1800's. He and his faithful servant, Conseil, are assigned to an expedition with many other chosen men by the French Government, including a Canadian Harpooner named Ned Land, to rid the seas of a little known and terrifying sea monster.

Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Regular readers of [...] won't be surprised to learn that the first book I read on the Kindle was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. There's something so right about reading a century-old tale -- whose narrator is enthralled with the power of electricity -- on a device that's a pretty darn enthralling use of electricity.That said, in exploring how the image of technology and the future has changed over time, few books are as influential as this one. Some observations:1. Captain Nemo's built himself a utopia. Consider that he says the Nautilus is out of reach from tyrants and built so well that it can't be damaged by nature. Nemo says he's never been as free as when he put himself inside the sub. There's a library with nearly unlimited information. The ocean provides an unlimited amount of food. Everyone's healthy thanks to the constant temperature and fresh sea air. Electricity, described as providing light \\"more uniform and continuous than the sun\\" and behaving \\"more obedient than gas\\" provides an unlimited amount of power. Sounds like every other golden age longed for through time, but this one is all thanks to technology--and especially electricity.2. The constant use of extreme detail in the book, going on for pages and pages about what the fish look like and rattling off measurements, give the fantasy parts of the book much more credence. It's a lesson on the benefits of getting granular when selling a vision of the future.3. There's a great passage where, on behalf of science, Verne snobbily says, \\"It was Tasman who discovered this group in 1643, the year Torricelli invented the barometer and Louis XIV mounted the throne. I leave the reader to decide which of these events has been more useful to the human race.\\" This wasn't the first time an innovator scoffed at a politician, but it's certainly one of the sharpest.

The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I don't pretend to be a literary know-it-all. I know about as much about classic literature as I do about moose hunting...and that ain't much. For whatever reason, I thought it might make me a more cultured and enlightened person if I read some of the old school fiction. You know, the authors that nobody ever mentions unless you're in an English class. They may be crusty, but they're considered to have written some of the greatest novels ever.While my trek through the classics is still at its infancy, I decided to take that journey 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that Jules Verne has been begging me to take ever since I was a wee lad. I've always noticed the various covers of this book over the years, often featuring a giant squid attacking either a submarine or some guy in an old-timey diving suit, or even both. Sometimes there's a treasure chest involved, too. It's no wonder that the book has always peaked my interest. How could you go wrong with such an inviting cover. It was about time that I figured out what was up with this Captain Nemo guy I'd always heard about.Through virtually the entire book, you have basically only four characters. Captain Nemo, of course, is the one everyone's heard of. He's the mysterious commander of an astonishing vehicle for its time, an electric submarine called The Nautilus. Professor Arronax, his servent Conseil, and Ned Land, a noted French-canadian harpooner, end up as captives aboard Nemo's strange vessel and are taken along for a voyage across the globe. The sights that they encounter are incredible. Creatures never imagined, lost treasure, undersea eruptions, and long-sunken vessels. The adventures are high ones, as they take the dangerous trip beneath the polar ice cap and even visit the lost city of Atlantis.I guess you could call it high adventure, but surprisingly, it's not all that exciting. The journey 20,000 Leagues Under the sea is a slow, plodding one. Sandwiched in between a fairly compelling beginning and ending is a wordy, overly explanatory middle filled with obscene amounts of nautical and technical jargon, yet devoid of much stimulating drama.I have no doubt that in the 1800s Jules Verne's descriptive prose awed readers to the wonders of the sea and underwater travel. In this day and age, however, the bar has been raised considerably and the story itself is very underwhelming for the modern read. The average person has been able to witness for themselves much of the stuff that Verne describes in such painstaking detail, either through television or trips to aquariums and the like. Much of the book simply isn't as extraordinary as it was 100 years ago. While the sea still holds great mystery, it's not near as foreign to us as it was back then.If you're not aroused by the technical workings of a submarine, or of the many food dishes that you can make out of sea life, there's not much else there for the average reader. The plot is more centered around situations conceived to further describe Captain Nemo's crazy contraption, The Nautilus, than it is to actually weave an interesting story. After the first few chapters, I was bored, save for a few bits here and there, until the last few chapters when it began to pick back up again.I trudged on, however, anxious to finish so I can get to the next book, hoping that it will be less yawn-inducing. If you're like me and wanting to tackle those classics, save 20,000 Leagues for the end. Pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World or War of the Worlds instead. Both are far superior. Heck, I'd even rather read Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, at least it was shorter. But like I said earlier, I'm no expert in the classics, maybe I just missed the boat, err...submarine, on this one."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Having seen the movie a couple times this was the first time I read the book and was surprised to see a significant number of unexpected differences. Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is arguably the first technical thriller, launching a genre which has since grown wildly in popularity and includes most of Michael Chricton's work. It is a very imaginative book, the story of the mysterious Captain Nemo -haunted by an implied but never explained past - who has built for himself and his crew the submarine Nautilus to be free of the laws of man and to live successfully and sustainably on the bounty of the world's oceans, which he intrepidly explores in all its wonders. Inevitably he is chased by the main characters, Ned the Harpooner, Mr. Arronax the professor and Conseil his man-servant, in the frigate USS Abraham Lincoln. Unlike the movie the story is told entirely by Mr. Arronax and Ned is more a minor character, and a stolid Canadian as opposed to the boisterous and fun loving American in the movie. Also unlike the movie the Nautilus does not sink the Lincoln, but in a duel vents it with steam that throws our three main characters overboard whom are then rescued after the Lincoln, ignorant to the fact they are no longer onboard, retreats from the scene.Thus begins a promising story of mystery and adventure, the possible drama of Captain Nemo being chased by worldly forces in his incredible Nautilus, the tension between the captives who are experiencing the amazing wonders of the ocean depths firsthand and their captor who cannot ever let them go without losing his own freedom, and the chance for exciting adventures. While all of these things are delivered in the book, they are done so very anachronistically (obviously), with the drama, tension and adventure being there - and being very creatively crafted - but also being very subdued and literally drowned in an ocean of Mr. Arronax describing the latin names of the sea life he sees outside the Nautilus's window. This captures the fascination of the age with Natural History versus today's focus on excitement and adventure in these types of novels. There are many times were the book gets very, very dry as the author rattles of names that you have no idea what they refer to, and even if you google them the only hits you will get are the passages in the book itself! Based on this, the fact that this translation cuts out some 20% of the book is probably not a bad thing.Nonetheless there are some great moments of natural beauty and adventure. Jules Verne showed some incredible predictive power in describing the structural design, diving operations and maneuverability, and life support systems of a submarine, being basically spot on before anything beyond the Turtle of Revolutionary War heritage had ever been put to sea. The myriad undersea \\"terrains\\" the characters experience are particularly cool and fun. Relative to the movie the giant squid attack is underwhelming, but a much better scene that never made it to the film is one where after discovering the south pole (something Verne got wrong obviously) the Nautilus is caught in between two icebergs and must dig itself out before its air supply runs out. But there are some drawbacks too. There are some shockingly dark moments for a book aimed towards younger men from the 1860's which seem to imply they are leading somewhere and could have been great plot tension builders, but they are never fully fleshed out, and neither is the character they are supposed to be windows into, the reclusive, tortured yet brilliant Captain Nemo. The book ends quickly and inconclusively, feeling like a great set up for a story that ends as more travel log than character story or adventure yarn. Nonetheless the book is short and relatively easy to read despite it's older grammatical style which can sound very strange today.The job the publisher did however is spotty. The cover design of the book is very well done, but the editing is poor with many glaring typos throughout the text.All in all the movie is much better as a movie than a direct adaptation of the book would have been, with Ned Land turned into a main character that an American audience can connect with (unlike the highly intellectual and uninspiring Mr. Arronax as main character of the book or the turgid Canadian version of Ned Land), Captain Nemo is more explained as a character and pitted more against Mr. Arronax as two opposing sides of a moral coin, and the movie has a more solid story and conclusion. But the book has it's own advantages and overall is worth reading, especially for its historical significance."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This one of the best Jules Verne books.

Even though this book was filled with information about electricity, how it gets it from the sea, how much the \\"Nautilus\\" weighs in tonnes, how the \\"Nautilus\\" can reach the speed of 50 miles per hour etc. it still was a marvellous book. Jules Verne puts stacks of information into this book. But here's the amazing bit of this information. This book was first published in 1871. 1871?Why 1871?Nothing like electricity was invented in 1871. Or other stuff. Jules Verne imagined science when hardly any of it was invented. None of it. None of it at all. That's why, 20,000 leagues under the sea and other of his novels were amazing.Also, the characters in this novel are likeable. The nature and the stuff Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real while reading this classic. The peculiar but wonderful character of Captain Nemo makes this book wonderful to read.This book appeals to children and adults.In 1866, a strange thing at sea captures everybody by surprise. It is some sort of peculiar monster or floating reef. The \\"Helvetia\\", \\"Columbus\\", \\"Scotia\\" and \\"Shannon\\" all spot this creature. People wonder what exactly is it. Pierre Arronax, Proffesor of the Museum of Paris is called by Captain Farragut of the \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" to capture this gigantic cetacean with all these harpooners, especially one called Ned Land. Ned Land is strong and full of uncommon skill. He is also a Canadian. When Pierre Arronax falls off ship, after Land aims his harpoon at the creature, jets of water spray on the bridge of the ship which throws many people off into the dangerous waters. The propeller and rudder are broken. Two other people who join Pierre are Conseil and Land. The creature was actually a submarine called the \\"Nautilus\\". It takes the three into it where they meet the mysterious Captain Nemo...Further on they meet savages, giant octopuses and indulge with the wonderful sea life which makes this wonderful tale enjoyable. But all with Captain Nemo. The four take on a ride of their life. Thanks to Jules Verne people have been excited since. Buy this and treasure forever. I have an old 1954 edition.This probablyis his best book of all. Other books include Round The World In 80 Days, Mysterious Island and other Verne books.+++++By StephenK"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Book Review by Spencer LantosI read 2000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. What this book is about is people who go under the sea to make discoveries. In the book they face some chalanges such as bad weather being attacked by sea monsters and being attacked by Indians. In the end of the book they find what their looking for but I can't give that away.My opinion on this book was it was good. It had lots of action and if you like adventure books I think you would enjoy this book. Their aren't very many boring parts of this book, and it almost never annoying. Whenever a good part of the book is over a new one starts and that is what I like about it.I would recommend this book because I liked it a lot. The reason I liked I said before It has a lot of action which I enjoyed so if you like science fiction books about traveling under water and fighting sea creatures I would recommend this book. If you don't then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Reading the original version was great and disappointing. Don't get me wrong Wells has always been one of my favorites. But Hollywood has changed the story, quite a bit.It was a pleasure to read it as it was written."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"A classic book I never read.

Jules Verne brings you on a fantastic journey under the sea with amazing detail and vivid descriptions.

The story is still fresh and informative. To be sure, Verne got some of the technical things wrong, but considering how technology has advanced and more is known, he got it mostly right. I've wanted to read this since I was a kid, and I am sorry I waited until I retired. Some of the biological naming discussions get somewhat tedious, but as a whole the story is great! However, don't think it is quite like the Walt Disney movie version, because it is not. It starts out that way, but proceeds through the story in a somewhat different way, and ends differently. However, the attack of the giant squid is quite exciting to read, and Verne's descriptive talents are quite obvious. I read it on my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it. Dive in!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"It's amazing to consider how prescient this book was, in its descriptions of submarine travel. The extensive descriptions of oceanic life border, at times, on tedious, but must have been novel and more exciting to the original audience. The main shortcoming of the book is that very little explanation is given of Captain Nemo's background or motivation until the last few chapters, and even then only a hint and a shadow of explanation are given.This is apparently not the best English translation, but it was not too difficult."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I've always liked this book and it reads well on my HTC one X.

The story is generally gripping and the character of Captain Nemo is an interesting and nuanced one - neither truly villainous nor heroic - but Verne gets bogged down in some of the details. Yes, I know the main character and narrator is an ichthyologist, but do I really need all of the \\"World of Fish\\" moments where he describes - in excruciating detail - ALL of the fish and other marine life that the crew of the Nautilus encounter whilst journeying around the underwater world on their anti-colonial crusade? I signed up for an adventure novel, not a Jacques Cousteau special. Oh well, when it works it works well and Verne will have you interested to the very end. The translation from the French in this edition reads well and the paperback quality is good enough. Recommended, but prepare to skip large portions of \\"World of Fish.\\""},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I was so excited that I found this book for free!

I also liked it that the translator(s) corrected errors they perceived in the book itself, and they gave reasons for such corrections. This showed that even at the publishing stage, mistakes can creep in. It is a pity that the 1878 (79?) translation by an English writer mangled the novel, but then he was English translating a French writer.......Good for students at school who may be studying the book for English literature."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"Still great after all these years.

I love science fiction and classic novels so Verne should be perfect for me, right? Well... I can't say that Verne wasn't influential and his ideas are spectacular which is why so many movies have been based on his books but I have yet to read a Verne book that exceeded or even met my expectations.First, all his characters, despite different names and motivations, are all the same; perfect English gentlemen. This is not uncommon for writers from this era but when a Canadian harpooner like Ned Land uses phrases like \`By Jove' it rings false. Rudyard Kipling wrote Captains Courageous 27 years later and created sailors that felt absolutely authentic. Verne's characters seem to be created for a specific purpose. Captain Nemo is there to explain in detail the working of his Nautilus and other inventions while Professor Aronnax's role is to gush over Nemo's discoveries. I don't believe that any of the other members of Nemo's crew ever say a single word in the book and are simply window dressing.The second big problem is that Verne's science is often dubious. I'm not talking about science that was still questionable in Verne's time but established science and physical facts going way back. Verne seems completely unaware of things like encumbrance or the effects of high elevation. In this book Verne's consistently and often dramatically increases the size of sea life. Also, it can be somewhat dull reading constant facts and figures about the speed, depth, volume of air etc of the Nautilus. The book just goes on and on with Nemo relaying fact after fact while M. Aronnax listens in rapt attention. It also spends a near eternity describing all of the flora and fauna and without an actual plot to pin it to it gets very dull. The layout of the Nautilus is very unrealistic with no apparent attempt to maximize the usage of space. Nemo has a full size organ in his spacious cabin. Actual submarines are very constrained spaces.In order to create a compelling story Disney greatly expanded on Nemo's quest for revenge which is barely mentioned in the book. Disney also greatly expanded Ned Land's role to the improvement of the story and did a very nice bit of casting having him played by Kirk Douglas. The famous scene where the Nautilus is attacked by a giant squid (multiple squids in the book) only occupies a couple of pages. Mostly the book is just the Nautilus cruising all over the world occasionally getting stuck. That's about it. It's as if Verne couldn't come up with a plot to wrap around his idea of a mysterious captain and his incredible machine.I have read quite a few of Verne's novels but this one may have the most anemic plot of them all. 20,000 is leagues is much more serious than \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and \`In Search of the Castaways' (which I really didn't enjoy) but it's not particularly compelling. This is a rare occasion where I think the famous movie version was an improvement over the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I have seen the movie (needs to be remade wih today special effects come on Disney) and really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I love it, because it&#8217;s giving you a description on the old model of the submarine and an underwater life."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"I've read this so many times I had to get it on my kindle.
