Perhaps it's close to my own world-view (read: left-field and cynical). But I urge you to give it a try (or two).I'm always absurdly curious why someone differs in opinion from me, but those who panned this tremendous novel never bothered to state more than their (by itself insignificant) dissatisfaction.

Heller mixes vivid scenes of slapstick comedy with genuinely shocking incidents without the usual jarring that is found whenever an inexperienced author attempts the same.Heller's real accomplishment is his cast of characters. Most authors just stick with one or two central characters, but Heller gives us a whole battalion of men, each with individual weaknesses and strengths. Also, unlike so many other war stories, this is truly memorable - for years afterwards you'll recall with a smile Milo's impossibly complicated scams, Natley's desperate search for his whore and Yossarian's wry outlook on life.In fact, there are only two problems with this book: firstly, as the book draws to a close, Heller appears to be in a desperate rush to get rid of his characters (presumably so that when Yossarian attempts his final escape, there's not that much tying him back). Secondly, the chapter &quot;The Eternal City&quot; is just awful - it reads like the book Adrian Mole is writing in Sue Townsend's &quot;Adrian Mole: the Wilderness Years&quot; and is so totally depressing it doesn't gel with the rest of the book.Still, two minor glitches in what is surely one of the most superlative books of this or any milennium."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I had a friend who didn't like this book because she took it way too seriously.

If you lighten up and prepare yourself for a very funny satire, you're in for the literary treat of your life. Heller makes so much sense when he pokes fun, and the situations he puts his characters in are ludicrously funny and outrageous. If you find yourself asking questions like, \\"How could there be a person named Major Major Major?\\" or waking up at 2am in a sweaty rage, catatonically screaming, \\"It's inhumane for Colonel Scheisskopf to want to bolt his soldier's arms to their legs to make them march straighter!\\", and yes, Scheisskopf DOES mean what you think it means, then you may have this book mistaken with Heller's other famous piece, \\"Absolute True Facts About World War II and the Heroic Soldier's Related\\"*.

Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is renown for being one of the greatest satirical war novels of all time. Heller's novel possesses great depth. The book is obviously anti-war but it also attacks many other problems that lie within our society. Heller attacks bureaucracies, capitalistic corporations, and other organizations that use individuals to benefit themselves. Heller's novel is directed to anyone who is fed up with being used as a tool of success for another person. The book is directed to anyone who is against war. Catch-22 is also directed to anyone who wants a laugh. In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully portrays an anti-war masterpiece using humor, corruption, and hope.In order for someone to fully understand Catch-22, he or she must understand the context of the novel. This novel was written in the 1950's. This was a time where many Americans viewed World War II as a heroic success. Those involved in the combat had differing views on the subject. Joseph Heller was a bombardier for the Air Force during World War II. Catch-22 is based largely on Heller's experiences in the war. Through his novel, Heller is expressing his detest for war. An element that one must take into account when reading Heller's novel is that he wrote Catch-22 using extreme satire. The reader must not take everything written seriously or he or she will not grasp the message Heller is trying to convey.Heller's novel Catch-22 revolves primarily around the actions and feelings of the protagonist, Yossarian. Yossarian desperately wants to be grounded. He can't be grounded though because he asked to be. Since he asked to be grounded that proved that he was indeed sane. If a man was insane he would want to fly more missions, therefore he could be grounded. Even if a man were insane and decided to ask to be grounded he could not be since he asked to be grounded therefore proving that he is actually sane. The preceding passage describes Catch-22. \\"Doc Daneeka replied, \`Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\" (55). Yossarian spends most of the novel faking illnesses and finding other ways to get out of flying. It is near the end of the novel when Yossarian takes a walk through the eternal city of Rome. Yossarian is in Nately's whore's apartment with all of the girls (prostitutes) missing except for one old lady. This lady explains another aspect of Catch-22. \\"Catch-22 says they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing\\" (417). The woman is referring to how the soldiers came and took all of the girls from the apartment. Once the woman says this to Yossarian he realizes that Catch-22 doesn't truly exist. It is an inexistent rule used to control people. After Yossarian realizes this he retreats to the city where he sees all of the horrors of the world. It is in Rome where he is arrested for being in the city without a pass. After he is arrested, Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn gave Yossarian a proposal. They will send him back to the States if he pretends to promote the war. \\"Be our pal. Say nice thing about us here and back in the States. Become one of the boys. Now, that isn't asking too much, is it?\\" (436). Yossarian accepts the proposal but breaks it. He cannot promote the war effort. Instead Yossarian decides to run away to Sweden. Yossarian runs because he can no longer be controlled and is ready to live a life of freedom.There is no doubt to whether Heller successfully executed his goals in writing this novel. It is evident through his writing that Heller truly detested the war and everything about it. He successfully uses humor in discussing a controversial issue. Catch-22 suggests many problems within the United States Militia. One of these problems is the traumatic affect of combat on soldiers. This idea is present through Yossarian and Snowden. Snowden was a young bombardier who died in Yossarian's arms. In result, Yossarian is always having flashbacks to the moment of Snowden's death. Although Heller's novel covered many issues it didn't touch on many common themes within war novels. One idea that is not present in Heller's writing in patriotism. None of the men in the novel act like they are fighting for their country. They don't show pride in what they do. This can be expected though since it is an anti-war novel. Heller distinguishes himself from other anti- war novelists in the sense of style. Unlike others, Heller uses satire to express his feelings on war.Although Heller's novel is entertaining and comical I don't entirely agree with his stance on issues regarding war. Through his writing Heller seems to find everything about war to be wrong. I personally feel that war is indeed wrong but is essential at crucial times. It seems as though Heller feels war is the worse thing on the face of the earth.In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully displays his beliefs on war. He touches on ideas such as corruption, deception, and violence in his novel. Heller was one of the first people to write an anti-war novel and did so even though he was a former member of the Air Force. Heller uses satire magnificently to illuminate on certain idiotic aspects of war. Catch-22 is a masterpiece of literature and everyone owes it to themselves to read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 tells the tortuous story of Yossarian, a WW2 bombardier, who starts to lose (or regain) his sanity after a member of his crew is killed during a bombing mission. As Yossarian loses more of his friends to enemy fire, bizarre accidents and strange twists of fate, the storyline becomes ever more convoluted and the characters ever more bizarre.At its heart, this book is about how soldiers handle war. How they justify their actions and how they live with the constant threat of death or injury. Heller illustrates the confusion and senselessness of war by using bizarre events and crooked logic. The book is filled with black humor and quickly moves from one outlandish event to the next.In my opinion, this book has two major weaknesses. The first, is one of the hallmarks of this book: Heller builds his sentences to suggest an idea, only to immediately contradict himself. I found this to be very amusing for the first 100 pages or so, but this style simply became tedious afterwards. The second problem is the book's non-chronological plot. Heller keeps skipping back and forth in time and this makes the book hard to read and the plot difficult to follow.I found the book's real strength to be in its amazing and phenomenally well developed characters. Yossarian, Doc. Daneeka, Orr, Major Major and many more, are all extraordinarily alive and yet fundamentally flawed.Did I enjoy this book? Yes. All in all, this is a book worth reading, but don't expect an easy read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is damnably funny. But it suffers as Monty Python's &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot; does - without a defined plot, it is incapable of sustaining a compelling narrative. Its midsection is bogged down with situations invented solely to amuse. It begins wonderfully and ends well, but the middle lays on the black comedy too thick. Heller tries too hard to be funny, and it turns repetitive, which makes it difficult to read all the way through.There are many, many characters. For a comedy they fit their purpose, but as a novel some are simply superfluous, inflating an already long book to even longer proportions. Scheisskopf, for example, in addition to being needlessly vulgar (German for &quot;s**t-head&quot;), has no effect on the plot, nor influence on any characters. Had Heller exercised his right to excise, he could have safely clipped 100 pages. Do we need 2 separate chapters on Milo's escapades as a celebrated food smuggler? Ideas once fresh run foul by the final 3rd of the book's length.Yet Catch-22 is brilliant, despite these surface flaws. The humor is definitely funny the characters memorable, if ersatz, and the rapport between soldiers seemingly real and certainly surreal. But only brilliant, not genius. Slaughterhouse-5 is genius - similarly, it paints World War 2 as absurd, poignant, and occasionally home to black humor, but Vonnegut's book dives deep into a few subjects while Catch-22 chooses to skim lightly over several."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The only way to endure a book about war and the constant hell of bombing runs, to my mind, is if it is desperately funny in a black-humor sort of way. Joseph Heller's masterpiece is exactly that. On an Italian island during WWII, Captain Yossarian and a whole base full of nuts are trying very hard not to get killed, while trying to finish enough of their tour of duty to be sent home, which means they have to go into danger in order to avoid it. Makes no sense? Neither does anything else in this book, except the dangerous, subversive kind of sense that suggests the whole thing -- the war, the military, even authority itself -- make no sense either. I love this book because it takes a serious subject and weaves in non-stop humor; the modern equivalent is the very funny Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which will have you belly-laughing as you consider the impacts of genocide. I have the highest respect for these novels -- because they entertain and make me think -- and that's a lot."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've tried to get through this book before, but was never successful. Another \\"war\\" story, complete with machismo and death and fight scenes. Having finished the book, I now know that it is a \\"war\\" story , complete with the pain, the camaraderie, and the illogic of warfare. \\"Catch-22\\" is not meant as an accurate portrayal of WWII, but instead as an farce; a parody in which it is petty local politics and self aggrandizement motivate the fighting, and the higher ups are more ashamed of \\"black eyes\\" than casualties. Hmmmm, maybe it is more true to life then I thought...With the abandonment of logic comes a high degree of frustration. I was so frustrated with this book that I stopped reading at several points. Many of the situations are so ludicrous that you cry out in anguish. But that was Heller's intention - he wanted me to feel just a hint of the frustration the main character, Yosarian, felt as he tries to get discharged from an Army that is as much Orwell as it is Eisenhower. So I embraced my frustration, and laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it all.Joseph Heller died while I was still only half way through the book. In a way, it was fitting - he seemed to me just another character, falling prey to the war predetor. But Heller lives on in this story."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In case you didn't know, the word stressed spelled backwards is desserts. Similarly, the words taco salad spelled backwards is dalas ocat, which to the astute mind, makes absolutely no sense. We highlight this important point to foreshadow the fact that much of Catch-22 doesn't make any sense either. That being said, don't think for a second that Joseph Heller's most popular novel isn't one of the funniest ever written.Who in their right mind doesn't yearn for a little dysfunctional military comedy every once and while? We do, we do! You've got to be alert (and slightly insane) to keep pace with Captain John Joseph Yossarian and the rest of his bombardiers. The reward however, is a hilarious account of military Bureaucracy and a few other things that go well beyond our humble comprehension, but are enjoyable nonetheless.Catch-22 has climbed to the top of several lists, including The Modern Library, Time, and The Observer. Furthermore, it came in at a respectable 11th place in the UK's Big Read campaign. We loved the book for its unique voice and fast pace. The novel will make you cry, laugh, and then wonder what you were so emotional about in the first place. No catch, just a good story."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I bought this to re-read for my Book Club. I had read it many years ago and had loved it. Now, a couple of decades +, it just didn't hit the same level. I guess it's true that life changes your perspective on the past."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Being a fan of M*A*S*H in its myriad of forms, I've often heard comparisons made to \\"Catch-22\\" so I finally decided to read it, and I'm glad I did. \\"Catch-22\\" has a great deal of dark humor as well as some outright silliness. It is a brilliant satire on war in general which is set in Italy during the waning days of the Nazis in World War II. My one criticism of the book is that some jokes tend to get repetitive at times.The story focuses mostly on a U.S. Air Force squadron who go on a number of bombing runs doing their best to stay alive and do many crazy things to avoid going on more bombing runs. At the center of the crazy group is Yossarian, a bombardier who is convinced that everyone is out to kill him. Despite actions such as appearing to receive a medal in the nude, in some ways he seems like one of the most sane in the group. His friends include Milo, a bombardier who, instead of flying missions, runs a syndicate which buys and sells almost any goods you can think of; his syndicate also provides services, which at one point included bombing his own squadron! The head of the outfit, Major Major, wants to be liked by the others but they treat him badly because of his position; consequently, he avoids people, only allowing people to be sent to his office when he isn't there. Even the higher-ups prove to be nutty with Generals Peckem and Dreedle spending their energy competing against each other rather than fighting the enemy.The book shows how insane the military bureaucracy itself can be, embodied in the concept \\"catch-22\\". One example of a catch-22 in the book is when Yossarian tries to be discharged by reason of insanity he's told he cannot be discharged because the fact he's trying to prove himself insane means that he isn't. Military silliness is also shown with how concerned officials are with seemingly unimportant things such winning parade contests and bombing a target so it makes for a nice photograph of the explosion.Many characters come and go with several killed in combat. Heller makes all of them three-dimensional so you grow to either love or hate them. The writing contains a variety of humor - silly, intelligent, outrageous. There are several running jokes, though I feel sometimes they are overused, such as repeated explanations of how Milo's syndicate sells one kind of goods to one group in order to buy other kinds at all sorts of prices. In addition to the humorous moments, the book has examples of the horrors of war. Not everyone makes it home and nobody is the same afterward. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to any fans of classic literature, war comedies, or satire."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 presents an unsentimental vision of war, without romantic pretenses, glory, and honor. Instead, we find a nightmarish comedy of violence, bureaucracy, and paradoxical madness. The story is told as a series of loosely related mini-stories in no particular order. Leadership continually raises the number of missions required for the men to go home - it makes the leaders look good. The leaders pay more attention to the quality of aerial bombing photographs than the actual bombing results.The M.D., counselor, and chaplain values each become subverted by their war duties. The doctor ends up providing useless treatments, the counselor unavailable for appointments, and the chaplain loses faith in god. All three are rewarded by the hierarchy, and none are punished.Yossarian, the central figure, focuses on his own survival, faking various illnesses and troubled by the death of Snowden who had died in his arms on a bombing run. Yossarian discovers its possible to be discharged because of insanity, only to also learn that by claiming to be insane one has proven himself sane. That's 'Catch-22.'Meanwhile, mess officer Milo Minderbinder gets fabulously rich through trading by his various companies, including at one point with the Germans who subcontract with him to conduct a bombing run on the American base. Eventually, Yossarian goes AWOL, is offered a court-martial or discharge - the latter if he supports the leaders' new mandate for 80 millions. Yossarian avoids the moral temptation by fleeing to Sweden.Only someone who had spent combat time in the military could write with such devastating irony - a great book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I moved to the US and wanted to read more American literature, the novel that people recommended to me most often was not, as I had expected, Moby Dick (which few seemed to have read) but Catch-22. Now I have finally got around to reading it and (unlike with Moby Dick) was not disappointed.The anti-hero, the anti-war sentiment and the black humor are all very characteristic of the 60s, especially 60s Britain, so it is not surprising that the novel was popular there before American readers warmed to it. Unlike other anti-war works of the period however, this one was written by a veteran and based on hard experience, rather than - as was more usual at the time - by someone who had never experienced war and was determined never to do so.The movie versions of this and MASH were both released in 1970. The latter was released first and was a much better movie, and so Catch-22 remained under the shadow of MASH for some time, and perhaps still does. Readers familiar with the MASH movie and TV series, who read Catch-22 now, may not have the same sense of novelty that the early readers had.The events of the story are to some extent modeled on Homer's Iliad (and to a lesser extent The Odyssey) which Heller was reading at the time he wrote Catch-22. It's not essential to know the Iliad in order to enjoy this story but, if you don't, you'll miss a lot of the references and not get the most out of it. Having said that, there are plenty of other references - literary and mythological - and I'm sure I've not picked up anywhere near all of them in one reading.Interestingly, the title has become part of the language with a meaning that is not strictly reflected in the book. Catch-22 as a 'no-win situation' is described early on, but the phrase recurs throughout with a more general meaning, that of an arbitrary and even fictitious rule. As so often, the novel does not really say what people who have never read it think it does.The continual use of paradox - paradoxical judgments, contradictory statements and situations, and so on - can sometimes become too contrived and can sometimes fall flat. It may be overdone for some readers' tastes. But on the whole it works very well, giving the book the appropriate ironic tone throughout.The structure of the story is extraordinary. The same events are related many times, from different perspectives, providing layers of narrative that finally reveal the whole picture. As part of this continual retelling, the phenomenon of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and related phenomena, feature in the story, both implicitly and explicitly. The timeline is thus non-linear, going back and forth continually. The result is a unique and compelling literary experience.This is a profound, funny, often disturbing novel that should be near the top your reading list.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The title has entered our language as a description of certain situations into which we might fall. The humor in this work is wicked.The focal character of this book is John Yossarian, a bombardier in the Air Force who wants to get out of combat duty. He runs into Catch-22: to get out of duty, you must be unfit to fly. But to want out is to show that one is sane--hence, not unfit!The book, by Joseph Heller, is an interesting take on behavior and decision-making within organizations. Bureaucracy is one target of Heller's writing.The style is exasperating! The work goes back and forth in time; different characters' perspectives are involved. Multiple iterations are used to explain the ongoing storyline. This can be challenging for readers but it also creates an interesting ethos in the work.But, in the end, this is still well worth reading, even many years after its original publication."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"By this time everyone knows what a Catch-22 is - we're inundated with them every day - but in case you're not sure, it's a circumstance in which the very thing you need in order to get you what you want is the very thing that will prevent you from getting it. In short, it's a double bind.The first Catch-22 ever publicized is, of course, to be found in this book. Yossarian, the protagonist and a World War II bombardier, wants his squadron doctor to certify him insane so his superiors will ground him and he won't have to fly combat missions. The doctor agrees that Yossarian is crazy, for a variety of reasons. All that's lacking is for Yossarian to ask to be grounded. If he does that, however, the doctor is required to take that as a sign that he has a normal, healthy aversion to being shot at, that he is therefore sane, and that he must therefore fly more combat missions. Oops.This is far from the first or last such incidence of utter lunacy in this book. The chaos begins well before the story kicks off. It actually starts at the author's note, which states that the real island of Pianosa lies in the Mediterranean off the Italian coast and is far too small to accommodate all the incidents set there in \\"Catch-22\\". So you start reading, with the idea in mind that the story on paper is, if anything, less real than other books, and the activities of the characters seem to bear you out - for instance, within the first few pages the narrative describes a captain with whom Yossarian has stopped playing chess because the captain is a good chess player, and the games are therefore so interesting they are foolish. And you think \\"Aha, this is a farce\\". Then Chapter 2 starts with the line \\"Outside, there was still nothing funny going on,\\" and you remember that Yossarian and his buddies are in imminent danger of death every day. Farce, my foot.Joseph Heller had a real gift for the goofy detail - he could have written sketches for Monty Python - and it was a stroke of genius for him to set his first novel during World War II, because the pressures of wartime prevent the story from dissolving into a set of disconnected episodes. The author came up with a few other strategies to lend his story a framework, most particularly Yossarian's recurring recollection of what happened in his plane to a young gunner named Snowden. In speaking of this incident, he generally turns it into a bad joke, asking \\"Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?\\" during mission briefings whenever someone asks if there are any questions. The question is a riff on the refrain of a poem by the medieval French poet Villon - \\"Where are the snows of yesteryear?\\" - the verses of which seem to be about the loss of beauty and love, or maybe innocence. As for Yossarian's question, when you find out what happened to Snowden, you learn that Yossarian isn't quite as nuts as you might think. Let's just say that his question has to do with lost innocence also, and let it go at that.As a matter of fact, you can read all of \\"Catch-22\\" as a series of confrontations between innocence and whatever seeks to destroy it, another good reason for setting it in wartime. This probably explains why there are so few combat scenes in the novel, and maybe why this is an air unit rather than a ground unit. It allows Heller to tell his story at one remove from genuine blood and death, at least until the novel's climax, and concentrate on the conflict between the innocent and the cynical. Yossarian makes a good central character because he's almost the only one who finds a way to fight the cynics around him without becoming cynical himself. It doesn't work forever, but it keeps Yossarian out of the snake pit long enough to learn another strategy from a most unlikely supporting character, and that's how \\"Catch-22\\" manages to end in some sort of triumph.So that's one possible reading of this ridiculous story - ridiculous on its face, that is. You can also read it as an attack on postwar bureaucracy a la Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", or some kind of anti-imperialist manifesto, or I don't know what, but please don't forget that it's also a comedy of manners, however unlikely that sounds. And just to give you an idea of how lightly you can take this book, we know that the phrase \\"Catch-22\\" is pretty nearly random. Joseph Heller wanted to call it \\"Catch-18\\", but his publisher made him change the number to avoid confusion with the contemporary bestseller \\"Mila 18\\", and he picked one that sounded euphonious to him. That's how much heavy significance there is to this novel - first and foremost, it's meant to be funny, and it succeeds exceptionally well.Joseph Heller gave an interview once in which he envisioned Buck Henry, who wrote the movie screenplay, flipping through \\"Catch-22\\" in despair and moaning \\"There's no PLOT here!\\" Technically speaking, that's probably true, but it doesn't matter. Its structure and theme make this novel hang together more than well enough. As we follow Yossarian from his desire to avoid combat by simply refusing to cooperate (following in the footsteps of his great predecessor, the Good Soldier Svejk), to his desperate attempt at keeping his sanity and his moral compass while tied hand and foot by the last great Catch-22, we come to realize that like a lot of light farces, this one has some pretty deep roots. Evidently the little island of Pianosa, at least in Joseph Heller's imagination, is plenty big enough for a great tale.Benshlomo says, Sometimes goofing off is better than preaching sermons."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"MASH is definetly the one word to describe this book. I can't imagine that the sitcom, MASH, wasn't inspired by this book. You can even pick out certain characters although they are sometimes blended together or split apart. Although, MASH would have been limited to Cinemax if it was an accurate copy. There are a lot of sex scenes in the book.I don't think I have ever read any book that made me laugh out loud more than this book. Some of the humor was very silly (like MASH), but I couldn't help laughing.Catch-22 is about pilots in war and there are some war related scenes that are gruesome, but not too often."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've always thought that people who don't like CATCH-22 are humorless fascists.Joseph Heller (1923-1999) was a poor Brooklyn kid who joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and ended up on the Italian front, where flew at least sixty combat missions--most of which he described as \\"milk runs.\\" Always interested in writing, he began to publish in the late 1940s and was well regarded as a short story writer. In 1953 he began a piece that he thought would be short story or maybe a novella. Eight years later in 1961, after considerable editing and a last-minute name change, it was a four hundred page-plus novel titled CATCH-22. Reviews were originally mixed, but the book thrived on word-of-mouth, and pretty soon everybody was reading it and talking about it.CATCH-22 is extremely difficult to describe because it does not operate on a linear time line: the story is not told in sequence, but in what seems at first to be a random order of events. Characters who were dead in one chapter are living in the next chapter; events that past in one chapter have not yet happened in the next chapter. These characters and events swirl like a confusion of confetti--but as the novel progresses one perceives a pattern, and at the center of the pattern is a U.S. Army Air Forces B-52 bombardier named Yossarian, who is repeatedly stymied by an absurdity of military bureaucracy created and supported by a military regulation known as \\"Catch-22.\\"Catch-22 is essentially an unspecified double-bind rule that can be applied to virtually any situation at will because no one has actually seen the rule in written form. The plot of the novel arises because Yossarian and his buddies have been required to fly an absurdly high number of missions and Yossarian's nerves are at the breaking point. He should be grounded, but in order to be grounded he must ask to be grounded. Since concern for personal safety is the process of a rational mind, asking to be grounded is evidence of sanity, and if he is sane he must fly however many missions his superiors require. This bizarre, circular logic--which is reflected in the bizarre, circular nature of the narrative--is applied over and over throughout the book.The result is laugh-out-loud funny, particularly when the characters are factored into the story: characters such as Major Major Major Major, ex-PFC Wintergreen, Hungry Joe, Chief White Halfoat, Chaplin A.T. Tapman, General Dreedle, Milo Minderbinder, and numerous others are hilarious creations that stay in your mind years, even decades after the book is read. But as the novel progresses it becomes increasingly hard to laugh at their predicaments, which become increasingly dark. By the novel's conclusion, we are praying for Yossarian and his friends to escape, but damn few of them do.People who have been in the military seem to regard the novel as a satire on the military; it is, however, much broader than that, and it would be more accurate to describe CATCH-22 as a satire on bureaucracy in general. The notion could just as easily be applied to business, to religion, to the government, and there is probably not a person living who hasn't experienced a Catch-22 moment within the past week or two. Just recall the last time you tried to have your telephone bill corrected or asked about a questionable transaction on your bank statement and you'll probably know exactly what I mean.CATCH-22 is one of the handful of novels to which I seem to return every few years, and with each reading I find funnier, darker, and more memorable than before. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amason Reviewer"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When Joseph Heller's wonderfully hilarious novel \\"Catch-22\\" was published in 1961, World War II was celebrated as the \\"good fight.\\" Popular memory held it as a noble stand against the Axis onslaught and a glorious victory for democracy, as opposed to the more recent Korean War, a somewhat muddled thing with no rousing cause beyond vague theories of \\"containment.\\" Needless to say, many found the irreverence and dark humor of \\"Catch-22\\" somewhat disturbing. Its hero, Yossarian, spends the story trying frantically to be sent home and not fly any more missions, while the United States military is depicted as an inanely irrational bureaucracy. The multifaceted \\"Catch-22\\" tells many tales, including a contemporarily relevant account of rhetoric gone wrong and the wiles of words used justify a variety of dubious causes in ways that make nonsensical sense. The result is a highly entertaining dark comedy that takes absurdity to new heights.\\"Catch-22\\" has often been described as the insanity of modern life as seen from the perspective of someone who is perhaps too sane. Yossarian is perturbed by the very logical fact that thousands of people whom he does not know nor has ever even met are trying desperately to kill him. Common sense would indicate that it is best to remove oneself from such a situation, especially given the basic biological instinct for survival found in all animals. However, such is the incongruous nature of war, here only heightened by the fantastically illogical organizations running it. In order for Yossarian to be properly discharged from service, he must be proven mentally unfit for combat. Unfortunately, the very act of self-preservation is indicative of a sound man. That, as Doc Daneeka explains, is the principle of Catch-22. Although he admits it has a \\"spinning reasonableness\\" and an \\"elliptical precision about its perfect pairs and parts that was graceful and shocking,\\" Yossarian remains steadfastly bound to the primordial value of life. It is later revealed that he came into his dangerously good sense after the gory death of his comrade Snowden in an air battle, thereby launching his quest to not fly any more missions. Alas, Colonel Cathcart, constantly trying to please his superiors so he can be promoted to general, persists in raising the number required. In essence, \\"Catch-22 . . . says you've always got to do what your commanding officer tells you to.\\"I think Yossarian's plight is perhaps that the individual must always work to oppose the domineering \\"vested interests\\" of business, government, and the military. Though vital to modern world, these establishments are often forced to rely on unscrupulous means to safeguard themselves against a populace rightfully dissatisfied with them. The core definition of Catch-22, according an old woman, is that \\"they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\\" Of course, so that they cannot be stopped, Yossarian's goal must be to prevent those in the military command from continuing to utilize him like a tool for their own ends. Yet the individual can never entirely escape the officious, overbearing, yet coldly and impersonally distant bureaucracies of contemporary society. To do so would be to violate the shifting facades of principle upon which they rest. There is too little to be certain of. Still, there remains the old declaration of skeptical philosophy: \\"I think, therefore I am,\\" as Descartes once phrased it. When the world takes on an air of unreality, when there is doubt of the very ground upon which one stands, there persists that one eternal verity: conscious life. Who wants a life, one character asks, if it is nothing but \\"a series of unfortunate events\\"? The response is another question: \\"What else is there?\\"When it was fist published in 1961, \\"Catch-22\\" received mixed reviews and moderate success. As the sixties continued on, however, Joseph Heller's novel took on a new significance. An entire generation was coming to question the authority under which they lived, as well as its rhetoric of black and white, good versus evil. Granted, there is little to have loved about the Communist dictatorship of the Soviet Union, although some American leftists came to believe that there was, but nor could the actions of the United States be seen as wholly in the right. President Lyndon B. Johnson subsequently found that he could not talk the public into supporting the Vietnam War with fuzzy affirmations of \\"Courage, Might, Justice, Truth, Liberty, Love, Honor, and Patriotism\\" backed by geopolitical jargon about the importance of the Third World in the liberty-or-death struggle against global Communism. In \\"Catch-22,\\" Yossarian finally decides to flee to Sweden: since the war is almost over, he would be risking his life for nothing but Colonel Cathcart's clamoring to be general. Meanwhile, in the real world, \\"Yossarian Lives!\\" would become a popular anti-Vietnam slogan. Escape was not an option for millions of young Americans in the late sixties who began to take \\"Catch-22\\" seriously and help make it into the classic it is today."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Other people have written much better, and more detailed, reviews of this book, but its true hilarity and power (which I have heard is quite different than the movie, which I've never seen so can't comment on) simply need to be experienced. Some of the imagery is almost divine; much of it is deliciously ironic; and a little brings us back to the horror that was the reailty of World War II.Just read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is simply one of the best books ever written. It describes the world as it really is, and does it in a way that will stick with you for a very long time.

The plot takes place in the heat of World War II on the small island of Pianosa, which is eight miles south of Elba. It follows the journey of an American bomber Yossarian, who is encroaching upon the first of his middle-aged years. The story introduces a myriad of characters that very much influence and have the ability to control the fate of the many bombers including Yossarian. In an attempt to escape this unappealing and rather petrifying fate, which is known to be Yossarian's \\"journey\\", the protagonist matures as a character that will eventually escape a catch-22 with the last sentence.The novel, which was filled with irony, spoke brutally honest words, which in different circumstances would have been considered taboo. \\"...A world boiling in chaos in which everything was in proper order\\" (154) is one of many instances where Heller's ability to successfully bring together two words of opposite meaning is displayed. Joseph Heller is a literary genius whose novel will never age with time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This didn't live up to my hopes re-reading it twenty years on from the first time - but that's not too surprising given how I relished it then. I suppose much of the pleasure was in how much it shocked and stung - something it's not going to do twice. It's hardly a book that needs any more discussion, so this is more just logging my response. Catch 22 was a wonderful foil to the stiff-upper lip jingoism of so much war literature and cinema, and Heller hilariously pilloried the dubious and at times absurd morality of the military. However this isn't just for laughs - we're not talking Hogan's Heroes farce or McHale's Navy peacetime shenanigans - the humour is as black as it comes. Just as you're wetting yourself laughing at something ridiculous part of you realises this is too close to reality, and the guys falling down dead aren't just cartoons.This book just overflows with manic wit while managing to powerfully confront some big establishment issues. Unfortunately the next book I tracked down of Heller's, Something Happened, was just an embittered humourless mess. Somehow the same apparent lack of discipline enhances Catch 22.A tricky thing these days, but may you come to this wonderful book without any prior knowledge or expectations."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Jay O. Sanders performance of this mind-boggling work is equally mind-blowing. He understands the book thoroughly and seems to channel the characters effortlessly. There's an honesty and shocked intensity that parallels the book's--all rendered with extreme confidence and cool. I love it and recommend it highly. One of the best reads ever."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If the \\"Lance Corporal Underground\\" had a reading list, Catch-22 would be at the top. From the sociopathic commanders to the stupidity of the mission requirements increasing endlessly and unnecessarily, all of the hilarious absurdities cataloged in this novel are daily realities for anyone involved in the military. Well, they WOULD be hilarious if they were mere fiction."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"i don't even know where to start--just thinking of this novel brings a loony smile on my face. i've read this a couple of years ago while i was on fieldwork, and i remember being on the receiving end of worried and even stupefied stares from my friends whenever i had this book on my hands--there were times (a lot of times, mind) when i'd just laugh outright as i read thru the exploits of yossarian, major major (and then more majors), milo minderbender, nately, and other illustrious (or not) characters. their eccentricities are often amusing, beffudling, heartwrenching, and even enlightening.but besides the humor, there are a lot of issues in the story. people will be given a glimpse as to how it's like for soldiers to be in the thick of war, how they are slowly, subtly changed from the inside-out. heller has masterfully encapsulated the dynamics between and among ranks of soldiers, and even those people outside their outfit that they come in contact with, and what influences they have wrought against one another. morbidly fascinating, excruciatingly merciless, and awkwardly honest, catch-22 deserves to be in everyone's literature..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you were a MASH fan you will clearly see this novel as wellspring.The humor is Marxian ( Groucho not Karl ) and you will see that there is nothing new. I am 150 or so pages in and among the chestnuts tackled so far are military tours of duty, farm subsidies, unscrupulous doctors, mindless bureaucracy and Texans.A particular sentence made me burst out laughing which is uncommon for me when reading, especially bearing in mind that I was 17 hours into a 20 hour journey from the UK back to the US.This is a great piece of writing and while I can understand its not appealing to everybody, Heller is a great artist and thinker."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A group of my friends went to Stockton State College to see a theater presentation of Catch-22. We all decided to reread the novel;all of us had read the book in high school english.The times have changed. There is a very pro military culture in the United States today. I think Heller's satire is probably closer to the truth about the efficiency of the military. The people who 'liberated' Iraq will be postal workers in about ten years. And not very good ones either.There are good wars that must be fought, one must concede. Most of the time,however, it is just male ego and ambition run amok. You might say, what if everyone felt that way?Then I'd be a damned fool to feel otherwise."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I had this on my \\"To Read\\" list for a long time but I had been putting it off. So then I found it on Kindle and finally I had the chance to read it. I admit I chose it because I'd heard so much about it, though I'd never read critiques, so I didn't know the specifics. I just knew it was famous. And, well, I guess it was a good thing that I didn't know anything about its plot because it blew me away. For one thing, I never thought it was going to be this funny. Heller takes absurdity and ridicule to hilarious levels. This books manages to break your heart, lift your spirits, and keep you in stitches, sometimes all of the above within two or three consecutive pages.The plot is haphazard but it keeps coming back to major points: a little detail that may seem absurd crops up later as a pivotal moment.The serious side of it, on the other hand, left me thinking about the ridiculousness of war (yes, even WWII) and how certain aspects of it keep coming up every time men take up arms against their contemporaries. For example, the opportunistic, greedy characters with little or no scruples and the soldiers who end up being heroes even though their actions were inspired by nothing other than pure cowardice. Many people have come out against this book, calling it anti-war, but I think it opens up a different perspective and it makes you stop and think about how much mere accidents play into what the government tries to sell us as well-thought out strategies.Heller raises absurdity to the level of art. I highly recommend this book if you want to laugh out loud and be moved."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I read this book I was rolling with laughter at the sardonic wit that infused it. Yossarian as Everyman, struggling to define himself and to get by and get over at the same time. This audiobook production somehow never grabbed me.

I do know that this is a great piece of 20th Century literature that somehow is not done justice in this version.Catch-22"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's story still provides depth.

Yo-Yo wants out of the war, and away from his superiors' endless raising of the required number of flight missions per person. Unfortunately his best hope is proving that he's crazy - but no-one crazy would want out of the army right? Catch-22!The novel is pretty heavy going, given the prose is like endless catch-22 jokes, and Heller has fun throwing the timeline around, frequently jumping out of scenes and scrambling the book almost beyond anything close to linear. Things get a little easier after page 200, and around page 400 we finally get chapters that stick to one time segment...Heller doesn't bother with typical plot-drivers like understandable/likeable characters, and has no compunction about driving his creations from the heights of euphoria to the deepest pits of despair.Surprisingly in amongst this mess, are some of the most vivid enthralling scenes I've ever read, especially the climatic flight scene towards the end, and I almost wonder if the intention of the novel is to build up to Heller showing off his literary skills for this one moment.Of course there is meaning to this novel - aside from mocking the military, Heller comments on human nature, particularly our contrary natures. With its moral depravity, and nothing changes stance, in many ways Catch-22 can be a depressing read, but also a bizarre ride, that one is better for at the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 remains one of my favorite books for many reasons, but most of all for the perfected black humor.

Although many say that the book's dark humor and existential discussions of the absurdity and cruelty of war have been surpassed by other subsequent works by new writers, I still believe all the others merely stand on Joseph Heller's achievements.

The \\"serious\\" sections about Yossarian's bombings and the precariousness of life are can't-put-down passages, often moving.Heller really shines when his novel asks who, exactly, is \\"crazy.\\" Is it Yossarian, the WWII bombardier whose antics (such as running around naked for days after a comrade's death) and determination to \\"save\\" his life make him crazy in the eyes of everybody else? Or is it everybody else, who seem startled and even repulsed by the idea that it's obscene to die at the hands of people who don't know you, for the whims of officials who also don't know you, for a cause that can't be even vaguely defined?Overall I thought Catch-22 was full of original comic asides even as it gives a suspenseful, yet disjointed, narrative. It puts across a potent message about our tendency to \\"just go with\\" things we really shouldn't put stock in.Complaints: Even though I know Catch-22's length is probably a satire of the idea that novels can capture real life's complexity, that doesn't really compensate for the fact that the novel really IS bloated. Heller uses three adjectives and an adverb for everything: \\"A lissome, blond, sinuous girl with lovely legs and honey-colored skin laid herself out contentedly on the arm of the old man's chair and began molesting his pale, angular, dissolute face languidly and coquettishly.\\" That sentence has thirty-four words and, incredibly, at least twelve of them are modifiers. There are many like it. Also, Heller has a jarring habit of using the word \\"obsequious\\" quite frequently.Sometimes the novel's sentences swelled to such lengths (and with so few commas) that I found it difficult to absorb any information at all. For example, see Chapter 23's eight-line, paragraph-long first sentence.Oddly enough, I thought Milo (who is apparently a much admired and thought-about character among Catch-22 enthusiasts) was very boring and flat. I dreaded the chapters that gave gratuitous attention to his enterprise. My favorite characters were the doctors, who seem irritated and perplexed just because people get sick.My last nitpick is my feeling that Heller stopped short with his ideas about pain in the novel. I'm certain he was a very intelligent man, so I don't know why he railed so much against God permitting suffering when it's fairly obvious that unpleasant experiences often form (and better) people more than pleasure does.

In laughing at Catch-22 we laugh at ourselves and our lives, and although few of us have experienced WWII from a bombardier's eye view, we have all experienced Yossarian, Major Major, R. O.

(The word is widely used in the russian army and society and stands for unpunished petty tyranny of people of higher rank, carried out to demonstrate the superiority of their position and (or) as a result of the inefficiency of their brainwork, which leads to unnecessary waste of time and energy of the subordinates, who are forced to execute orders often devoid of any common sense.)

I was lucky enough to be discharged in 1965, and missed the opportunity to kill Asian farmers. I finished &quot;Catch-22&quot; in just a few days. I've read it many, many, times since. From being a rather ordinary, &quot;just go along with it&quot;, marine, I became an anti-war protester, in no small part due to this wonderfully subversive work of Joseph Heller. I've never read another book, (and, I've read very many), that so completely and so darkly (yet hilariously), points out the horrible absurdity of war.

Before Catch 22, much had been written about war but few had found humour in it, and fewer had ridiculed it. After Catch 22, it is difficult to conceive of war (and warmongers) being presented in any other way. In presenting war as farce, Heller didn't just change the way we view armed conflict, but the way we see authority, in corporations, government bodies and other institutions where men accrue and exercise power. An unforgettable, life-changing (and life enhancing book). And, lest it be forgotten, a tremendously funny read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I don't believe this is an anti-war novel; I believe this is a novel about a man who is against being forced to fight a war in which he could be KILLED. I honestly don't think Yossarian cares if there is a war going on--he just wants out. This is undoubtedly the best novel I've ever read. I finished this book a couple of years ago, and I still laughingly think about some of the circumstances that Yossarian got himself into while trying to get out of the war machine that he was part of. You don't have to be of the generation that fought WWII to thoroughly enjoy this book; in fact, you don't have to know anything about war at all to cheer for Yossarian in his attempt to escape the war. Through the study of history we learn that the victors of wars write the histories; Heller teaches us that if every one gets killed during the war it won't matter who wins.

Returning the favor, many critics condemned the book. Some, however, defended Heller, contending that the book was in fact not about war or the military, but was a commentary on American society. Furthermore, Heller dwells on a few specific aspects of American society, like the emergence of mega-corporations.\\"Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy. Frankly I think that the whole society is nuts - and the question is: what does a sane man do in an insane society?\\" -Joseph Heller (AP)As Norman Podhoretz said in his essay, \\"Looking Back At Catch-22,\\" Heller's real subject was the nature of American society at the time he wrote this book. But how? It sure seems as though this is a novel about war. The setting is in Italy during World War II. The characters fly combat missions on a daily basis. They act like soldiers. In fact, they are soldiers. So how can this novel not be about war? It is not about war because of the meaning buried within the narrative - the war serves only as a vehicle for Heller's message. But what is Heller's message? The novel jumps from place to place, almost illogically, perhaps like American society. So how do we figure out his message? By carefully reading the lines of text, and in between the lines, we see that Heller thinks that American society is crazy. \\"What would they do to me,\\" he asked in confidential tones, \\"if I refused to fly them?\\" \\"We'd probably shoot you,\\" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen replied. \\"We?\\" Yossarian cried in surprise. \\"What do you mean, we? Since when are you on their side?\\" \\"If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?\\" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen retorted.And perhaps this exchange between ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen and Yossarian is a commentary on how people in this country have no sense of loyalty to anything. Reading into his commentary, we see that Heller has lost hope for society.During the writing of this book, companies merged and \\"acquired\\" each other right and left. From this merger and acquisition frenzy came the term \\"corporate America.\\" Once again, Heller deems this to be crazy, so he makes fun of it. In the book, Milo's syndicate, M&amp;M Industries, represents one such large corporation. He claims that if the syndicate makes a profit then it is good for everyone. This is analogous to corporations that claim that if they merge, they will be able to provide a better product, which is better for the consumer. Well, in reality, it cuts jobs and thus creates larger profits for the corporation. Nonetheless, corporations present some damn good arguments for merging, just as Milo presents some damn good arguments for why the syndicate is good for everyone - \\"everyone gets a share\\" (Heller). Furthermore, M&amp;M Industries exhibits some organized crime structure as well. Perhaps Heller is saying that the size and political power of these mega-corporations (which were nothing like the corporations today vis-&agrave;-vis BP-Amoco, Microsoft, AOL/Netscape-Time Warner, etc.) makes them too powerful, and that they can do anything that they please, legal, quasi-legal, or blatantly illegal, much like organized crime. To put it bluntly: it's not about war, stupid. What it is about is American society and how it is spiraling downward towards oblivion. Furthermore, Heller thinks he is the only sane one in an insane world - like Yossarian. Heller thinks that everyone is crazy, and so he broadcasts his message to everyone via his book - if they are sane enough to decode his message - a catch-22 in and of itself.\\"It used to shock me and alarm me and discourage me that there was a general decline of everything of value. But it doesn't surprise me anymore. It seems inevitable and natural and there's no way to resist it.\\" -Joseph Heller (AP)"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"a good book for anyone considering the futility of war. The humor and insane logic make the pages fly."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was required to choose a novel to read independently for an advanced placement English class. After choosing this one I set out to read it.I was suprised because I was expecting a novel completely about a war and instead I got much more than I expected. I became engrossed in the book and the lives of the charcters. The hilarity of the situations and persons involved kept my interest peaked for a long time. Yossarian may be the only sane one left!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There is a place in a world where irony meets comedy, courts it, marries it and from this marriage reality is born. This world is called \\"Catch-22\\" by Joseph Heller. In this land of probabilities a narrative encircles a reality (like a ball encircles roulette's bowl before landing on a lucky number for some or a cursed one for others) before revealing the final results. And in the process of encircling, the same narrative paints characters out of the white pages with the colors of stories full of absurdities, and in spite of these absurdities these characters represent parallel witnesses of real personalities - the ones in our own reality.The more I read the book, the more I discovered how Heller's world complements mine, how it reflects it like a mirror as it examines the meaninglessness of war, name, rank, serial number, order, death, economy, capitalism, love, sex, religion (and not necessarily in the same order) and several other highly regarded objects of (im)moral value, and in this reflection it condemns them.Initially, I thought everyone in this novel was crazy. Then, I thought Heller was crazy. In the end I found out that it's the (I) reader who is crazy, that the world (I) he lives in is crazy, the job (I) he does is crazy, the aspirations (I) he holds are crazy, the mind (I) he tries to expand is crazy, and yet it feels good, and sacred, and meaningful, and happy, and cuddly, because (I) he makes it to be so, and because others say it is, and because (I) he is never going to be Youssarian (although secretly (I) he dreams of becoming like him).For those of you who don't have time to delve into the story completely I recommend the movie. Otherwise, the book is a must read.-by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"&#65533;&#65533;They&#65533;re trying to kill me,&#65533; Yossarian told him calmly.&#65533;No one&#65533;s trying to kill you,&#65533; Clevinger cried.&#65533;Then why are they shooting at me?&#65533; Yossarian asked.&#65533;They&#65533;re shooting at everyone,&#65533; Clevinger answered. &#65533;They&#65533;re trying to kill everyone.&#65533;&#65533;And what difference does that make?&#65533;&#65533; (25)Catch-22&#65533;s antihero questions the ultimate logic of war. &#65533;And what difference does that make?&#65533; This is a resounding question throughout the book (and throughout the war), both in which Joseph Heller&#65533;s creation, Yossarian, plays a vital role. In Catch-22, Heller creates an array of characters whose absurdity is at once satirical, silly, somber, and scathing. Particularly, the passionate, angry, strikingly sane voice of Yossarian lends a certain ironic tragedy both to the mindless pursuit we call &#65533;war&#65533; and to the mindless machine we call &#65533;bureaucracy.&#65533;It is important to read Catch-22 not only as a great piece of twentieth-century literature, but also as a primary source, written by a man whose own involvement in WWII allowed him to create this novel and this character. The characterizations that Heller creates in this novel are a clear and scathing indictment of twentieth-century &#65533;&#65533;isms,&#65533; all of which combine to perpetuate aggression and eventually escalate into the total wars of our modern era. These &#65533;-isms&#65533; include patriotism, opportunism, capitalism, heroism, individualism, and sadism. In striking contrast, Yossarian seems to transcend these evil &#65533;-isms&#65533; and capture something missing in modern warfare&#65533;sanity. Yossarian&#65533;s desperate desire for self-preservation is the clearest evidence of his sanity and runs counter to all of the caricatured &#65533;ideals&#65533; surrounding him. Certainly, like all other novels, Catch-22 has its failings&#65533;at times, it seems that &#65533;the book is an emotional hodgepodge; no mood is sustained long enough to register for more than a chapter&#65533;; at other times, the action and characters almost seem too absurd and farcical to make a valid point; at still other times, the satire seems too formulaic, unable to grasp at the ironies of life. However, for all of its failings, the mood and voice that is uniquely Yossarian&#65533;s allows the novel to maintain a joie de vivre and strength for all time. Yossarian&#65533;s logic is created against the stark backdrop of a tragic and deadly war; however, this logic lives on especially now. At the conclusion of the book, the reader is compelled to ask, of war, of bureaucracy, and of all else, &#65533;And what difference does that make?&#65533;This book must be read by anyone who decides to weigh in on the most recent political conversation regarding war, conflict, and terrorism. Best of luck...and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book used to be funnier. When I read it as a teenager it was hilarious. The absurdity, the foolishness, the ripping descriptions of situations and people with whom we could all superficially relate -- it made me laugh and shake my head and then laugh and shake my head again.Now I'm an adult and -- with age and the experience of responsibility -- I picked the book up to enjoy it again. And I didn't. I still chuckled in the early pages but stopped reading by page 100. First, I no longer found any of the characters remotely believable. Even as a veteran, I didn't link the straw-man military types to real life. Then I thought, maybe that's the point: create over-the-top characters in order to skewer an idea. But I still didn't get it.Second, the unrelenting bitterness of the author's voice reached me this time and it annoyed me to no end. Every character seemed to be either crazy or an idiot, unhappy with himself, a failure at life, stupid, dishonest, amoral or immoral, and even those who weren't were -- per the protagonist and the author -- therefore fools who didn't know how dumb they were. Even in a work of satire that gets old. In fact, especially in a work of satire it made me lose what the satire was supposed to be about.Last, and this is a sure sign I'm getting old, I couldn't get past the protagonist's selfishness. Absolutely I sympathized with his desire to fly no more missions. But then I kept wondering, so who's supposed to fly in his place? If he doesn't go, someone else has to. Obviously the self-centeredness appealed to the 60's generation who made this book a \\"classic.\\" But now a few years on, it no longer seems so funny.It's still an interesting book and worth reading if only to know how the title entered our lexicon. But it's not as good as I remembered. And it used to be funnier."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'm more aligned with the reviewers that the trimumphal author takes to task in his 1994 preface, which appears at the end of this edition. I was expecting more out of a novel that has received such wide acclaim, including on the amazon website. The novel was flabby in many places, the characterization was thin, and the absurdist aspects wore on me. In many regards, it read like an extended Marx Brothers movie. I suppose I understand the origins of television's McHale's Navy and more to the point M*A*S*H a little better now, though I must admit what I found tiresome in M*A*S*H, I found tiresome in C-22. The wit was too much on display, wanting to be looked at and thought deep and insightful.All of that said, I did become engaged by the second half of the book. The chaplain and a few other characters did begin to have something to say. And anyone who has dealt with corporate absurdities will find resonance in many parts of this book. Additionally, I learned something about how the American officer class of WWII, which strikes me as quite different than that of today. Heller obviously writes of what he knows. For my money and time however, I would recommend Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy over C-22 if it's a comedic, jaundiced look at WWII one is seeking."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book because I saw it was recommended by Kurt Vonnegut and then again by Matt Groening in a Life in Hell comic strip, so I thought it must be pretty good. It starts out great, but Heller's style is so repetitive it becomes pretty boring to slog through it. It would have been much better if it had been edited down by about half. My advice--read anything by Vonnegut instead...even his worst efforts are better than this thing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is about 350 pages too long. It's not that it's bad, it's just that Heller makes himself quite clear in the first thirty pages and then ensnares the reader in chapter after chapter of \\"War as an Endless Sitting at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.\\" I think that the length and density and madness of the book is itself part of Heller's unique take on the \\"War is Hell\\" theme, but I still wish he had chopped out a dozen chapters or so.The book doesn't really have a plot, exactly, as instead it examines a number of characters involved in WWII in Italy. There are some plot points, like a particular mission in which Snowden is killed, but the plot does not advance so much as loop back on itself in a Gordian knot until the last fifty pages or so, where the structure makes a welcome shift to a more straightforward but significantly darker series of events after an accidental mid-air collision.There are some very amusing moments in this book - I laughed out loud at some of the developments in the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, and some of the more nakedly amoral actions of Milo (the ultimate capitalist) - but it's not exactly a laugh-out-loud funny book overall. Heller seems more inclined to use humor to engage the reader in the absurdity of war, and I don't know that he's entirely successful at each attempt.Overall, I see why this is a classic, and I'm happy that I let my fear of peer pressure stop me from giving up after the first hundred pages, but I can see why it's not for everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It seems most criticism of this book on the site asserts claims of dull repetitiveness and trite anti-war arguments. Even Yossarian however admits that the war against Germany had to be fought (of course to know this you would have had to get past the first hundred pages as so few of the critics have).The book is about capitalism, relationships, friendship, duty, service, love and the eternal paradox inherent in each. There is something human in this book that touches us as the reader in the depths of their humanity and throws us naked from the tree of knowledge (and good and evil too!) into the world around us.

Just exactly how many missions WILL the men have to fly? How much does Nately's whore really love him? Why did Yossarian get a medal (and almost a court-martial) for the same bombing run?

Heller repeats himself over and over - sometimes entire paragraphs - and not as a stylistic choice but because he probably didn't know where the story was going.

A bit irratic."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Throughout most of the book Catch-22, I was left dazed and confused as to what was going on in the stroy. In fact, I have no idea what the real storyline is, but I can say this, having read the book; the author attempts to define the Catch-22 numerous times by telling stories of each of the characters lives, and how they try to achieve something, but they never seem to be able to get there, for one reason or another. Joseph Heller therefore proves the Catch-22 exists. but beyond this main point, I do not recognize any form of story developing. The whole story seemed to be going around in circles, and, if it wasnt for the humorous parts within the book every now and then, I may have put it down in utter confusion as to what was going on in the book. Without the humor, the book did not tie itself together, so, for the little that I did get from the book, I owe it to the humor."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 consisted of alot of irony and witty sarcasm, and held ideas that seem unrealistic yet comical and incredibly unexpected. I found it understandable that character Yossarian wants to get home without having to die in order to do it, and the other numerous characters and situations made it even more comical and twists the ideas and sarcasm, making it truly unique. But as entertaining as it was I also found it somewhat redundant; the situations and predicaments certain characters were stuck in kept it interesting, but in my opinion there wasn't really a plot. It would jump around to different moments in time unexpectedly and the end of the book was so unexpected and disappointing, it makes the book as a whole seem superfluous.Irony was a large aspect of the book; practically every situation any character got into was totally ironic, and I think Joseph Heller's use of irony brings out more of the anti-war opinion the book seems to have. It seems like Heller meant for the ideas and situations to be superfluous in order to show that war is superfluous, and I think he portrayed it well in the book. The tools he used to get that point across-- irony, sarcasm, comedy-- I believe were crucial to the ideas and themes, but I also think that seeing it from Yossarian's point of view is crucial as well, and brings out more of Heller's opinions throughout the book.A good aspect (and one of the very, very few) I found about the book was the fact that it wasn't based on pre-conceived notions of war but based on Heller's own opinion. Heller wrote the book the way he saw war, in a way where it seemed so twisted and unrealistic that it couldn't be reality but in my opinion it was reality. Every situation seemed unbelievable, but I think war in itself must be unbelievable and that was Heller's opinion...it was ridiculous, unbelievable, something one couldn't describe using everyday circumstances. It made all the main ideas stronger and circulated them throughout one another and throughout the book, but that was probably the only good thing about the book. I thought the whole thing was incredibly unnecessary with the way it ended and it was too repetitive with simply describing characters for each chapter; it made it kind of dull."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book definitely had its good points - Yossarian's antics (&quot;I yearn for you deeply&quot;), the out-of-sequence structure (yes, I actually liked that), and some of the philosophizing about war which struck a chord with me - but its annoying points outweighed them in the end. The main thing that ruined the book for me was the ridiculously illogical behavior of almost everyone in the book. Now, in a military satire, I expect some ridiculous logic from the commanders, and it's funny at first, but when EVERYONE behaves without logic or intelligence, it loses its edge and becomes annoying. One example: the Colonel (?) who says &quot;You mean the enlisted men pray to the same God as the officers?&quot; OK - that's not biting satire - that's just plain stupid. There are endless examples of this type of ridiculousness, and it turns the novel into a cartoon. And please don't give me the &quot;war is insane&quot; line - while I agree that it is (or can be), the war and characters in Catch-22 are not insane, they are inane."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I had high hopes for this novel; I mean it's a classic right? My 16 year old son had to choose a novel for summer reading and I helped him pick this book. The story was very difficult to follow and just jumps right into a confusing hospital scene. We hung in there and figured that if we kept reading it would eventually piece itself together and make sense. After Chapter 4 I had lost my son entirely and I wasn't too far behind. I rented the movie out of desperation, hoping it would gel a background story that we could carry back to the book. We couldn't get a third of the way through the movie!

While this didn't cause me distress or confusion (in fact I've found this technique appealing in many other novels - including pretty much everything Kurt Vonnegut has ever written) but in this case I found the story moved aimlessly, consisting of little more than a series of loosely bound (albeit, amusing) antidotes. Amusing anecdotes are not a bad thing, but for me, there was no sense that the chapters were building toward anything. The story didn't feel like it was moving forward. As a result, my interest waned (despite the fact that the individual chapters were often entertaining) and it took some measure of discipline for me not to put this book down and move on.My complaint about the lack of forward-moving plot is the primary reason for my middling review(a mere 3 stars for this highly acclaimed novel), but it isn't my only complaint. Another is the lack of likeable characters. While Catch-22 features no shortage of entertaining, self absorbed characters complete with a dizzying array of quirky personality traits, after spending 500 pages with these characters, I have to say, I didn't really care much if they lived, died, deserted, or were sent home to the safety of the good ol' USA. Admittedly many of the most memorable characters in modern fiction aren't likable, in fact some are pure evil, but in the case of Catch-22 I think the novel needed at least one character we could care about.Is this a great novel?

It has yellowed a bit and has very minor wear but otherwise is in awesome condition. If anyone is wondering if this is worth reading, I can't put it down.

THIS BY FAR WAS THE BEST AND FUNNIEST BOOK I'VE READ. I ALSO BELIEVE CATCH-22 MUST HAVE BEEN THE INFLUENCE FOR THE MOVIE AND TV SERIES OF M*A*S*H. EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY TO READ"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Full of sarcasm, ridiculously funny, with wonderful prose interspersed. I am sure it was unique and shocking for its day but I believe it to be overrated and does not stand the test of time. He makes use of the dictionary, so keep one handy, and the ranting dialog gets to be too much. What Heller did was to spawn others to do the same, such as the novel \\"Castle Keep\\", which was better, and the movies Mash and Kelly's Heroes.The protagonist, and antagonist is a W.W.II bombardier who finds himself at the breaking point. Along with bombing missions his other mission is to find a way out of the war. It doesn't help that the Generals keep adding more missions onto the squadron's quota. We find our way into the hospital quite often through this read. The characters are unordinary, finding any way they can to divert and diverge themselves from the war; we discover entrepreneurs, maniacs, ridicule, capitalists, ineptness........ but rarely normalcy.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Stop changing the rules.That is what the title refers to - that fact that you need to successfully complete a number of missions to get out of the war, but when you get close, the nasty people in charge keep upping the number.This is a black comedy that follows our protagonist as he tries to get by while stuck in this ugly war situation with a bunch of crazy and going crazy fellow military, locals and other whacky people around the place.Both funny and bleak at once.Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When looking at the book, it looks like they had to cut down a whole tree to make it, but it's worth every cent. Personally, I am not a big reader, or a fast one, for that matter, so it did take me a while to read, but I most certainly enjoyed this book. Joseph Heller does a great job in putting comedy into such a serious topic as war. The book has so many morals like stay strong and success will come and different stories that will keep you awake all night; unfortunately, this book is hard to follow because of all the stories and you need to make sure that you remember what happens to each character and build off of that. I highly recommend it for more skilled readers. I am leaning more towards the high school age, and if you are an adult, then you will also get major kicks out of this one!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 captivated my attention from the very beginning. I'm not one to read books and enjoy them, but this one was different. It showed the stupidity of war and hateful situations with satire. Yossarian, the main character, leads us through his thoughts and actions, basically through a maze of situations unbeknownst to any but an unlucky sane soldier. There are times when you are so confused and enraged with what the way hierarchy decides things, you want to get inside their heads and figure out what they are thinking.We are reminded through Yossarian and other characters, Hungry Joe especially, that what may seem to be nonsense could very well be sensible, and what is known to be good could be bad. Hungry Joe reacts the opposite way you would expect a person to, when things are horrible he is happy, and when things are fine, he is miserable."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 can be a frustrating novel. I HATE the first 50-100 pages. The names of characters come flying out of nowhere. The circular and contradictory style of writing just annoys me. The nonlinear style annoys me.I stuck with it, and before you know it, it all comes together. That is the key. If you stick with it and not try to understand every single detail, or read every dialogue like you are some deep, intospective English teacher, it can be a lot of fun. Understand some parts are supposed to be confusing, and it is normal to feel lost.One chapter describes the roundabout way Milo Minderbinder makes a profit. It is supposed to sound absurd to you. Heller is sarcastically demonstrating the reality of war profiteering. Milo can make you furious, but what really made me furious was how he made no one else around him furious!Overall this was just a fun book, that appeals to the average person looking for a good read, and the serious reader looking for enlightenment. That is the genius of it. For a couple of days while reading the book I was talking like the characters, and I drove people around me crazy. I do not recommend doing this, especially if you are married. Just have fun with it!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"With good reason, Catch-22 is a smart alleck classic. Joseph Heller munches-up one of our most sacred institutions, the military and spits it back into faces. Through the eyes of Yossarian, the World War II bombardier who wants nothing more than to not die, Heller exposes all that is kitschy, absurd and soul-numbing about not just the US army but about the high-minded American attitude in general. Indeed, this is probably less a novel about warfare, as it is a novel that comments on all American extremes including extreme pride, extreme capitalism and extreme bureaucracy. Heller may be a gadfly and he may be too cute at times (my only significant complaint about his style) but it is undeniable that he often has a point. It is easy to commiserate with Yossarian. Why is the numbskull who commands his regiment any less of an enemy than the numbskull who commands the one on the other side when both could get him killed? What do things like pride and country matter to someone who is dead? What does it all mean in the end? Those are questions for the reader to answer, but it is pretty certain that there is a passage somewhere in Catch-22 that would take a pretty good shot at his or her resolution."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\" Chapter 5, pg. 55While this explains what Catch-22 is all about, I still found this book very hard to follow. Joseph Heller does a wonderful job at manipulating the language, but he seems to have done too good of a job. It is broken down so much that I had a hard time following the simplist plot twists and progression. While this pose a tremendous problem with the story, I will give it credit that it is strongly filled with wit, humor, confusion, and hope.Heller puts a powerful message of how pointless war is and the corruption of beuracracy. The colonels show the strongest representation of these factors throughout the novel. This seems like a very topic but the way Heller deliver's it is outstanding and confusing by the constant twists of Catch-22.I cannot say I would reccommend this book to most people."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Not my favorite novel of all time (hard for a woman to appreciate male bonding and glorified prostitution), but certainly worthy-in it's originality, wit, and cleverness-of the classic status it has acheived. Unnecessary for Heller to drive home the point of Catch-22 quite so repetitively throughout the novel, but Yossarian finally escapes it's spiral in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have to be completely honest that Im half way through this book and I'm looking for an escape hatch as I'm really not enjoying this masterpiece. Reading much of the one/two star comments I agree with the average interpretation but I don't agree with childish sledginging, naming those who enjoyed the book as fakers. I,m going to give the book back to the friend with crab apple cheeks and rubber under wear who gave it to me. Sorry mate but it just wasn't my cup of tea, this goes down with the one percent of books I couldn't find the will power to complete."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I do not like \\"Catch 22\\" book. The expression of this book is so difficult to understand. It was very long and too many characters. I was very bored when I reading this book. Also it is not my favorite type of book.However, sometimes the language of book is very funny. I like the scene, where Yossarian- a bombardier (main character) had the conversation with Luciana (Italian woman). Yossarian asked her to marry him, but they talked as if they are all crazy. That kind of conversation made me laugh the whole way of reading the \\"Catch 22.\\" Also the conversation between Yosaarian and Doc were very crazy too, it seemed as if they were out of mind. So sometimes I need to concentrate about what they tended to say to understand the conversation.\\"Catch 22\\" is about Yossarian who do not like the war. Yossarian always thinks that someone is trying to kill him. He thinks that the war is stupid and people are dead for nothing.I agree with him, I hate the war too. People die in the war. Moreover, all valuable structures and old relics are destroyed. Nothing is going to solve by using \\"the war.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This was my second attempt to read Catch-22 all the way through (last year I gave up after 40 pages).Reading this book was a chore, and it took about three weeks and every ounce of discipline I could muster to complete it. The thick cast of characters were exhausting to follow, the repetitive running gags were tedious, and the circuitous \\"narrative\\" was just irritating. The humor struck me as dated and corny, with few exceptions.I agree with other commenters who have said that a condensed version of the book would have been more successful. Its core \\"message\\" was clear and the concept of a \\"Catch-22\\" clever, but after 450 pages of being hit over the head with it...(come to think of it, being hit over the head would have been less painful than the long journey to chapter 42...)Like others, I also thought the ending was a bit too \\"suspend your disbelief\\" but by the time I got there, I was no longer invested in the outcome.To be fair, I did smile at a few passages, and certainly respect Heller's distinct style and abilities as a writer. Having never written a book myself, I admire his accomplishment, especially considering that it's become a part of the American vernacular and is widely regarded as a modern classic (and enjoyed my many, many people).It just wasn't my bag, and I'll probably never read another Heller book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I bought this book because it was known as a classic. I don't know if you have to read it 20 times, but I was confused through the whole book. I couldn't tell the timeframe of each chapter. Maybe I just don't appreciate that each chapter was a catch 22. Oh well, I don't suggest to buy this book, though."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In November 2000 I wrote a really lame review of this book, and I apologize, to Joseph Heller more than anyone. This is a re-write of that disappointing effort.I just finished the superbTracy Daugherty biographyof Joseph Heller, which led me to my annual re-read of this book. I was introduced to this book in October 1980 in high school Honors English, and I have read it at least every year since. I never get tired of reading it, and every time I do I find something new. I adore this book. It is my #1 favorite of all time, and likely always will be.Synopsis: Twenty-eight-year-old World War II B-25 bombardier Yossarian is faced with the prospect of death at every turn, and no one notices or cares. Eventually he finds a way to do something about it.The book is wild, sprawling, seemingly out of control. The non-linear format can be a turnoff to many, but if you stick with it, and just let the story unfold, it all makes sense. The story comes together, page by page. The payoff comes only in the final pages, but it all comes together. Really. It's also deeply, deeply funny, with an enduring humor that operates on a number of levels. Although written more than fifty years ago, the language and dialog remain colloquial.One thing I wrote eleven years ago I still stand by: the book is about a man and men, set in a purely masculine environment. The point of view is overwhelmingly male, and sexist, with every single woman in the book described in primarily sexual terms. Yossarian admits to it on page 291, \\"...Everything reminds me of sex.\\" Women exist in the story as foils for male action and as bases for Heller's editorializing. This being said, I would hope women reading the book gain some insight on general male approaches to and perceptions of women.So what is the book about? There's a lot going on here. Heller took more than ten years to craft it, its 443 pages edited down from the original manuscript's 1,000+. It's about the nature and burden of conformity in the most conformist institution (the military) during the most conformist of times (war), and how that conformity--and unquestioning obedience--will kill you. It's about the cruelty and inherent dishonesty in bureaucratic and hierarchical institutions, the inevitable corruption within capitalism, abuse of power, greed, deception, justice and injustice, heroism and cowardice, God and religion, and the manipulation of logic and language to legitimize a wrong, pronounce sentence or make a sale. The book is about the loss of innocence and the concomitant loss of youth to age, awareness, and ultimately to mortality. It is about the value and vitality of individuality, about friendship, humor and sex, and how essential these are to sense of self, well-being, and how we relate to others.While the story and themes are powerful enough, Heller's writing itself is a pure joy, with such gems as:-- Yossarian under physical exam, his body \\"...drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed...\\"-- \\"Hungry Joe was a throbbing, ragged mass of motile irritability.\\"-- \\"...he was dead, a bleeding cinder on the barbarous pile whom nobody had heard in those last precious moments...\\"-- \\"The clinging, overpowering conviction of death spread steadily with the continuing rainfall, soaking mordantly into each man's ailing countenance like the corrosive blot of some crawling disease.\\"-- General Peckem's \\"martyred smile of sweet reasonableness...\\"-- \\"...her hands lying in her lap like fallen moths.\\"-- \\"...the crazy, craggy, patchwork canyon of crashing antiaircraft fire...\\"-- \\"...the open-air theater, where the milky, dust-filled beam bursting horizontally from the projector slashed a conelike swath in the blackness and draped in a fluorescent membrane of light the audience tilted on the seats there in hypnotic sags...\\"-- Major Aarfy's \\"...fustian, moon-faced ineptitude...\\"-- \\"..the primal, powerful, rhapsodic instinctual rhythm of erotic ardor and abandonment...\\"-- \\"...a howling, strident, onrushing cacophony of overwhelming sound...\\"And there's Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City,\\" one of my favorite passages in the world. It is a stark, shattering 14 pages in heavy, dense paragraphs offering grisly detail in which Yossarian treads the inferno, descending into and through man's unending inhumanity to man, realizing it has existed and always will exist, only that up until now he had been unable to see it. The violence, cruelty and injustice cascade through the narrative. Heller's pacing, structure and word choice in this chapter are the high point of this book.As heavy as this book gets as the story unfolds, there is a great deal of humor, and this books still makes me laugh out loud. Its humor comes in all forms, clever puns, plays on words, turns of phrase, illogical actions, and at times the darkest and cruelest black comedy I have ever encountered. It is a deep, thought-provoking book which still makes me laugh out loud after more than 35 readings in the past 31 years.Bottom line: this is a brilliant work of fiction, an absolute treasure, and I recommend it with all of my heart."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Maybe it was somewhat shocking in its day to take a critical and lampooning look at the military and contemporary society, but its somewhat status quo today. The writing is decent, but not extraordinary. The chapters focus on a separate character, weaving their interactions together with some flashbacks and a few other out-of-chronology accounts. There are repeating themes about irony, deceiving appearances, contradictory motives, power-blind leaders, prostitutes, black markets, infirmaries, and borderline insanity. There are some interesting points made, but not nearly enough to fill up 450 pages. The list of characters is fairly impressive and engaging, but the narrative itself doesn't have a powerful arc, nor are there many philosophical insights or cathartic moments along the way. The characters are amusing, but one doesn't make an emotional connection. Overall, the passages on prostitutes and black markets seemed cliche by modern standards, and deflating via ennui with their trite and vulgar presence. In short, I was not blown-away (excuse the pun) or enthralled by this novel, skimming quickly over a large assortment of pages."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The book condition was good. However, we did not receive the book til after a month and a half had already passed. Good thing we didn't really \\"need\\" the book for something in particular.

This story spurs many philosophical and social discussions. With this novel, you can dissect meaning or you can enjoy the story for face value. As usually is the case, don't expect the movie to compare with the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"My one-line summary says it all. This is the best-written book ever. The characters are unforgettable, the setting is amazingly real, and the plot twists and turns, skipping around until it is on complete picture. Yossarian proves that often the people called crazy are the sanest ones."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a wonderful book if you don't just put it down and decide never to listen to anyone again. It presents the &quot;A person is smart, people are stupid&quot; viewpoint brilliantly and is addictive and a wonderful read (pgs 85-91 are the best); but the worldview it mocks has something to say too.I recommend reading Kurt Vonnegut's _Cat's Cradle_, which defends lies and organizations, either immediately before or immediately after this to get a little balance."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Although at first, Catch 22 may be hard to get into, with its short incomplete clips of scenes and overwhelming number of characters, it is well worth the read. Catch 22 is a catchy book filled with satire for war and its happenings. Highly suggested."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is a lot deeper than it may seem if one gives it only a casual brush. It concentrates on the evils of war (its absurdity) by creating a text with little concrete plot, shifting time, and characters who are as senseless as war itself. Heller makes his point very clearly, and this novel deserves to be regarded as a classic. Comparisons with Slaughterhouse-Five are almost certain to arise; Vonnegut's novel is the stronger of the two, but Heller should not be underestimated in any way. The message of this novel, which is developed slowly as Heller leads the leader up to a spilling secret, is plain; for a lover of peace and wry humor, this is an excellent piece to read. For a lover of war and conflict, however, this is a novel that should certainly be read; if everyone could be lead to see Heller's point of view, maybe the world would be a safer, better place for \\"nuts\\" like Yossarian."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I am not overdoing it when i say that catch 22 is undoubtably the most entertaining, humourous, unique and utterly beautiful book I have ever encounted. It is funny, yet sad and heart wrencing. I would recommend it for anyone, it truely is the greatest novel of the centry."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Yes, you probably could summarize this book briefly, but that would be to dismiss the point entirely. The book does not simply make a point and then drive it into the ground. Its length and content aid in its quality of satire. Heller could have abbreviated it after page 200, but, in keeping with the title, the ubiquitous sense of frustration and hopelessness would have been compromised, (not to mention the irony!!!)! This book says volumes about war, perhaps in as profound a manner as Johnny Got His Gun. And Heller achieved this with a caustic wit, and little to no reliance on horror. I read it seven times in a row, and discovered complex new layers each time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"At first I thought this book ridiculous. No one is as whacked as these characters. Then I started to recognize my own flaws. I saw that the ridiculous characters have the same flaws we all have, only exaggerated in the book. The Chief believes he will die of pneumonia so he does not bother to wear a coat. Of course he gets sick and dies of pneumonia. How many times have we lost before we started because we thought we could never win? We defeat ourselves as the Chief did. I saw myself in other characters too. Heller shows us our own tragic flaws through a cast of ridiculous, but quite realistic characters. Everyone should read this book. It is funny, sad, ridiculous and brilliant."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, it has to be the funniest book I have ever read. The title it self, is a law in the army that has many parts. One of the parts is to get discharged from the army, you have to be crazy. To say you are crazy, you have to ask the the doctor to keep you on the ground, but as soon as you say your crazy and want to be grounded, Catch-22 says you have to be sane to say your crazy so therefore you have to continue. The book is about a fleet of bombers that are bombing cities in Germany. They are constantly made to bomb The whole book was filled with crazy people, like Dunbar, he would do things he hated doing, because it would make time go by slowley. Dunbar thought this would make his life longer. Orr, had to be one of the wierdest guys out there with his stories about putting crabapples in his cheeks or the protitude that hit him with a shoe. The book is mostly composed of learning about characters and then their stories add on to a plot line indirectly. Throughout the book, it reveals more and more of a plot, about escaping war. I recomend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor and enjoy books about war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"this is one hilarious story with some of the most memorable lines i have ever read in a book! great read!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a comedic story that keeps you on your toes because of the hilarious actions and reactions preformed by those who are trying to escape the imfamous &quot;Catch-22.&quot; This catch makes it impossible for Yossarian and the other members of his squadron to go home. Everyone wants to be grounded or sent home so they don't have to fly dangerous missions. You can go home if your crazy, but anyone smart enough to say that they're crazy so that they can go home, is really sane. Along with Catch-22 keeping them in the service, a seemingly infinite amount of required missions also keeps the bombardiers in the air. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone ready for a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"At first I thought this book had a pretty slow pace to it, but once I got beyond Heller's style, I found it to be a very humorous and entertaining depiction-or mockery-of our country's military, and of the way people in general tend to think. It has a lot of good insight into the decisions we, as humans, tend to make, and of the effects our constant need for approval will have on our lives. Great book...I haven't laughed so hard in a long time!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In Joseph Heller's WWII story, Catch 22, we the readers are given a less than perfect picture of the realities of war. By showing the ironic and irrational events that take place during a war we are able to see why the main character, Yossarian, hates war, and tries his best to stay out of it as much as possible. Heller is able to produce a comic effect throughout the book by telling of some of the crazy stunts that Yossarian does in his attempt to live forever or die trying as he puts it. Yossarian fakes ever possible illness he knows, he makes himself and others sick and finally outright refuses to fly any longer. But in the end he must decide if he wants to risk the lives of others, or his own. The mess of other characters also adds to the humor of the work by showing the effects of war on all different types of people.This book was written excellently, and paints a very vivid imagine in my mind. The only thing slightly difficult about the book was the fact that Heller skipped around throughout the book, never going in order.For all those who think war is always the right way to go, don't read this. But I would recommend this for those who always wondered what it's really like to look death in the face, for this book is able to present it in a comical tone while still keeping it serious."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller writes Catch-22 to show how abusrd and pointless the idea of war is.

The doctor says if you are insane, then they have to ground you and anyone who is flying in the war and doesn't try to get out is insane, but the minute you want to stop flying or get out of the war, you are sane so you have to continue to fly.The characters in this book also portray how in a war you have some people that are only looking out for themselves and want to make a profit. One character in particular who sticks out is named Milo Minderbinder. Milo will do anything in order to make a profit.

And make sure that you enjoy it since it's the whole and only point of the book, if there is any point at all.J. Heller was a kind of writer who would produce something that his readers could enjoy from the bottom of their hearts.Many reviewers here and elsewhere tried so hard and too hard to make a serious solid stuff out of this book (i.e. trying to make it a masterpiece of twist philosophy..bla..bla...bla) which is actually just fine as long as they can still enjoy it.This is a lovely book. Please love it. You can criticize it anyway you like but please do not despise it.And for those people who gave and will give this book less than 4 stars just because it couldn't satisfy their philosophical-twisted minds.

First, I loved the book. The idea of turning a war into a comedy makes an interesting story. The complexity of Yossarian and other characters really draws the reader into the book. I would like to know if you know if there is any real truth to the story. I am interested in finding out if Joseph Heller, the author, experienced these events as a basis for his story. If you have any answers or have any e-mail addresses of people who may, please respond. Thank you."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"First of all, it is necessary to notify potential readers unfamiliar with this book that the writing style is very colloquial and the humor quirky. If you are looking for high-brow writing, I would say you are probably not looking in the right place. The author has a very conversational tone that verges on stream-of-consciousness writing.If you have seen the (1960's era?) movie, don't let that affect your decision to read this book. I thought the movie was OK, and it certainly followed the story mostly, but there was too much in the book to faithfully transfer the characters to film. Of course, this criticism stands for most books that turn into movies...The book, as I mentioned, has a very off-beat narrative style. Heller is very funny, but I don't think his sense of humor could be considered traditional. That said, When I read the book the imagery was so rich, and the dialogue and situations so crisp, that I could not help but laugh out loud on the BART (the local public transit system).Catch-22 mostly reads as a collection of stories about different interrelated characters. The book also does not have an entirely linear timeline-I'd guess that about one quarter of the book mostly relates to flashbacks the main character has.If you believe, like me, that great literature comes in many shapes and sizes, I can't think of a book that I can recommend more highly.As an interesting side-note, Heller mentioned on at least one occasion that the characters in Catch-22 were completely fictitious. He did serve in the military, but he never had anything but praise for his collleagues and superior officers.YOSSARIAN LIVES!!!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"That catch-22 is a very funny and insane book. Why i say it is insane is because it reveal the truth about the Wars an the views of Men. The characters in the book are in the War but non of them knows why they are there fighting so they are totally crazy as they are flying to bomb and kill the people. The main character, Yossarians, is the one we can say is the craziest of all, but,in my opinion,he is the one with the clearest state of mind to judge the war. Because he is the one who is trying to avoid the wars and refuse to fly. Milo who is a mess officer who is trying to do business out of the war and really make popular and success in the book. And the other characters are also very interesting and make you to think that if it is possible that people who in the war really look like them. The most interesting of all is &quot;the catch&quot; that is catch-22 in which people are trapped. It says, &quot;Yossarrians can be allowed to stop flying if he is crazy but then he has to ask the doctor to ground him, then he is not crazy when is asked then he can not be grounded.&quot; Isn't it crazy and confused?As the story goes on, the real purpose of the wars is becoming more clear, the more the stupid the wars become, and the sad the story become.As an Asian, I found that book is really difficult to understand but it will become more and more interesting and exciting in the end. So keep reading and you will find it really funny and insane or may be sad in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The first chapter of Catch 22 will either repel or enthrall the reader. Heller's emphasis on dialogue, combined with his ironic sense of humor and a set of absurd premises, makes for a writing style that is galaxies away from any other. Rapid scenario shifts keep the interested reader on his toes, although they will confuse and turn off anyone who's only marginally focused on the book.One potential problem for many is the book's lack of an obvious plot line. It reads more as a chronicle of a man's experiences told out of sequence than a story of his accomplishment. Certainly, many hints are given; however, it is not until the very end of the novel that the reader realizes that the novel concerns not a specific action but a specific mindset--namely, the mindset of a sane man who merely wishes to retain his sanity in the face of those whose sole purpose is to destroy it.The novel's only major flaw is its ending--not so much the content, but the style. The sappiness is what one would expect from Hollywood, and the abruptness makes the reader wonder if Heller didn't suddenly realize that he had a deadline to beat and had to end the novel right away. However, the ending is not reached until the end, and so all through the preceding pages the experience of reading Catch 22 remains flawless."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This isn't the type of book who's rating tends mainly on opinion. But more on how you read and studied it. While as everyone says it's a war novel, it's a metaphor on corporate America. It is a difficult read, but if you study it it will prove worthwhile. Reading with someone who knows the book also helps. It does help you become well read because of it's being one of a kind. You learn from it, not every book's hero is the ultimate anti-hero. Not every book is a paradox upon it's self.This could be read just for the humour. When you think about it though you wonder, why am I laughing, this is so dark. It's the way of writing only expert authors such as Heller can do that makes the book that way.Who you are also is necessart for the book. You need to be well read to begin with to get the most from it. You need to be willing to take your time. You need to not care if there are 5 pages where the characters swear 24 times. You need to be able to deal with this book. You could be a 13 year old mature high-school student or a 30 (or 50) year old adult. You need the inner maturity and perserveriance to do this book what it disearves."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While I was reading this book, I couldn't help but crack up. In class people would look at me oddly and then I would have to explain what was going on and then they would be laughing too. The way Heller presents these incredibly eccentric people is ingenius. His third person narrator is very matter of fact, though more compassionate toward some than others.The story starts out with Yossarian in the hospital flirting with the nurses and screwing around with his pal Dunbar until an annoyingly patriotic (but extremely likable) Texan moves in and pushes them all back out into war. The actual plot takes awhile to get going, but there is not a single boring page in this book. It is one of the funniest things I have ever read, and one of the most profound. It attacks bureaucracy, questions and ponders religion, and deals with ever present death. Honestly one of the best books I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh but wants to think too."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22: the only thing that can define a book that seethes with paradox, contradiction, and twisted reasoning. The novel is set in the closing months of the Second World War, on a little island off the coast of Italy. Heller skillfully depicts a generation of people who are used against their will and the sheer helplessness of their resistance to the system. What makes this piece of literature so clever is how Heller uses his characters, which seem so real, to create many instances of contradiction and questionable logic. For example, Major Major, who will only see people in his office he himself is not in it. Or Commanding Officers who care more about well shot aerial photographs of bomb targets than actually bombing the target. And the most twisted contradiction of all: the main character's (Yossarian) iron will to survive the war, or die trying.The novel stays fresh by unfolding many side stories that involve Yossarian's relationship with other characters. This, of course, tells the reader more about the men in the Bomber Division, but it also reveals more about Yossarian himself and his attempts to get himself out of as many missions as possible. Other characters present many of the recurring themes in the novel, such as faith. The division's chaplain, Chaplain Tappman, spends all his time preaching from the Good Book in hospitals and to the men, but at the same time, doubts everything he says, and the Lord's existence. Also, Yossarian's superior officers reveal the absolute weakness of language: while it offers no reassurance to those facing death, or those who could meet it, it offers the power of officers to trap their men in a hopeless prison of the army or in a grander scheme of things, bureaucracy.By the time I finished this book, I was again presented with another contradiction: while this book is serious, sad, and incredibly thought-provoking, it's quite the funny read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is an exciting and sometimes confusing adventure about a WWII bomber named Yossarian, and his atempts to get out of the war alive. I read this book for pleasure. I recomend reading this book if you are looking for a great book about as crazy as a book can be. The first couple chapters of Catch-22 and some vocabulary may be a little daunting to the reader, but the book is well worth the time to read.This book was amazing. I do not think I have ever read any thing this funny one minute then horrifying the next. The book is funny in how the world around Yossarian seems totaly absurd and impossible. Unfortunatly in a military setting Catch-22 may also be shockingly closer to reality then first presumed. I think more people who have been in the military at some point in time will enjoy reading this book than someone who has never been in the military"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you like Seinfeld and the Movie Pulp-Fiction you will love the jumbled plot and crazy characters of this book. Highly recommended, I've read the book several times and it still amuses me!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22- saddening, thought provoking, hope inspiring, and really rather good. no, not everyone dies, even though it starts to appear that way. i dont usually care for war related things that often, but this was worth reading. It takes a humorous and cynical approach the pointlessness of trying to escape war and the headaches it can cause. Catch-22 is the ultimate devil in this book and it consistantly pops up. The story follows one man and his struggles to survive in an insane and hopeless world. Add in a bunch of pilots begging to get home, a doctor who is technically dead, and a mess seargent who uses logic that surpasses everyone else's minds, and you have one motley crew. A book of laughs, tears, puzzlement, and thinking, Catch-22 is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I first read the title of this book, it brought to mind all the wonderful comments I had heard about it. I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. I was a bit intrigued after the first chapter, but I wasn't quite sure it was worth all the hype. As the book went on, I began to dislike it more and more, loving it all the same. It drove me nuts with every turn of a page. I was immediately thrown off by the absurd conversations depicted. I didn't understand how you could only go see someone in their office when they weren't there. But, I quickly warmed up to the idea that the book was just not going to make sense. The whole concept behind Catch-22 is that there is no logic; you have to find a way to use the illogical ways of the system to your advantage. Though I complained throughout most of my reading, I can say that I definitely enjoyed the book. It's one of those that will mess with your head; you just can't let it get to you. However, if you are planning on reading it, I would make one suggestion: make a list of characters and short descriptions as you read, or print a list from the internet. There are about 38 characters, not including some minor ones. If you do not find some way to keep them straight, you will find yourself flipping back pages all the time to remember who someone is."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I began this book with the intent of it giving me something to read for a class assignment.. I figured i was going to dislike it very much, and just pretend to read it. The way that Heller mixes fact and comedy blows me away. The details and descriptions of characters and places in this book are almost like watching a movie. Each character is drawn well, and very defined-- I began to feel for a few of them, and reading doesn't usually do that to me. There were a few parts of profanity that I wasn't totally getting a feeling for, but other than that it was good, and well worth the reading. My favorite character happens to be one by the name of Major Major. It is quite the story how he got the name, which you will have to read to find out. His character stuck with me from the first introduction. This book is about crazy people: You're crazy if you want to stay in the war. You're crazy if you want to leave, because you know you won't be able to. I definately give Heller kudos on this book, and I plan on reading more by him."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Everyone must read this book. I had to buy a new copy because mine got all ratty from carrying it around and yelling phrases at people in the mall"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There are parts in this book that made me laugh out loud. And it made me think. Books don't normally affect me that way. So there is something special about this book.When I finished \\"Catch-22,\\" I had to tell somebody about the book The urge to talk about it was strong.You always want to talk about grand realizations. Reading this book is one of life's grand realizations. There is no other novel like it in any other country. It is uniquely American.We all know the story. Yossarian's story. We all know about Snowdon. We all know about Milo Minderbinder. And about Major Major.What happens to them at the end of the book? They disappear. They all disappear. That realization made me sit up and take notice.When I was in Vietnam, my closest buddies went home before I did. They all went home at different times in those hot thirteen months. Until I was the only one left in Nam in my unit who remembered the past.Something like that happens in \\"Catch-22.\\" Yossarian is the only one left at the end of the book. But he also disappears in the last sentence: \\"He took off.\\"You are probably wondering where I am going with this. It is simply this: People you are close to today disappear tomorrow.Someone always moves, leaves the job, gets divorced, dies, and so on. You look around you and you wonder where did everybody go to? That was what I asked when I finished \\"Catch-22.\\"\\"Catch-22\\" is a fast read. It will leave you full of excitement. It is like drinking champaign: it leaves you feeling very bubbly. I envy the person who is reading it for the very first time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you like a good story, then do yourself a favour and read Catch-22. If there is one book everyone should read atleast once in their life, it's this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. I gave up early on and came back to it after reading one good review after another. The first few hundred pages can be confusing and even dull. Heller's disjointed out-of order story telling technique is very hard to come to grips with. There are some entertaining passages even at the beginning but you have to slog through many dimwitted puns. There are some scenes that are quite funny. The best, in my mind, is a scene near the end, where Yossarian is offered the chance to go home by the Colonels that have been tormenting him. There's only one catch, he has to agree to like them, to be their pal, and say good things about them. This is unacceptable and he chooses instead to run away. Skip the puerile chapter titled \\"Major Major Major Major.\\" The one joke of this insult to the reader's intelligence is the character's name: Major Major Major and the rank he is automatically promoted to on joining the army.It gets better after the slow start and story begins to come together once you get halfway through. Yossarian, or Yo-Yo to his friends, is the unhappy and psychotic bombardier who is the central character of this non-story. He's afraid of dying and is upset that his superiors have repeatedly raised the number of combat missions he must fly before he can go home. His friends are killed while incompetent, evil people are promoted and prosper. The black-marketeers Ex-PFC Wintergreen and especially Milo Minderbinder get rich. He's haunted by the memory of a fellow flyer (Snowden) dying in his arms over Avignon.Whether you think this novel is a good or not, it exists and many people who have never read the book are familiar with the title phrase. Heller uses Yossarian's situation to makes some points about the absurdity of war and, perhaps, of modern life in a Capitalist society. He points out that you are \\"free\\" just as long as you never actually want to use any of your freedom. It's interesting to see a depiction of American soldiers during WWII who have absolutely no patriotic or heroic feelings but are only concerned with saving their skin or perhaps profiting from the situation they are in. Mailer, in The Naked and the Dead, and other authors have expressed these sentiments better. This take on war and American society came to be the norm in the aftermath of the Vietnam War but it probably seemed very subversive when this book came out in 1961."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"You must read this book. Scroll up the page, click on &quot;Add to cart,&quot; and get on with it. Don't read any more reviews, don't let anyone tell you anything about the story. Discover it for yourself. This is important. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a great book. In fact it's such a great book that I decided to read IT instead of the one my teacher assigned. Well worth it! If you like writers who make fun of human stupidity, along with making fun of a lot of other things, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Throughout Catch - 22, Joseph Heller utilizes diction and irony to satirize the inner workings of the Armed Forces. By exercising his command of the English language, Heller comically portrays the Army in a way that makes the reader just have to laugh. The easiest examples of this comedy are some of the names the characters in the novel receive. The character Major ------- de Coverley is a symbol for the lengths the military will go to simply keep a secret, no matter how unimportant it may be. Throughout the entire novel Heller never once tells the reader de Coverley's first name. Another character that further illuminates the problems that plague the Army is Major Major Major. When this character enrolls in the Armed Forces, he serves as a symbol of how the military promotes it's soldiers, not by merit, but simply because the &quot;bigwigs&quot; feel like promoting someone. By promoting Major Major Major to a Major from a Private simply because some General thinks that it sounds good, creates a ridiculous situation that enables the reader to laugh at the Army that created it. Aside from his excellent word choice, Heller fills Catch - 22 with massive amounts of irony to instill in the reader a sense of hilarity toward the Armed Forces. When Yossarian is attending a question and answer session he and some other pilots as questions that have no answers such as &quot;Why is Hitler?&quot; This leads Colonel Korn to ironically proclaim that the only people who can ask questions are the people who never ask questions. Soon after, because no one was asking questions, the classes where considered worthless because Colonel Korn did not consider it necessary to try and educate people who never questioned anything. This shows how the Army will do something so stupid as give Colonel Korn orders, which achieve nothing, and call this a success. Also when Yossarian is sick in the hospital, the army makes him switch beds because the family of a man who just died has arrived and want to see him. Now, instead of telling the family that their son is dead already, they tell Yossarian to play along. But when the family comes to talk to him, Yossarian doesn't tell them that he's their son, he tells them that his name is Yossarian not Guiseppe. Normally people would think that perhaps they have the wrong person, but they persevere and take it in stride that he claims his name is Yossarian. The brother constantly reminds them that Yossarian is Yossarian but the parents don't listen because don't think that the army would lie to them, and yet in reality it did. Another good example of irony is when Doc Daneeka dies. On paper it shows that Daneeka was supposed to be in the plane that crashed, so Sergeant Knight assumes Daneeka is dead. Yet, when the doctor protests to Knight that he's alive, Knight just ignores him because he knows Daneeka is dead regardless of what Daneeka himself says. Here Heller is making fun of how the Army deals with people strictly on paper and not as the people who they really are. Another example of this is when Yossarian sits in the hospital bed with the wrong nametag, because he wants to sit next to his friend Dunbar. After extensive talks with a psychiatrist, Yossarian is ruled to be insane, and is to be sent home. But because of the wrong nametag and the fact the Army deals with people on paper, the person who's name is on Yossarian's nametag is sent home while Yossarian, the one who actually is crazy, is made to stay and continue fighting. To show the corruption of the Army, Heller uses situation irony when Milo Minderbinder bombs his own squadron for a profit. Now instead of being punished like the reader would normally think he would be, Milo is congratulated on how much money he made because all the bigwigs get a portion of the profits that Milo makes. By his word choice and hilarious irony, Heller creates a comedic atmosphere perfect for his satirical portrayal of the Army."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Most people claim this book is a &quot;war novel&quot;. However, like Apocalypse Now, war is merely the setting. This book is about life. More importantly, the &quot;absurdity of life&quot; as someone has said. After reading this book, I began to see through the &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; of society. An excellent piece of literature. You'll be better off for having read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In &quot;Catch-22&quot;, Joseph Heller paints an incredibly ludicrous, and simultaneously realistic, view of one man against the military-industrial complex. His writing style is difficult to get accustomed to, however once the reader starts thinking like Yossarian, every page is a welcome adventure. Joseph Heller weaves his tale with great skill, taking the reader from ironic situations so funny you *will* laugh out loud, to mind-numbing tragedy on the same page. My personal favorite? Colonel Cathcart, and his 'feathers in his cap' and 'black eyes'. I recommend this novel to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, rest assured you will have your eyes opened."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is so sad, its not funny. And there are other things in it that aren't even funnier. Like re-reading this damn book every two years or so and crying hard not to laugh at the same passages."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is one of those rare books that a reader can take from it whatever he or she wants. If it's humor you're looking for, then this is a funny, comical book to read with fast-paced, pinpoint dialogue (similar to the slapstick humor in Zuckers/Abrahams/Zuckers movies &quot;Airplane!&quot; or &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;). BUT FUNNY IS SUCH A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT. Catch 22 is rich with social and political symbolisim, which means if you're looking for something deeper than a &quot;good laugh&quot; there is plenty here to keep you busy thinking for a long time. Overall, I found Catch 22 to be a story of hope. That no matter how ridiculous or impossible the obstacles in front of you appear, you can conquer them with belief in yourself and a plan of attack."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Assigned this book prior to XMAS break and read it 3 times before class resumed. I read it once per year.

At that point I said WOW, this is great. It is a work of fiction, no doubt, but the writer could not have written this book without being in the Air Force in WWII. It may be the best book on the war, fiction or nonfiction."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 was easily one of the greatest masterpieces I've had the enjoyment of reading. The book will make you laugh, cry, and make you eager to read on. Of course though this book along with every other book imaginable isn't for every audience out there. For one thing veterans are sure as hell to hate it since the whole book makes a mockery of the military, and I also feel that people who are acute to profanity and sexual situations [are there such people?] wouldn't like to read this book. Young people such as myself are sure to love the book though; if they like to read to begin with. On a final note, I'd also like to say that Yossarian's cynicism reminds me very much of the character Holden Caulfield, the boy from the story The Catcher in the Rye (which is another one of my personal favorites). To those people who've read CITR then Catch-22 is for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"To the reader from main Street USA (who I strongly suspect either didn't read the book, or didn't understand it)1 - The Military IS evil - though not neccesarily the individuals within it.2 - not evertone in the military is an idiot - just the ones that aren't evil3 - Not everyone who mocks the military is heroic - but anyone who does it as well as Heller (or Yossarian, if you like) certainly isthe reason you hate this book is because you and your philosphy are its targets. I am sure Heller would hate a reactionary idiot like you to like the book. if you did, he'd have got something wrong."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Who needs plot when you have plenty of fascinating characters and plenty of examples of wry humor. So this book didn't have a regular plot. If it did, Heller wouldn't have been able to show the aspects of his characters and the scenes that he did. This book was a successful blend of comedy and life lessons. People complain about not agreeing with the theme of the novel. Which theme? There was more than one. Depending how you looked at this novel, you would come away with many new outlooks on life, or disappointed because you only found one theme and disagreed with it. Heller's writing style is unique and clever. Buy this book. Don't listen to the people who hated it, or the people who loved it like me. Read the book and draw your own conclusions. (One thing is for sure, as long as you keep an open mind, you'll love it.) Now go read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Ok, I can see how the cynics could get all deep and delve through the mixed messages of war and rank in this novel, and how the contradictions could be seen as frustrating, but, as far as I'm concerned, this is the best book ever written, better that Don Quixote and the Bible combined (though I've read neither). Here's what I think. I don't think the book was hard to get through. I read it very quickly the first time, although, I later went through it a second time with a dictionary, circling the words I wasn't familiar with (of which there are plenty) and wrote their definitions in the margins. Now, whenever I am bored, I can just grab this book, open it to a random page, start reading, and laugh and laugh and it will never get old because the contradictions and the nonsense are the exact ingredients that make life itself a never ending roller coaster. A bit over the top? Ah, who cares, it's not like this is The New York Times. Don't be afraid of this book. Read it, but make sure you keep an open mind because the moment you insert a prejudice or a preconceived idea of right or wrong you WILL get angry and throw the book and you may end up hurting a pet or loved one."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is widely regarded as the classic masterpiece for all comic warfare novels. It cleanly addresses the pointlessness of trying to escape war, as well as topics such as bureacracy, hypocrisy, and captitalism. It has a cynical, sarcastic style of writing that is sometimes hard to trudge through however. Yet while using this style, Joseph Heller has perfect control of where he wants the story to go; what he wants you (the reader) to feel. Through the eyes of the sometimes crazy Yossarian, we see that no matter what he does, he cannot escape flight duty during World War II. Yossarian flies at maximum altitude to evade German anti-aircraft \\"flak\\", changes flight maps, destroys the cockpits radio, even fakes illness to get out of flying. An antagonist of the story, Colonel Cathcartt, keeps raising the number of missions required to fly before the pilots can be honorably discharged. This really ticks off the reader as well as many pilots, even driving one to have violent nightmares. I would recommend this book to individuals thinking about joining the military because of its exposure to a different side of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's classic, Catch-22, is a very intriguing novel that I would suggest to anyone. Though the book is about war, extensive knowledge of history is not needed to love this book. Catch-22 is written in a different manner than other war novels. Set in WWII, the novel continually moves from the hilarity of the personal situations between the soldiers and the horrors that all involved in war face.People generally agree about the validity of WWII. Catch-22 presents a side of it that is rarely seen. Heller's protagonist, Capitan Yossarian, hates the war and takes it personally. Throughout the novel, Yossarian constantly wonders why he is risking his own life for people that will eventually die anyway. Everything has a \\"Catch-22\\"- it is impossible for him to feel that he is in the war for good reasons, but he must stay there or he will be punished. I feel that it is beneficial to see both sides of the issue. Catch-22 is very interesting in that it shows us a unique perspective that diverges from the norm."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is Joseph Heller's satire that pokes fun at the military. In it, the army has absolute power, dictating the lives and fates of the men in its power. The military constantly increases the required missions for the men. Colonel Cathcart, the person who raises the mission requirement, is risking the lives of his men in order to impress his superior officers. This reflects the futility of their situation. The reason they risk their lives is not to help the country. Instead, they fight for the greed and ambitions of one man.The main character, Yossarian, is constantly afraid that he is going to die. People think he is insane, but the fact that he wants to leave and survive makes him possibly the sanest person there. Each chapter in the novel centers around another character in the military (though, with few exceptions, everything leads back to Yossarian and his plight). From Major Major Major's issues with his name to Colonel Scheisskopf's fixation with parades, these characters and their situations are very interesting and amusing.While hilarious and amusing, Catch-22 does have a deeper meaning. It talks of the futility of war and the powerlessness that men can have against bureaucracies such as the military. Yossarian's reflections on life and morality in the midst of chaos are surprisingly deep."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of those books that everyone ought to read, because it is so effective at chronicling one of the strangest sides of the human condition. The book is hilarious throughout; the result of this is that it's much easier and more fun to read than most anti-war books, and the violence and horror are much more affecting. Absurdist and pointed at the same time, this book is much more potent than many other more serious war novels. Heller's writing style is not very literary, but it gives the book more of an urgency and a realism. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In the beginning, we are introduced to the protagonist, Yossarian, and the situation based in the last part of WWII. It is difficult to keep from chuckling out loud while reading about the many desperate attempts of the squadron to escape the gruesome and violent conditions of the war. Somehow, Joseph Heller incorporates a light-hearted, humorous tone into a melancholy situation. By claiming to be sick and insane, the men buy time away from the dangerous flights, but the captain just keeps sending them on more required missions before they can be sent home. This actually holds the pilots in the captivity of the war until they complete the continuous assignments. With these discouraging conditions, Yossarian endures many difficult experiences, including the death of his friend. The ending is technically a happy ending but the reader is left with a feeling of despondence. Though I began the book expecting it to be more of a male's favorite, I was surprised at my enjoyment of this action-packed, humorous novel. This book deserves a four because it is hard to put down, but not my favorite."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is one of the greatest novels written in the 20th Century. Heller's sense of absurdity and pacing is remarkable. His understanding of the double standards created by greed and dishonesty give depth and meaning to a world hungry for answers. His style is not lost on a new generation of writers: David Sedaris for one has mastered the wit of satire. A new writer, John Orozco in his DELANO, pays tribute to Heller with rapid fire dialogues that are reminiscent of CATCH-22. These satires are valuble in exposing hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Simply put, Catch 22 remains entirely original and absurdly different 40 years after its first publication. It's 1984 with wit and satire. You'll laugh 'til it hurts and maybe even think a bit too. Buy it and let Joseph Heller surprise you with his weird and wonderful way of writing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is quite possibly the best book that I have ever read. Heller's first novel isn't a classic because it's old or the dying fart of some well-respected author--its a classic because its hilarious and at the same time dark, because its meaningful and at the same time completely irrational. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fans rejoice, because this is the book that sired it. This is what black humor ought to be--and frankly, everyone who's read this book knows it! It's zany, its fun, but its also worth your time. Catch-22 turns life--and war--inside out and laughs at it. Its philosophy: \\"to live forever or die trying\\"! Read it; you couldn't possibly be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What more can be said about &quot;Catch-22?&quot; It's one of those classics that is such a staple, you grow up with it as a part of the cultural fabric. As a student of literature and culture, I think it's an absolutely brilliant satire; as a sarcastic person with an odd sense of humor, I find it immensely pleasurable to read and re-read. The first time around, it can seem pointlessly bizarre, and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that satire is an extremely difficult genre to pull off well. And &quot;Catch-22&quot; pretty much wrote the book (no pun intended) on satire. What's frightening is how prescient it is, how uncomfortably close to truth satire is. Re-reading &quot;Catch 22&quot; during the war with Iraq is a supremely creepy experience. But I guess that speaks to how important it is as a work of literature. If you haven't read it, you should. If you have, you should read it again."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"My daughter says...The story of Catch-22 opens with the introduction of Captain Yossarian. Captain Yossarian, quirky and extremely paranoid, is the protagonist of the tale. Throughout the story, he is paranoid that everyone around him is trying to kill him. Yossarian's only wish is to fly the required number of missions, seeing as he is an American bombardier during World War II, and return home. However, due to the prideful actions of his Colonel, Yossarian has difficulty fulfilling his goal. Colonel Cathcart continually raises the number of missions his bombardiers have to fly in order to increase his own glory. Catch-22 is an accounting of the actions Yossarian takes to try and escape death, as well as the story of all the interesting, slightly odd, people he meets.When the number of required missions is first raised, Yossarian travels to the Army doctor to try and get the doctor to certify him as insane. However, Doc Daneeka refuses to allow Yossarian to get out of his missions due to the now-infamous Catch-22. According to the army's regulation Catch-22, any soldier who tries to get out of fighting by pleading insanity is showing personal concern. By showing this concern, the person proves himself sane, because insane people don't care about their lives. Men who are truly insane have no trouble flying more missions. However, since the only way to be \\"grounded\\" is to request that you are, and the act of asking implies sanity, no person can get out of flying their missions. Yossarian, therefore, has no choice but to continue to fly the ever-increasing number of required missions.Yossarian, foiled in his attempt to plead insanity, attempts a number of other measures. First, he pretends to have some sort of liver problem and is checked into the hospital. In order to avoid being bored, Yossarian forges the name \\"Washington Irving\\" on a number of the soldiers letters home he is asked to censor instead of writing his official signature. This action leads to a huge problem later on in the book as all the officers try to discover who Washington Irving really is. That problem is only compounded as various other soldiers began copying Yossarian. When he is finally thrown out of the hospital, Yossarian moves a line on a map of Italy to avoid flying a dangerous mission.Through the next section of the book, Yossarian has to deal with the deaths of several of his closest \\"friends.\\" Snowden, the young Nately, and Hungry Joe are all bombardiers like Yossarian who ultimately get caught by one accident or another and die. With these deaths, Yossarian simply refuses to fly any more missions. This has a profound influence on the other soldiers stationed with Yossarian, and they silently begin to support him. Because of this, Colonel Cathcart offers to make a deal with Yossarian. If Yossarian will return back to the states and tell everyone how wonderful his superior officers are, they will let him go home. At first he considers the offer, but then realizing that it would be selling-out his fellow soldiers, Yossarian refuses.Instead, when the chaplain brings Yossarian to the living quarters of Orr, Yossarian realizes that Orr is not lost at sea like everyone believes. Instead, Orr carefully planed his escape by practicing crash landings on every flight he made. This time, instead of returning to the base, Orr had made his was to Sweden. Yossarian decides that he will run away to Sweden and join Orr there so he does not have to continue to risk his life fighting in the war.Review:Unlike most books about World War II, Catch-22 does not attempt to describe specific battles and provide insight in the course of a war. Rather, it deals with the human interactions that are a part of war. Catch-22 is more than just a war novel, it is a novel about why people act the way they do when put into certain situations. I really enjoyed reading Catch-22.One of the most dominant themes in Catch-22 is that of insanity. In almost every chapter of the book there are examples of people using insane argumentation to make logical points. Catch-22 takes a look at the way people form so-called reasonable assumptions and proves how everyone, it seems, is crazy in their own way.In the very beginning of the book, Yossarian travels to the hospital and meets the army Clergyman. Once he decides that the man is not insane, Yossarian warns him that insanity is contagious, and, indeed, by the end of the book it seems that Yossarian is correct. By the second chapter, Yossarian has determined that war itself is madness. Men fight and die for a crazy notion of patriotism and that doesn't seem to bother anyone. Yossarian's friends think he is crazy because he recognizes the insanity around him, however Yossarian realizes that it is this awareness that will ultimately save his life. Because Yossarian knows he is in constant danger because of those surrounding him, he is prepared to defend himself against anything at any moment.The presence of the Catch-22 itself is a prime example of insanity in the book. It employs insanity to come to an insane conclusion, yet on the surface appears to be a logical chain of reasoning. Even doctors in the book are figures of madness. Yossarian is evaluated by a psychiatrist who determines that he is insane, however, because Yossarian went to the doctor under a different name, the doctor sends a different soldier home even though he knows that person is not the one he diagnosed as crazy.Another example of irrational circular logic occurs when Yossarian proposes to Luciana. Luciana refuses to marry Yossarian because she believes he is insane. She thinks he's insane because he wants to marry her. Luciana tells Yossarian he is crazy, yet she justifies this belief with irrational thinking, proving herself delusional.Perhaps the best irony of the book however, is that Orr, supposedly the craziest of all the men, ends up being the sanest. In the beginning, Orr tells irrational stories and walks around with strange objects in his mouth. He does this so if anyone ever asks him why he has a certain object in his mouth, he can say that he doesn't have that thing in his mouth and pull out something else. He is, of course, utterly sensible in this belief. Orr is also, however, believed to be the luckiest man in the unit, because he is always crashing his plane and making it out alive. In the last chapter of the book, Orr crashes his plane in the ocean and disappears. Yossarian is at first shocked by this news, then stunned, as he realizes that Orr was not actually crazy. Rather, Orr feigned insanity in order to disguise his escape plans. The last time he crashes, Orr went to Sweden instead of simply dying like everyone thought. In the end, Orr used his insanity as his cover, and as his ticket to freedom.Typically, I am not a fan of any book dealing with historical wars. Catch-22 however, caught my interest quickly and held it throughout the book. I would recommend this book to everyone, no matter what kind of genre they usually enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When this book came out in the 1960's the world was obviously a different place to todays world.WWII was recent history and the old guard establishment in the UK and US were in control of the media .The reviews were mixed because the reviewers did not understand or comprehend the subtleties and genius of this book. They missed the point.I remember reading it at the age of 13. We were brought up to be voracious readers in our house and this in truth got under the wire as my parents did not really understand what it was. They were about as pro-establishment as you could get. They blamed the downfall of the British Empire on The Beatles.Suffice to say I have probably read this a dozen times in my life at the age of 50.I used to stay up late in bed laughing till I cried re-reading individual chapters. I still do .I read it again last year.A remarkable insight into human nature. No need to describe the events."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The only novel I have read 3 times. First was in high school then again in college and after many years again just recently. Although this story has WWII as a backdrop, it could have been anywhere and anytime. It clearly shows the illogical aspects of life with tremendous insight and humor. The cast of charactors are wonderful. 90% of my reading is non-fiction but of all the novels that I have read this is my #1 favorite of all time and my candidate for best novel of the 20th Century. Enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"And now to explain Catch-22 in a single word \\"circular\\". Heller managed to create a variaty of characters and then milk them for all they've got. For those of you who expect an anti-war book, go read something else. If, however, you enjoy quality literature and can stand the unexpected, Catch-22 is addicting.Note: This book is very confusing, and to those who can't make sense of it, it will be really bad. I read it for an english class, but if I tried reading it for pleasure, this reviewed would be titled \\"ADD Overload\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, a great satirical work, presents many characters with extraordinary personalities, the most important of whom is Yossarian. A witty man, he constantly tries not to avoid being killed while serving his duty in WW II. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early in the book and uses the book's title phrase Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that soldiers will be sent home who are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doctor tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then must have someone vouch for his insanity. Yossarian then assumes that he will be dismissed after this, but the Doc adds one more stipulation: if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy, they can't be crazy because anyone who doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase \\"catch-22\\" now appears in the dictionary because of this book. If that fact does not suggest the importance of this book, I don't know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows a lighter side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle during wartime but Catch-22 uses humor to show how the conflicts between one man and the solders fighting along side him affect him in war. This book will be able to make you laugh about some very serious issues that effected people during WW II.One reason that I recommend this book so highly is that it has been banned. The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it. This book was banned because it refers to women as whores. The text does not dwell on that, though. Readers who feel offended by this term cans easily substitute another term. If you want to read a great book that will make you laugh, you definitely should read Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I first read Catch-22 a few years ago, initially put off by the style of this book. For example, there is no true concept of Time, as you jump between the past and present continuously. Similarily there is very little unity between the chapters (when you first read it), as Heller jumps between Major Major Major's life story in between stories of Milo Minderbinder. If you are just a conventional reader who is looking for a fantastic or winding plot, this book is DEFINATELY not for you.However, what make Catch-22 so great is the flexibility of the novel: I can pick it up and read any chapter I want to at any time and STILL be entertained by the events. Each chapter is more or less self-sustaining (save the first and the last chapters), creating an entirely different reading experience. With light (and occassionally dark) humor, the novel remains in high spirits and occassionally brings you abruptly back to earth into the grim reality of war.I seriously believe if you DO NOT own this novel, you obviously have not been reading the proper literature all your life. So go buy it now, I can almost guarantee you will not be let down."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As I started to read this novel I was immediately overwhelmed with the persistence of new characters. But as I started to learn the little niches and such that I could attach to each of the characters it made it much easier to follow, and thus allowed you, by the end of the book, to really piece together the whole meaning of the book and sit back and really take in what Heller tried to give to his reader when he wrote it. And that is a feeling of utter dismay for all that has been thought to be of benefit to a military force; the unquestioned following of leadership, cold and detached attitude towards a human, and a bigger than thou regard for the rules that everyday citizens are expected to play by and keep in mind when they interact and function together."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It seems to me that almost all of the people that DON'T like this book and don't understand the humor are the exact same people that sit around watching sitcoms that base humor on bodily functions. Heller was a genious. I finished the book today, and I don't quite think I'll ever be the same. I am among the few that found the book more serious than satirical. Something about the book just lets anyone identify with it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Without a doubt, the greatest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Heller was, in my mind, a true genius. He not only changed my way of thinking in many respects, but inspired me to write in the hopes that I, too, might make someone think. I would like to point out that the absurdity and lack of logical progression that so many seem to find &quot;pointless&quot; were, in fact, the genius of the novel--they were meant to reflect the craziness of war. Sadly, it seems too many could still profit from reading this classic."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller has written a book of such broad scope, such immense power and such depth, that the reader is absolutely entranced to every page.It takes place on a fictional island during World War II, revolving around a group of bizarre, truly individual characters that are slowly going mad. Catch-22 basically means a 'lose-lose situation'. Each of these men get caught up in the insanity, the beaurocracy and hypocracy of the war that they are trapped on the island, prisoners of the military rather than the war. Despite whatever they try, the just can't get out: Catch-22. The author articulates the isolation of the island into an excellent backdrop for a brilliant character study.There's Yossarian, the main character, who is gradually descending into madness. There's Milo Minderbinder, the cold-hearted entrepreneur who is using the war to generate revenue and who bombed his own base so the Germans would pay him. Also, there's Colonel Cathcart who is so focused on getting a promotion that he volunteers his bombardiers for the most dangerous of missions, just to impress the general. There's Chaplain R.O. Shipman, who is losing his mind and his faith, and there's Hungry Joe, whose terrifying nightmares make him scream and swear in his sleep, causing the entire squadron to lose sleep. These are just some of the many characters in the book who are revealed through tantalising vignettes.The writing in the book is truly masterful; the author commands a strong grip of English vocabulary. The plot moves along in illogical, chronologically incorrect sequences, making for a very unique reading experience. There is little violence or language: the author generates tension from the psychological aspect of the story.This is an exemplary book, which should be studied in English Literature classes, rather than books such as 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstien', or 'The Great Gatsby'. It is tense, hilarious, black, cynical, satirical and formless. An absolutely brilliant character study."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What is the message or moral?Joseph Heller is trying portray the message that life is worth living. The American system is corrupt. There is not a point to fighting for a country that does not fight for him. It is closely related to Greek myth of Sisyphus. As Sisyphus pushes a boulder up a hill in Hades, it rolls back to earth. He continues to do this into eternity since there is no end to his task.Did he say it well?Heller's message was shown very well. Characterization was excellent. The reader is able to sympathize with Yossarian, the main character. As the number of missions to be flown rises, so does Yossarians desire to escape and go home. The reader is supposed to be able to identify Yossarian and his life with their own. Yossarian tries convincing the doctor that he is insane so he doesn't have to fly. It doesn't work because of Catch 22. He'd be insane to want to fly, and sane to know that he was doing something insane.Heller's values also came through in the symbolism used in the book. The dying fighter, Snowden, represents Yossarians own death. Snow (Snowden) is also white, representing the absence of color and life. When Yossarian walks around the air base in the nude, it represents his rebirth.Was it worth saying?The message was worth saying. Joseph Heller showed America how pointless it can be to fight for a cause. Yet Yossarian faught for his own cause: to live. He wanted to live and enjoy the rest of his life instead of being one of the many killed or lost in action"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"You have to be a certain type of person to like this novel. I imagine many people are that type of person. I am not.For me, the problem with Catch-22 was that Heller never developed the characters in a way that made me like or dislike or otherwise feel a certain way about them. Most of his descriptions of the characters focused on superficial qualities; he hardly developed the *character* of the characters (other than Major Major) at all.These superficial traits, however, do not have universal appeal. Different people have different opinions of these superficial qualities, and my opinions are evidently very different from Heller's.Take General Peckem. It was obvious that Peckem was supposed to be the epitome of annoying characters in the novel, based on his name alone. Yet, when we finally met him, I hardly found him annoying at all. In fact, I found him rather efficient.Maybe there's a certain honesty about not presenting characters in a way designed to influence the reason's opinion of them. But Catch-22 is a satire, and a satire depends on the reader feeling a certain way about the characters. Much of the satire didn't work for me because I didn't share Heller's feelings about the charaters.Now, having said all that, I will say that I think most people, especially military and other action types, will share Heller's opinions, and will understand the satire.The other problem I had with Catch-22 is it's lack of temporal continuity. It seemed that you could read most of the chapters in the book in any order and it would make just as much sense, which is not much. Also, there was a ridiculous overuse of a certain figure of speech (mostly used to describe Milo).On the good side, the book was quite funny, and the satire was amusing where it made sense to me."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is incredible; I've enjoyed reading it and re-reading many times since my first copy when I was in 8th grade (I'm now 62)I wanted to purchase this classic novel to carry on my Kindle but ... the Kindle edition is more than the paperback edition.I will not buy with this pricing policy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I don't presume to add much to the varied and detailed reviews of the book, except perhaps for an observation on how a popular work esteemed by one generation simply may not transcend its own time.Like many, I first read Catch-22 many years ago in high school. I don't believe it was assigned; rather, it was one of those revolutionary, counter-cultural books that you just HAD to read (Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). At the time, the Vietnam War was winding down, the \\"counter-culture\\" had come and was rapidly going, and unbounded faith in the wisdom and integrity of authority (especially governmental authority) seemed dubious, at best. Although it was published a number of years prior to that, Catch-22 seemed a brilliant evocation of everything we KNEW was wrong with authority, the govenment, war (read, Vietnam) and capitalism. War was wasteful, individuals were largely pawns in a much bigger game, rapacious capitalists would deal with either or both sides to make a buck, and the underlying logic of the entire equation could only be described as \\"absurd,\\" or, perhaps, a rational man could only grasp the world, and continue to function with his reason intact, if he came to appreciate absurdity.I still believe Catch-22 brilliantly makes all of these points. I will never forget, for example, Milo Minderbinder's seemely bizarre schemes to make money for the \\"syndicate\\" by cornering the market in cotton and trying to produce from it something edible, or contracting with the other side to bomb his own army. Similarly, the concept of Catch-22 (only a crazy man would want to fly more missions, and if you are crazy, we can't let you fly more missions; but you don't want to fly more missions, so you're not crazy, so you have to fly) has become a part of the language, though I'm not sure everyone who uses the term these days (fewer do) could explain its meaning or origin. Finally, I love the idea that, because time seems to pass more quickly when you are bored, the best way to extend your life is to bore yourself unmercifully.All of that being said, I do believe that many of the more negative reviews of the book result from our familiarity with so much of the political landscape of the book that, 40 years ago or more, seemed positively shocking, if not revolutionary. Ours is not an especially revolutionary time, so Heller's absurdity, on the one hand, seems a bit out of step. More than that, it is no longer new; we've heard it all before. Reading Catch-22 now seeems a bit like listening to an overly long joke that we've heard too many times. Finally, it is hard for us to appreciate how unique the book seemed in the '60s and 70's as a critique of war, especially a critique of World War II--the Last Good War of the Great Generation. Before Heller, the literature coming out of WWII, despite depictions of avarice or cruelty or waste, had none the less esteemed that war as a great and good thing that, in pertinant part, overthrew an evil dictator and freed (part of) Europe, etc. It was shocking to see THAT war depicted in THIS way.I only came to indulge in this review because, recently, I thought I would re-read the book. I was hoping I would find it fresh and funny and insightful (as I remembered it). I was disappointed. It was still occasionally funny and made many of the points I remembered. But the disjointed nature of the narrative seemed confusing and indulgent, whereas I remembered it as groundbreaking. And much of the book left me rather cold. It seemed long-winded, and repetitive (because we really did get the point), and many of the characters seem as if they are there only to set up a joke or make a point and they are not especially real or multidimensional.In any case, I would still recommend reading the book. Like many \\"popular\\" or \\"political\\" books, however, to really appreciate it requires casting your mind back to a different time and looking at it from that perspective. Without doing so, it is hard to realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was. On the other hand, if you cannot or will not approach the book from that perspective (and it is certainly no sin if you cannot), I'm afraid a new reader will find himself agreeing with the more negative reviews on this site. That seems a shame, even though I can hardly imagine Heller or any of his earliest readers contemplating that the book would ever be a historical curiosity or an expression of the mind-set of its day rather than a penetrating satire."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I just finished reading this book, and it was definitely a chore. I was very disappointed with it because it's widely hailed as a great and 'hilarious' work of classic fiction and I saw it as exactly the opposite.Once again, as with many books I've read, the foreword wasn't really worth reading. It should have been an afterword because it basically described the process of getting the book published along with all the successes and obstacles therein. As with almost every foreword, it contained some amount of spoilers which dismayed me because I prefer to find such things out myself. Those curious about the history behind the book or folks who have read the book before and bought the new copy would find it useful.After reading the first three chapters, I was wondering when the book would begin to be funny and enthralling. I was constantly confused about what was happening and most of the \\"Jokes\\" fell flat. The book is intentionally written in a manner that makes the reader dig deep to link events together, which I personally didn't care for. I felt like I was watching \\"Lost\\" by the way everything was spread out and the beginning of the book in particular offers tiny pieces of the plot through seemingly incongruous events.As I tried to get into the book, I developed a strong distaste for the writing style and I had to force myself through this book most of the time. There were only a few parts that I found funny, but I was mostly disappointed by the real lack of any climactic action whatsoever. The reviews I had read about this book had me expecting a hilarious thrill ride but it's almost half dialogue apart from tons of unnecessary descriptions and a smattering of fistfights and actual combat.I think that Heller's sense of humor was lost on me. This book is a riot if you love reading the same thing over and over again. When the reader isn't trying to figure out which character is terrified about which or waiting to find the significance of an event, the dialogue drones on and the paradoxes and contradictions that make the heart of the book pop up incessantly and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I did find some parts funny, but those parts were far too few to be redeeming. I do not consider this book to be especially funny, and I do not think that the humor of the book should be mentioned in most of the quotes and synopses on the back cover or in the Amazon.com description. I could see it being a bit better in movie format because of how important the tone and delivery of the dialogue is, but I have not seen the film nor do I intend to. If you disagree with my sentiment, then take into consideration that I found the Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger to be the funniest novel I've ever read and blame my sense of humor for that.The characters were pretty well developed, and with all the description the reader knows about every freckle or wart on their faces. Some of them were funny or surprising at first, but the way every person is involved in nearly every event makes juggling all the names and facts exhausting at first. As the story goes on and the plotline jumps wildly around, I think that some readers would have to have a pen and paper ready to take notes as things progress tiny bits at a time while the focus is on a different subject. Luckily, everything is restated several times and if you missed anything the first time, you're sure to see it pop up again and again.I think that the main reason why I didn't like this book was the fact that in reading through it I had effectively read the same thing twice, if not several times with all the repetition. The secondary reason is that my expectations of this book were simply too high and I didn't appreciate the way life and death were so inconsequential, and insignificant events and errors were blown out of proportion. I understand that the book is meant to be partly satirical about the military and about that very portrayal of such skewed priorities, but such a piece of writing is simply not for me. I don't feel that this book is deserved at all of its reputation and I would never consider buying the sequel or recommending it to a friend.I saw fit to rate it two stars because it is not entirely without good qualities, but I couldn't help but wonder why the book couldn't have been written in chronological order. I suppose that that quality is part of the charm, but I would have preferred a less repetitive book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While some might sing their praises of Joseph Heller and his \\"masterpiece\\" in the book Catch-22, one should not be so quick to join in unless a serious examination of the book has been undergone. There is a premise for greatness in this book, a foundation upon which Heller could have created a truly wonderful piece of literature, both comical and unobtrusive into the morals of those who read it, but this is not the case.The book is downright hilarious at times, mournful at others, and downright disturbing in parts. Many sections of Catch-22 will have the reader cracking up with laughter, as Heller uses his wit to full effect in the many characters which fill the pages of Catch-22, from hated generals to deaf pilots; one cannot help but smile at their antics. Likewise, the book takes place during World War Two, and therefore is forced to take a somber mood as sanity is slowly ripped away from those exposed to war for too long, and terrible accidents claim the lives of young soldiers. The character Yossarian the cowardly bombardier, claims the reader's full attention with his witty attempts to stay grounded and out of the flak filled skies of Europe. He is able to conjure up many a sickness yet undiscovered by mankind which keep him in the hospital, but is incapable of finding a way home, as the loathsome Catch-22 keeps virtually everyone in service regardless of physical or mental ailment. One will begin to feel a burning hate for the superior officers of Yossarian who are continually adding on to the staggering number of flights each person must endure before a much hoped for trip home, and yet still be able to laugh at them. The book, told from the view point of the mentally disturbed Yossarian, takes all concepts of what should be right or wrong and twists them so that one must reevaluate just exactly what is the correct course of action for Yossarian to take as to whether or not he should remain patriotic and continue to unwillingly serve his country.These feelings cannot cover up the sense of disgust that sits deep in the pit of the reader's stomach however, as the book is fraught with sexually explicit encounters, which are present in nearly every chapter, and which detract from the overall enjoyment of reading. Whorehouse scenes take the formerly comical, or formerly somber feelings and ruin any previous enjoyment of the book that was extant. Seemingly unnecessary hotel room depictions degenerate the most interesting portions of plot and throw them into the gutters.The book is by all means an interesting read, with all the qualities of being a great book, but before it is recommended so freely to all who enjoy literature, the warning should be set in place that this book is filled with portrayals of immoral and tasteless actions as if they were supposed to cause mirth in the reader. Interesting is all this book can conjure up, not magical and unforgettable reading, nothing which the younger minds should be exposed to, but simply interesting."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I had seen the movie a couple of times, for better or worse, before reading this top-ten most important 20th century American novel.While the book is more complete, I think in some ways the movie does a better job of illustrating the madness of war; &quot;Catch-22,&quot; the novel, does not rely so much on graphic depictions of blood and gore as it does on the unfairness of circumstance and the fear and pointlessness of men killing other men over the colors of their flags. (How many German and Italian soldiers were facists at heart? Most, I reckon, were young and impressionable and filled with fear over what would happen to them if they refused to fight.)Of course, WWII was an unavoidable war, one we fought bravely and righteously -- Heller's novel doesn't openly dispute that. What &quot;Catch-22&quot; does in a groundbreaking way, though, is point a spotlight on some of the absurd, from-the-top-down, morally questionable and out-of-public-view actions of war that lead to innocent men, women and children (on both sides of the border) suffering and of course dying. Some of these actions -- repeatedly upping the required number of missions after the quota's been met, using military connections and materiel in the act of selling or trading black market goods for private profit, war-related corporate benefits, private goals of officers that involve men going in harm's way -- may be more associated with our conflicts in Vietnam and Iraq than WWII.The only valor in this novel exists in the idea of getting out alive; after all, the enemies are not the Germans so much as the commanding officers. Interpreted more deeply, &quot;Catch-22&quot; could be considered a comment on corporate structure and the use of men as pawns in the top-level games played by the players and power brokers of America. (For more on that subject, see &quot;Life Askew,&quot; available at Amazon.com.)The first 100 pages of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is a series of character sketches, some hilarious, some maddening -- there's a very stream-of-consciousness aspect to what little narrative structure exists. (Heller breaks so many storytelling rules and gets away with it!) Madness, folks. It's about madness. The story, what there is of it, really takes shape in the second half -- the more satisfying half of the novel, more structured and less antic.Like The Grapes of Wrath and 1984, Catch-22 is an important cautionary tale. Read it if you would rather live on your feet than die on your knees."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a great book that should be re-read annually. It is a mordant and sarcastic black comedy that shows the folly of war and the foibles of that most bureaucratic institution of all, the U.S. military. In this time of a never-ending &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, this is a book that should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book as an assigned novel in high school, around 27 years ago. I tried and tried to get into it, but couldn't get past the first chapter.Face it, the first chapter ain't the best in the book. The first two people we meet are the Texan and the Soldier in White. The dullest people in the book--the soldier in white, by definition!One day, I had an essay due on Catch-22. I'd cribbed most of the contents from other sources, but needed a few quotes to add credibility and bulk. So I opened the book somewhere in the middle and started to read at random. I think the chapter I picked was the one about Milo. And I was hooked. I found several quotes, submitted the essay, and returned eagerly to the text to read the rest for my own satisfaction.Maybe all of you who find Heller's narrative structure disjointed should do the same. Or simply treat the whole thing like a book of essays and read them at random, saving the one in which Nately dies for last, naturally. (It's labelled \\"Nately\\", BTW)Isn't it funny? After all these years I can still remember all the characters, many of the jokes, and can certainly remember the point. Testament to a great work of art."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I tried to get into this book, but could not. I read about 30% and stopped. I may try to finish later."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this a few years ago as it was on a list of the best novels of the 20th century. Awful! While there are a few parts that are humorous, I thought the book as a whole was horribly tedious. If a student wrote a paper/essay like this he/she would get batted across the head. Verbosity reigns supreme in Heller's work, with tedium a close second. The attempts at humor are feeble. I suppose in the interest of being well-read it might behoove some to read it...certainly not for enjoyment. A shame really, because the basic premise is interesting and, yes, thought provoking. Perhaps I am in the minority, but I don't understand all the hype."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The emperor has no clothes, and Joseph Heller has no writing abilityI read this novel, all 42 chapters of it, for several reasons.1. Upon searching for the greatest novels of the 20th century Catch-22 was always either number 1 or number two. I guess it IS number two because this novel (If you can even call it that) was S**T! I rename it, Catch Number 22. Once I start a novel, I finish it.3. Because it's a \\"classic\\" I knew the pretentious fake fans would cry foul if I said I hated it yet never read past the 5th chapter, when i realized I was reading toxic waste.If you're truly honest with yourself you CAN NOT say this was a good book. It was not a novel as I already mentioned, but rather a patchwork of asinine conversations, adolescent meaningless humor and plain old pointless babble. Several hundred people gave his drivel 5 stars, while another 30 some-odd honest reviewers, both honest with themselves and with others, gave this one star. I wish I could have given -773 stars.At first I thought the novel, as many others are, was a slow starter. I thought the silly language would break and become...what's the word I'm looking for? GOOD!I have read the reviews of the 1 star voters and found myself nodding my head yes, and strangely, the reviews were better reading than the 430 something pages of garbage.I can agree with the reviewer who said the book was an insult to those who have fought in VERY meaningful wars, as my father did in WWII, the war the book is based on. I agree with the one who said this was a CHORE to read. I'm no Kim Peek when reading, but I'm no slowpoke either. This book took my 2 MONTHS to read. I read ONE chapter a day then would discard it for 2 or 3 days and pick it up again, I hated the sight of it and left it in the toilet where I usually read it, I thought it would be happiest in its natural habitat."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Sorry, people. For some reason this book has been branded a classic simply because...well, I'm not sure why frankly. The satire hits you over the head until you are dizzy (unfortunately not with laughter), the plot is cellophane thin, the message completely muddled. The book flows as smoothly as a trainwreck. There are some witty commentaries but overall don't believe the hype. This book is an outdated bore."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book and all I can say is...it was simply a disappointment. I realize it was satirical...however the characters seemed 2 dimensional and unrealistic, and after a while there behavior and responses were so predictable, I soon lost interest and the book became a slog. I personally feel if Joseph Heller wrote it later on in life he would have had more life experiences to draw upon and could have written a much better novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If I could, I would've given this book no stars at all. I could not bring myself to read beyond page 120 because I found what I read absolutely and unbelievably ridiculous. I couldn't see how so many people gave the book four and five stars. I definitely learned from this experience not to fall for books just because they have a high number of positive reviews as this book does."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Don't read this junk, the chapters do not go in order, and there is no point to the book. You could skip chapters and you would not miss anything"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is one of those books that everyone reads and pretends to like because everyone else has read it and says it's really funny. It has its moments, but it's not a very good book--that is, if you believe an interesting plot, interesting characters, and good writing style are the determining factors of a good book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Being that I like to read, and am often looking for new books to read, I became interested in Catch-22. This is probably because it's considered by many to be one of the greatest books of the 20th century. So I went and grabbed a copy from a local used book store, and took a look at the back and the inside and read many great reviews calling the book \\"entertaining and hilarious\\" and that it portrayed \\"a strong, heartfelt message\\". Naturally, I thought it would be great.Dead f***ing wrong. This book is absolutely awful. Not only is it horrifically boring, but it's downright annoying. The lack of a real storyline alone makes it unreadable in my opinion, but as if that weren't enough, there's more to this piece of crap that just makes it torture to read. It's plagued with horrible, repetitive dialog and ridiculous characters (that I guess is supposed to be humorous) that makes you want to skip to the last chapter to see how this abomination of the English language ends. The book also has a few running jokes that make you want to stick a fork in your eye. A perfect example: the main character, John Yossarian, is always saying that millions of people are trying to kill him. Oh, I get it. Because he's in the Allied forces, the Axis forces are trying to kill him. Kind of amusing, right? Not after he says it twenty times. Also, there's a character named Major Major Major Major. Hilarious.And I'm sorry, but I think the message of the book has not really aged well. War is Hell? What? I had no idea! (Sarcasm). And even if the message of a book hasn't aged well, that doesn't make the book bad. An example of this would be Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, another satire that takes place in WWII. Again, the message is a bit dated, but at least that book is well written and entertaining. Not only that, but the message is supported by a first-hand account of the bombing of Dresden, one of the most horrible events of the war in Europe. In Catch-22, the anti-war message is backed up by five hundred pages of a lazy air-force captain complaining.So overall, this book is garbage.*Warning. Contains spoilers*And just one more thing, I hate the ending. He decides that he won't endorse a statement that the pilots need to fly eighty missions in exchange for a trip home because it puts his fellow pilots in danger. On his missions he drops bombs willy-nilly. Yeah. That doesn't put anyone innocent in danger or anything. Hypocrite."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"With the United States currently in a position of faltering patriotism, Catch 22 was a very difficult book to read. I felt that it transcended time boundaries, and the horror of war that Heller effectively described in World War II could be held applicable to the current situation our country is in. Through humor and circular logic, Heller accurately portrays the concept behind Catch 22 as not just being a military law, but how those with power can justify their actions over the powerless. Each character Heller introduces to the reader is easy to relate to, for each represents a different type of conflict that each individual undergoes in his or her life. Milo Minderbinder's character represents the temptation of big business and profit which still drives and corrupts people to this very day. The chaplain, representing the loss of religious faith when faced with the hard circumstances of life and war, relates to many people in their questioning of a God in the midst of hatred, terrorism, and useless death. Colonel Cathcart, representing corrupt military and governmental bureaucracy, is a portrayal of how many people in life desire to uphold their status and power at the expense of those below them in the social ladder. Lastly there is Yossarian, a character portrayed by Heller to be both crazy and pitiable, is motivated in his actions solely by his longing to survive and his right to life.What impressed me the most about this book was Heller's complicated writing style which was in itself a tool to portray to the reader the ridiculousness of the whole justification and reason behind the concept of Catch 22. Whereas Heller uses the military law prohibiting bombardiers from avoiding flying combat missions as the actual embodiment of the Catch 22 trap, Heller's haphazard writing style and interaction between characters is a Catch 22 in itself. In this way, Heller makes Catch 22 extend beyond the war to apply to life itself, and the traps that we encounter in our journey to save ourselves amidst tough circumstances.Heller succeeds tremendously in giving a moving portrayal of the atrocities of war while maintaining a humorous and satirical tone. The reader will go through ups and downs, from laughing at the ridiculous dialogue between characters to being shocked by the useless death of many of the characters due to the inevitable death occurring in war. Though I was confused most of the time through the circular logic Heller portrays throughout the novel to emphasize the trapping quality of Catch 22, at the end of the book I was horrified and moved by how World War II can destroy people's lives."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Anybody mind if I break up the love-fest for this piece of anti-establishment drivel? Get serious folks. The premise of this book is based on three assumptions, all incorrect, which are as follows: (1) the military is evil, (2) any person in the military is an idiot, and (3) any person who mocks the military is heroic.Please. This type of thinking went out with flower power and tie-dyed t-shirts. Get with the times, people. Vietnam is over."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was assigned this book in high school and did not finish it with about 100 pages left. About 10 years later, I recently picked up the book again to finish a book I have been wanting to finish. I was not disappointed. Joseph Heller is a skilled story teller whose pen is well adept to writing satire. Many of the humorous points of this book I was not ready to appreciate as a high school senior. Years later, I found myself laughing out at many lines in this book.The book tells the story of Yossarian, a disgruntled World War II pilot. Yossarian wants nothing more than to go home from the war after his mission quota is satisfied. Unfortunately, his mission quota is raised each time he gets close to meeting it. Along the way, we meet a cast of unique characters. It makes me curious as to where Heller came up with the idea for all these characters. Lieutenant Scheisskopf and Major Major Major Major are two of my favorite characters in the book. Their stories in addition to the idiosyncrasies are wonderfully written. The book ends with Yossarian faced with a paradox of choices based on the development of the character. It is worth reading the book to find out the ending.This book is a literary classic. I hate to give too many points of the plot away in the review as I would hope the sharp turns in the plot can surpise other readers the way they surprised me. Truly, this is a great book for those with an eye for wit."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a biting satire about the absurdities of war. Set in World War 2, the novel is about a squadron of bomber crews stationed in Pianosa. The book follows the exploits of the group, and of one man in particular: a bomber named Yossarian. Yossarian goes against the grain, and tries valiantly throughout the novel to escape the inevitable Catch-22. All Yossarian wants to do is survive the war, but that seems impossible in the face of Catch-22. This novel is about his struggle against the system, his personal quest for survival in the face of a military that sees him only as part of the war effort.Several things--a colonel who's aspiring to be a general and keeps upping the required number of missions, a mess hall attendant who forms his own syndicate and sells supplies to the enemy to gain a profit, a major who disappears inside his trailer--combine to form the military unit to which Yossarian belongs, where \\"what's good for the syndicate is good for the country\\" and where men are endangered and their lives sacrificed for the ambitions of higher-ranking men aspiring to fortune and notoriety.This book would be depressing--horribly depressing--were it not so downright funny. The situations, the way the characters react and interact with each other, are absurd and hilarious. In fact, the attitudes of most of these men (commanders in particular) are downright ridiculous, and the book is not realistic in terms of the characters personalities (how many generals REALLY believe they can order someone to be shot whenever they want?). Still, the absurd nature of the book is what gives it such power. By giving his characters such outrageous ambitions and by creating such ridiculous situations for them, Heller makes his message painfully clear.This book is a modernist approach to war. The narrative is fragmented and roughly pieced together, and the satire is very prominent and in-your-face. In the end, Yossarian is faced with a choice: submit to the \`Catch,' or die trying to escape it. The irony of it all--submit to the Catch and be a hero (though morally dead) or try to escape it and be physically dead--is what makes Yossarian such a powerful character. This book is one of the greatest works of the 20th century for a reason--the impression it leaves is very lasting."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, it has to be the funniest book I have ever read. The title itself, is a law in the army that has many parts. One of the parts is to get discharged from the army; you have to be crazy. To say you are crazy, you have to ask the doctor to keep you on the ground, but as soon as you say your crazy and want to be grounded, Catch-22 says you are sane to say your crazy so therefore you have to continue flying missions. The book is about a fleet of bombers that are bombing cities in Germany. They are constantly made to bomb, even when they are suppose to be sent home. The whole book is filled with crazy people, like Dunbar, he does things he hates doing, because it would make time go by slowly. Dunbar thought that it would make his lifelonger. Orr, has to be one of the weirdest guys out there, like when he talks about putting crabapples in his cheeks when he was little or the prostitute that hit him with a shoe because Orr paid her to do so. The book is mostly composed of learning about characters and then their stories add on to a plot line indirectly. Throughout the book, it reveals more and more of the maincplot, escaping war. I recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor and enjoy books about war. I will read this book again, just because it was an all around good book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The book Catch 22 by Joeshph Heller is a book about a piolt in WWII. The main charecter is named Yossaian. This piolt is very paranoid about alot of things. Also through out the book he trys to get out of flying missions by doing various things. A couple of things he does is fake being sick. Also he fakes being mentally insane.This book is different from any other book i've read. There is a unique yet talented style of writting i've never encountered before. In the midst of all the chaos of war the author still seems to throw in alot of humor. It is also a different sense of humor based on simple concepts. When I first started reading it, I was thinking too hard to understand the humor, I thought there was a deeper meaning to alot of it. After confusing myself a bit I learend that I just have to take it for what it is and judge it at face value. At the end the humor is more one big joke than many little ones. My advice to the reader is to just read and accept, then later it will make sense. An example of this humor would be on page 33, &quot;I did it to protect my good reputation in case anyone ever caught me walking around with crab apples in my cheeks. With rubber balls in my hands I could deny there were crab apples in my cheeks. Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands not my cheeks.&quot; That is a perfect example of humor you shouldn't try to figure out. There is nothing to figure out. That part is just telling you about the personality of the charecter Orr.Overall it was a very good book. The only possible drawback is that the begining is slow moving. You might get frustrated with the book, but just keep reading, it gets better. The possitive of this book far out weighs the negative."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Sorry, people.

There are some witty commentaries but overall don't believe the hype. This book is an outdated bore."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Yossarian doesn't want to fight and get killed. For this reason, the army psychiatrists rule that he is sane. If Yossarian were to want to fight and get killed, the Army would still not send him home because he is just the kind of man they need....Get the picture? Catch-22 is a moving novel about the individual soul's continual despair at the neverending combat with the absurd and unreasonable in life, particularly war. The humor hurts and enrages. Yossarian's situation seems irremediable and, down to the last pages, one wonders if it is sane to even go on.If this book does not awaken you to the insanity of those around you, then you are probably part of the problem...."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"With the advent of Joseph Heller's first published manuscript to the nation's bookstore shelves in 1961, critical reviews were far from rave. Indeed, at first glance there seemes to be little reason why it should have been a success. The plot, what little there is, orbits freely of its own accord, and the chronology is so fragmented that it takes a ridiculous effort to piece snippets of time and space together. But it is the total absurdity and odd seriousness of Heller's bitter black humor that gave paranoid characters like Yoassarian and Major Major a cult following of average civilians and servicemen, if not the educated bigwigs.To these perfunctory--and perhaps more cultured--readers, Catch-22 reads like one off-color joke after another. Logical fallacies abound. Why the pilot Orr puts crabapples in his cheeks, the reader will never know...except that they are better than horse-chestnuts. Why? Non sequitor. Milo buys eggs for seven cents on Malta and sells them to the mess hall...and still manages to make a profit using nothing but circular logic. It is this type of bizarre humor that propels the entire book. Heller's over-the-top slapstick and conflicting logic will seem like a literary papercut to some readers. Yawns, or even grimaces, may eventually paralyze most (normal) readers' hysterics about halfway through the mission to Bologna, but the pages keep turning.There is a method to the rampant madness. Beneath its warped surface, Catch-22 addresses the depressing, scary, so-serious-its-sick subject of total war. Heller reaches a point where he is no longer funny because everything he writes suddenly springs true. For average non-entities like me, it rings a little too authentic."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Take war, mix in the Marx Brothers, and place them in Alice's Wonderland, and you have Catch-22...only the book isn't nearly as interesting as I just made it sound. It is simply one of the most tedious, poorly-written books I've ever read. It makes its point well within the first 100 pages, then spends the next 300 plus pages beating you over the head making the same point. War is hell, the military bureaucracy is tedious and illogical, war profiteering (capitalism?)is evil, there is no God, there are bigots in the world (and half of them are in Yossarian's chain of command), blah blah blah. The characters are shallow, cold, and completely unlikeable - perhaps none more so than our poor, put-upon Capt. Yossarian, although I don't think that was the author's intent. I appreciate the literary device of absurdity as much as anyone, but its overuse in this novel struck me as...well, absurd."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Mark Twain said that a classic is a book that everybody praises but nobody reads. I'd like to add that a classic is often praised now because it was praised in the past. Some classics are timeless and can make their point in any period, but others are useful for a certain amount of time then lose their effectiveness. \\"Catch-22\\" clearly falls into the second category. When this book was written back in the 50's it was necessary to give the world a reaction to the mythology of World War II. The soldiers in the war were still being worshipped as perfect humans with a perfect love for their country and unlimited bravery and courage to save the world. Surely some of the soldiers were not so perfect and that's what Joseph Heller shows us in this book. In the character of Yossarian, we have a WWII soldier who was not the epitome of courage, but a slacker and malcontent who did everything he could to get out of his duty. But Heller takes this way too far as the book becomes an extremely repetitive parade of soldiers who do nothing but try to weasel their way out of service or stab each other in the back; and officers who are inept bureaucrats who are under-qualified for their positions of authority and are focused on their own self-interest rather than winning the war. With this never-ending parade of idiots, Heller not only makes the statement that some of the fighting men in WWII were not up to the stereotypical ideal. He keeps on repeating the implication that they were ALL unworthy. He makes this point early on but fails to expand on it other than beating it to death repeatedly. While \\"Catch-22\\" is still useful as a good example of non-conformist and subversive literature, it has aged badly. Some \\"classics\\" are relevant in any time period, but the era in which this book's points were truly necessary is long gone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is interesting but it is not one of the best books I have read.

I believe Catch-22 is a well written war novel that blends different moods,which express each characters point of view on life as troops.This Novel discusse the ups and downfalls of World War II.One character who I found most intersting in the book was: Yossarian. Yossarian is character who captures personal fears and opinions of his troubles in life. He reminds me of high school and all the pressure you go through,inorder to get your goal done. However in high shool, you have to deal with passing examens,inorder to get a good grade. Instead of passing examens, Yossarian has to passed missions, inorder to become a well trained war flier. Yossarian is trying to indenify his way through life, under pressure and protecting himself and troops,who Yossarian is in charge of.Catch-22 is novel that can truly show you how most military families are and the obstacles we go through,inorder to have a love one safer from any type of war that's over seas. Most people don't understand what it takes for a person to fight for a country that may not be right all the time. It takes encouragement and self-control to fight in a war that may never end for both real troops and the troops express in thew novel.Overall this novel is truly an amazing story that could teach you lessons upon lfe and what not to do that may leave you scar for life.

There are many references to prostitutes, one night stands, and \\"love\\" that is actually lust. So, if you're a bit skiddish of vulgar language and references you'll be sorely disapointed in this book.The whole book is full of catch-22s. For instance, a character named Hungry Joe likes to take pictures of naked women that never develop correctly but when he was a citizen, he had been a professional photographer.This book jumps around a lot. It gives tidbits of information that at the time might not seem important but tie into the main story later. Because of this, the book gets more interesting towards the end but seems drawn out and boring at the beginning.All in all, I've read better books but I've also read a whole lot worse."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is total satire and irony concerning WWII, combined with a dose of sobering morality along the way. This book will make you will laugh, and just maybe, cry. Perhaps old WWII vets may not enjoy reading this book, but I certainly did. Only down side was the open-ended ending, leaving the reader with no clue what happens to Yossarian. However, it showed what a strong, unyielding character Yossarian was.

Catch-22 is a \\"no-win\\" situation or a \\"double bind.\\" B-52 bombardier John Yossarian is fighting to stay alive during World War II. His humorous and sometimes frighting realizations of war and life set this book apart. The characters in the story are both fascinating and absurd. Heller's story jumps back and forth in time.

Yossarian gets a medal for NOT bombing an Italian town. The supply officer makes a fortune trading across the Mediterranean, and of course there's always Catch-22. If you are crazy enough to want to remain fighting then you can be relieved and sent home, but you have to ask to go home. But if you ask, then you must not be crazy anymore.

And funny as anything. I don't remember HOW many times I laughed out loud during the course of the novel...it was hilarious...the way Heller walks himself into contradictions and paradoxes is highly amusing. There are a great many characters, hard to keep track of, but most have a quirk which helps identify them. And the amazing thing is, he keeps everything straight. Little funny things he mentions seemingly offhand continue to pop up later on in the novel. Yes, get out those horse chestnuts and crab apples. The book is very funny.Then, towards the end, the book develops a heart. Bad things happen, and you feel bad. War is bad, and bad things happen. Yet, Heller still manages to inject humor into these events, including one of the funniest sequences, that of the chaplain and the generals...the people in charge are the craziest of them all. You will laugh out loud. You will sometimes feel bad for laughing (hence, black comedy). But you will be happy you read this book.It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Yossarian, the hero of CATCH-22, never wanted to be anyone's hero, but it's easy to see how he became such a popular figure in American literature and culture in the 1960s and 1970s. He may be the best literary example of the tortures a sane person goes through in a world of crazy and dishonest men. A WWII bombardier who's tired of people trying to kill him, Yossarian can't get over seeing a kid in his plane die in his arms, in fact he can't get over death at all, or the people who seem perfectly relaxed about flying into its jaws on a regular basis. No one has the right to say he hasn't done his duty, but they say it anyway, and every time he flies the required number of missions to be sent home, Yossarian's insecure, self-aggrandizing colonel raises the number of missions. As a result, most of Yossarian's friends end up killed in action and somehow Yossarian ends up not insane despite the best efforts of all his superior officers and doctors to convince him otherwise.You almost have to take an amphetamine to SLOW the effect of Heller's rapid-fire prose. Yossarian is the only roundly developed character in the book; everyone else is a just developed enough so as not to seem a caricature, but most are distorted extremes (e.g. Milo Minderbender who runs such a highly profitable international black market that he gets praised for bombing his own troops, or the never available \\"Major Major Major Major.\\") Heller uses these distortions for their humorous, satirical effect, and they work, but never do they obscure the true horror of the experience of the men fighting the war.How I wish I had read CATCH-22 in high school. So many of the daring, anti-establishment, questioning of \\"excessive authority or obsolete traditions\\" would have stirred me up and made me laugh so much more than they do now, at thirty. And the sexy parts would have really got me going more as a teenager. CATCH-22 remains and important anti-war text, and an important lesson for all to beware of those who push empty-headed patriotism and religio-pietistic mind control. Heller pleads us to think as he shows us the evil that men do when justice is a commodity. Intelligent teenagers of all ages should read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"&quot;You mean there's a catch?&quot; Yossarian asked. &quot;Sure there's a catch,&quot; Doc Daneeka replied. &quot;Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy.&quot;I thought that Catch 22 was an excellent and hilarious book. But, I don't think it is for everybody. Some people might not get the type of humor Joseph Heller uses throughout the book. And to others, the lack of a plot might make reading the entire book very demanding. But for me the constant humor and exceptionally well created characters made the book well worth the read. Catch 22 is a satire that reflects on the absurdity of war. It is about a bomber squadron in Italy during the end of WWII. The book's main character, Yossarian, is frantic and furious because people he hasn't even met keep trying to kill him. The best part of the book would defiantly have to be the characters. Joseph Heller did an excellent job creating so many unique and interesting people. That was definitely what kept me reading. There were so many great characters I'm sure everyone could find someone in the book to relate to. So if you don't mind a book that can be a bit slow at times and is absolutely hilarious Catch 22 is a great choice."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Without this book there would have been no \\"MASH\\" the television series, no \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or the general refusal to view war as some great historic accomplishment of mankind. Heller's masterpiece transports us to the absurdity of war, a human construct that devours the individual in the face of bureaucratic systems designed to enable the destruction of the individual through depersonalization. The inherent chaotic state of war is captured through the plot structure embedded by the author, a technique that many readers will find difficult or impossible to deal with but unlike the characters the reader can choose to escape from.An important subplot of the novel often not dwelt upon is the nature of capitalism, international trade, and spot markets. Milo's Syndicate provides the basis for analyzing the sociopathic behaviors that can arise from the pursuit of the profit motive without reflection on the condition of Man, a subject first considered by Adam Smith in \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and his \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments\\".Acclaimed as a great American novel, the book deserves this recognition on many levels. First, it is an American novel through and through both in its perspective and its style of the individual over the group, the quest for independence and freedom, and the disrespect for rank and privilege. It is also a beautifully written book both in its prose and its psychological connections. It is also a story of common men thrown into alien conditions that they were not raised or trained for but who find an inner strength to carry on and who find humor in the face of damnation.You will want to run away from this book but it is important that you persevere to the end just like the characters who survive..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I served in the US Army, and what struck me about Catch 22 was that although this was an obvious satire, it was still so true. Even the craziest parts of the book were no more crazy than the day to day life of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.My dad has since passed, but we spent hours discussing this book, and he actually served in the Army Air Corps during the war. But it doesn't matter. Anyone who served in the military, and I think anyone who has worked in a large company can understand and appreciate Heller's work.This book is part of our national psyche now, and it has to be in the top 10 American books of all time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"We've all experienced the catch-22 of being at the dentist's office, with the dentist all up in your mouth, while you're asked that question that you're expected to answer. How can you talk while the dentist has his hands in your mouth? Classic catch-22!I started reading \\"Catch-22' by Joseph Heller, and was incredibly surprised (and delighted at the coincidence) of a catch-22 that I experienced just yesterday.I have been a teacher for 5 years and my husband's job has us moving in the near future, so my job is going to change. We'll be in transit somewhat and I figured a good option for me would be to substitute teach. Denver, Colorado requires a background check with paper fingerprints (like getting the prints done on paper with ink), not digital like my county in Florida currently requires. The Colorado Department of Education says to just show up or call ahead to a law enforcement office to get the prints done and the law enforcement office will take care of everything. Unforunately, the Colorado Department of Education doesn't provide the paper fingerprinting form and neither do the law enforcement agencies! How am I supposed to get fingerprinted, which is a requirement, but no one will let me have a card for the prints? After many more phone calls, I found a way to order the cards, but still, that's a great catch-22, and such a welcome coincidence since I was currently reading the book!\\"Catch-22' by Joseph Heller was definitely a unique story. I've never read a book quite like it! Yossarian is a bombardier in the military in Italy who does anything he can to get out of flying his missions and to be sent home. Unfortunately, every time he completes the required amount of missions, or gets close to it, the mission requirement is upped. Also preventing him (and the other men) from leaving is the fateful Catch-22, which says that \\"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.\\" So you're crazy for flying the missions and should be sent home, but just asking to be relieved means you're sane enough to keep flying!\\"Catch-22' is filled with catch 22's and quirky scenarios. One scenario has a doctor who is terrified of flying and has bombardiers lie to say he is with them in the plane (since he is required to fly a certain amount of hours). On one of these instances, the plane crashes and those aboard die. Since the doctor did not bail out (even though he is standing there with other soldiers watching the plane crash), the doctor must be dead. His wife is informed, he stops being paid and fed, etc.\\"Catch-22' is a witty, quirky story where it seems that every situation has its idiocracy and a catch 22. I would recommend it mainly because it's so different from anything I've read and it was humorous. I wouldn't laugh out loud, but you have to give the book some credit for making me SMILE when someone dies, based on the irony of the death."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There are probably thousands of reviews regarding this book, and I will not endeavor to review such a literary giant. So I will simply give my honest opinion regarding the story.I have laughed, cried and been furious simultaneously on a few occasions while reading this book, and I do believe it is one of those books that everybody should read at least once. If you are an avid reader you will not be disappointed here. If you are more of a casual story seeker, you will probably find some sections of this book difficult and cumbersome, but I would still recommend giving it a go as the exquisite humor mixed in with some truly head scratching moments make up for it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"NOTE: The first version I read was published in the 1960's and my current copy is from 1976.About the book:This is a satire about war, about bureaucracy, about the disinterested, uniformed, unintelligent men (and women) who end up in charge, and about the people caught in the horror of all of it. The story loosely follows airman Yossarian as he navigates the terrors of war and the horror of those who control his life. There is a large cast of memorable characters who often unwittingly, but at times on purpose, influence the life of Yossarian as he tries to save himself from being killed in the war.The book is not told in a linear time fashion, so a reader can get lost as the stories move forward and back over various events. The chapters tend to be character sketches, which take us through events only to have them repeated in another sketch through different eyes.My take:I didn't immediately fall into the book. It took me time to realize how time flow was presented. Remember, I was only 15 or 16 when I read the book. I had not come across a nonlinear book before. Once I understood the presentation, I was hooked.I had enough experience in life to understand what Heller was trying to get across, though I hadn't any experience with satire. Those days were the middle days of the Viet Nam war, giving me additional insight to the book.Much of the humor is subtle while most of it is over the top, in your face. For instance part of a sentence in the book reads \\"Chief White Halfoat was transferred out of Colorado at the first rumor of oil...\\" which is buried in an explanation of how Halfoat came to be with the squadron. While another part of the book contains conversations that sound like the Abbot and Costello routine of \`Who's on First'.Memorable scenes for me included Orr tinkering with the stove \`faucet', Milo and his chocolate covered cotton, the dead man that wasn't dead, and the most haunting was when Yossarian treated Snowden for the wrong wound. In fact, Snowden remained with me for decades in much the same way he stayed with Yossarian throughout the book.I highly recommend this book for anyone who understands satire and has had experience dealing with bureaucracy. I will say this is not a simple or easy read but the gems are fascinating. For many of us, this book is laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I, like many others, have used the term \\"catch-22\\" knowing it's core meaning but never knowing it's origin. The book was nothing like I had expected and the wacky way the author's characters were drawn was a little hard for me to accept. However, the more I read the more I understood that these players were caricatures of the real-life insanities that many of us have experienced.By the time I finished the book I felt a sense of loss that it had ended!Wes Hill"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"No long review, just an opinion about a memorable tour de farce. Once I began reading I couldn't put it down. I'm not a fast reader but I finished this book in about ten hours. I was completely engrossed. It's an adventure that explores the foibles and nonsensical rationales of men in harm's way that are assigned to do the business of war and are looking for a way out or a reasoning for their participation in convoluted circumstances. It is eccentric hyperbole. Now, I lent the book to a friend of high intellect and steadfast scholastic pursuit who thought it ok but nothing to tell his children about. When we discussed the book, it became obvious to me that one of the differences in our enthusiasms was his lack of military experience. While I had seemingly experienced all the characters in stressful venues, he had not. Still, my affection for the book, well, I wear it my sleeve."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 was a very confusing book to read at times. I thought it was really fun to read about the insanity of war and what a person thinks of war. In my opinion war is crazy I would not want to be in a war for anything in the whole world. I could not imagine myself flying in an aircraft over a battle zone bombing things, and risking my life for my country many times. That is what the main character of the book did he was Yossarian. Yossarian was my favorite character in the book, because he understood how crazy the war was and he really didn't want to be in it. Many times he tried to get away from where he was stationed but the commanding officers would not let him leave. Yossarian made a lot of decisions throughout the book whether or not to leave the army or to stay, and he was always looking out for the most important person in his life and that was him. That related most to me, because I think of myself as the most important person in my life, and I would do whatever it took to make me happy. Not to say I wouldn't help other people, but I would look out for myself first and for most. I thought the book was very funny. The author Joseph Heller used very funny language throughout the book. His diction is what made the book so great. He made the readers see how insane war really is, which I think is really good for young people to figure out, before they get involved with the army or navy. Think how crazy you have to be to fly a jet over a place that is being bombed and try to dodge missles being fired at you. To me that would be insane and to Joseph Heller that would be insane also. I couldn't imagine myself ever wanting to go to war. People might say well your dying for your country and you have to do this to protect us, well there are other ways of solving disagreements with other countries. Every character in the book was very realistic. I thought that the soldiers were all very scared to die, and they wanted out. I wouldn't' blame them. Overall this book was really good, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that has the insanity of war in it, without the violence and the graphic descriptions. Some parts were confusing to me but for the most part I understood the whole book. I would read a Joseph Heller book again."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A Book so full of invention, you are left breathless.

A great book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 by Joseph Heller (461 pages)Book: Description and Review: In short \\"Catch-22\\" is a humorous look at the lives of the soldiers in World War II. It is more than that, however. This novel depicts a life of impartiality, pain and boredom. The war is out side, and inside, but the men have their own ways of putting the horrific details and coping with the loss aside to live. Through the eyes of many different people the war and those involved are explored from many different points of view. This technique that Heller uses gives the reader a look at look at their lives and the way they are lived from every possible perspective. In a personal opinion the narration resembles a Faulkner story. Through the incessant ranting and frivelous ravings a mind and a story emerge. The \\"average Joe\\" is given his 15 minutes to shine with every turn of the page. This novel is recommended to those who not only enjoy war stories, but a good laugh as well. Heller's source of inspiration (W.W.II) is an admirable source. He found a quirky humor from the tragic war of the 1940s."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is great.

Three quarters of the way through, you'll be in stitches. Every character in the squadron, from top to bottom of the pecking order, is subject to ridicule. Those familiar with the nonsense and pettiness that revolve around office politics would be the first to relate to Heller's unique brand of humour.Readers looking for an intricate plot will undoubtedly be disappointed, because there isn't one. Instead, the book is made up of cleverly interwoven vignettes all of which (somehow) have a bearing on Yossarian's relentless efforts to save his own skin.Very funny. Very perceptive. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you are going to read this book in a subconscious state of mind, don't even bother. The book is well written and extremely humorous, but the reader has to think while reading it. The plot is not obvious; the characters are not fully described.

I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It takes genius to write a novel like this. I admit it is not for everyone. Only serious readers should attempt it. Crazily written, it will make your head whirl. Readers who didn't like it probably thought it was too crazy, confusing, cartoonish and unrealistic. Then again, life is too sometimes. By the end of the story, Yossarian discovers &quot;how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts...&quot; A great novel that will stand the test of time, or at least as long as we fight wars in the name of patriotism."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Despite being very repetitive, this book entices anyone who reads it with the thought provoking plot, and different view points from different characters. I just read it, and keep refering to many of the characters ideas and sayings. One example is Major Major Major Major (the greatest name of all). Whenever he's in, he's out- and whenever he's out, he's in. There's also Yossarian who somehow is the only sane man in a world of lunatics. Fitting directly with the time period it was written in, this novel doesn't only incorporate a number of Catch-22's, but it is a huge Catch-22 that keeps revolving around the same basic principle, but ends up with different hilarious results. I recommend this book to everyone- because allthough most people either love this book or hate the structure of it, it will make you laugh until you fall on the floor- then make think about what you just laughed about."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It's like watching a cartoon. Humorous, yet if you read between the lines you will discover a profound meaning. Recommended for people who like clownish plots."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is almost unquestionably one of the funniest books ever written, but there is a depth to it that forces it to resist categorization as simply a humor piece. It satirizes war in a way that's more condemnatory than most \\"serious\\" novels could ever dream of. The absurdity of it all makes it almost nightmarish; nothing is what it seems, which I guess is a pretty accurate general description of war.I've read Catch-22 from start to finish a couple of times, but my favorite aspect of it is that it really doesn't even have to be read in order. There's no telling how many times I've seen something that reminded me of Appleby or Major Major Major, and I'll just pick up my copy and read their particular chapters, always amazed at how well they function as self-contained stories. In short, this is one of my all-time favorite novels, and I feel that its scope is broad enough to appeal to just about everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a witty, funny and often mind boggling look into the insanity surrounding WWII. This particular edition was in fair shape retaining excellent readability."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I first started to read Catch 22 I had some trouble comprehending what it was saying. In the beginning there is a lot of very random detail and the story tends to jump around a lot. But after a while the story gets quite interesting and starts of with a lot of sarcasm and humor and towards the end moves to a more sad but much more realistic outcome. The story focuses on Yossarian and how he tries to get past Catch 22 to be able to go home and out of the military. But one of the things that the book does very well is that it thoroughly examines many other characters of dramatically different character types to contrast the different kinds of soldiers in WW2. The book tells of Yossarian's struggle and how ironically he ends up fighting the American military system instead of fighting the Germans, he doesn't care about the Germans as long as he stays alive. Over all this book is a very good interesting book that shows how Catch 22 actually applies to many situations in everyday life. Even though the information is a little hard to comprehend at first it is a very good book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The best book about (the logic of) war ever written. Hilarious, sad, and - several decades after WWII - still will make you wanna drag a rowboat to Sweden. Genius."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The book's title and premise, Catch-22, is a term defined a number of ways by many men in the course of Joseph Heller's seminal book from 1955. Each time, Catch-22 is referred to as an irrational policy for legalized craziness - a way to make sure that no combat pilot can be grounded for being crazy - especially when they are crazy.A fellow airman, suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress, is described as \\"babbling incoherently when they fished him out of the dank bottom of the slit trench, babbling of snakes, rats and spiders. The others flashed their searchlights down just to make sure. There was nothing inside but a few inches of stagnant rain water.\\" Following the hallucinations and panic attack, the airman, absurdly named Hungry Joe, is almost immediately re-assigned air combat duty by his superiors.Heller's own experiences as a B-52 bombadier relate with a painfull, crisp clarity the effects of war on the male psyche.Heller presents War as institutionalized insanity - a world at war being enough to drive anyone who lives in it completely crazy. Bombadier Yossarian, although high-strung and violent, is the lone sane man in a world gone completely crazy with war. The only place Yossarian feels safe at is a military hospital in western Italy. At this hospital, Yossarian is surrounded by war-jangled men who've come down with sudden cases of sanity in the face of a fiery death. They each argue the meaning of Catch-22 while trying to find a way to survive the war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is a classic. Catch-22 is on all of those Top 100 books of the century lists. Just start reading the damn thing already! Jesus!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. The language is literate, but the style is modern - it's chaotic, which reflects the circumstances of war and the emotional trauma inflicted on Yossarian, the main character. From the first page where Yossarian is in the infirmary avoiding duty with a vague liver complaint, the absurdity of his circumstances is apparent. Yossarian is a bombardier in a B-25 fighter stationed on an island off Italy in World War II. His brown-nosing commander, demonstrating the dedication of his squadron, keeps increasing the number of bombing missions required before (noun), despite the availability of fresh crewmembers. With the high fatality rate for these missions, it's not a surprise that by the end of the book, everyone Yossarian has served with has been killed except the administrators and commanders, who find they serve their country best in a non-combat role. Yossarian's view of war is confirmed paranoia - he believes people are trying to kill him, and they are.Now that I've read Catch-22, I see that it was hugely influential. MASH could not have existed without it, though MASH is upbeat compared with Catch -22. Published in 1955, before On the Road, it is avant-garde in some of the same ways, but has a different value system. Because of the non-linear timeline and the barrage of characters, Catch-22 was a slow, but not boring, read for me. I can't remember another book that I liked so much that took so long to read.Catch-22 is a landmark book that everyone should read at some time in his or her life. The sex and violence is understated (perhaps that's how it ended up in the Young Adult section?). The language is rich and complex, and the ideas are fresh 50+ years later."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I rarely write a review, but the performance of Jay O.

Some of Heller's chapters/paragraphs are intentionally repetitive although funny. Difficult to follow at times. But with the help of Sanders who manages to give the various characters distinct voices/intonations, it is so much more enjoyable. Amazing what a good actor can do.If you have trouble with the book - get the audio CD narrated by Sanders!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 delivers the tragic story of a wide variety of American soldiers during World War II in a way that is both heartbreaking and hilarious.Similar to the way that Catch-22 doubles back on itself, the book's dialogue is loaded with endless double entendres and a unique style of speaking I will call \\"catch talk.\\" Many of the men, such as Yossarian, Orr, and Natalie all have conversation riddled with sexual innuendo. Catch talk most commonly occurs when Yossarian is present. When his commanding officers become furious with him and they attempt to punish him, Yossarian suggests that in order to avoid making the company look like it has insubordinate members the officers should simply promote him. The officers quickly write the idea off as ludicrous and continue trying to find a punishment for him. Soon, however, they realize on their own that punishing Yossarian would look bad for the company. Then one of the officers comes up with the brilliant plan to simply promote him and make the entire company forget about the issue. Thus, catch talk occurs. One party begins the argument arguing one way, and the talk then deviates to something different, but then reverts back to the original statement. This style of speaking catches the readers' attention and creates something unique that the reader can identify about the book.Yossarian was one of the most original characters I have ever heard of. Playing the protagonist for a good portion of the book, he at times is also the antagonist, as he inhibits the goals of some of the other main characters. Similar to the looped idea of Catch-22, Yossarian can be quickly classified as one of the most insane people in the book (he curses himself for forgetting to bring his machine gun to the officer's club in order to massacre everyone). But on closer inspection, Yossarian is in fact one of the most sane people in the book. While all other officers act perfectly sane on the ground, they are considered insane because they ignore their instinct to survive in the air. Yossarian, on the other hand, acts insane while groundside but then is perfectly sane in the air. Everyone acts calm while flying, while Yossarian is panicky and wants nothing more than to get the hell out of the fight.With its unique conversations and the one-of-a-kind Yossarian, Catch-22 was a hilarious and tragic adventure that gives a unique perspective on the war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is quite simply a fantastic book and a must read for anyone who appreciates modern classic fiction. Funny, insightful and tragic. The book begins in quite a funny manner as you begin to meet the characters, although one by one, tragedy befalls them and you can only smile at the sour irony of their situations. I personally likened it to the MASH TV series in many respects finding parallels between Yossarian, the main character of Catch 22 and Hawkeye from MASH. This is of course my own personal feeling and Im sure that people would be happy to point out many differences between the two characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The writing is a joy to read.

But what foolishness was all this? The book is a masterpiece of modern English. How could I have been so mis-informed? So nave?Where to begin? Well, in the first place, the book has no real plot. Rather, it is a series of events regarding \\"Yo-Yo\\" Yossarian and his attempts to be sent home to the US from Italy in the Second World War. In the process, we are introduced to a host of bizarre characters. Some are his peers, some are more senior officers. But despite all his efforts, he seems destined to remain on the Italian island of Pianosa from where he is sent on missions to bomb various targets in France and Italy. Every time he gets within striking distance of the requisite number of missions that would grant him a ticket home, his nemesis, Colonel Cathcart raises the bar. Yossarian's hopes are always being dashed.In essence, \\"Catch-22\\" is a book about the futility of war. In spite of its chaos, one side will win. Along the way, maddeningly insane decisions will be made. Welcome to the world of Yossarian. He is simply struggling against the system. The reader is also introduced to a mad cap cast. Each character is crazy in his or her own way. Joseph Heller clearly had a wonderful and often hilarious imagination.When, I first began \\"Cath-22\\", I was thinking of awarding it four stars. However, after about fifty pages, it was clear that it warranted five. The pity is that more cannot be awarded. It would certainly deserve them."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I am not finished yet, but I am enjoying the book very much!

It's a comedic attack on the rules that such organizations make and self-centered people who make them. It's also a surprisingly poignant and powerful anti-war novel, one that questions the foundations of patriotism and obedience that lead soldiers to fight. It does this set, not in Korea or another unpopular war, but in the heart of World War II.

But if I like it for being unlikeable am I actually liking it?Catch-22.The actor who read this audio edition did a fantastic job so it was easy to keep track of all the characters- and there are a ton of them- because he gave them perfect voices. really likeThe circular logic and story telling fit perfect with the catch-22 theme- a phrase coined by the author, btw. really likeThe portrayal of the abysmal lack of care for the individuals who were actually putting their lives at risk for- well, nothing really- made you just as frustrated as Yossarian. Flawlessly written. really likeEverything was a bureaucratic catch-22 for the lead character Yossarian and it was hilarious in its ridiculous logic. really likeEspecially because, more than anything, he wanted to stop seeing death all around him and that's all he ever saw. really like- but not because I liked what character was going thru. (Insert Top Catch-22 here.)The ending- had you cheering for the poor sap because finally, finally he was gonna find his freedom from the nightmare he was living, however odious it would be to a modern US military man. not sure what I think about that one- But in the end- gonna go with really liked.Finally, unless you have been in the military as an enlisted man, or worked in a cubicle, you wont get this book.

I love the way the first 400 or so pages spiral you into the story; character by character, anecdote by anecdote, you slowly learn more, and you get closer to the \\"truth,\\" which is then revealed in the next 50 or so pages.

I was too young to read it in the 60s when it came out but I recently heard Joseph Heller's daughter being interviewed on Public Radio discussing the 50th anniversary of the publication and decided that I should certainly read this classic novel. I am so happy that I did! At first I was captured by the humor of the situation and Heller's hilarious and satirical description of life in the military in Italy during WWII but the further I read, the more horrified I became. The book is absolutely brilliant in that just beneath the humor is the absolute horror of war and military leaders who were completely incompetent and primarily concerned with their own private or hidden agendas. The book reminded me of M*A*S*H in many ways. I strongly recommend that anyone who has not done so already buy and read this book.

Heller was a navigator on a bomber in World War II and draws inspiration from his experiences I am a self-proclaimed history buff, and I especially love war in American society. But sometimes reading the same heroic war stories or glorifications of a great battle can become redundant. Heller's satire is the proverbial breath of fresh air in comparison to the endless volumes of war related material.The story follows Yossarian, an aviator/bombadeer in World War II. It becomes clear very quickly that Yossarian is about a nickel short of a dollar. He imagines that everyone he knows or comes in contact with, save a few of his good friends, wants him dead. The problem is with the system of flying bombing missions in the military. When he began flying, an aviator was sent home after his 25th mission. But as he continues to fly, his commander Colonel Cathcart increases the minimum number of missions an aviator must fly. To escape his dangerous assignments, Yossarian fakes a liver disease and is sent to the base hospital. It is here that he is first introduced to \\"Catch-22.\\"Yossarian and Doc Daneeka, the medical officer, are good friends. So Yossarian asks Doc to lie on his medical exam and report that he is not mentally fit to fly. Doc explains to Yossarian that because Yossarian asks him to do this, he is in essence proving his sanity. He goes on to explain that anyone that would fly a plane into enemy territory is surely not mentally stable enough to fly a plane into enemy territory. (Read that sentence again if you don't get it the first time.) But anyone who asks to be examined proves that he is sane enough to perform the same task. Catch-22 is basically a lose-lose situation.The part of the novel I found most interesting is only discussed a few times. The character of the soldier in white appears in the hospital at the beginning of the novel. None of the men in the hospital know his name, and no one knows why he is there or where he is from. The soldier in white symbolizes the anonymity of the men that fight for America. Men gave their lives every day during that war, yet they are not famous. Society does not seem to care about who is fighting, but only that they are fighting for their country.Catch-22 is a must-read for anyone finding interest in war. It does well to hold the reader's attention. The mixture of off-the-wall humor and obvious irony make it an enjoyable read. It may or may not be historically accurate, but Heller probably did not intend for it to be. Pick it up; if you don't like the first two pages, then don't bother reading it, but if you do, you'll enjoy the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is exactly the sort of absurdist and strange humor I love. The Milo Minderbinder character was one of the best I've ever read about. Heller manages to mix all this outrageousness with the melancholy of loss and death that people experience in war. This book is a classic for a reason. Go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 starts off as a frivolous comedy with a bunch of insane, eccentric characters, and only later on you realize that there is a method to this madness, and the pieces start falling in place.Yossarian - the main protagonist who is a bombardier in WW II - refuses to fly any more missions after having flown seventy, a number which Colonel Cathcart (who lives in his own world of imaginary triumphs and catastrophic imaginary defeats) keeps on raising. He is then presented with a very tempting offer which he decides to decline after having seen from close quarters that \\"there are people cashing in on every decent impulse and every human tragedy.\\"Though the entire novel is very well written and fun to read, the climax is absolutely unbelievable. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's elaborate satire of war reveals its absurdity and tragicness through contradiction and quagmire that is unequal in any other piece of literature. Heller creates an extrodinary cast that are at the same time sinful and pious, and this is what makes them so human. From the first sentence the reader is drawn into a universe filled with irreverance that makes complete sense, and through it Heller unveils a grand story chapter by chapter that begins with humour, falls into stoicness, and ends in gaiety. A must read for anyone thats looking for a new world to explore."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"'Catch-22' is an excellent novel, a true masterpiece of the 20th century. Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy.Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all.Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way.For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel.One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar.It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption.Timeless & flawless - you must read this book"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a great great book.Note, none of his other books come close to this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A mark of real brilliance is an author who manages to add words to our common language, like Heller with \\"catch-22\\" or Orwell with \\"doublespeak\\".Simply put, this book is absolutely brilliant. It reflects the crazy, upside down world where insane is sane, incompetence rules, and one (or, as it turns out, two) person stands alone and upholds his sanity.A few highlights:the chapter on milo's syndicate is an economic masterpiece. Not only is it hysterical but it is a perfect example of a modern market economy based on absolutely nothing.chaplain trappman's interrogation at the hands of the CID is another example of english writing at its best. Remember, the CID man has had latin training so he knows the chaplain is \\"not a baptist.\\"I find myself quoting this book constantly.

Powerful book, nothing but pleasure."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Amanda Daddona, Mercy High School, Middletown, CTJoseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is an amazing piece of literature. Through his realistic characters and witty and humorous use of dialogue, Heller allows the reader to infer their own opinion about war and governemnt, and the effet that war has on individuals. Through the use of humor and understatement, he paints a picture of what war does to men; their ambitions, thir fear, and the inevitahle death of whoever happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, which he describes as \\"a matter of circumstance.\\" This novel portrays a host of characters, all believeable and true to life. Yossarian has a rational an understandable fear of death, and he questions an institution whose word is absolute law. Yossarian sees that good men die for antoher man's cause, and in turn question his own positon in the war and what he is doing there, fighting in a war he deson't believe in.The concept of Catch-22 showed the absolute power that the military had over the men, and also demonstrated how when soemthing is accepted and not questioned, it can have power over people. Catch-22 did not exist, but because people believed it did, it had power and influence over them.In the novel, humor is used in such a way that what is written seems light and fivolous, but really holds a deeper and more horrifying meaning. There were several instances of this: the interrogatioin of Clevinger and the chaplain, Cathcart's obsession with missions and getting into the Saturday Evening Post, the very definition of Catch-22, Doc Daneeka's \\"death\\", and Milo's extreme capitalism.The effects of war are plainly seen as well: Yossarion's progression from acceptance of his missions to falt denial to go up in a plane ever agian, his questioning of the war itself, the deaths of the men, Nately's girlfriend's insanity after she hears the devestating news, the ambitioin of the men of higher rank in the military, the chaplain's doubts and fears, and Milo's increasing empire, M&M; Enterprises.Despite all of the horrors, Heller presents us with a light of hope in the character Orr, Yossarian's comapanion who is more than he seems. He manages to escape and this gives Yossarian the extra push to make his own decisioin about escaping the trap that Catch-22 has him in.Each character, as I said earlier, is realistic and believble, which makes the novel more meaningful and appealing to me. There is a rainbow of personalitioes, from the quiet chaplain to outspoken Yossarian, the hypchondriac Doc Daneeka, the excessive capitalist Milo, the ambitious Cathcart, the fearful and awe-insiring Major____de Coverly, young and naive Nately, the prostitues, as well as many others. All of these characters are real people facing real issues that are connected to and rooted in war. There is a struggle for survival that these people must face, and they all face it in their own way. Some are succesful, and some aren't.Heller presents, then, a novel of paradoxes, a novel about war and survival, hoplessness and hope, ambition and humility. He describes the horor of war without actually stating it. And though this book deals with serious issues, it is also very entertaining to read. I laughed aloud numerous times and enjoyed reading every page. And so, this gifted author leaves us with a novel I consider to be one of the greatest I have ever read. I highly recommend this novel to anyone and eveyrone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It is hard to define exactly what \\"Catch-22\\" is. At its most basic, it is a book about a squadron of American WWII bomber pilots who fly over Axis territory out of their base in Italy late in the war. More specifically, it is about one captain who has become all crossed up with the absurdity of the war.In the end, it struck me as being a book about being able to see the world from fresh perspectives, even when you think you already are. The ending of the book leaves you feeling strangely excited about the unseen possibilities in life.A must-read for anyone who enjoys fiction that delves into the philosophical."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It seems silly to be reviewing classics on their literary merit. Obviously, if a book's a classic, its merits have been trumpeted by much more qualified readers than myself. But I can always comment, perhaps especially when it comes to classics, on whether or not a book is enjoyable. Catch-22 is a very enjoyable classic. Some of the cleverest writing I've read. And clever in a good way, not just to be clever. Sarcastic before it was cool, outlandish, funny enough to make the serious stuff sting and serious enough (gut-wrenching at times) to make the funny stuff refreshing. Wonderful characters. And a portrayal of the idiosyncrasies of the Army that anyone who's ever been part of a large organization can relate to."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There's one thing about this book first published in 1955 which, at the time of this writing, was darn close to a half-century ago: it is revered as one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. In fact, there's some pretty compelling arguments why it could be considered the best novel of the 20th century. This from the critics.It's also an enormous international bestseller. That is to say, it's not some kind of weird, experimental thing with some enormous political axe to grind that normally wins Pulitzers and garners accolades from the effete in their ivory towers. This is a book that all kinds of people from all walks of life have read and enjoyed.Business Leader take note: when a book touches both the masses and the critics then something has been written that touches a chord in all humanity. This is something that you can learn from and use in your business setting. These books reveal the secrets about how everybody feels. It helps you violate the law against fooling all of the people all of the time, so to speak.We believe that Catch-22 has something even more special to offer. It reveals the truth about bureaucracy.It's a lot of fun today--and really has been since the time of the trustbusters in the age of Theodore Roosevelt--to hate big giant corporations. You can't sit in a coffee shop without hearing someone rant about Big Business and the evils it perpetrated upon the environment and people of struggling nations. You can't turn to fiction without constantly seeing Big Business presented as an all-consuming evil that manipulates nations and lives to its whims. The press has long delighted in portraying Big Business as preying upon the decent, the common, and the innocent.And in some cases they may be right.But there is a different truth. It is the truth that Big Business can't possibly organize itself and come to the kind of consensus necessary to prosecute the vast majority of the injustices for which they're blamed. The simple truth of the matter is that bureaucracy--that maelstrom of decayed policies, outdated procedures, the futile and whimsical direction of middle-managers who have given up home, the ambitious subterfuge of self-serving middle-managers who are--or perceive that they are--on their way up, all crashing together like the planetessimiles in a proto-solar system bound together by the gravity of a thousand conflicting agenda, beliefs, and ideals... that bureaucracy prevents.Big Business blunders. It blunders its way through the world achieving much more by accident than it ever does by intent. It is why Big Businesses, which has always founded its strength upon originality, daring, and speed retreat to defense in lawyers and regulations when they age and suddenly find themselves stagnant, timid, and slow. The inevitable gravitational pull of bureaucracy on any Big Business pulls all to an entropic heat death.Catch-22 is a case study in exactly that kind of bureaucracy. It is the bureaucracy of the military--but really the same infectious bureaucracy found everywhere--as it attempts to win a war. An endless display of very real people are introduced to this blender of military bureaucracy and it is reduced to the terrible comedic.People love to read this book because it is so funny. But it's funny because the bureaucracy is so familiar. The people's behavior remind us of how the world really works outside of the board rooms, court rooms, and throne rooms.Every business leader should read this book if only to become so intimately familiar with the face of bureaucracy, which will always be the final and most terrible enemy that any business can face.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Captain Yossarian has a problem. He wants to live, but thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him! Every mission he flies as bombadier for the Army Air Forces could get him killed, and he wants to get out of the war. Unfortunately, the only way he can get out is if he's crazy, and wanting to get out is proof that he's sane.This is a biting, cynical indictment of beauracracy and the narrow-minded paper-pushers who make it so disfunctional. From the squadron commander, Major Major, who was promoted based solely on his name, to Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions needed before the crews can go home and volunteering his crews for the most dangerous missions, to General Peckem, who wants to add the bomb groups to his special services command, this book is full of over-the-top characters that are just barely within the realm of believability. This book is funny and infuriating, at the same time, and reflects the worst traits of any beauracracy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is definately the funniest book published. And there aren't even any jokes-- just pure scathing irony and paradox, sarcasm and wit (the greatest forms of comedy). The style of telling is to be celebrated. The transitions are great (my favorite part); from one year to the next in one terse comedy of a sentence. It is all so compact in its delivery and connected through the text. Its told out of order, so certain anecdotes make much more sense and are much funnier later on. Yossarian, Yo-Yo, is the best straight man in literature. His cast of pals are uproarious in rediculous seriousnous over something that, in this new wonderful light, can only be laughed at (Appleby: &quot;Do I have flies in my eyes?&quot;). It is both sad and comic, by the sheer weirdness of it, as well as pathetic and selfservingly hilarious. The small repitions of mundanity are going to catch up to you; the intermittently gradual reintroduction of small details will seem peculiarly silly. And the serious parts --Snowden's &quot;I'm cold,&quot;-- are beautiful, gritty, real, shocking fiction. Heller was a wonderful writer, truly tops to spin both certain laughter and the touching pall of warfare into his greatest book. Must Read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Critique Christopher GrantYossarian of the story, \\"Catch-22,\\" is finally free from the hell that is war. He runs away from his hellish experiences during World War II. In the minds of narrow minded readers Yossarian is a coward, escapist, and selfish for his desertion. These readers do not take into consideration how selfless his desertion really was.Yossarian is presented with a catch by Colonel Cathcart when he offers Yossarian a chance to go home in return for a favor, a favor that will take many innocent lives. Yossarian is set. He can finally leave the god forsaken war that has taken the lives of so many of his friends. Colonel Cathcart tells him he will include a promotion and, \\"have parades in his honor.\\" Colonel Cathcart says Yossarian would have to be a fool to turn down the agreement. But Yossarian doesn't go through with it and decides to run away instead, saving the lives of many innocent people. Yossarian now presents himself with a bad situation. He puts himself in danger of getting a court martial, sent to prison, and as Major Danby put it to, \\"live in danger of betrayal forever.\\" Yossarian's brave and selfless actions are continuously shown to us when he considers the lives of those who will be affected if he is sent home by Cathcart.Yossarian would be a true escapist if he allowed Cathcart to send him home a hero. If Yossarian chose to go home, the other men in the squadron would unknowingly have to complete more missions than they really need to. But if he stayed, and didn't fly any more missions, the other men in the squadron would have refused to fly missions as well breaking up the unit and putting the country at risk. In this, Yossarian is now sacrificing his safety for the lives of the men in the squadron and the good of the country. Yossarian's selfless actions have still yet to cease.Yossarian continues to think of the well being of others. He says to Major Danby, \\"there's a young kid in Rome whose life I'd like to save if I can find her.\\" Nately's whore and her younger sister have been kicked out of their apartment in Rome. Yossarian's selfless actions continue when he decides to save (putting himself in danger) the little girl from the dangers of the Eternal City. Yossarian's actions here prove to be anything but selfish.How could such a brave man like Yossarian be branded a coward, escapist, and selfish? His reasoning for desertion was based on how it would affect the lives of everyone else in the war. Yossarian would have been a coward to get sent home with a promotion and parade, an escapist if he ignored the lives of the men who fly the missions, and selfish to consider his life over the one of a helpless little girl. Before a narrow minded reader brands the selfless actions of a hero like Yossarian to be cowardly, an escapist, or selfish, they should look at the facts."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is savagely funny and deadly serious all in one breath. There's the Texan that kills the soldier in white through unrelenting conviviality, the cat that sleeps on Hungry Joe's face and maybe eventually killing him, the soldier who see everything twice, Major Major Major Major, the atheist chaplain's assistants who run God's service so much better than the believing Chaplain ever could, and then there is the war and the desperate unfunny catch-22 to stay alive in a business that's bound to kill you.I read this book in High School and have finished it off since then about 4 times. It solidified my love for literature. It taught me that to keep our sometimes feeble hold on sanity we have to find the ludicrous and humor in the dead seriousness of reality. It is pacifist's plea to find some sanity to end the state of things where we legally go out to kill each other, trading blows with the enemy underneath the bombardier's sites and the enemies among us. I wonder if Joseph Heller could find Peace quite as tragically funny.\\"The only thing going on was a war, and no one seemed to notice...Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't funny at all. And if that wasn't funny, there were lots of things that weren't even funnier.\\" It's the humor amid the tragedy that in war people die and when people die, there is little laughter and to hold on to your sanity you must laugh. That's a catch isn't it? I'll close this in the words of Jimmy Buffet and thank you Joseph Heller for teaching us well, \\"If we didn't laugh we'd all go insane.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Many people complain that this book has no plot, at least not in any intelligible order, except that Yossarian wishes to keep from being killed at any moment by anyone and anything around him. He's neurotic, and at the same time the saniest one living, because he'd rather die than be killed. This book is absurd, I think, not for reasons of humor, but because of the subject matter it portrays. In fact, it may be more reasonable to show war as absurd than to show war as rational. I found this to be one of the most endearingly fiendish books I've ever read, and more life-like than I originally viewed it as. It is not about a plot, for life has no central plan (but rather a disorganized bunch of disparate events), but about the characters and people that fill it. This book is about the idiosyncracy, absurdity, contradiction, and illogic of personalities, or lack thereof.In this paradoxical way, Catch-22 seems to me to be bizarrely one of the more honest depictions of life as we know it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Many years ago, I was given a paperback copy of this book by a WWII Army Air Corps veteran.

Comedy is found all throughout the book ranging from Yossarian's unorthodox ways of getting himself out combat duty to Nately's struggles to make a prostitute love him. Also the story is told in a unique circular way which constantly parallels the overall theme of explaining the purpose of what \\"Catch-22\\" means.If there is a fault in the book it is the slow development of the story. The chapters only give the reader a small taste of what the overall story is about and the storyline doesn't start forming until about halfway through the book. While this might deter some readers it can also create an incentive for the others to continue on and finish the story. Heller in a way makes his novel a puzzle that doesn't become completed until the very last chapter. The chapters in his novel could probably be read in any order (with the exception of the last chapter) and still make as much sense as if it was read the way it is printed.Catch-22 is a truly unique novel that will appeal to any reader as well as those interested in World War II literature. While the slow and confusing development of the story is its only glaring let down is also has an appeal that almost forces the reader to continue on with the novel so that all the confusion and loose ends can be cleared away by the time the last chapter is finished. The comical scenes as well as the ingenious elaboration behind the meaning of \\"Catch-22\\" and how it applies throughout the novel will entertain readers for years and years. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 will remain on book shelves for years to come and is a literary work of art that shall never be overlooked."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a very funny book because anyone who served during war can identify with the insanity that Yossarian endured. I read it in high school, but I identify with it much more now that I've gone through two wars. A must read!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a truly great novel, and a wickedly funny, bite, pull or satirical take on the impact war has on the human condition. It is a strike at the idiocy of bureaucracy gone mad;it is a telling commentary on the frailty of man trying to live by the standards of decency and humanity he was brought up with, under the madness of war.Catch 22 is also an outstanding piece of entertainment. The first hundred pages or so have been described by minds greater than mine as '... Hysterical farce...' and more than once I had to put the book aside in order to wipe the tears (of laughter) from the corners of my eyes. Chapter three - subtitled &#34;HAVERMEYER&#34; is the first highlight of the book and I was in stitches several times as I read, and tried to read, and make sense of the glorious text found within. The writing style is unique. The book itself is easy to read. It has a straightforward plot (was there a plot?) which kept the pages turning but it did not take long for Heller to remind you are reading a book about war, and that war is dangerous, and people whom we love, people whom we are destined to love but never will, are bound to die fighting for the causes that we all hold dear. And some chapters you can hold up high for the joy and merriment they bring, the next chapter is just as likely to bring you back down to earth with a jolt, as one of Yo-Yo's friends go missing, and are presumed dead, or meets a particularly gruesome death in a way that no one could have predicted. But as each one dies, there is no way that it can be said that they died without every single shred of their character still intact.Catch 22 is hysterically funny, and at times, incredibly sad. It is a tribute to the strength and power of the human spirit, and as such is worthy of the five stars that I hereby give it. It is a classic novel, a book for the ages. Catch 22 is timeless. I think I need to read it again. Now.Greggles (LR)"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I thought it would be fun to reread this book after many years. I was not disappointed.

I really didn't get the full impact of it then. This book is genius. The sarcasm is the perfect dry type of humor to mix well with WW2."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Years after the book's release, Joseph Heller's classic tale of war and insanity remain a shining light in the annals of satire. The thrust of this story is the characters, always quirky and often lovable, which even today, are unique, tragic, and funny as hell. Read it!Jeff Davis, Author of Snaggler's Paradise"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For decades all I knew about Catch-22 was that it was about war, and for that reason, never wanted to read it. Last week I finally picked it up, and what I thought would be the standard war story was anything but.Centering around Yossarian, the bombardier afraid of dying, the novel circles through events, showing them from different characters' perspectives at different times. Joseph Heller masterfully takes the reader in and out of the minds of the large cast of characters, back and forth in time seamlessly.The book is raw, horrifying, infuriating, sarcastic, and surprisingly funny, depicting the insanity of war (or really of any enterprise) conducted by a mindless bureaucracy. Not a light read, not the kind of book I would ordinarily read but one I highly recommend because of the brilliance and depth of the writing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Creating comedy during the murderous insanity of World War 2 is nothing short of pure genius. Joseph Heller, author of the fictional masterpiece Catch-22 showed the world a different view of the perils encountered during war, twisting them into a witty page turner. The story's main character, United States Air Force Captain John Yossarian, is a B-25 bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea in the year 1943. Understandably, Yossarian continuously tries to scheme his way out of flying bombing missions, since thousands of people he has not met are trying to kill him. Despite his best efforts, Colonel Cathcart continues to increase the amount of missions the men must fly to satisfy their service requirements and return home. As the title suggests, there is a catch:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause in Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. \\"That's some catch, that Catch-22\\" he observed. (p.46)The above quote is one basic yet confusing catch can be put into simpler terms: a person is considered insane if he willingly flies combat missions, but if he requests to be removed from flying, he is deemed sane and therefore fit to fly. This basic element continually puts Yossarian in danger by the very system he is supposed to be protecting. He is more concerned with his own survival instead of winning the war, calling into question his integrity and patriotism.Heller follows no traditional structure in his novel, rather relies on free association to tie the book together. While the storyline seems at times to follow no discernible path, it perfectly echoes war is itself. Both are vain, chaotic and irrational. But it is that very structure (or lack thereof) that sets the book apart from anything else ever written. Having this book follow any sort of chronological order normally found in other novels would do Catch-22 (1961) a disservice and detract from its overall greatness. Heller implants key flashbacks and side stories at critical points during Yossarian's journey to save his own hide. The complicated storyline structure requires the reader's careful attention to accurately understand all descriptions and anecdotes. Heller introduces complex characters and themes early on, but waits until further in the text requiring the reader to rely on both recollection and foreshadowing.The book also uses third person omniscient narration to further develop and complicate the storyline. The reader learns more from each character than they would if the book was only through Yossarian's eyes. These different points of view allow the reader to fully grasp inside jokes and see characters in a complete three dimensional light. Few characters, due to the in depth detail in which they are described, are considered minor character.Catch-22 (1961) is a classic masterpiece that has withstood the test of time by being in a category all on its own. Pulling out all the stops, it grasps the reader and leaves you yearning for more. The book's influence on American culture culminated on the phrase \\"catch 22\\" becoming popular in the English language for a situation with idiotic circular logic further testifying to Heller's brilliance."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Nobody needs me to say that \\"Catch 22\\" is one of the great novels of the 20th century. It's incredibly powerful today, and it's hard to imagine the impact it must have had when it was published more than 50 years ago.The book strips away any pretense about the glory, intelligence, or fairness of war. It shows the cynical, base motives of the most human of actions: violence. It highlights the absurdities --- the utter contradictions --- that each of us face every day in our lives.The thing that struck me most about \\"Catch 22\\" on what's probably my fourth reading is that it's so densely packed. There are entire paragraphs that you need to read again and again because they have a remarkable perspective about the human condition. But then you struggle to remember them 10 pages later because of the new ideas that Heller has raised. One technique that Heller has mastered to create this density (for all I know, he invented it) is absurdist statements: \\"The Texas turned out to be good natured, generous and likeable. In three days, no one could stand him.\\" There are hundreds of these passages in the book.Heller also uses rare adjectives and adverbs throughout the text, often paired with a more familiar word. Again this adds to the density of the reading, even as you turn to an online dictionary for a definition.The book is also memorably grueseome and sexual, sometimes together. The bomber pilots lead a warped life, and so even their leisure is warped. They're whoring and cheating as much as possible, usually out in the open because they simply don't live in a just society any more. As an old, starving Italian woman explains to Yossarian near the end of the book, when he asks her why Military Police destroyed her whorehouse: \\"Catch 22 says they have a right to do anything that we can't stop them from doing.\\"Just when you think you're going to like someone or that the book is going to be fun, Heller slams you with a wounded or dead pilot or a child prostitute. It never stops.Basically, you become like Yossarian, the protagonist, in that you want to just scream at the top of your lungs that everyone and everything is crazy, and that we need a new crop of adults to come in and change the situation. Yet, because it's war and human nature, it will never happen."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"That's about it. Louis-Ferdinand Celine wrote Voyage Au Bout De La Nuit in 1952. Mr Heller Americanised the setting and the dialogue but the entire book, the ideas, the storyline is virtually identical to V.A.B.D.L.N."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Of all the books I've read, I've never read one that made me as confused as Catch-22. I believe it's a great book that shows you just how crazy war can be. My favorite character was Yossarian because I related closest to him. It's hard for me to imagine what it would be like to have to fly an armed aircraft over a battle zone and risk my life numerous times. Yossarian and I are on the same page. I've been taught that I am the most important person in the world to myself just as you should be the most important person to yourself. Every decision that I make will always effect my life therefore I am the most important person to me. Yossarian is much like me because he values his life a lot. He doesn't understand why he should have to go to war and risk his life for his country, because he could die while in battle and not get to enjoy what he is fighting for.I think Joseph Heller did a wonderful job in letting the readers get a feel for the insanity that war brings to people. Many of the soldiers started out as sane human beings, but the effect the war had on those men was horrific. Think of how crazy you would have to be to fly a jet, that you know will get attacked, over a battle zone for 50 or 60 times. Several men realized how much danger they were in, and they would try to get out of battle by making excuses or faking illnesses. I think that if I was in their situation, I would've done the same thing.My least favorite character was Colonel Cathcart, because he kept increasing the number of flights that the men had to take. All the men got their hopes up when they were near the required amount of missions, but Colonel Cathcart would make the amount needed a little higher each time so that the men would have to stay and fight. Imagine how frustrating and disappointing that would be. Every time you got close to your goal, it was always set a little higher. After a while the soldiers started to give up hope, because they realized they would never reach the amount required.Overall this was an interesting read. I was often confused due to the craziness of the characters, but I believe that that craziness is what made the book so good. It brought a weird humor to the story and lightened up the atmosphere."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Book description: Set in late World War II, Joseph Heller's Catch-22 starts out with Yossarian meeting the Chaplain in the hospital. Yossarian was a pilot and was the main character in the book. Catch-22 tells the story of World War II through Yossarian's point of view, from hospital visits to bombing missions to showing up to his medal ceremony naked.The book also ranges in topic from a Major who everyone was too afraid of to ask his first name to a mess officer who runs a bogus company. Many topics are amusing, but the majority is not. They are very human.Review: Catch-22 is the most honest book I have ever read. It feels like I am sitting on Yossarian's shoulder for the whole book. I feel all his emotions and thoughts, and they seem so realistic. The characters are completely believable and I can imagine a real person behaving as they do. I feel like a part of the scenes in the book.The writing style is very good, too. Heller doesn't use flowery language or over describe situations. His language choice is absolutely perfect for the situations he is describing.Many novels from World War II seem unbelievable and overly heroic, but Catch-22 is not either of the two. It comes across as very human and realistic, and that is the main reason that I think it is so good."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is one of those books that bothered me while I was reading it. Sure it was funny but I also felt insulted as I read. Nonetheless, I always picked it up the next day and read on.Let me start by saying that I preferred M*A*S*H much more because it didn't take itself too seriously. It was raunchier and 100 times funnier. Catch-22 simply tries way too hard. The paradoxical, catch-22 situations are too many and grow tiresome. The whole book is that way! It could have been about 200 pages shorter!The insulting part is how military professionals are all portrayed as complete and utter idiots. Sure, all the characters are very quirky and idiosyncratic, but the military pros are absolutely unlikable and seem to possess no redeeming qualities like the others. As one who has read a great deal of WWII history this was bothersome. I understand the literary technique but it's just too much.READ M*A*S*H INSTEAD. SAVE THIS FOR LATER. YOSSARIAN LIVES."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, the ironic rule that keeps Yossarian and his fellow men in his squadron in the war. They are all crazy in their only special little ways, each fighting their own battle for freedom. Yossarian knows their all crazy; he knows he must get out, not for a loved one or for just the hatred of war itself. Yossarian fears for his life, he fears it every time he climbs aboard his bomber. Some man fly for patriotism and others fly because it needs to be done; the younger men believe war is a great and fun thing. When they do fly many do not come back, as Yossarian can testify. Before his eyes he has seen many of his comrades die, which only depletes what is left of his sanity. The squadron's lack of sanity is at most times the source of great humorous occasions. From Milo's crazy antics of buying and selling of merchandise to Major Major's rules, the laughs far outnumber the moments of tears. Heller uses such great detail to bring the reader to the limits of sadness, and the characters means to dealing with it are the craziest of all. The book is a great read, it offers so many great lessons to be learned and to be taught to further generations. As I began to read it I was unaware of how the book had touched the minds of some many people before me."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It literally took me YEARS to finish this book. I'd get halfway and be so bored/frustrated I'd put it down and read something else. Fortunately I did manage to finish it, and I realized it really was worth the effort. I'd recommend it to anyone with a solid sense of humor, a taste for the absurd, and a truckload of patience."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is the funniest anti-war book ever"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I went into this book with mixed feelings. On the one hand, this book is widely considered a masterpiece, and friends who know my reading tastes were shocked that I hadn't read and fallen in love with this book. On the other hand, the (newer) copy of the book I read starts out with a pretty lame preface by the author: he writes about what great reviews the book got, and how well-received the book was. It's hard not to come away from such a self-congratulatory preface without a bad taste in your mouth.So did the book live up to the hype? No, not really. Heller is exceedingly clever at times, and he displays a masterful command of the language. The characters are all top-notch - well illustrated and interesting to read about.However, the flaws were also very apparent. Catch-22 weighs in at 452 pages; while the characters remain interesting, the zany predicaments they land themselves in become repetitious. For example, a chapter after Yossarian learns about 'Catch-22', he has a conversation with a prostitute, who tells him that she won't marry him because he's insane, and he's insane because he wants to marry her. I felt like I was reading a recycled joke - nowhere near the laugh-out-loud hilarity I was expecting.The story is not told in a linear fashion - characters will talk about an event in chapter 2 that isn't described until chapter 10 - and this gives the story a meandering, episodic sitcom sort of feeling. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. So far as themes go, the book does a decent job of mixing absurd inanity with serious war-time events, but I personally feel that Vonnegut mixes tragedy and comedy far more skillfully than Heller.Also, I thought Catch-22 would be the story of Yossarian trying to act crazy in order to bypass Catch-22, but this isn't the case. Catch-22 is really a collection of loosely-related zany incidents that Yossarian's squadron go through - the story of \\"Catch-22\\" is really just one in a series of clever conversations.Despite all my reservations, Catch-22 is still a better book than most books you'll read, and most definitely worth reading if you haven't already. I just felt that all of the unqualified praise that this book is getting needed some counterpoint."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Just finished reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22.I did not like it. Here are my reasons. I have avoided citation of specific instances in support of a point so as not to give anything away.Heller works the novel like an Archilochus/Isaiah Berlin hedgehog - around the idea of people entrapped, enervated and then destroyed by intended and unintended contradictions of, in this case, the war machinery. Perhaps the indictment is of any powerful bureaucracy - even life itself. The irrational and dehumanizing aspects of war unfold in farcical iterations. Each iteration further fleshes out and reinforces the chimerical webs that entrap the flies - the harder they struggle against it.The author is most formidable in his use of the language. What skill it must take to overuse the language so incredibly, yet, so lightly. His pen shows no strain - none at all - as it moves left to right, up and down - over and over again - fluting out in steady drips a full mountain of descriptors. It would be achievement enough if the overlapping descriptors somehow came together harmlessly. But here the imagery is all the more better for it. As if, using the elements/techniques of oil painting, one has churned out a most exquisite set of watercolors! Gestures, expressions, movement of any kind rise from the medium of words to that of a resplendent image almost immediately. This, I propose, is Heller's true achievement.No doubt, Heller has several sources and inspirations. Certainly one of them is Dostoevsky, class Hedgehog. But Heller's one big idea is hardly novel. Literature has many memorably executed suffocating, paradoxical, tragicomic bureaucracies. Repetition of an idea is in itself not a critical drawback because new ideas are not so easy to come by. An existing idea newly represented such as to expand its scope and understanding can be just as worthy an achievement. But there too Heller falls short.Heller fails because his deliberate, repeating exaggerations become too repetitious. The iterative unfolding of the novel is thick with dialogs, events, characterizations that repeat far more than they move. After a point these repetitions do not add anything significant to any aspect of the novel. The plot is not any more intricate for it. The characters are not any more intelligent or coherent or paranoid for it. The repetitions cease to reinforce anything. In-fact they blunt any worthwhile movement that comes along. Such as ascension of Milo's enterprise into lunacy. The repetitions strip all the edge of such progressions.Since Heller himself makes several references to Crime and Punishment let us consider it. Too serious and intricate a comparison would be silly but one may still compare certain general aesthetics like plot and character richness. Look at the exquisite contemplative gallop with which Raskalnikov moves to crime and then towards punishment. Look at the coherence of his paranoia. Look at the rich characterizations of Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovitch.But yes, having said that, I think, Yossarian's stroll through war torn Rome is just as beautifully illustrated as any of Raskalnikov's stroll through Petersburg.All in all, I think the novel is worth reading for its language. Otherwise, I would put it after so many of those other outstanding classics."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"> AS I recall the editor of this book changed the title from Catch 18 to Catch 22. I think the editor was right a much Catch-ier title. If you have not read this book take my advice, read the book, read the other reviews with the 5 star ratings and take their advise, I'm really to tired to review this book properly but not so tired as to recognize the wisdom of some of my fellow five star'er'ers.STOP READING! just read the book Joseph Heller I aint!... I havnt been this tired since I was a young man of eleven, my brother Charles Chadwick and I had a good friend nicknamed Big John who set up a waste basket on the ground floor of our families unfinished cottage and he decided to play Dresden. He climbed upstairs where my dad kept all his old playboy magazines, dropped his boxers and dropped a few biscuits in warning (as the allies did in WW2) and then zeroed in on the basket. We all ran for the woods and hid until dusk and then snuck around to the house avoiding Big John because we were afraid of being caught and becoming forced labor in the cleanup in Big Johns reenactment of the Dresden bombing. Even as kids we understood the importance of learning from history...Speaking of history I had a good conversation with Big Johns younger brother Roscoe about the Dresdan story and he remembered hearing about about it but was not present, he mentioned that knowing his brother as he does (as a brother) that it all made perfect sense. He related to me a story about when Big John and Big Joe (Big Joe is Roscoes twin,he was younger than Big John as well, in addition he was not as big as Big John despite the fact that he was big) would play a game with a rubber ball when the folks were out of the house, kind of like basketball except the object was to throw the ball in the toilet, the looser had to fish the ball out. However as Roscoe explained and what ads credence to my Dresdan story is that Big John would always make Big Joe fish the ball out no matter who made the basket...Off the subject abit but I cant help myself, my friend Roscoe is a self-made millionaire, he had the idea a few years ago to convert old washing machines into dog houses and made a fortune, he cashed out and travels the states with his girl friend Lora lee lee and his monkey Tater."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Look, you're a smart person.

It's for people who just say &quot;War is bad&quot; without really thinking about why it's bad.The book is basically Dilbert in World War II. As in the comic strip, all the people in charge are unbelievably stupid, don't care about the people they command, and are extremely selfish. The common soldiers are of course much smarter than the commanding officers and try their hardest to get out of work. Their unwillingness to fight is justified (by the book, anyway) because their commanders are just so evil and stupid. Everyone's behavior is cartoonish and annoying.This edition of the book includes a preface by the author in which he, instead of saying anything useful, writes mostly about how everyone thinks his book is wonderful. Well, it's not."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joesph Heller goes about the business of numerical postulating and rehashing. I see nothing artful or original in a soldier who sees twice but rather it is repetitive for the sake of it and J.D. Salinger quite easily trumps this banal device, and Heller's entire novel, in \\"For Esm&eacute; - with Love and Squalor.\\" So, it is clear: this brief short story encapsulates the entirety of WWII. As a point of comparison, Norman Mailer's, \\"The Naked and the Dead\\" is made a collection of typed pages best left beside the typewriter.The author's story line is transparent, in a bad way, and any attempt at exposing the mystery of the military man's psyche is telegraphed by Heller, the beginning and end become the same. Catch-22 is rather about smoke and mirrors, a second-rate magician's parlor tricks. It is conceptually weakened by the over arcing, anti-finessed characters. Each goes about with a sledge hammer banging out Joesph Heller's ideology, an artificial artifice. It would never be published today by a known house and caught in his own 22, Heller would, need do and left to, the self-publishing ocean of unread authors.Chris Roberts"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I forced myself through one hundred pages of this book and then I stopped.

Catch-22 is about John Yossarian. He's an American soldier during WWII. However, don't mistake this book for your average war literature, because it's not. This book is CrAzY! From the get-go, you'll be confused. Not because you can't read but because the book isn't in chronological order, which gives the impression that Joseph Heller was having a seizure while writing this book and the editors didn't catch it. In my humble, yet clearly superior, opinion, this book is far too long and filled with meaningless content. There are some very important lessons to learn from the book, unfortunately, the book puts you to sleep before it can convey the moral of the story. You need to be some mythical, god-like English teacher to be able to finish this book without throwing it at the wall in frustration. The characters are insane, so insane that, at one point, I was actually wishing the German bombed the crap out of Yossarian and those around him. The book is funny. However, you need to be clinically insane to get most of the jokes, sadly, contrary to popular belief, I am not. Every time I read a piece of comedy from this book, the scene from Napolean Dynamite would flash in my head, where Napolean would slap someone on the cheek and run away. It's funny but after a while it gets old and feels as though you're being slapped on the cheek, which isn't fun at all. The humor fails to salvage this poor book and only hard-core literature analyzers will appreciate it and call it a work of art.

The story of Catch-22 lacks major elements needed in a story to make that story exciting and understandable.The story is about a bombardier named Yossarian who is serving in World War II at a station in Pianosa,Italy.The character of Yossarian is uncaring and selfish, and all he cares about is being able to go home to America when he completes all his missions.Another thing is that all the conversations in the story tried to make all the characters seem funny, but actually I think it made the book more boring.All the other characters in the story also are very much like Yossarian in the same respect.I thought this was an unengaging book with all its unimportant conversations and description of characters with no plot.Also, the unintelligent and nasty characters added to the pain.I could barely even read the book because it bored me to death.This book should not be a classic #1 bestseller, but the worst and most pointless book of all time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is the most over-hyped book I have ever read.

I wanted a good copy for rereading, remeniscing and discussing.Ideal copy Thanks, Amazon"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While Catch-22 might be one of the most known and reviewed modern US novels, not everybody has actually heard of it, even if you are familiar with the \\"catch-22\\" phraseology. It is by no means a standard story told through a conventional channel, but rather a surreal picture conveyed through the novel use (and mix) of different techniques.So, why should you bother reading (and buying) it?Well, let's start with the simple part. The book itself is well printed, with the 50th Anniversary edition boosting some additional material, which, if you are a die-hard Catch-22 fan, you will cherish, but which otherwise doesn't really add that much value to the novel but for making it easier for the (younger and) newer readers understanding the context in which the novel was released and actually gained fame. This is one of the nicer paperback editions I have seen, probably only lacking the glossy paper and the hard cover. There are even a few (rather lost) pictures in between.Now to the real meat, the content.If you are looking for a book about WWII, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book as a bedtime companion in order to fall asleep, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book that is an easy read and does not require you to actually think about what you are reading, go away, this is not.Catch-22 is a book that requires the reader to work and think. It will not do the work for you, nor present you with any preconceived ideas or solutions, but it will punch you right in your face and stab you with a knife in the back and force you to react, to think, to rethink. If there is a merit in this novel (and make no mistakes, I think there are many), this is the biggest. Heller makes an astonishing and refreshing use of well known techniques to take you along the ride and seemingly without too much effort force you to face the brutal, cruel and often crazy world of war, bureaucracy and ill-understood free enterprise.Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it. Which is fine, as long as you know what to expect and be prepared for.My biggest problem with Catch-22 is the context, both in terms of time period as well as geographical/sociopolitical. If you are a US reader, you should have no problem relating to the book (if you are over 30 years old you probably have read it in school anyway). In the post-Korea and Vietnam world of the 60's and 70's, this novel hit on the nerve of a society that was just waiting for this kind of books (another fine example being M*A*S*H). However, the 60's and 70's are now far away, and many readers know this period of time only from the history books or from the stories told by their older relatives, so this novel seems a little out of context today, actually a bit outdated.I rated it 3 stars because of the outdated feeling of it, and because it is so difficult to really grasp that the amount of work seems a bit too much compared to the end-result.So, you have been warned, now it's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk to be \\"catched\\"!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was satisfied with shipping time and price of product, only downfall was that it wasn't in mint condition.

I was disappointed to see the Kindle version priced higher than the paper back book through Amazon. Furthermore, the Kindle version contains several typos that seemed to result from translation errors made from scanning from print to digital. For example: \\"He wouldn't he to anyone;\\" which should have been \\"He wouldn't lie to anyone.\\" The typos were minor, and I probably wouldn't have cared as much if the publisher weren't selling me a digital book that costs them less to produce than the identical paper back which presumably has no typos. Still - read the book - regardless of the version."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is the funniest book I have ever picked up. Joseph Heller has to be one of the greatest wits in literature history. The story of Yossarian the pilot who simply wants to live works on so many different levels. In the end the book transcends simply being comedy, it uses humor to pack a helluva moral punch that absolutely reduces the blindness of war, the slavish devotion to government to total ruin. By the end of the book the illogical nature of war is so clear that it's a wonder the UN hasn't declared war illegal and a crime. The dialogue is incredibly clever and the characters so unique and colorful. On of my favorite parts is the scene where General Dreedle at first wants the chaplain to hang out in the bar (\\"So that he can sympathize with the men and gain their trust. How else are they going to believe in God?\\") but in the next breath says, \\"That's a fine thing, a man of God hanging out with a bunch of drunks and losers.\\" And ends up threatening to have the chaplain taken outside and shot. Most of the humor fallows this same pattern, proving over and over again the illogical, contradictory, and insane nature of the military and of war. Or how about Milo and the syndacite? Milo plays both sides of every conflict and ends of funding an enemy bombing of his own batallion...There are better reviews on here and I could go on and on but this book literally blew me over with its powerful message and savagely satirical humor."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I had originally read Joseph Heller's \\"Catch 22\\" many many years ago while in High School. At the time, I greatly enjoyed the book, and it's telling that over 30 years later, I still remember many of the characters very clearly today. I recently decided to re-read the book, although not without some misgivings, as I was afraid that, like many things in life, it might be better left in memory than revisiting in reality. I needn't have been concerned.Catch 22 is a classic novel, combining many disparate elements ... slapstick, biting sarcasm, tragedy, the darkest of black humor ... into something larger than the sum of its parts. The story follows Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian, a bombadier in a B-25 bomber in Italy. Yossarian and his fellow pilots have been pushed well beyond their limits of endurance by an incompetent and uncaring superior, and Yossarian has lost his nerve to continue fighting, along with maybe a large part of his sanity. He desperately trys to avoid flying any more combat missions, but the military bureaucracy always manages to stay one step ahead of him. Yossarian's story, as well as those of the multitude of colorful and flawed characters around him, make for a good read.They say you should write what you know, and like his character Yossarian, Mr. Heller was a B-25 Bombadier in Italy, where he flew 60 combat missions. The book shines on many levels ... as pure entertainment, as an anti-war novel, as an inditement against mindless bureaucracy ... and stands up well almost 50 years after it was first published. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Yossarian, the protagonist of Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unlikely war hero. Many central characters in war novels focus on more typical soldierly qualities, such as bravery and duty, but Yossarian is a blatant antihero whom the reader comes to regard as a competent and sane voice in an otherwise absurd setting. Yossarian has no illusions about the war and does not trouble himself by concealing from his military superiors his true feelings and concerns. While there were certainly moral factors in World War II--e.g. the fight against fascism--Yossarian's bizarre environment has erased any pretense of nobility. His military service can only serve to get him killed, as he constantly reiterates.To Yossarian, the needs of society can never replace the needs of the individual. Although society may be comprised of individual citizens, each must retain his fundamental freedoms and safety. Within his bomber group, Yossarian has found the blatant indifference of General Dreedle, the incompetent careerism of Colonels Cathcart and Scheisskopf, and the maddening anti-social behavior of Major Major, the squadron commander. Against this backdrop, Yossarian cannot accept that the needs of society trump those of the individual; furthermore, he believes his need--survival--outweighs the Army's need for him to fly missions as a bombardier.Catch-22 is as relevant and compelling today as it ever was. With America embroiled in two wars, each with its own nebulous goal and distorted morality, the role of the individual in society is more in question that ever. Yet, unlike Heller's day, there is no draft and individuals are no longer compelled to serve in uniform; thus, war persists because the military has been relegated to nothing more than a government department that politicians and bureaucrats are unencumbered to use as they see fit. As society moves down this dangerous path, most readers would do well to read and reread Catch-22 and reflect."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book runs through the gamut of emotions in a single chapter. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional rollercoaster. It's a difficult read in the beginning as the chapters are like the corner pieces of the puzzle, they seem random and disconnected. Eventually you're given the pieces that tie the whole puzzle together and it's a beautiful sight to behold. It's a war story, but it's also a commentary on bureaucracy and the social condition. For me, it sums up my views on life in a way I could never express. Heller just gets it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I heard Catch-22 was up for grabs in my English 9 class, I was eager to obtain the book. From Amazon and even from a few of my friends I had heard good things about the book, the biggest being its humor. This book was perfect for a person of my reading level, which is around the 11th to 12th grade mark. I would say, however, that it is quite long for anyone looking for a casual read.The book itself stars the satirical Captain Yossarian. Yossarian is an American bombadier in WWII stationed in the fictional camp on the nonfictional island of Pianosa, Italy. Through the book, many events lead him to other parts of Italy like Bologna and Rome. Yossarian has to fly more and more missions, and after the witnesses the death of Snowden, he is demoralized and simply stops trying. Yossarian's new goal is to just stay alive. The general idea of the book revolves around a universal idea called a Catch-22, in which no conclusion can be made due to the fact that both options cancel each other out. If event a has to happen, event b must happen, but event b cannot happen without event a, etc. In essence, a Catch-22 is an unobtainable paradox. It is this paradox that keeps Yossarian and his wingmates in the war for a walloping 80+ missions.Yossarian's wingmates are all a bunch of strange individuals, each with their own stories to be told. As such, each chapter usually focuses on that character to help the reader better understand why things are the way they are. However, this often causes the narrator to have to go back and this can disorient the reader. Another low point is how it takes a while for the plot to actually advance. I swear I got d&eacute;j&agrave; vu reading this book. However, in the end of the book, things start coming together and it focuses mainly on Yossarian.The book's highly-praised humor is one of its selling points. The dark, satirical, and sometimes just plain funny humor is evident, as each chapter has some sort of funny happening, such as a witty, lightning-fast debate that lacks logic, or the distortion of famous quotes to fit a character's personality. It is this that keeps the reader pushing on through all 453 of its pages.Catch-22 may be a long book, but anyone interested in an entertaining, humorous, and just plain good read, should pick it up today."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While reading Catch 22 I wondered when Heller realized that he'd struck literary gold. Was it during the writing process or later after the book received critical acclaim? Although Heller wrote numerous other books, I defy any average Joe to name any except for the \\"sequel\\" to Catch 22 (called Closing Time) and the often considered \\"sacrilegious\\" posthumous Portrait of An Artist As An Old Man. Nonetheless Heller ended up writing one of the most endearing, hilarious and poignant American novels ever.Catch 22 follows the exploits of a WWII American bomber pilot named Yossarian. We follow Yossarian through numerous missions and extra-curricular events in around his air force base and various locations throughout Europe. Yossarian is a wise cracking paranoid fellow who often finds himself in the most absurd of situations that end up being revealing slices of life. It's political satire at its best and one of the book's many strengths is the ability to change the reader's reality so that the absurd seems commonplace.Catch 22 has many things going for it. \\"Laugh out loud hilarity\\" is a phrase I've often heard others (and myself) use to describe Catch 22. One of the funniest books ever, it gets better with each read...Yossarian and his cronies are loveable characters that you will come to care about root for to survive. Besides being hilarious the book has many touching and horrifying moments as it deals with monstrosities and casualties of war. To top it off, Catch 22 is more relevant as a military satire due to current world events.Amongst my group of peers (mid to late 20 somethings), Catch 22 seems to be the most common \\"all time favorite book\\" and I would have to say it's top 3 for me as well. It has a message, it's delivered in an entertaining way, the writing is more than serviceable, the characters are memorable and it has introduced a phrase into the American colloquium. These are just many of the reasons why the book was a \\"classic\\" shortly into after it was published.Everyone should read this book although its length and prose could be a challenge for the uninitiated or inexperienced. Although some of the material is adult in nature, the book is appropriate for mature high school students.Bottom Line: A cornerstone of American culture, this novel is not to be missed. A genre defining novel that will make you feel like you accomplished something important upon its completion..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller is such a talented writer! This story is funny, shocking, sad, horrifying, confusing, and yet painfully simple. You just have to read it to understand.What I appreciate most about Catch 22 is that, while it is entertaining, it is so much more than that. This novel is a social commentary that explores the atrocities of war, interpersonal relationships, and the depths of the human condition.Catch 22 is definitely one of my top 10 favorite books."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When my father told me to read this book, I was 13 years old. I moaned and groaned but just said \\"to hell with it\\" and began to read. From Chapter one, \\"The Texan\\" to Chapter forty-two, \\"Yossarian\\", this book held my interest for the whole ride. Heller has produced not only a hilarious but an intelligent and well-thought scenario to place Yossarian into an inescapable paradox of authority and his own discombobulated resolve. This novel also carries an excellent anti-war and anti-authority message, and will motivate a reader to stand up for what they believe in, not to conform to someone else's beliefs. A must-read for anyone in their right mind."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is by far the funniest book I've ever read. The humor is truly original and creative. The dialogue is priceless and some of the situations Yossarian and some of the other main characters get in hit home in a chilling way.Catch-22 has by far the best structure of any book I've ever read. The book isn't in chronological order, but instead structured by theme. The product is a realistic but specially sequencial order of events.Catch-22 is by far the best book I've ever read. From the beginning to the end, I was blown away. I've reread it several times the same year. The only drawback about Catch-22 is that it's not completely accessible. Many people I've talked to hated the book.But for someone whose pretty picky concerning books, I absolutely adored it!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'm getting a little nervous, because I'm re-reading &quot;Catch-22&quot; and am a bit less enamored by it than I was the first time around. I'm going to go ahead and base this review on my first reading with the qualification that the book may not hold up quite as well on multiple readings.The first time through, however, I was blown away. This book is really not like anything else I'd ever read. I know that statement sounds cliche, but it was true for me. Joseph Heller invents an entirely new prism through which to view the world, and I suspect the humour and zaniness in this novel will either work or not work for readers based on personal taste. It worked for me, and after reading it, the only thing I could think of was what had prevented me from reading it sooner.Actually, my wife couldn't wait until I was done with the book, because at times I was in such a black mood while reading it. That's not a criticism of the book but rather a testament to Heller's skill as an author. He so perfectly controls the story that you will have tears of laughter rolling down your face one moment and a sick feeling in your stomach another as the story moves effortlessly from rollicking comedy to horrific tragedy.I won't bother trying to summarize the plot or characters. I have read other comments that criticize Heller for not inventing developed characters, which I suppose is a justified criticism. Many of them have a cartoonish quality and exist solely for the purposes of making a point or moving the plot along. However, they're not totally devoid of depth, because when a character dies, I felt genuinely moved and actually mourned the loss. Their individual traits and quirks (even if that's all you get of them) are so delightful that their absence from the story is keenly felt.I can't praise this book enough and only hope that as I continue to re-read it, the genius of it will emerge once again. One thing is for certain: I doubt I will ever read anything quite like it again, because I doubt that anyone will ever again write anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've been seeing this book around forever. My roomate had to read it in highschool, but he never finished it. In fact, he had to write two research papers on it, and STILL never finished it. After reading up on it, I decided to give it a try...it being a classic and all. And let me tell you, I was impressed.Lately I've been on a Vonnegut reading spree, and this fit well into the same mindset. Plenty of hilarious conversations and occurances. You just can't go wrong with clever humor. I finally know where the phrase &quot;My name is Mudd&quot; comes from (Primus fans will feel nostalgic)!This book is a challenging read though. No rookies want to tackle this puppy. You have to keep track of the characters, or you'll get a little lost. Still, I do not even consider that a negative thing. It's just something you have to deal with, right?Anyways, this was a great book. Who would have thought that a war satire could be so funny? One last thing, my favorite character was Major Major Major Major."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As a long-term prisoner, I'm frequently struck with the comical absurdity of the rigid rules and manner in which adult human beings interact inside the federal bureau of prisons. It doesn't matter whether one is held at USP Leavenworth, or the federal prison camp at FPC Montgomery. A pecking order of personnel exists in every institution which mandates that staff members who want to advance must like the boots of their supervisors, enforce and support every rule assiduously regardless of the ridiculousness of the rule itself. No staff member can befriend or fraternize with a prisoner. Although prison guards fancy titular titles like correctional professionals, they not only fail to \\"correct\\" anything, but they absolutely thwart the progress of individuals who aspire to grow. Living as a prisoner places one in a perennial catch-22.I had heard the term \\"catch - 22\\" for years, and I knew there was a book of the same name. That's all I knew. Then, one afternoon while listening to National Public Radio, probably NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, or Radio Times, I heard one of the guests describing Joseph Heller's Catch - 22 as an exceptionally great American novel. I was almost finished with an Anthony Robbins self-help book when I heard the NPR interview, so I walked to the prison library to check it out. Heller's Catch - 22, a Voltaire-like satire of the military's rigidity had me laughing from page one.Heller uses a dry wit to poke fun at the obsequious, phony interactions between military personnel. As Voltaire's Candid brought to surface the hypocrisy that comes with institutional thought patterns in general, and organized religion in particular, Heller makes readers laugh by bringing his protagonist into contact with his superiors, his equals, his subordinates, and civilians. As a federal prisoner, I live in the midst of the same culture Heller describes. Catch - 22 reminds readers that institutions and the insular culture they propagate cause many of the personnel who work for institutions to forget that we're all human beings and not part of a bureaucratic machine.Heller uses each chapter in Catch - 22 to dramatize another ludicrous episode of military life. We laugh while reading how individuals become blinded by their positions and the power that comes with rank. In several chapters we follow one ingenious military man as he exploits the greed of human nature to build a massive military-sanctioned black market enterprise, the syndicate, in which \\"everyone has a share\\"; enabling them to profit through layered global transactions that frequently deal with war-time enemies. In other chapters Heller entertains us by exposing the insecurities and pettiness of high-ranking officers; it's funny to see those whom the officers belittled and stepped on earlier become direct superiors later in the novel.Heller's Catch - 22 is so powerful that he book's title became a dictionary work defining paradox. It not only made me laugh, but also inspires me as a writer. One day I hope to emulate Heller and Voltaire by writing a satire in the same vein, exposing the absurdity and waste of the criminal justice system in general, and prisons in particular."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you are looking for a book to sit down and read on a Sunday afternoon, &quot;Catch 22&quot; is not the book for you, however if you are looking for a book that will make you think, and is accompanied by off beat humor then &quot;Catch 22&quot; is the book for you.The humor in &quot;Catch 22&quot; is not your typical slap stick humor. It is, however, a way to understand the crazy timeline in which the book is written, and a way to realize how crazy the characters really are. The book's humor shows the insanity of war. The humor in this book takes away from the reality of war. The book seldom mentions fighting, it is more focused on the characters getting out of the war, and the crazy action of the characters. Without humor this book would be extremely dry, and confusing. The humor however does not appeal to all readers.Yossarian, as well as the other main characters in this book, are all stuck in a &quot;Catch 22.&quot; Each way they turn, there is another obstacle preventing them from getting out of the World War II. Whether it be the rise of the missions required, or the increasing bureaucracy among high-ranking officials. There are examples of \\"Catch 22\\" such as this throughout the book.The humor shows how truly crazy the characters are. One character, for instance, puts crab apples in his cheeks because he likes the way they feel inside his mouth. Can you image seeing one of our troops walking around with crab apples inside his mouth, and how comfortable with our army would you be?If you are looking for a book to really stretch you mind, as well as make your stomach hurt from laughter then &quot;Catch 22&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The novel Catch-22 deals with the soldiers stationed on a small island just off the coast of Italy during World War II. The main plot is focused around the story of Yossarian, one of the many soldiers on the island. Yossarian is different from many of the men stationed there as he takes the war personally and gets annoyed that he has to be there, facing danger everyday. He continually tries to find ways to get out of the war and go home, but every plan he comes up with always has a catch, catch-22. This catch ruins all his plans and makes them seem illogical. Throughout the novel Yossarian has to fight against everyone to gain back his life and get what he wants.I enjoyed this novel because of the serious yet satirical tone that is used to convey the major theme. Heller used humor to make the book less controversial and to entertain the reader, while trying to make a statement. He also dealt with a very serious subject matter, the topic of war, which everyone has differing views on. He discusses the fighting and death that occurs in any war and is very graphic in his descriptions of what happens, but through being straightforward and blunt, Heller makes a stronger statement about war and its brutality. The descriptions affected me and my heart went out to all the soldiers involved in the war. Then, when Heller brought the humor back in I began to laugh out loud at the experiences he discussed. I truly enjoyed the way Heller wrote the novel and found that the mix of humor with the serious topic of war worked well to convey his message and made the novel truly original.The novel does not only discuss war and cannot just be considered an anti-war novel. The novel can relate to any aspect of human life and make sense in almost any situation, making it a universal novel. The issues that Catch-22 deals with are issues and emotions every person has confronted at one time or another, such as anger, loss, pain, determination and selfishness. All the characters have to overcome these emotions if they want to survive the war and make it in the world.I found Catch-22 to be an excellent novel about gaining your own freedom and becoming your own person and enjoyed the fact that it used such a controversial and universal topic as war to convey that message.A great read for anyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This satirical novel tells the interconnected stories of Yossarian the bombadier and the men who serve in a military camp on an Italian island during WWII. Nearly every character in this story is crazy, some because they have become unbalanced through their horrific battle experiences and others because they serve so well as functionaries in a system that has normalized the killing of other people. Yossarian retains his sanity through a tight focus on the necessity of his own survival. He becomes a hero by ultimately refusing to capitulate to the forces that demand him to sublimate this most basic and healthy of natural urges to the convenience of a system of death based on the spurious logic of \\"Catch-22,\\" a series of mutually exclusive choices that make true choice impossible and lead one by default down the most destructive path.This is a very funny book, although I felt that some of the more outlandish satire didn't sit well with the more graphically realistic elements of the novel. The narrative is presented in a disjointed manner that heightens the chaos of the situation.Some may be put off by the manner in which Heller attacks the mentality of war without any consideration for the specific conditions that may have provided some justification for the prosecution of WWII."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I wasn't sure what I got myself into when I chose this book for my World History book report. I sorta thought I might have chosen the wrong book. That is, until I actually started reading. This is the funniest book I have ever read and the only one to make me laugh out loud.This book tells the tale of Yossarian, a bombardier captain, stationed off Italy. The thing that separates this novel from every other war novel is that all of the characters are so dysfunctional: Yossarian, the main character, doesn't want to fight. He even tries to convince his superiors that the place he was supposed to bomb already was. Orr, his best friend, carries crab apples in his cheeks. Chief White Halfoat keeps threatening to die of Pneumonia if people don't pay attention to him and the soldier who sees everything twice, sees everything twice.This book is incredibly funny one moment and incredibly sad the next. The horrors of war penetrate the wall of humor in this book quite frequently. Because all of the characters are so weird and cartoonish, it makes everything much more depressing than if a character in a less zany book dies. They aren't supposed to die, they are larger than life.Everything is displayed in a very sarcastic tone, from the Major who states \\"Whenever I am out, I'm in, and whenever I am in I'm out\\" to Milo, who contracts his planes to bomb and defend the same bridge.This book cannot be read without cracking a smile and is a much needed change of pace from the other books in this genre.

He claims he's going crazy, but the fact that he's afraid of getting killed proves he can think rationally, which proves he's not crazy. If he stops worrying about getting killed and requesting a discharge, that will show that he is crazy, but then he won't want the discharge.

Published first in 1955, Catch-22 is an incredible story of life during World War II and many stories of soldiers during battle. Although, there are handfuls of characters, the storyline follows the life of a young American bomber by the name of Yossarian, and his struggles to break free of the war. Life for everyone living near and around Yossarian off of the coast of Italy is tragic and very authentic. The men experience fear, love and hatred, murder, confusion, and the yearning desire to go home.Review Catch-22 is an astounding view of war, and its effects on its participants. Although slow and complicated at first, the conversations and humor make it a favorite read and one that can't be put down until finished. It shows the realities of World War II and how victory comes with consequences.Through Yossarian's stay in Italy, the reader becomes sympathetic to Yossarian and his comrades. They struggle through fear of the slightest things and are almost certain they will not arrive home alive. The men are classified as psychotic, and through their conversations the reader gains a sense of humor of all the many predicaments they get themselves into.Heller emphasizes the importance of every page through tricky conversations that requires the reader's devout attention. He doesn't leave one stone unturned. Catch-22 is very descriptive and not an easy read, but one that will leave the reader with better knowledge of life during World War II. It is a moving novel for both young and old, and reminds the reader that World War II will not be forgotten."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I am one of those rare people who somehow was never required to read CATCH 22 whilst still in the clutches of high-school English teachers. Recognizing this deficiency, I recently read CATCH 22 for the first time, and found it wonderfully comic, yet simultaneously dark and frightening in its implications.Intended as a scathing satire of war and the military, CATCH 22 is firmly rooted in the bizarre. The characters are delightful in their insanity (also evidenced by their names, i.e., Colonel Korn, Major Major Major Major), and each portrays some aspect of the horrible side of human nature (Nately's sad naivety, the gnawing self-loathing of Major Major), mostly to the total exclusion of any happier traits. With such a cast, thrown into the confusion of World War II, CATCH 22 can only be a strange tale. Personally, it reminded me of the sort of black comedy that leaves you feeling dazed afterwards (for movie lovers, think NIGHT SHIFT), reeling from the confusion and horror of it all.It elicits strong emotions -- frustration and anger not the least of them -- which I suspect was the author's real intention. I often wonder why books touted as &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;great&quot; must be so bizarre. CATCH 22 is not necessarily easy to read, and it seems that only adds to the praise it receives. Perhaps CATCH 22's ability to make the reader a part of the confused, rambling story is based firmly in this bizarreness.Personal hint: read this book twice. You'll catch much, much more the second time through."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is truly one of the best pieces of liturature I have ever read. It captivated me, I found it hard to put the book down, even to rest my eyes for a minute. Heller does such a good job keeping your interest. The characters in this book come alive to you. You want desperately for Yosarian to make it through the war, and for something terrible to happen to Colonel Cathart. This book does a great job shedding light on the insanity of war, and of the terribly beaurocratic systems involved with everyday life. This book makes you laugh out loud, as well as making your stomach turn with apprehension. Its amazing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"hilarious insights and incidents. An original account of war.

Yet it also has somber tones, a theoligical debate, and it promulgates Heller's existentialism.

Heller is brilliant!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A hilarios book. This is the story of a WW2 pilot named Yossarian who knows that that millions of total strangers are trying to kill him and can't figure out why.

It continued well bought could not keep up the humor using the same kind of jokes that Heller kept using. Maybe it was just too long. Catch 22 was an original and well written and sometimes hilarious novel. It's message is that nothing should be taken seriously, or is it that everything should be taken seriously? Who stole my plum tomato?"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"CATCH-22 is masterful in so many ways. It begins as comic farce, proceeds to the increasingly surreal, and then transforms into a nightmarish tragedy before ending triumphantly. No novel that I know so successfully blends all these disparate moods. I believe it was Hugh Walpole who wrote, \\"Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragedy to those who feel.\\" No book illustrates that better than this novel. This truly is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is also one of the most tragic.CATCH-22 also introduces one of the most insane collection of great characters in fiction: Yossarian, the Chaplain, Orr, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Milo Minderbender, Maj. Major Major Major, Nately, Doc Daneeka, Danby, General Dreedle, Nately's girl (not the description in the book, but Amazon's software will bleep it), Cathcart, Nurse Duckett, The Texan, Major ----- de Coverley, The Soldier in White, and a host of other characters. It is one of the most gloriously populated novels of the past half century.This is a novel I can almost not discuss except through superlatives: greatest war novel I have read, funniest novel I have ever read, greatest English language novel of the past 60 years. But the best thing is that it is, on top of being a superb book, an exceedingly fun book to read. Even at its nightmarish, this is a fun, delightful book. And few novels contain as many unforgetable moments as this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I would first like to inform other reviewers that I am a high school junior, read this as part of a choice novel project, and had no trouble grasping the ideas that Joseph Heller presented within his Catch-22.The sarcastic attitude of this novel is conspicuous, and all bonds with reality are dropped with the first character introductions. The humor that has previously been criticized I found to be easy to understand, not monotonous, and a unique aspect to illustrate WW2. This is not to say the humor is for all, because Heller uses many paradoxes (look up definition of \\"catch-22\\"), simple one line contradictions, and subtle word choices to draw a laugh-all which represent the personality of the novel.Yes, there are many characters, probably over fifty, yet grasping the names is not important at all times. Of course you quickly get associated with Yossarian and the other main characters, and chapter do reintroduce people from the early parts of the book. This may be annoying, yet each character is distinct, and there is little chance of confusing Milo, and entrepeneur, with Havermeyer, the elite pilot. In truth, the novel lacks a linear time, but chooses, rather, to define the novel through numerous character sketches, focusing them loosely around Yossarian. By the later chapters of the novel, Heller subtly introduces the gruesome truths of the war, balancing the early humor with more realistic look. It is through this transition that the weight of the situation is elucidated, and by contrasting the final chapters with the first, Heller is able to attract our attention and force us to analyze the war.What is the novel about? There is no simple answer, yet if I attempt to state it in a single sentence Catch-22's theme, it would be \\"The only true fault of America's once the war began, was that we as a nation began to glorify war, without truly understanding the implications of our actions.\\"What is the idea behind catch-22 as a statement? Read the book. Enjoy. Open your eyes with laughter and tears. Perhaps you won't like the satirical tone, but I would suggest to all that you try."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I was in high school, my English teacher introduced me to the absurdity of war. We were assigned to read &quot;Dulce Et Decorum Est&quot; by the great war poet Wilfred Owen. This poem refuted the &quot;old lie&quot;, Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori - How sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country. After reading this poem, I suddenly realized how wasteful and utterly senseless war is, especially for the unfortunate people who must put their life on the line.One day, I was in a second-hand bookstore, and by chance spotted a copy of &quot;Catch-22.&quot; I had no idea what the book was about, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop. This book, like Owen's poem, describes how frightening and pointless war is to the soldier. However, while Owen uses gory details to bring forth his ideas, Heller uses satire.This book captures the personal fears and opinions of the troubled bombadier, Yossarian. He does not know why he has to be there, and he certainly does not want to die.Yossarian stated that he didn't care if this opinion made the enemy happy. He said that the enemy is anybody who wants to kill you, and it was his superior who kept sending him out to get killed...This makes me wonder about the millions of soldiers throughout time, for this thought must have passed through some of their minds at some desperate point. The old men who instigate and plan wars are not the ones who will die. Rather, they send people out to die for *their* cause.As you can see, this book really made me think. Yes, I thought, I laughed till I cried, then I cried for the senselessness of it all. Heller is a genius!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For so many of us growing up in the USA, our high school teachers assigned us Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" as required reading, and I was among those assignees. I'm not sure why the requirement, other than perhaps some Catch-22 type of logic that everyone else was assigning it, so there, must be great, must read. I don't particularly remember liking the novel then, perhaps with no more substantial of a reason than -- just not my style. Reading the novel now, in midlife, my opinion (or my literary style) has changed little, but today, I can attempt to add to \\"not my style\\" perhaps a few deeper insights.In this second read, I realize what so fails to appeal to me is Heller's slapstick, absurdist, repetitive and dizzyingly circular style of storytelling. At the same time, I fully realize this is also the appeal of the novel for many: it's absurdity. Indeed, time has tested Heller's topic of war having little logic or reason in the real world, mostly born of individual and governmental insanity, power plays and mere whim, male ego clashing and chest thumping. Few wars seem to have good reason for happening when one considers all the other possibilities of resolution. While leaders sit safely in secure offices on fortressed hilltops, the common soldier takes all the risks, offers up his/her body for battering, endures indescribable torments in battle, and often gives the ultimate sacrifice of life. Shall we debate the virtues of boxing rings for political leaders instead? Yes, war is absurd. And Heller captures this \\"crazy-making\\" truth in a crazy-making novel in which characters dance to illogical commands, spin in frustration, and dig themselves in ever deeper as they try harder and harder to dig themselves out. You know... as in war.So I slogged through the pages like a good soldier. Characters leapt forward and backward in time, one event led to no other event, resolution rarely made a showing, and the dance of insanity kept the main lead. Even as I slogged, I could not deny what an excellent reflection of warring reality Heller's writing proved to be. Kudos for that. Redeeming factor.And then, somewhere towards the final pages, I was somewhat won over. Without losing his voice of absurdity, the author had Yossarian, key player, say lines so absurd they rang true to the core, e.g. \\"but we don't want what we want!\\" and I could only shake my head and echo, oh indeed. We don't. When offered a bounty of temptations to sell out his soul, Yossarian denied them all, and in his crazy way, spoke utter sanity. How common is it to want something desperately much of our lives, only to realize we don't want it at all when fantasy turns into reality? A gold star for the author. Other episodes of Yossarian struggling to keep a fellow soldier alive even as his guts spill out, the sheer horror and despair and helplessness of the situation, hit target. Bravo.This, and Heller's commentaries on man being little more than meat, fodder for the brutalities of war, resounded with such painful truth that today's reader can only look up at current events and current disasters and realize -- we are living in a world ruled by absurdities even today. History has taught us nothing.And so, I could be convinced that Heller's novel is a classic. Perhaps it is."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"To be honest with all you gentle readers, I don't much admire War novels, nor do I stand by the title of my review. Generally, I believe War is truly Hell.But last Winter, in the grips of a bout of quasi-depression-for-teens following a move to the most FLAT province in Canada, I truly thought I was in Hell. An e-mail friend suggested Catch-22 to use up edgy cabin-fever time. Now, let it be known that my attention span for most novels dwindles quickly, especially if the book is slow to pick up. While significantly slower to get 'into' than most of the writing I chase, Catch-22 sucked me in, like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is sharply funny, engaging, and chock full of delightful characters. The main character is a thinker; a young man disheartened by war and his own mortality. His name is Yossarian, and since reading this novel, he has stood out in my mind as being one of the most...sculpted... characters in the history of literature.Put simply, this book is a satire about World War 2. Coming from a kid sickened by the very idea of war, I can say that this book is worth whatever bills you have to fork over for it. It's not about war, per se, but more about the human condition. In addition, it made me laugh a few times, something that only a few other works of fiction have ever been successful in accomplishing. I finished this book feeling oddly... renewed. If you're looking for something 'new' (or, so old it's new) and engaging, I heartily recommend 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Undoubtedly, this book is a modern classic. To describe and elucidate all peculiarities of its style, allusions (Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, etc.), plot, characters and its influence on the modern culture and life one will need to write another book of similar volume. So I'll be short: the novel is excellent, a must read.It starts as a brilliant satire showing absurdity of a war machine and its human components. In times the story is so funny that it is preferably to read in solitude in order not to exasperate people with irrepressible laughter. But in the second half of the novel the festive mode metamorphoses: a hilarity becomes a horror of a man ensnared by a booby trap. The events and orders are crazy but the blood of friends is absolutely real. The black comedy, taking place in Italy during World War II, transforms into a hideous picture of the human society, where a life of an ordinary person signifies nothing being only a card in heinous game of rapacious and salacious potentates. In one of the last chapters Rome, the Eternal City, appears as an apocalyptic vision of impending destruction of the iniquitous world. The marvelous novel of Joseph Heller warns us: Be vigilant!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is not a book America wants to read, especially in her present state of patriotism. One cannot picture Heller's Yossarian sporting a \\"These Colors Don't Run\\" T-shirt and waving a flag. Indeed, the opening chapter explicitly refutes any interpretation that suggests Yossarian's actions are rooted in a deep sense of nationalism: an uber-patriotic Texan drives almost all the men out of a hospital ward and back into combat. Catch-22 is a book that challenges the logic of war. It combines wry humor with startlingly affecting anecdotes to force the reader into asking questions. It is the portrait of a man who is dangerously sane, but trapped in the insanity of war by catch-22.When I started reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22, I had no idea what to expect. I scanned the buzzwords on the back cover...\\"apocalyptic, bitter, hilarious, monumental, original, subversive, classic.\\" What I found was a moving satire, centered ..., an allegory who manages to retain his humanity. The fact that Heller's Yossarian was indeed so easy to relate to contributed to the book's power. The novel brings you deep into the world of war, as viewed by a soldier. Yossarian's experiences are not entirely realistic, and much of what happens over the course of the novel seems to make no sense at all. In presenting war in such a manner, Heller asks the reader whether the reality of war makes any more sense than does Yossarian's story. Heller says that war itself is a great catch-22, a paradoxical trap that humans walk into time and time again. He questions the logic of the illogical, and asks the reader to try and rationalize the irrational.Catch-22 is significant because it claims that not only war is a catch-22. The metaphor extends to include life itself. We see that the characters are not merely fighting to survive the war...they are fighting to be immortal. Each has his own way, whether it be by enduring boredom to make time move slower, or by gaining global power through commerce and enterprise. They are all trying to cheat death. Heller's novel reveals many deep and often unpleasant truths, but it does it with humor and style. For this reason, Catch-22 has reached \\"classic\\" status and will probably remain a classic for generations to come.As a book, Catch-22 is flawless. It is moving, witty, and ultimately one of the greatest novels I have ever read. It deserves every one of its five stars. However, to those who are interested in reading it, I warn you to take Heller's work with a grain of salt. Many may find the satire offensive in light of the current global situation. Please do not let current events get in your way. Catch-22 is a wonderful, eye-opening novel; but as with all \\"subversive\\" literature, it must be approached with an open mind."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Having recently read and greatly enjoyed Herman Wouk's &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, I expected &quot;Catch-22&quot; to be a straightforward war novel. Boy, was I wrong, and pleasantly surprised!There are two sides to the style of &quot;Catch-22&quot;. On one hand, the character profiles and the bits of dialogue showing how the characters interrelate are hilarious. Heller's prose is as funny as P.G. Wodehouse's and even his wry style of humor is very similar to Wodehouse's. But Heller is not using humor to lighten the mood of war, nor is &quot;Catch-22&quot; merely humorous. The other side of the novel is its realistically gory portrayal of the atrocities of war (some of which are even the result of &quot;friendly fire&quot;), including detailed accounts of the sights, sounds, and terrors of flying in a World War II bomber aircraft.Rather than present the plot in a linear, chronological fashion, Heller cleverly and innovatively cuts it up like a jigsaw puzzle and lets the reader put the pieces together. Only towards the end of the novel, relating Yossarian's sadness at the news of Nately's death and the events that follow, does the plot start to proceed a little more conventionally until Yossarian makes his final decision to escape his predicament.If the novel has a theme, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's about the evils of rationalization; that is, the way people interpret and twist the logic and laws of authority or society to their own advantage. People's desire for power, status, and money results in excuses for military brutality and endangering the lives of others, and &quot;Catch-22&quot; illustrates numerous examples."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's excellent anti-war satire is on of the most poignant, intriguing and comical books ever written. The conversations of his roundabout characters are some of the wittiest pieces of dialogue one could ever find in a novel, and the underlying satire and social commentary behind every character and every page really does pack a punch. Catch-22 is both hilarious, cynical and scathingly satirical: a masterpiece; a tremendous achievement.It revolves around a group of characters during WWII, notably the eccentric Yossarian. Yossarian is confined to a small military on the island of Pianosa, in amongst a large group of weird and wonderful characters. Each of these characters exhibit strange idiosyncrasies inflicted by the madness of war: they are vehicles for Heller to convey the futility and stupidity of the institution.Yossarian, no matter what he tries, cannot escape bombardier duty and cannot get transferred. To be transferred, one must be classified as insane. Hence the Catch-22: by exhibiting a concern for one's personal safety and asking for a transfer, one is sane. But, by flying combat missions and risking one's life, one is IN-sane, but by asking to leave, one is SANE! Yossarian is flummoxed.Catch-22 is one of the best books ever written and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Who is more dangerous to your sense of self-preservation, the enemy soldier who wants to kill you, or the superior officer who orders you into hostile fire? Joseph Heller took everything that is wrong and insane about war and bureaucracy and turned it loose onto the pages of CATCH-22.Time does not progress in a linear fashion is this book. Characters that are furious when the minimum number of bomb-missions to be flown is raised to sixty are later appalled when it is raised to thirty. The pilots and crew are trapped in an endless circle of logic, time and red tape. Yossarian's attempts to preserve his life end with him exactly in the same place that he was before. Everything is structured so that escape is completely impossible. All the regulations and requirements keep looping around back upon themselves leaving Yoassarian with no options left.The strange and bizarre characters that Heller created are really what give the book its teeth. Virtually every character has constructed a routine for himself (since this is set in the male-dominated military camps of WWII, just about all of the major characters are men) that distances him from the actual war effort. The leaders bury themselves into the deep sands of regulation and order, and grapple with tough problems like paperwork, the military hierarchy and organizing parades. The soldiers spend their time drinking, having sex with Italian prostitutes, getting into bar-fights or trying to get rich. What is interesting is that almost none of the characters even mention the opposing side in the war. CATCH-22's war is not about bravery or heroics, it is about selfishness and greed and insanity.I disagree with those reviewers who have said that the order of the book appears random, as if Heller had written the book in a straightforward fashion and then merely shuffled the chapters around. With the book written in this way, we see the development of certain characters within their own bubble of time, freed from the distractions that other characters and their unrelated subplots would bring. It allows Heller to bring specific themes to the foreground when they are needed or let them sit in the background when they are not.This is a really excellent book and I highly recommend it. I rate it at five stars because I honestly cannot find any fault with it. The book moves effortlessly from hilarity to tragedy while pausing only briefly to look at how the individual deals with the horror of war. Everything in this book is absolutely and hilariously absurd. One of Yossarian's friends, Milo, owns so many supplies and controls so much of the market that he is able to buy eggs at seven cents each, sell them at five cents and still run a handsome profit. A computer with a sense of humour decides to promote a man to major based purely on the fact that his last name (and his middle and first names) are the same word as the position.This is a must read for everyone. The illogic will delight you, the humour will tickle you, and the reality of it all will scare the hell out of you.Note: The Everyman's Library edition contains a new introduction by Malcolm Bradbury, a timeline for notable events in the period during which the book is set and the preface that Heller himself wrote for the 1994 re-issue. If you are planning on buying this book, I recommend getting the Everyman's Library edition, as the added features are quite worth it. Plus, it comes with one of those built-in cloth bookmarks that are so handy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I laughed outloud a lot while reading this book, but towards the last 1/4 of the book it began to drag a little, and I felt that it could have ended sooner and still been good. That said, I'm not sure what exactly I would have cut out because I think all the characters are funny, but possibly a couple of the lesser characters could have been cut to help the pace a little."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The story focuses around Yossarian, a WWII officer stationed in the Meditaranian Sea. Everyone thinks that Yossarian is insane because he is paranoid about dying. As Heller shows though, this is the very thing that makes him sane.Quite simply, one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'm not going to write a long review, as others have done a well job of it. I just like to say, it was just funny from one page to another from beginning to the end. The whole book reminded me of M*A*S*H with too many Klingers, or, they all seem to be a relative of him. All trying to get out of warzone as many of their comrades are dying mission after mission. I can't believe high schoolers are forced to read this? Sure, it has SAT vocabs strewn all over the pages, but so is sex. Shrug."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a great book to demonstrate certain literary devices. This book is a great book to understand foreshadowing and symbolism. Heller uses great symbolism to present the idea or purpose he's trying to get across. The one main problem I had with this novel was the confusion that Heller puts the reader through. I like books that have mystery but are straight forward with explaining the ideas, exceppt for Heller who makes you think you know the idea but there's actually a twist to it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"if you liked momento, you must love catch-22...this book is like a piece of art,even if you don't like to read books, you are going to be addicted to it.Some reads it over 10 times to understand how it connects to real life, but some others read it for the first time to comprehend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The spotlight in which Catch-22 has remained since it became so very popular during the 1960's, is one of great significance to literature. Heller was ingenues in the way he compiled the stories of these seemingly simple characters. The further along in the story the more attached you become the each character. You fall in love when they do, feel loss when they are morning and find humor when you realize the foolishness of their situations.This book was the first of its kind in the way it was organized. It's plot is not in chronological order and you find things out long before you truly understand what they mean. This book is a wonderful piece of literature and recommend not only reading it, but possibly reading it again to fully understand it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is really an amazing book. Heller opens with many random character descriptions and stories. Within the first few chapters it is easy to feel confused and/or lost. As the book continues, everything that was once confusing starts making sense and the book becomes rather interesting. This is where Heller puts the icing on the cake. Everything starts connecting with each other and the whole book becomes a masterpiece.Heller also constructs different feelings and views on war and the effect of it. If you are in the mood for an exciting, mind boggling, and action packed book, I suggest Catch-22!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller does a great job in piecing together this story. Each anecdote acts as a new puzzle piece. As the story progresses the pieces start to fall into place to form the overall picture: a criticism on the aristocracy of war.If you are into abstract stories that make your mind wonder what the author is truly trying to say, you will love this book. The writing style Heller presents is very unique. It leaves his readers split; you will either love it or hate it. The complexity of this text is better understood when reading it the second time through."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a brilliant satire that plays out like an old war sitcom, such as Hogan's Heroes or M*A*S*H*. The story takes place in an airbase, on a small island off the cost of Italy, during the end of World War II. The sitcom feel comes from the over twenty central characters, each with their own different fears, ambitions, passions, personalities, goals and beliefs. Not to mention each character is INSANE in his own personal way. From the rebellious Yosarrian, who believes everybody is out to kill him, to the capitalistic Milo, who bombs the base himself as a business investment, the misadventures that occur on the island when all these characters try to survive with one another bestows upon the story its sitcom-like charm.The author, Joseph Heller, uses elements such as dark humor, explicit violence, and everything in between to craft this novel. By making you laugh out loud on one page, and then sicken you with disgust on the next, Heller demonstrates the utter insanity of war. He blatantly accuses the government and the military of turning their back on the innocent men they USED to do their dirty work. The generals in Catch-22 are portrayed as irrational, ignorant, and power hungry because they are more concerned with the prestige they may receive than the number of men they pointlessly send to their death.On the whole I would recommend this book because of its ability to be humorous, appalling, and thought provoking all at the same time. By the end, the reader begins to understand the hopelessness of all the characters because they are not evil men, but the war forces them to choose between doing evil and being killed."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In order to find out how complicated this book is, you must first read it. However, after having read it and having struggled through many parts of the book, you find the book not very complicated anymore.Since many reviews have been written about the plot and characters of this marvelous book, I will proceed to write my feelings after reading it.Heller has done a great job of writing a book that basically satirizes World War II. This book is very complex, with its many plot twists and flashbacks, but not complex enough that readers will lose control of the main picture he is trying to paint. Readers young and old alike will be awed by the cruelty of the last world war while laughing through many other parts of the book. The amazing range of emotions regarding the book is what truly makes it a masterpiece.However, I must warn that readers will not be able to comprehend the full comical effect of the \\"profoundness\\" of this book very easily, as it requires a much higher level of reading than most other popular books."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I can clearly recall after over 30 years the stir that Catch-22 caused in the group of friends I was close to in college. The book at first reading was so outrageously funny and captivating that it was a major error to put down the only copy we had for any reason. The sole copy left unattended would immediately be picked up by one of the &quot;vultures&quot; that were constantly circling the fortunate one who had the book, looking for an opening.On subsequent readings of this remarkable novel the incredible depth of characters and irony comes through more forcefully and new meaning is discovered. Heller's command of the language and his fine understanding not only of the madness of war and the insane reasons those in charge offer for its necessity but also of the day to day absurdities of life in the military and by extension in everyday life, make this a novel a Bible of Truth that for those of us who have experienced those absurdities and that madness. Conversely, those who do not have the experiences of armed conflict and interaction with any military machine still get full meaning of &quot;the catch&quot;. This novel touches so completely the soul of an ultimately sane man, Yossarian, living in a totally insane world. That the phrase &quot;its a Catch-22 situation&quot; has so completely entered the language and that it is understood by those who use it exactly as Heller intended is the ultimate compliment and review of this timeless work."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have been taking a look at some of the negative reviews here, and some reviewers do bring up a good(albeit obvious) point: this book does not portray war realistically. It should be a given that practically every satire exaggerates. That is, after all, what makes satire so funny.That being said, this is still a great book. I won't explain why it is great, as there are so many other reviews which tell you so. I would however like to touch upon a few things. The last few chapters have less humor than the previous chapters, and these chapters can get quite gruesome and disturbing. Also, I sometimes found myself frustrated with the stupidity of some events in the book, instead of humored. Finally, the ending was a little TOO unrealistic, as the whole mindset and attitude towards life is changed in Yossarian thanks to a single bit of news. Mind you, the book ends so abruptly that it is unknown whether he maintains this attitude for long, and therefore it is a bit of a cliffhanger, despite the fact that there was never meant to be a sequel.Still, overall, a great book. Not quite 5 stars, but more than 4."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"To immerse yourself in the WWII-era nightmare at the heart of Joseph Heller's masterful novel is to lose yourself in a world where bureaucracy has run amuck, logic and sanity have become rare commodities, and the threat of imminent death permeates the very air. And yet, the only person who can see all of this is Yossarian, a bombardier who has the misfortune to be stuck in a war while being, as the dust-jacket points out, \\"dangerously sane.\\" He is terrified by the dangers that surround him, disgusted by the wanton behavior of his compatriots, and angered by the selfishness of his superiors. He just wants to go home and leave all this behind him, but that seems to be an impossible dream. The closer he gets to the end of his tour, the further he gets from going home as power-hungry, image conscious superiors concoct new ways to extend the number of missions their pilots must fly. This is a war where the accuracy of a bombing run is seen as irrelevant so long as it photographs well (a pretty explosion is all part of the CO's PR campaign), a mess hall officer can run an international business that makes him the most powerful man in the unit, and a dead body can be allowed to lie around without getting removed if that officer's paperwork never arrived (making him never officially exist to the bureaucrats), and more. The logic that they and all characters except Yossarian use is utterly absurd, lending \\"Catch-22\\" a farcical air, but the genius of Heller's work is that their outrageous logic is actually an only mildly exaggerated version of the logic that we are forced to abide by in everyday life. You can read in his inspired satire the problems that plague any bureaucracy, whether it be as mundane as the office or as vital as the government.\\"Catch-22\\" is outrageous, yes, and that may turn some readers off, but it is a novel that has a devilish heart and a wicked wit at its core - not to mention the fact that it is sheer genius, and it isn't as far-fetched or outlandish as it may initially appear. Heller's tone is pitch-perfect and never wavers, and his vision has made \\"Catch-22\\" a timeless classic that is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was first published. An absolute must-read.Grade: A+P.S. If you like this check out Kurt Vonnegut, another spectacular absurdist author. I'd recommendSlaughterhouse-Fiveor my personal favorite,Mother Night."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is genious. It's so hilarious. It manages to make as serious a topic as war funny. But at the same time, Heller makes it clear just how terrible a thing war is. This book isn't for everyone, it's a love-it-or-hate-it book. The sense of humor is hard for some to understand. If you read the first one or two chapters and don't find yourself laughing, just stop reading right there. But if you're like me, you'd have fallen in love with it by then."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, by Joseph Heller, is the story of Yossarian, a bombardier fighting for the United States in World War II. Heller takes a lighthearted and satirical approach to address the serious topic of war. While doing this, he addresses several themes including the idea that money and power corrupt, and conveys the loss of religious faith and the overall uselessness and destructiveness of war.Catch-22 takes place on Pianosa, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea. The reader witnesses Yossarian and his desperate attempts to get out of the war. He was once a great bombardier, but loses interest after he witnesses the death of a man on his plane. He no longer cares about the assigned missions and instead \\"had decided to live forever or die in the attempt, and his only mission each time he went up was to come down alive\\" (29). Yossarian finds himself trapped in the war due to his antagonist, Colonel Cathcart, a man so interested in being promoted that he will put other people's lives in danger. The problem is that Cathcart continually raises the number of missions required of the men in order to complete their service in the army. \\"They were in a race and knew it, because they knew from bitter experience that Colonel Cathcart might raise the number of missions again at any time\\" (27). Yossarian finds himself closing in on the number of missions he needs to get out of the war, but sees the number rise just before he can get there. He can also be excused from service if he is insane, but Catch-22 makes this option impossible. One part of Catch-22 says that a man is insane if he flies his bombing missions, but if the man says that he is insane and asks to be excused from duty, the fact that he is requesting this proves that he is in fact perfectly sane because \\"a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\" (46).Catch-22 features many separate characters, all of which have their own side stories. The book often switches from present to past to allow the reader to learn much about many of the characters. Most of the focus, however, is given to Yossarian, a character who is hard not to like and feel sorry for. The novel shows how Yossarian and the other characters spend their time in the army-both during missions and during their free time. The reader gets to witness how the characters deal with the war and watch as some of them, characters like Colonel Cathcart and the cook, Milo Minderbinder, use the war to their advantage. Catch-22 is a constant struggle by Yossarian to save his life and to stop flying bombing missions.Catch-22 features several important themes. The first shows how power and money corrupt. Most people would hate being at war, but Colonel Catchart and Milo Minderbinder definitely do not mind. Cathcart is a man who cares about little else than being promoted. His powerful position and hunger for more power drives him to raise the number of missions his men must fly in order to complete their military service in order to impress his superiors and possibly get his promotion. Milo, on the other hand, is totally driven by money. He runs a syndicate where he is constantly buying and selling goods throughout Europe. However, he begins to lose money and is willing to do just about anything to make money back. \\"One night, after a sumptuous evening meal, all Milo's fighters and bombers took off, joined in formation directly overhead and began dropping bombs on the group. He had landed another contract with the Germans, this time to bomb his own outfit\\" (257). Both Milo and Cathcart are willing to endanger the other soldiers just to feed their appetites for money and power. Their corruption is only one of the several themes present in Catch-22.Other ideas that are introduced in the novel are the loss of faith and the uselessness of war. After being involved in the war for so long, Yossarian has abandoned any belief in a higher being. He says, \\"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways. There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing. Or else He's forgotten all about us...What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His...Why in the world did He ever create pain?\\" (179). The war, along with the viciousness and selfishness of the people that Yossarian deals with have led him to lose any religious faith he might have had. He does not agree with the war that he is fighting in and seeing his friends die in. War, in the novel, is overall depicted as useless since there is no real reason why the men are fighting, except for the benefit of people higher up in command.Overall, Catch-22 is an excellent book. The only complaints that could be made about it is the fact that it is sometimes difficult to follow since the plot jumps from the present to past without warning. Also, there are numerous characters with many names and military positions to get confused. However, after a while, one will get used to this and it will not be hard to finish the novel. Joseph Heller decides to depict war in a comical and satirical manner, styles that are not often used for books in the war genre. It is a very funny book, but is also deeply significant since it addresses the ideas of power, money, corruption, religion, and the uselessness and viciousness of war. It is a great read and is wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who is interested in reading a classic."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If there is one thing i can say about this novel, is it's surprisingly dark humor. Every page gave me a wicked grin.I'll give a warning though: if you don't have a sense of humor... go read someone serious and leave this book to the eccentrics. But, if you have a warped sense of humor (such as myself) this book is just... wow.The strength of the book is it's underlying theme of buracracy. If you are blind to the dogmatic society that we live in: there will be too much red-tape for you to truly understand the novel, and Heller's intentions.My favorite &quot;thing&quot; of this novel is the cast of characters. In fact, i'll go out on a literary limb and say that Catch-22 has the greatest ensemble of characters then any other novel ever written (or that i read for that matter... which is alot).The only obstacle i can think of (besides if you are a blind conformist) to reading this book is the structure of the plot. It's as if Heller had the novel all set and ready to go, accidently dropped the manuscript out out of a window and every chapter oddly stayed intack; but have fallen out of order and have no sense of time frame anymore. on top of this, heller was to lazy to put them back in order, and gave it to the publisher that way. I think he intended it to be a chaotic structure, much like the enviroment of being in war, where everyhthing seems to be flying at your face. But this really isn't too much of an obsticle. actually, it makes riddles out of the side-plots, and how they end up (or began for that matter).I heard that Heller's other books pale in comparasion (and are downright bad for that matter, which is very unfortunate) but at least he got one classic out of his head for us. Thank you, truly."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller has written a true masterpiece. I can just imagine the considerable effort that went into the genuis of this book. Catch-22 is a powerful satire composed of such well-written, unique, and frightening characters. It can be so absurd at times, but then you find that you are chuckling to yourself at others. Then you realize what you found humorous and that is kind of scary in itself. Catch-22 is such a challenging and complex read, it is full of allusions, images, and metaphors. You also cannot overlook the very organized way Heller used for the time sequences. However, all these aspects contribute to show the sheer genuis of the author and how well he was able to create this work. I am sure Catch-22 will remain prevalent in society for a very long time, and just getting through the book can become a great reward. Read Catch-22 for its provocative satire, intriguing characters, and brilliance."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"To be honest with all you gentle readers, I don't much admire War novels, nor do I stand by the title of my review. Generally, I believe War is truly Hell.But last Winter, in the grips of a bout of quasi-depression-for-teens following a move to the most FLAT province in Canada, I truly thought I was in Hell. An e-mail friend suggested Catch-22 to use up edgy cabin-fever time. Now, let it be known that my attention span for most novels dwindles quickly, especially if the book is slow to pick up. While significantly slower to get 'into' than most of the writing I chase, Catch-22 sucked me in, like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is sharply funny, engaging, and chock full of delightful characters. The main character is a thinker; a young man disheartened by war and his own mortality. His name is Yossarian, and since reading this novel, he has stood out in my mind as being one of the most...sculpted... characters in the history of literature.Put simply, this book is a satire about World War 2. Coming from a kid sickened by the very idea of war, I can say that this book is worth whatever bills you have to fork over for it. It's not about war, per se, but more about the human condition. In addition, it made me laugh a few times, something that only a few other works of fiction have ever been successful in accomplishing. I finished this book feeling oddly... renewed. If you're looking for something 'new' (or, so old it's new) and engaging, I heartily recommend 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I am merely adding in my own two cents:I never read this in high school or college, and now, at 32, I am rediscovering many 'required reading' novels that I missed. Though this novel won't appeal to everyone, it is a satirical view of the folly of war, capitalism, religion, and many other ideals. Through humor and very interesting situations the reader gains a sense of the exasperation the main character has with the surrounding characters and their morals (or lack thereof).Deep down it has a very Kafka-esque feel to it. If you enjoy dark humor then you should definitely give it a shot. I am very happy I read this, it is on my short list of favorite novels."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Why did this 570-page book take me a month to read? Is it because I only read on the commute, is it because I often had work-related stuff to read on the commute, or is it because it's a tricky book to read? Paragraph by paragraph, Catch 22 is probably the funniest book I've ever read, some really hilarious bits. It's difficult to describe its hilarity, somehow, but the example below provides a pretty good description of its general wackiness. This is from a scene when the chaplain is being taken away by a colonel and a major and he asks \\"What have I done?\\"\\"Why don't you keep your trap shut and let us ask the questions?\\" said the colonel.\\"Don't talk to him in that say,\\" said the major. \\"It isn't necessary to be so disrespectful.\\"\\"Then tell him to keep his trap shut and let us ask the questions.\\"\\"Father, please keep your trap shut and let us ask the quesiotions,\\" urged the major sympathetically. \\"It will be better for you.\\"\\"It isn't necessary to call me Father,\\" said the chaplain. \\"I'm not a Catholic.\\"\\"Neither am I, Father,\\" said the major. \\"It's just that I'm a very devout person, and I like to call all men of God Father.\\"\\"He doesn't even believe there are atheists in fox-holes,\\" the colonel mocked, and nudged the chaplain in the ribs familiarly. \\"Go on, Chaplain, tell him. Are thre atheists in foxholes?\\"\\"I don't know, sir,\\" the chaplain replied. \\"I've never been in a foxhole.\\"The officer in front swung his had around swiftly with a quarrelsome expression. \\"YOu've never been in heaven either, have you? But you knnow there's a heaven, don't you?\\"\\"Or do you?\\" said the colonel.\\"That's a very serious crime you've committed, Father,\\" said the major.\\"What crime?\\"\\"We don't know yet,\\" said the colonel. \\"But we're going to find out. And we sure know it's very serious.\\"Taken as a whole, it's a bit hard to figure out what's going on, although by the time you get to the end of the book you do start to realise that the reason why it doesn't make sense is that he tells some parts of the story backwards: you'll learn an outcome that puzzles you because it came from out of nowhere, but throughout the rest of the book it's referenced often enough that you begin to piece together what actually happened. Heller's thesis is fascinating, if a little adolescent: everything and everybody is insane, especially during war. But because he takes it to such an extent - you'd have to be crazy to want to fight, you'd have to be crazy to want to kill, you'd have to be crazy to fly air force missions, you can only get out of the war if you're mentally unstable but if you were rational enough to want to get out of the war you could not claim insanity; also systems are insane, bureaucracy is insane, commerce is insane, the military system is insane - it provides him with so much material that he has no problem filling a whole book about the insanity of a single army unit. In the end, it seems that I enjoyed the book in spite of myself. Now I want to see the movie."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It took me months to find a copy of Catch-22. Somehow, though, I knew that I had to find it. After the first sentence, I knew that I was going to love the book. There's something spectacular about a book that never seems to fit together. The time lapses in the book are just as crazy as most of the characters! I never knew when what happened, but the whole book had a simply CrAzY effect on me. I had to catch &quot;Catch-22&quot;"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is excellent.

The charachers are wonderful as they go through life just trying to get to the next day. The humor is sad but memorable.

Even if you don't like war stories (which I don't) it is still well worth the read"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Sometimes I'm amazed that this novel, set on a WWII Italian airbase, could so change the life of a teenaged girl growing up in 1980s suburban Houston. How could I possibly have related so strongly to the book? _Catch-22_ is about the absurdity, the wrongness, the evil which is part of many familiar institutions. It is a primer in how to say &quot;No&quot; to meaningless demands, cruel commands, nonsensical orders. It is also funny. Certain passages still cause me to laugh out loud. The ending nearly stirs me to cheering. Like _Slaughterhouse Five_ and _Gravity's Rainbow_, _Catch-22_ is not *really* about WWII. Far from being a poke at those who fought the 'good war', it is a take on the society of the Cold War. Also like those other fine novels, it progresses in a circular fashion, replete with wordplay and strange imagery. I can't promise that it will change anyone's life, but it will certainly provide an entertaining and intelligent read"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I could never read a book in the same way after reading Catch-22. It showed me what an author with a true love of words could do. I have never read anything as funny, or as sad. I've read it three times since the first time I picked it up, two years ago. I think it's one of the best books ever written. I recommend it for anyone"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 takes to the extreme many of the American archetypes of World War II. Yossarian, the unwilling patriot; Milo Minderbender, the ultimate in the capitalistic ideal; Snowden, the mostly forgotten victim; and Colonel Cathcart the ambitious officer. Cynical behaiviour abounds as the pilots try to reach the ever increasing number of missions needed to be flown in order to go home. Peppered with vivid and intense scenes, Catch 22 is one of the funniest and amazing books that exist. It is an emotional and cynical tale that reveals Heller's genius as he turns the reality of World War II into important commentary. One of the best ways to examine why we as a society do some of the things that we do is through humor and Catch 22 does exactly that. I cannot recommend this book highly enough"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Is it possible for a book to merit all the above adjectives above? Yes, if it is Catch-22; in the setting of World War II, Heller depicts the sheerwaste and tragedy for humans, when 'nations' are at war. Catch-22 seeks to show the waste exemplified by the War , without ever depicting a direct attack by theenemy, the Germans. The protagonist of the book, Yossarian, sees through the sham that war is, and questions his superiors relentlesslyabout their ideas of patriotism, when it is he who is going to die 'for the country'. the novel moves back and forth in time, throughevents and from the farcical to the tragic at a machine-gun pace. Yet within this seeming disarray, atale builds up- in the end you wonder who the real enemy is - the Germans orYossarian's superiors"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's timeless classic, Catch-22, is amazing. Hellercrafts an upside-down, senselessly sensible world whereeveryone but the main character, Yossarian, is sane. Or isYossarian the only sane one? Decide for yourself when youread the book. The novel is endlessly funny, pointedlyrevealing and gleefully rambunctious, filled with inherentcontradiction that somehow makes perfect sense. It's beenone of my personal favorites for years and will remain sofor many to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is perhaps one of the best post WW2 books ever written. The style is unique in that Joseph Heller writes in a circular maner rather than the traditional linear style common with Western authors.

Trully a brilliant master piece"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What difference does it make if anyone ever reads your review? If you truly liked this book, write the review for yourself. Write it to thank Joe Heller for a book that you can't imagine your life without. Those who appreciate this book (and from the reviews, I can see you are many) I am comforted to know I am not alone. To those who can't or won't see what Heller did here, I feel sorry for you. We've all in North America been born into a place forged out of wars, wars for independence, for life, for humanity, it is a pity to see how little we understand how valuable a gift all those men and women gave up for our liberty. Catch-22's true brilliance is in showing us that most of the time, those who fought in all those wars didn't themselves understand how valuable their lives were, until they were always on the verge of losing it. That's probably the greatest catch of all. Heller's message in the book is clear, take Snowden's secret to heart as Yossarian did. Man is not special or invincible - &quot;The spirit removed, man is garbage.&quot; See past patriotism, nationalism; see past all the &quot;isms&quot; and think for yourself.

I hope everybody reads this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Lots of humor and humorous situations make this a fun read. Heller seems to favor adverbs more than most writers, but this may be because they were more in style decades ago when this was written.

The men can be grounded if they are insane, but if they recognize the insanity of their missions, they are sane--and must fly more missions. When Yossarian and his friends begin asking clever questions to disrupt boring educational sessions, Colonel Korn decides that only those who never ask questions may ask questions. When they want to discuss a problem with Major Major, they are allowed into his office only when he is out. Even when Yossarian is offered an apparently harmless deal that would allow him to go home as a hero, there is a catch. He must betray his friends by praising the officers who caused many of them to die.

None of that is necessary when speaking about Joseph Heller's masterpiece, Catch-22. Every year, in high schools throughout America, a rather large percentage of english teachers introduce this novel to yet another class of high school english students. What a good thing it is that these teachers do.Catch-22, from the moment of its publication, redefined the anti-war novel. Witty, ironic, savagely sarcastic, yet all the time retaining the poignancy of truth, this book has played a substantial role in teaching people to question authority.If you've read Catch-22 before, grab it off the bookshelf and read it again.

It will make you think more than some people are capable of but don't let their bad reiviews fool you. Go out and read this book. Don't buy it from here though. Get it at your local bookstore.

The parts at the end of the book where Yossarian walks through the sreets, totally helpless as he watches all sorts of evil things being done to people, are really powerful. CATCH-22, as I see it, describes a world that has become so hard and evil that it paralyzes the people living in it, and a war serving the interest, not of the people it's supposibly fought for, but the interest of the officers and the capitalists (Milo). A world where every glimt of common sense is seen on as insanity, and a world populated with people desperately needing someone to hold on to, someone to touch."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Really good book, it was a great change for me from my usual boring technical books.

He was, of course, right on--that's another confirmation that this book is required reading for all military bureaucrats. The various quagmires and contradictions are fleshed out admirably in his characters. I especially love the Chaplain, who is described in one chapter in masterful literary way. Everything in this book is \\"true true!\\" So you have to read it knowing that the ridiculous fiction is a parallel of real life experience, told in a surreal way. He did a nice job with stream of consciousness that was not as overkill as in the other novel, Something Happened. If you are in the Military, make this book your next purchase and plan on re-reading the book seveal times. I can't imagine a better present to send a soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan. The ending is perfect, the beginning is awkward so you have to power through!

Catch-22 was certainly more modern in its references and it covered things from multiple viewpoints. Catch-22 was more slapstick comedy whereas in Hasek's classic you were never sure if Svejk was a genius or an idiot with his simple minded torpidity and senseless compliancy. At the end of the good soldier I leaned towards Svejk being a genius underminer and from reading Heller's book, he too probably thought this. It's almost as if Hasek's protagonist, Svejk, was reincarnated into catch-22's hero Orr.My own favorite characters in Catch-22 were Milo who's ludicrous economic machinations were sheer brilliance and the despotic old Italian man who's ruminations on life were genuine.The plot did bounce around a bit too much for my liking, and the time shifted without warning. Hilarity and riot were mixed sad and poignant scenes such as in which Snowden's murmurs morbidly about being cold while being cradled in Yassarian's arms, sheltered by comforts of \\"There, there.\\"In all a good book, especially after tumbling past the first 200 pages or so."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I can't believe I didn't read this forty years ago.

It does take some acclimation, but it is more than worth the work (for some people, such a style makes perfect sense and would give such a book 10 stars if possible). However, if you are not one of thee latter folks, hang with it, and you will be stuck with a brilliant piece of writing that will haunt you for a very long time. This book has staying power, and that's what may make it something of a masterpiece (albeit a messy one)."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller nails it. While at first it seems a chaotic mess of dark situational humor and commentary of the state of war, main characters (dozens!), and time-jumping, a wonderful pattern is found in it all. Read it through twice: first to find out why Orr was getting hit in the head by a shoe-wielding prostitute, then again to understand why there were crabapples in his cheeks. What a masterpiece!Answer to second thing: What do you mean? There are crabapples in his hands, not his cheeks."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book to me is the perfect novel. Forget even the fact that it deals with war, it raises a lot of excellent points about life in general, through the satiric, repetitive, and absurd format and dialogue. In life we notice that a lot of stupid and terrible things just happen, and they do all the time.Life is repetitive, irritating, absurd, and bad things happen for no rhyme or reason, which is part of Snowden's secrect. Of course, this is magnified 1000 times during war time. Seemingly normal people do horrible things, like when Yossarian realizes that the true crazy person is actually Aarfy, who is so even keeled that he is incapable of grasping his own evil or true danger ahead.This book illustrates some of the frustrating realities of living in a satirical and roundabout way, which is what makes it so brilliant. If you can find the absurd, ridiculous, and awful in world war II, which was actually fought for excellent reaasons, you can find it in a hospital, a school system, a church, or an office. Someone could probably write an amazing catch 22 style book about hurricane katrina and its aftermath.The wild and colorful characters are really exaggerations of people you know and see every day. I do know people who procrastinate and bore themselves to death in order to avoid inevitable bad events, like Dunbar (me), or people who are so silly that they hid their true intelligence for a reason, like Orr, or opportunistic people who sell out humanity in their own way like Milo. I even know what it's like to be more nervous and scared when something bad isn't happening than when something bad is, like Hungry Joe having nightmares only when he isn't flying missions.I also am in awe of Joseph Heller's command of the English language and literature. There are so many literary references that I miss and find out about later on. You have to appreciate the skill in tying all of this together. If he never wrote another book ever again it wouldn't even matter because honestly, this one is perfect in every way."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you like M*A*S*H*, I'm betting you will probably like Catch-22. Heller takes you on an absurd ride through Captain Yossarian's time at the Air Force camp in Pianosa - showing the tragedy of war from the facet of what it does to those who engage in it. Chapter by chapter, you meet characters for whom the heat of war has further fractured the cracks and fault lines in their souls - from young men who go crazy trying to keep themselves sane, to opportunists who take advantage of the most ridiculous circumstances, to generals and colonels who play power games simply to indulge in their own power.What Heller's book shows us, when we laugh at the characters and their actions, is that we are not so different from this lunatic cast - that our own offices, churches, and homes are filled with the same characters and the same flaws. Some of those characters and flaws are funny, and some are downright frightening - but none of them is without critique. We are all cracked and we will all shatter - the only hope is escape.Heller's book is unapologetically escapist. When you see the world as an absurd series of events, there is little else to do but escape. If you become a part of that landscape, you lose yourself. Yossarian, the protagonist, refuses to let himself completely melt into the canvas of the scene that is painted around him and seeks a way out. In the life of a Christian, this way out is Christ - the escape for sinners who would rather not go on sinning, even though they have already done so and have broken themselves and others in that process. Heller does not paint Yossarian's escape so clearly, but does give us hope that Yossarian will escape.I enjoyed this book for the most part. It was a little dense reading at times, but well worth the time spent in finishing it. I hope you'll enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I still can't decide if this difficult and cumbersome read was worth it. It was like watching Dilbert devolve into a horror movie... I kept reading with a mounting sense of terror, I was actually biting my nails by the last few chapters.This novel *is* a work of genius - the repetitions that so many readers find unbearable demonstrate the way Yossarian's mind travels in circles around the traumatic events he cannot face without going completely crazy (they remind me of the writing of Connie Willis - a favorite of mine). I don't think anything else I have read has brought home the horror and senselessness of war quite like this book, and I can see why it is taught in so many literature classes, you could discuss it for hours.....however, that being said... I have no desire whatsoever to open this book again."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I don't really have much to add to what everyone else has already said here, but this is a book that is worth coming back to every once in a while.

My recommendation is to buy the paperback and wait for the eBook price to settle down to a more reasonable level."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller has produced a masterpiece with this novel. A masterpiece of the absurd. The absurd of democracy. The democracy of the US armed forces. Any one has rights, but each right is blocked either because someone higher has the authority to block it, or because the implementation of this right shows that the subject does not qualify for this right. In such a situation there is only one solution : escapism. The situation is dramatic since we are in Italy during the second world war. Simple pilots and bombardiers have no say whatsoever on their fate or lot. Either it goes against the authority of someone higher up who makes them do what he wants to satisfy his own ambition. Or it goes against the general trafficking by the local entrepreneur in the armed forces who aims at making money on the war situation in the name of free enterprise, asking for the war to be privitized. Or it goes against circular rules that disqualify you as a beneficiary of these rules as soon as you ask for them to apply to you. Those questions are very serious. Where is the dignity of the warriors ? Where are the noble objectives of the war ? Where is the defense of the country in such a war ? Where are courage, loyalty, heroism when everything is mercantilized and speculated upon for the profit of a few ? And what does victory mean in such a situation where some are trafficking with the enemy in order to make money, even on the military operations themselves ? The world is absurd and one can only escape from it if one wants to retain one's sanity. But, as opposed to Kafka, this author uses humor and makes us laugh at such silly situations : it is a highly funny book, but in which any laugh or smile hides the sadness of the situations or facts with great difficulty. We would really like to get angry at such mediocre middlemen who dictate hell for other people in their own interest and can do that because these other people lack the courage to rebel, are like sheep following the flock without protesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Well, I never had to read this for school but I read it becausemy sister majored in english and she lent me the book because Ive always liked books that hold a mirror to society (1984,Brave New World..etc...)

It takes place during World War II and is primarily about John Yossarian, a bombardier in the war. Yossarian is an interesting character who looks at life very rationally, yet different from most people. He cares for his life like most people would. He doesn't care for authority unless they can hurt him. He is moral and immoral, smart and immature. With no central theme or story line it is hard to give an accurate plot summary. It does give an outlook on war and life that is not seen very often, with a humorous twist that will keep you laughing only if you are in the mood for it. The characters in this book are very stereotypical yet very unique at the same time. There are some you will love and many you will hate. One reoccurring theme in this novel is the title, Catch-22. There are so many catches and hypocritical events in this book that it is sometimes hard to keep everything straight. For example, Yossarian asked this girl to marry him. She said that she would not marry him because he was crazy, but she thought he was crazy because he wanted to marry her. This is just one of many catches in the book. The entire book seems to revolve around catches, which makes it hard to read at times. The best part of this book is how it gives a humorous outlook on a very serious subject, war. There were very few times I wasn't chuckling at this book. Everyone in this book seems to have lost his or her minds. One of my favorite parts is when some of the soldiers are driving back from a bar and one of the passengers in the back suggests that the driver turn off his headlights. This is obviously a stupid idea. As they are talking the officer in the front passenger seat demands to know why it is so dark and the driver responds, &quot;I turned them off. You know, Chief White Halfoat is right. It's much better with the headlights off.&quot; This is a great example of how no one in the book seems to be completely in reality and the cause of this seems to be the war. Over all I really liked this book. It was almost always funny. It took a while to get into it because it is very different from any book I've ever read. I loved the characters, Yossarian and Dunbar especially, although they were all very good. I would recommend this book who wants to read something new and different and get a good laugh."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is definitely THE BEST book I've read yet. Joseph Heller's characters are very believable, from Yossarian to Colonel Cathcart. The plot is clear, but has its twists and turns, leaving the reader expecting more and getting it. The amazing amount of paradoxes in the book leave you pondering, and the beauty of it is that they all fit in with the book. Truly a must-read book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Having read this book for no other reason than I thought I should I must say I am frankly envious of those with the opportunity to study it. Anyone who reads Catch-22 will rave about it; no formal dissection is necessary to communicate the mutual wonder which shines clearly out of the ensuing rather incoherant duet of praise. Convincing the rest of the world is another matter, one I feel I should leave to those who have done more than just read the book. However I remain skeptical that anyone could ever do justice to this novel, no matter how effusive their praise.&quot;He knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it&quot;. Well Heller has created a book that won't let you avoid enjoyment. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's novel did not dissapoint. I was not sure what to expect when I selected this book but I was thouroughly impressed. I am not a big fan of war books but this novel is much more than that. Heller's attention to detail and great dialogue made this book exciting to read. The conversations held by the characters not only make you laugh but also make you think about the points that they are discussing. Heller's use of vocabulary also inhances the quality of the book. He uses words that are specific to the war and time period. Although sometimes I was confused by the large vocabulary I kept reading because I knew that I would still understand what was going on. Heller describes the scene of war as a place that at some times people would hate to live while at other times a place of paradise. I think that his description of the characters is unlike any i have ever read. Heller describes the characters by writing about their actions and past expierneces. He uses their actions to write about the way they treated others and they way they thought about things. This method was very usefull because it didn't cause the book to stop and explain the character it just told the story and described the character at the same time. Many times in society we take for granted our views on others and ourselves. This book realates the tragedies and triumphs of war to the problems of human society. It opens the minds of those who cannot see the wrongs in society. I think the term &quot;catch 22&quot; which is used throughout the book in many different instances refers to life. In the book no matter what the pilots do they cannot get out of flying the missions, while in life no matter what a person does during there life all people will endure the same tragedy of death. This book is great for all people who love to ride rollercoasters. Heller takes you on an exhilirating ride through the emotions of the characters and tragic happenings of war. I would reccommend this book to anyone who loves to read books that open your mind and make you think."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There are only a handful of books that go beyond literature, cross that fine line into the realms of real life and then challenge what we believe to be right. The Catcher in the Rye and perhaps One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest are perhaps two.For centuries brothers have murdered brothers in the pursuit of peace, and although we always 'try' to believe in the powers pulling the strings we never stand up and ask why?. Jospeh Heller used Yossarian to ask why, and he uses a wit to make the point so incredibly poignant.If passers by catch you reading Catch 22 many pass a knowing gaze and quite possibly feel a tingle down their spine. Whilst at an Airport in Texas a gentleman spotted the book and made a comment that was positively chilling: &quot;I read this book and laughed in college, and then read it a second time in Vietnam. The second time it was not as funny, the second time it was true.&quot;Before reading Catch 22 I read an interview with Joseph Heller, he was asked why he had never written another book as great as Catch 22, his reply was simple: &quot;Nobody Has&quot;. When you reach the end you have to agree."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this when I was eighteen and loved it ever since. I can't count how many times I have read it. I believe Heller once said that the book was not really about WWII but about 'the next war'. That is probably why it struck such a chord with the Vietnam generation for whom the war was happening daily on their TV sets. The surrealism of the novel seemed to be reproduced in the US Army officer saying about a devastated city 'We destroyed it in order to save it'. For there is a ferocious paradox in battle - why don't both sides just run away? This book does not try to resolve the paradoxes (leave that to Keegan, Grossman, Marshall and the military historians), it celebrates the 'grunts', the poor bloody infantry (or air pilots) who just endure the madness, hoping to escape the terrible combination of circumstances that may demand their deaths. Probably the soldiers who endured the trenches of WWI might understand Catch-22 better than those of WWII. Read and be amused, scarified and ultimately humbled."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a masterpiece of a novel, one of the highlights of the last fifty years in literature. One of the saddest, funniest, most inventive books of all time. It's as creative and whimsical as Lewis Carrol, but set amidst the horrors of war. It's hard to find a book so original, so unprecedented, so clear in its convictions and message. A must read for everybody."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"With the recent death of Joseph Heller, I felt compelled to go back and reread his masterpiece, Catch 22. Thirty some years ago I read it as an undergraduate at San Francisco State in the midst of the Viet Nam War. Looking at it again in my fifties, Catch-22 seems a bit more over the edge, and yet the wit is still razor sharp. The absurdities of war still ring true. Heller reminds us that the insanity of war is not limited to pointless wars like Viet Nam. The craziness can even can be found in the so called Good War."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"One of the most hilarious books of all time. No other book has made me laugh out loud as often and authentically as maybe this except The Hitchhiker's Guide."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The reviews are interesting, because no two people see 'Catch-22' in the same way. There are those who don't get it, of course, as there always are with any ground-breaking book, particularly one as unconventional as this. However, even those who like it don't always like the same things. Many people fall into what I regard as a trap, trying to pigeonhole it. It's a war book, a comedy, a satire.... yes, it is, but it's also many other things. The genius of 'Catch-22' is that it defies categorisation.Almost any kind of human interaction you can think of, with the possible exception of sport which only gets a minor mention, 'Catch-22' takes on. Capitalism, communism, religion, sex, courage, loss, medicine, discrimination, authority, man's inhumanity to, well, just about anything really; they all get a good working over. The form of the book is bewildering, with multiple storylines weaved together in non-chronological sequence. It's best not to try and sort them out, but to let yourself be tossed and turned in the sea of images Heller creates. Gradually, as the book winds towards its conclusion, the incidents and people sort themselves out; the final section contains despair and hope in about equal measures.The more you read the book, the more you realize how much of it is relevant to everyday life. Some of you might remember reading Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' for the first time and noticing that it's full of what are now cliches. They weren't cliches when Shakespeare wrote the play, of course, they were brilliant examples of phraseology which passed into the language after Shakespeare coined them. So it is with 'Catch-22', which identifies truths that we all know but just couldn't put into words before Heller did it for us.'Catch-22' isn't a comfortable book. It will make you squirm, unless you are so blind to human frailty that you fail to identify with the travails of the characters. The fact that at the same time as you are feeling their pain you are laughing at them only makes it more disconcerting. Ultimately, though, it will perform the service of all great literature- it will make you think."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book first in 1967. The fact that I still remember it well and am reminded of it often in everyday life situations speaks to its impact, at least on me.It is one of a very few books which can prompt the reader to laugh out loud while reading it. There are also passages which carry profound messages about the reality of war, life, and love. What more can one ask?We read many books and immediately forget them. That has not been the case for me with Catch 22, nor do I think it is with most readers. I would have no hesitation in numbering Catch 22 amongst the most inmportant 100 books I have read. I recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is a must read. I read this book more than twenty years ago and I can still tell you the story verbatim.No library is complete without this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It's sobering to realise that it's 50 years since Joseph Heller's biting satire \`Catch 22' was first published. Through the 1960s and 70s, its famous title was slowly adopted into everyday idiomatic usage around the world and is now quoted by people who have never read the book and may not even know the origin of \`Catch 22' to mean any \`double-bind' situation designed to get you no matter which way you try to brook the system.Heller's novel is themed on the way an unfeeling bureaucracy conspires to marginalize the individual. It covers the same ground as much of Franz Kafka's work (notably \`The Trial') and has an Orwellian core, but \`Catch 22' is much funnier than almost any other work of this loose genre and is a joy to read.Earnest comedy combines with episodic chopped-up storytelling: on re-reading the book after several decades, it becomes obvious that Heller does in fact employ a tight and disciplined - though unorthodox - structure, where common themes are continually re-stated and reinforced with humor and for example the same scenes are described from the perspectives of different characters as the novel unfolds. Clever observation of the absurdity of bureaucratic thinking through a host of sharply-drawn and fleshed-out characters display human behavioural psychology in a way few other novels of the modern age manage to do. You put people in a situation like this, and this is what can happen: it all has its own peculiar logic where the insane can be comfortably in charge and the irrational appears normal. If you are prepared to exploit the system you can get away with almost anything, whereas if you follow the rules and demonstrate \`patriotism' and \`honor' - well, you're basically screwed.The characters who populate Yossarian's world are hard to forget: General Dreedle, the Chaplain, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Major Major Major, (who had a rank created just for him, to exploit his unique name); the incomparable Milo Minderbender and his grandiose money-making syndicate extending even to trading with the enemy and contracting to fly missions for them; the comparatively sane and rational Doc Daneeka, who explains Catch 22 to Yossarian; Nately, Cathcart and the rest.You could describe \`Catch 22' as a comic-tragedy, but above all it's instructive and entertaining. If you've never read this 20th century classic and real, solid books with paper pages are your thing, you now have the chance to get yourself a new edition of the long-out-of-print paperback- the \`50th Anniversary Edition'. Go on, treat yourself."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is absolutely priceless. Several things stand out. One, war is crazy. Two, people are crazy. Three, woman are hysterical.Our protagonist, Yossarian, spends a lot of his time in the military hospital, as he realizes that is perhaps the only place where he can't get killed.Around Yossarian revolve an unbelievable assortment of characters, from rabid war-mongers to meek pacifists, with the entire gamut of humanity spanning the gap in between. Some quotes:\\"McWatt was the craziest combat man of them, because he was perfectly sane and did not mind the war.\\"\\"Milo defended the historic right of free men to pay as much as they had to for things they needed in order to survive.\\"\\"Look fellows, we've got to have some confidence in the people above who issue our orders. They know what they are doing.\\"\\"The hell they do.\\"\\"Colonel Korn was the lawyer, and if Colonel Korn assured him that fraud, extortion, currency manipulation, embezzlemment, income tax evasion and black market speculation were legal, Colonel Cathcart was in no position to disagree..............\\"Perhaps the most entertaining and insightful book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I would only recommend this book if you aren't easily offended. It does have coarse language and is gruesome in parts.It has been a while since my first reading of this book. I read it when I really new to the military. It is much funnier now after having gone to war and been in the Army for longer than a year.I must admit that even though the characters in this book are a bit outlandish and far fetched, you do feel at times in the Military that your superior officers are exactly like the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Hidden underneath the parades and utterances of manipulative politicians there's always a real war with real people that get killed or have their lives and the lives of those who love them altered by the war. Heller in this novel portrayed war as satire. No flag waving just a good look at how war can sometimes become dysfunctional because wars are fought by bureaucracies. And sometimes,especially in this novel, bureauracies develop objectives that are different from the people who commisioned the war.Catch 22 is a law with perverted logic and is displayed in various parts of the novel:\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"During World War II, Heller was a member of the Army-Air Corps and flew 60 combat missions in Italy. I would make a guess that had he not flown those missions, he might have written a different novel where the airmen were more heroic - more ra ra. Heller is not the type of writer who churns out clever novels that look like a book by the numbers but sell well because people like the comfort of the same old thing. He said what he had to say and that was pretty much it. He continued writing throughout his life but he never duplicated or exceeded what he did with Catch 22. I would recommend that every young person read Catch 22. It certainly helped to me rethink my previous support of the Vietnam War.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I found this book to be a masterpiece in its own genre. I agree that Heller's writing might not appeal to everyone, but I found narrative to be excellently sarcastic, clever and enjoyable to read. Bitter humor intertwined with realistic descriptions of the war atrocities, as well as insane dialogs, which correspond to the insanity of the surrounded bureaucratic chaos are simply genius.The book's plot is not built in a traditional way, but at the same time, it is shrewdly completed as a whole, even if chapters seem to be randomly put together with description of memorable characters, as well as events in the military base. I didn't laugh out loud as some readers did, because I just don't enjoy the topic of war, but that is just my personal preference, which doesn't prevent me to see that book as a all-time classic read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I just want to say that I disagree with all those haters giving the book one star. I'm in high school and my AP literature class went through the book as part of the course. The collegeboard considers this a book of literary merit, right along with other greats such as Huckleberry fin, Moby Dick ect. I personally loved the book and found it quite hilarious, however, I'm glad I went through it with my class: had I not, I would have missed a lot. For instance one of the characters posions the men by putting soap into the food to show that the men couldn't tell what food was good. I missed the irony of something that we gennerally associate with cleaning or making one more healthy (soap) being used for the opposite purpose. Things like that are everywhere in the book, and irony runs rampant through the entire story. Also: knowing the history of the author helps as well. Joseph Heller has a philosophy that the more restricted the general population is the more their morals degenerate. This can be seen the the more desperate things Yossarian tries to do as the book goes on. Long story short: its a great book and a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The phrase \\"Catch-22\\" didn't exist until this book coined it in 1961. The author, Joseph Heller inadvertently added it to the English language when he used it to describe an American regulation governing pilot's required number of combat missions.The rule was this: Pilots could only be grounded if they were insane; however they had to request this. But - asking to be grounded proved you sane and so there was no escape, and this was known as Catch-22.This simple problem becomes a metaphor for all that goes on in this novel and correspondingly, in virtually any warfare. The book is bitingly funny, filled with tragic incidents and is chaotic, much like war.The plot revolves around the lives of a group of American bomber pilots in World War II. The central character is Yossarian, who we first met in hospital. The book details events form his life in a seemingly random order, in some ways similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" where an American soldier becomes \\"unstuck in time.\\" In Heller's case, this isn't as blatant and you see the order is in fact carefully constructed to build towards a climax.Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else. Then there is the newly promoted Major Major, who once promoted, becomes Major Major Major and then spends most of the war trying to hide from his men.Each of the unique and colorful characters adds a bit to the pastiche of moods and attitudes deftly displayed here. Absurdities run through the book such as when Doc Daneeka was supposedly killed when the plane he was in crashed...he wasn't killed since he always avoided flying, but in the US Air Force, once it's in the paperwork, it's a done deal...so there's no going back - to everyone else, including his misinformed wife, he remains dead - no discussion.It's a simple idea to posit that war is absurd but it takes a clever writer to illustrate through the actions and inactions of his characters. Catch-22 is the kind of novel that welcomes a second and third read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Despite the fact that most of the characters seem to be caracatures and that this book is a very satirical look at military logic, this book threw me for a loop. The main character, Yosarean, is compelled after months of being put into the line of fire to stop. He no longer wants to follow the orders of his superiors who have no-one's interst but their own at heart. (This is best articulated by Colonel Cathcart, who longs to be featured in the Saturday Evening Post.) Yosarean's solution is to not go into harm's way any longer. Most of the novel is rapturously funny with characters who never answer a question with a satisfactory response. But toward the end the tone becomes dark and quite disturbing as Yosarean becomes more and more haunted by the memories of his fallen comrades, which amounts to nearly all of them. All-in-all this is most certainly a work that I would recommend to anyone looking for a laugh. But be prepared for an intensely dismaying end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As a high school junior, one might think Catch-22 would be a challenge. This is true, for the writing is very different, and it is at times very hard to follow the story. But, if you can find it within your heart to forgive Catch-22 that minor misgiving, then you certainly would feel the same way about it that I do that Catch-22 is a very good book.There are several characters in the book, but the one that Catch-22 is rooted to is Yossarian, who throughout the whole book is always wondering why people he has never met are trying to kill him. His wondering why leads him to try to leave the army in any way possible, but he is always confronted with \\"catch-22\\", which in his case means he can leave the army if he is crazy, and he must be crazy to fly the dangerous bombing runs, but, and here's the catch, \\"anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy...that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\". Catch-22 is used in different situation throughout the book, each with its own underling meaning.A major point the book conveys is the line between sanity and insanity. As seen by the \\"catch-22\\" for Yossarian, it seems to us he is really crazy, for who would walk around all day for months naked. Yet, after getting into the book, the reader comes to realize Yossarian is the only sane person in the whole outfit. This new idea of those who are crazy are sane, and visa versa, leads in to the theme of the later half of the book, the stupidity of army politics. During the story, there are countless times when idiotic things occur because the ones in charge fell it necessary. For instance, in a mission that a member of Yossarian's crew is killed, Yossarian gets a metal.With what I have said, you can see how the book is confusing at times. But don't let that scare you away. Catch-22 is one of the best books of the 20th century, and it is also a very funny book. I recommend it to any who are willing to try something new, for Catch-22 is a challenge, and what could be better for to read than a challenging book full, of humor, about a war...kind of reminds me of \\"M.A.S.H.\\", but not as serious."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Bombardier Yossarian can be grounded because he's crazy, but if he asks to be grounded he will be declared sane and fit to fly; Major Major will permit any man to visit him in his office...as long as he isn't there; and Colonel Korn's education sessions only permit the men to ask questions who never do. These are just a few examples of the roundabout logic, self-defeating reasoning, and frustrating paradoxes that infest the text of Catch-22. Set in final months of World War II, Joseph Heller's novel depicts a world where the human language has become obsolete. Hardly a single exchange takes place that doesn't contain some form of self-contradiction or circular reasoning. Heller's stories of the horrors of war are a satire that is at one-moment whimsical and acidic the next.Featuring an abundant cast of memorable characters, Catch-22 is a war novel that is much more. It is an allegory, a collection of running themes and recurring storylines. Told in a nonlinear storytelling style, Heller's novel captivates and demands attention, making reference to events in casual passing, only to return to them in increased detail. During an education session in Chapter 4, Yossarian, the book's protagonist, makes passing reference to Snowden, a man killed during a mission in which he was in charge. This incident is returned to with increasing detail as the story progresses, and it is in the book's blood-drenched climax that the full horrors of the event are recounted.One recurring theme in Heller's novel is faith. The character Chaplain Tappman is the ideal vehicle for Heller's musings; he constantly preaches the word of God, questioning The Almighty's existence all the while. On the subject of the bible, Tappman recalls one soldier asking, \\"Did it indeed seem probable...that the answers to the riddles of creation would be supplied by people too ignorant to understand the mechanics of rainfall?\\" Yossarian also offers his two cents on the matter in Chapter 18, referring to a certain Supreme Being as \\"'a colossal, immortal blunderer,'\\" saying, \\"'When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. It's obvious he never met a payroll. Why, no self-respecting businessman would hire a bungler like Him as even a shipping clerk!'\\" Its insights like these that make Catch-22 the joy it is.This questioning of faith and religion is justified, particularly in the environment of war, where ruthlessness and corruption are the status quo. Heller creates a world where a redeeming character is a rare and unusual blessing. Many of the book's characters are so self-absorbed it's a wonder how they came to men of respected standing in the first place. Colonel Cathcart, one of the story's central antagonists, is a prime example. A brown-nosing, elitist, social climber, He cares more about getting his picture into the next edition of the Saturday Evening Post than the well-being of his own men. If it weren't for the characters' military titles, one would hardly know this was a book about war at all. Heller doesn't glorify war or hold it on a pedestal, and it is through this jaded perspective that his reader begins to understand what war is really about.By the end of Catch-22, I had been run through a full gamut of emotions. I laughed at the irrational interrogation of Chaplain Tappman in Chapter 36, and I felt a sickness in the pit of my sickness as Yossarian witnessed poverty, death, and desperation wandering through The Eternal City in Chapter 39. Catch-22 is a thought-provoking, entertaining piece of literature, and its declaration as a modern-day classic is well-deserved to say the least."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is satirical novel which pokes fun at many different parts of our society. It manly criticizes capitalism, the army, and the chain of commands that it consists of. Some readers may dislike this anti-military tone. I liked this novel because Heller's original and repetitive style of writing was funny as well as influential, but by no means is it easy to read. A less competent reader may not enjoy the book as much because the underlining humor may not be understood. The plot and character development is choppy making it difficult to understand the story line. In order to enjoy the novel you must enjoy the humor because the plot itself is not interesting enough to cary you through the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In modern day, relatively few people read books which are written by contemporary authors, never mind authors from fifty years ago , but some books just stand out even to people who only have a minor knowledge of classic American literature. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one such novel. Set toward the end of World War II, the book follows a very vague plot line with a strange way of representing time but uses abundant, rich, and sometimes a little dark humor to weave an enthralling tale about the bombardier Yossarian and his struggle against reality, particularly the fact that he has to fly in a plane (with people whom he has never even met before shooting at him) just because he is told to.The book is well written and it draws you (the reader) in by really relating you to the myriad characters and their unique quirks. There is little historical accuracy in this book and some things are so wrong that its downright funny, for example Milo Minderbinder's mess hall syndicate (M&M;) which, run by a lowly mess officer, trades with countries and organizations all over the world (including Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia) turning a prophet using confusing tangles of twisted logic and the magic slogan \\"everyone has a share.\\" The humor is by far the book's most prominent strength but the writing is a close second. The astoundingly detailed and descriptive prose makes the funny parts all the more zany and the heavy, semi-depressing parts so vivid and powerful that they are extremely moving at times. This combined with Heller's sharp wit and snappy 50's slang make this book an immensely entertaining read and certainly an example of a great American novel of merit."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is my title: and I believe it. The greatest novel of all time.The reviews below will doubtlessly get further into the more complicated issues--the themes, the meaning of certain characters, the fractured chronology--but the fact remains that this will be, for a great number of people, the most profound work they ever read.Catch-22 is a riot from start to finish. There are plenty of hilarious books, but few that will make you laugh as often or as embarrassingly loud as this one. The book, however, is not just about comedy--that's just another level on top of the heartfelt sadness that consumes the book's greatest heroes (Yossarian and Dunbar). The true meaning lies somewhere between the moral decisions of every character of the book--Yossarian's decision to live through the war or die trying; Dunbar's decision to spare all innocents at all costs; Col. Cathcart's decision to win the war at all costs; Doc Daneeka's decision to complain about the war while doing nothing to counter the immoral acts taking place all around him.It's a book for rebels; fine. It's an anti-government book, anti-war book; fine. It's hysterical, depressing, life-affirming, epic, fascinating, and, at a basic, human level, true. Fine.The fact remains: Catch-22 has more to offer than any book I have ever read. Try the first chapter and you'll know it's for you; it's the fastest 463 pages you'll ever read; the world's greatest combination of comedy and tragedy in one work.I can only gush so long. Just read the ... thing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Several reviews on this page, even the ones that label this masterpiece as a 5-star novel, fail to accurately grasp the book's significance on a moralistic level. True, it can be said that it is an anti-war statement, but that is a shallow interpretation at best. It questions the establishment of course, but in a sense so do all novels. Its comedy is tremendous, but again, Catch-22 goes far deeper.Catch-22 is perhaps the greatest novel of our time because it explores humanity from a perspective and depth of insight never before seen. The significance of man in the modern world, the ironic yet inexplicably logical meanderings of man's mind, the wittiness, insecurity, hope, despair, failure, and, above all, the ultimate triumph that humanity possesses is utterly represented.This novel has never failed to make me laugh, cry, despair, and ultimately to appreciate life. Humanity is something to cherish, and Heller's Yossarian is the tangible embodiment of that ideal."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Can a writer create a classic work based on insanity? Can the way in which war is conducted be considered insane? Can insanity be fun? If you dare say yes to these questions, then you'll enjoy this classic novel, seemingly written from the inside out.Writers often find the notion of flashback difficult, and if anything, Joseph L. Heller has endeared himself to us all by teaching us how to turn that dilemma into part and parcel in this masterpiece that is the Catch 22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"the writing in this book is very well done. it is very funny and i can see the influnce that it has had on comdey from monty python to the simpsons. still for some reason i had troubles finnishing it. i think it was the story that failed to capture my imagination. the author dives into the insanities of mans dual nature with a clever use of the english language manipulating the mind through masterful sentences. very well done."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Imagine M*A*S*H meets Monty Python meets Alice In Wonderland... this is as close to the mood of the story as I can get.

What was even more wonderful was that such a humorous book carried such a powerful and harsh critique of war and our convaluted 20th century society.

Also, I was intrigued how a book's title could gain such significance with its concept becoming such a common term.The story is a tangled web of nonlinear narrative, unrelentingly logic looping, mental instability, military ineptitude, and satire. It took some time to completely embrace, but about half way through I found myself really gaining emotional attachment to the character ensemble and finally an admirer of the work as a whole. Now I can understand why this subversive work has lasted 40 years as a great American novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Like the imfamous catch itself, Stephen Heller's masterpiece is \\"beautiful in the intricate simplicty of it moving parts.\\" What is most fascinating about the story is the way in which the complex writing style reflects the round-about logic of Catch-22 and both combine to bring forth Heller's bitter attack on bureacracy and the absurdity of it all.The novel itself will make your head spin. It does not neccesarily occur in chronoligcal order, but rather events are revealed to you when Heller deems it fit to present their importance. Reading the first chapters will leave you with more questions than any true understanding of the plot, and going back an re-reading won't help you. Rather, by pressing on with a mingled feeling of hatred and love for the confusion, the reader will, through Heller's round-about writing style, learn the answers to his or her many questions. This level of complexity, while muddling the plot, add depth to the books over-all message in a way that few novels ever achieve.I highly reccomend this book to the thoughtful, patient and curious reader, but with the warning that it is not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Its about how one sees humour in destruction, endless moronity and loss of lives. Amazingly dealt with Heller talks about Catch 22 situation in all endless loops. All characters have an element of humour and suddenly you find that they are all in danger of loss of life.Major Major meets people only when he is not in his office, he asks people to wait when he is in office and to let them in when he is out. Lots of confusion and lots of fun especially with ladies. Use of language and the manner in which humour is introduced in serious situations is commendable.It shows that World War II was fought in confusion and the meaningless fight was made more meaningless by the leaders who themselves didn't know why they were fighting. In the process many lives were lost.I remember Orr's putting apples in cheeks as another humorous incident. Why the whore was hitting him when he was laughing was funny too. Heller has introduced characters and made them alive. Nobody can make one laugh in the face of death as best as Heller.It ends like a movie when the Hero Yossarian has run away to Rome to save his life and every thing is left to your imagination."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I do not know how I avoided Catch-22 during high school and college, but I'm glad I waited no longer. Catch-22 is the classic war satire and while some aspects of it are a little dated, it still rings very true in the contemporary political climate. Heller's characters are all quirky, intense and unique, but their conversations and actions really penetrate the absurdity of war and are very entertaining. I personally think the larger goals of World War II were noble and worthy, but when the impact of the war on those people who were actually fighting it are examined through Heller's off-kilter viewpoint, it becomes clear that there are tremendous costs and failings when trying to achieve those goals. This is a wonderfully amusing book and for people who are interested in more than a laugh, it also has an important message. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read it before."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"My name is Kayleigh Gunnoud, and I am a senior at Mercy High School, CT. Catch 22, by Joseph Heller is a novel which makes a strong statement about the effects of war. While there are many novels which address this topic, this novel is unique in that it comedy and sarcasm. These methods help show the overall madness and lunacy of war, and truly make the reader rethink their opinions on war.The main character in the novel is Captain Yossarian. Yossarian's view on the war change after seeing the death of his friends and after Colonel Catchart's continuous raising of the number of missions the men need to fly. Yossarian finds himself unable to leave because of a mysterious law, Catch 22. Yossarian becomes an extremely defiant of the military authority.This novel reveals another side of war. While people are very quick to think about the glory of war, Catch 22 introduces you to the many soldiers in the war and gradually shows you their demise and death. After developing a relationship with these quirky characters throughout the novel, one fails to see any glory provided to them after their death.I would recommend Catch 22 to anyone. The comedy in certain passages is literary genius. It is a very dynamic novel, with many unique characters and scenes one will never forget."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a story set during World War II. A significant choice for what is, ostensibly, an anti-war satire, since that particular war was a universally popular one butressed by high moral motivations. But that is the point, for Catch 22 is not simply a lampoon of war, but a searing indictment of man's spiritual crisis in the modern world.On all fronts, the main character, Yossarian, is assailed by the dehumanized absurdities of mondern life, manifested most concretely in that perfected science of death, modern warfare. Yossarian, like all of us, is chained by rationality that has been stripped of reason, engineered thus for the purpose of control. That is the essence of Catch 22.The character of Milo Minderbinder represents the cold, opportunistic thinking of the corporate world, dead as it is to humanistic concerns in its tireless pursuit of profit and power. Chaplain Tappman embodies the impotence and self-doubt common to many people of faith who feel adrift in a culture of materialisticly driven insanity. But it is Yossarian's wanderings through Rome, the Eternal City, and as such, the representation of modern &quot;civilized&quot; society, that is the coup de grace. It is a moonlit, poetic scene lamenting the spiritual and humanistic decay and ultimate bankruptcy of modern Western society. Simply powerful stuff.Properly speaking, Catch 22 is more a series of vignettes or short stories rather than a novel. But it is told with a humor that bristles with moral outrage. While not perfect, it is an excellent read, and definitely recommened."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This was the most humorous book I've read recently! Very entertaining from beginning to end! It is about a World War II bombardier, Captain Yossarian, who desparately wants to be sent home but he is caught in the military's Catch-22. Catch-22 states that one can only be excused from flying missions on the grounds of insanity; one must request to be excused; one who requests to be excused is presumably in fear of his life, thus proof of his sanity so therefore he must continue to fly; one who is insane would not make the request and would continue to fly the missions despite the fact that he would be excused from them if he were to ask. The typical no-win situation. There are many characters presented in this book, adding to the confusion and enhancing the hilarity. The plot...well, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot but once the reader becomes caught up in the circular logic of the military, the plot doesn't seem important anyway. There are grisly moments of realism interspersed with the absurb humor. The time-line of the story is not chronological, but somehow it all makes sense. Throughout the book, I found myself cheering for Yossarian and his efforts, hoping that in all the confusion he would come out a winner in the end. If you enjoyed the T.V. series M*A*S*H, then you're sure to love this book as the writers of the sitcom were inspired by Joseph Heller's amazingly bizarre tale."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"i found catch-22 to be well written, but i found the humour very bland and utterly repetitive, even though the main theme of the novel is Yossarian being cast around and around again in the circle of catch-22. the only reason why i am giving this four stars, it would be three without this, is because of why it makes so much sense for Orr's whore hitting him over the head with her shoe: she paid him."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have only existed for 22 years on this earth and some of that time as an illiterate and gurgling baby, but Catch-22 is easily the funniest book I've read...so far.

One moment I'd laugh at a character(Milo, Cathcart) and the next hate him. This book makes the reader laugh and laugh, but after its over its not funny, it is pure tragedy with some small satisfaction in the human spirit of Yossarian. This book should be read by all persons in the military worldwide and by all dictators as well."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have had this book for a long time, but I always chose to read something else. I think the war theme had always turned me off. However, this is a wonderful book. Many times while reading this book, I found myself cracking up, rereading the passage and then, cracking up again. I have to say that I really didn't like the story line that much and there were some chapters that I enjoyed much more than others, but having said that, on balance, the book was just really good. I would read the book again in a heartbeat! It's a really funny and clever book--and it's not really about war. The war just provides and interesting and dynamic setting that can support a variety of backdrops and situations.I can't give this book five stars, because I think I could like a book more.

In fact, it's so good, I've read it three times cover to cover, and countless times just a chapter at random.

So what if he took a chance? War is brutal and ugly, and equally crazy as well. For you who wonder about the plot, stand in a puddle and stick a fork in a wall socket.

The book follows the exploits of the group, and of one man in particular: a bomber named Yossarian. Yossarian goes against the grain, and tries valiantly throughout the novel to escape the inevitable Catch-22. All Yossarian wants to do is survive the war, but that seems impossible in the face of Catch-22. This novel is about his struggle against the system, his personal quest for survival in the face of a military that sees him only as part of the war effort.Several things--a colonel who's aspiring to be a general and keeps upping the required number of missions, a mess hall attendant who forms his own syndicate and sells supplies to the enemy to gain a profit, a major who disappears inside his trailer--combine to form the military unit to which Yossarian belongs, where \\"what's good for the syndicate is good for the country\\" and where men are endangered and their lives sacrificed for the ambitions of higher-ranking men aspiring to fortune and notoriety.This book would be depressing--horribly depressing--were it not so downright funny. The situations, the way the characters react and interact with each other, are absurd and hilarious. In fact, the attitudes of most of these men (commanders in particular) are downright ridiculous, and the book is not realistic in terms of the characters personalities (how many generals REALLY believe they can order someone to be shot whenever they want?). Still, the absurd nature of the book is what gives it such power. By giving his characters such outrageous ambitions and by creating such ridiculous situations for them, Heller makes his message painfully clear.This book is a modernist approach to war. The narrative is fragmented and roughly pieced together, and the satire is very prominent and in-your-face. In the end, Yossarian is faced with a choice: submit to the \`Catch,' or die trying to escape it. The irony of it all--submit to the Catch and be a hero (though morally dead) or try to escape it and be physically dead--is what makes Yossarian such a powerful character. This book is one of the greatest works of the 20th century for a reason--the impression it leaves is very lasting."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I started Catch-22 3 times in my life. 2 of the times ended halfway through because life just wouldn't have it. But finally i had the summer off and i decided, ok FIRST BOOK this summer will be Catch-22, i'm going to finish it if it kills me. And i finally did. It was absolutely amazing. I saw my own world changing after reading the novel for two weeks. The way i thought the way i talked, my views on what a coward and what a brave person is. It was really great.Joseph Heller is absolutely a genius. He created a world, much like our own with it's own hypocracies and jaded/curupt leading figures. And then there was Yossarian, I fell in love with him falling in love with every girl he laid eyes on. His amiable persona and his great questions and ideas and etc.Definately one of my favorite books now."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 was an extremely well-written novel taking place during World War II. The author, Joseph Heller, made full use of his extraordinary wit. The whole novel takes on a light view, looking into an American military camp in Italy. The story is superbly set up as a camp of foolish bombardiers headed by egotistical power- and glory-hungry generals.The story shifts from character to character, spending only a few pages on each. As the story progresses, previously introduced characters come in contact with each other, setting up the plot.Heller wrote the book ten years after the war was over, but he still was able to grasp the general ideas of a military camp. Heller realized though that his novel was going to be much too serious if he kept it completely factual, so he changed a few details, which altered the novel from being serious to funny.Although Heller changed the idea of a camp somewhat, he was still able to write an extremely funny novel. His wit provided an amusing storyline that no other book from World War II has, making Catch-22 truly one-of-a-kind."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a great book. In the beginning, the book starts great, though it seemed that some of the jokes were no that funny. Many of the characters were great and some of them were comparable. There were many hilarious scenes that I thought were great in the novel. Though at times, character's seemed very ignorant and immature. This novel is also great, for having an aspect of how many people that are in war have. There must be many individuals in war that might feel the way that Yossarian felt. Though this book is a comedy, Heller made a mixture of Comedy in the beginning and Tragedy in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Great book, great ideas, read it, but before you do know some things.First, remember that this book is &quot;Catch-22,&quot; not &quot;such and such at war&quot; or whatever. I read the first ten reviews an only one mentioned it. An C-22 is not the unexcapeable situation the dictionary would have you believe it is. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say know there are scences that better handle C-22 than the Doc's. It initially seemed to be about 1/2 dozen things that only shared a name in common but after a few reads it clicked.As others have pointed out, the novel is not cronological in order. This makes the novel difficult to understand, and that combined with the difficulty of understanding C-22 the idea brought my rating down to 4 stars."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In Catch-22, Joseph Heller uses a flashback structure and irony to make reader not only see how horrible war is, but Heller utilizes comedy to first make the reader laugh then have the reader be disgusted with what they were laughing at. Heller structures Catch-22 in a jumble of flashbacks of events and repetitions. Heller may first mention something very random at the beginning of the book, and make it seem like it's some joke. However, then later on in the novel he'll actually tell the situation behind the first mention of it, and it sickens the reader to learn what truly happened. For example, Yossarian, the main character in the book, has a \\"dead man\\" in his tent. At first this just seems to strengthen the opinion that Yossarian is insane. Heller repeats this use of the \\"dead man\\" all throughout the book until finally he tells the reader who the \\"dead man\\" really is. The \\"dead man\\" is a man named Mudd. Mudd transferred into the same squadron that Yossarian was in, but immediately went on a mission after he put his stuff in Yossarian's tent. He was killed on that mission, but his paperwork hadn't actually transferred him into the squadron. Therefore he was never actually in the squadron. That means his stuff still lies on one of the beds in Yossarian's tent, and no one can take it out because it's really not there. At first the reader may find the mention of the dead man to be humorous, but when the reader finds out the truth they feel disgusted with what they were laughing at. Another structural episode that is repeated numerous times throughout the book, deals with a man named Snowden. At first he is just mentioned, and once again this adds to the thought that Yossarian is insane. Then near the end of the book Heller tells the reader what really happened with Snowden. This graphic description of Snowden's death sickens the reader and once again enforces the purpose of the author to show how horrible war is. Irony also is very prevalent and purposeful in conveying Heller's message from the book. One instance shows how corrupt the management has become. The leaders of the squadron want them to go bomb a bridge to form a roadblock, or that is at least what they tell the men. The truth is they just want to get a nice picture of a \\"bomb pattern\\". They don't care that this will kill innocent civilians, all they want is their stupid \\"bomb pattern\\". It is ironic that the commanders don't uphold that decency of not killing people just for the fun of it when they should. They really don't care even if their own men die, just as long as they get some recognition. Another irony demonstrating how war twists things, happens through the chaplain. It says \\"the chaplain had sinned, and it was good\\". This is ironic because the chaplain is supposed to uphold some sort of righteousness even in trial, and now when he sins it is good. A paradox that also portrays how war really messes people up is the fact that Yossarian thinks that everyone is \\"trying to kill him\\". At first this statement seems ironic, but the more the reader gets into the book the more truth it has. Not only does the enemy try to shoot Yossarian down, but his own commanders are trying to kill him by making him fly more missions. Colonel Cathcart, the leading colonel of the squadron, keeps raising the number of missions therefore giving more chances to everyone else to kill him. In an indirect way the colonel tries to kill him, and according to Yossarian so is everyone else. War has made him paranoid, and it destroys any sort of faith in goodness or even any kind of truth. War has completely warped everything that he is. Heller's purpose is to show how terrible and twisted war can make a person."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book ALWAYS makes my Top 5 List"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"left me speechlesschanged the way we look at the worl"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"this is the best book I've ever read (even though I didn't finish it yet) It humor and style is just one of the kind.

So much of the points that the author made is true. It sort of forces you to look at life from a different perspective--very interesting point of view. I laughed out numerous times when reading the book. the authors way of thinking is just a breath of fresh air. IT'S THE BEST"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Although literate, accessible, and sometimes brilliantly written, the characters' lack of humanity blunt the force of Heller's satire. Ironic that a novel so beloved by the Sixties' generation contains no real individuals, just a batch of comically drawn stick figures cascading down an endless mudslide of absurdity.Yossarian is a bore. A hero in his own right for having flown so many dangerous missions, he runs away from heroism to become an epic-slacker and whiner. It could be said that this slacking and whining is how Yossarian's dread of flying missions manifests itself. But could an airman, a bombadier who has seen and inflicted and endured so much suffering really act as he does, even given the book's absurd context? While Catch-22's fans may see him as an anti-hero, I see him simply as an anti-human.The real disappointment for me, however, was that the book was not even sporadically funny. I've laughed out loud at the best of them--Twain, Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh--and nothing, not one single scene comes within puking distance of these masters. The mediocre Marx Brothers patter, the Keatonesque knockabout, and the ante-Stranglove absurdity are all recognizable and should amount to something--but they don't. It is like sitting through a four hour stand-up comedy routine where a skilled and ingenious performer does everything including painting his genitalia green and none of it adds up to funny. In this sense, Heller is a skillful and often ingenious storyteller, but he is not a particularly funny one.Okay, now that I've dumped on Heller and laid my curmudgeonly, sourpuss opinions out there for you all to see, is there somewhere else where you can read a funny book about WWII? Yes, most definitely: Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy. This book has everything working against its being funny: a dull central character (calling Guy Crouchback a hero would be a gross overstatement), a dreary, failed marriage, and lots of tedious training far from the heat of battle. But out of these unpromising situations, Waugh creates a story that is both uproarious and profoundly moving. Put his Apthorpe up against any of the martinet officers in Catch-22 and tell me who it is that makes you laugh the hardest. Yet, when Apthorpe dies unheroically in the second volume, I felt a sense of loss--something I never felt in Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I guess yu can say that I started this book with high expectations. From what I read and heard, this is considered to be a masterpiece. I began with the preface and all Heller does is praise his book and he goes on to tell us-the readers just how well the book did.I didn't like being confused more than half the time. I must admit Catch 22 had its moments where I laughed, but it doesn't make up for all the other chapters where I was left scratching my head. I did admire Heller's choice of descrition of his well illustrated characters, but I felt that all the story did was drone on."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is not perfectly written, but pretty damn close.It starts out hilarious and ends horrifying. The book is incredibly fictional, to the point of ridiculousness, but as they say, &quot;much truth is said in jest.&quot;It's not perfect: Heller's scene with Yossarian in the rain near the end was a bit overdone, and if he wanted to make it dramatic and impacting, he should have written it better, but all in all with the hilarity, the brilliant irony, and the anti-war effect it leaves you after you read it, it deserves an easy 5 stars."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a very thought provoking novel.

For those of you that have never run across this law it states, \\"If anything can go wrong, it will.\\" This book seems to embody this thought and nothing else. \\"Catch-22\\" is a long list of things that go wrong with little hope for meaning or plot. Why is this book popular? I believe that many people can relate to a person that is always faced with problems and is surrounded by strange people. When I was reading this book I was able to find one person (I stress the one) who truly enjoyed it. This single person happened to have been enlisted in the Army twice, both times being put up for Court Martial for their resistance to authority. While hearing this person's story I could tell how their similar situations could draw them to a book like this.

The two best ways of telling this are by the number of missions that must be completed before coming home and when there is someone, who died earlier in the novel, walking around. I would also like to add that there are not much war scenes (which is good for me, because I don't like war novels)."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book makes me feel like it's trying to trick me into thinking that pointless killing is a bad thing. It talks to me as if I am 100% convinced that pointless killing is actually a good wholesome thing, a proper thing for countries to do in their spare time.As a result, I feel like I have to constantly try to think of reasons why war is good. This makes me feel dirty. I don't like that.Yossarian isn't particularly likeable, although he does feel about as passionately against the idea of dying for one's country as I do. This makes me think that I am not particularly likeable either. I don't like that either.In fact, I didn't much like this book. Some of the sentences were really funny, but it didn't really make me think.

If Joseph Heller had only written one book, this one book would make him a great writer. The insane humor alternately makes you laugh and think.

My English teacher (to whom all credit is due) told us that the book follows a spiral-like chronology. If you look closely, Heller will come closer and closer to a certain incident in the book.

I encourage people who don't like this book to read deeper, and really contemplate what the characters represent."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Being a sophomore in high school, I didn't know what kind of treat I was in for when I picked up Catch-22. I was hooked after the first page. The witty paradox of Yossarian's situation and the realization that he represents all of us, really influenced me. John Yossarian's character really pulls the reader into the plot. I couldn't help but sympathize with him, yet there is something in his personality that offends the reader as well. He is crude at times, but it is so close to the way things were during that time, that you forgive him, and learn to love this character.

It amazes me that this book could have even been WRITTEN, it's so damn brilliant. Interweaving characters, timelines, and ideas, Heller makes everything perfectly clear to the reader, and then goes in and flushes it more for good measure. It's like he's trying to juggle as much as he can, and when he gets that far, he throws in several flaming chainsaws too. Everything is put up to the light for scrutinization, and finally, much like the Vonnegut statement, everything is revealed to be quite preposterous and ultimately, insane.

Yossarian may seem like a coward or trouble maker to some, but to me he is a personal hero. He knows that sometimes it takes a bigger man to refuse to fight. Yossarian could teach us all something.

Heller was truly touched by the hand of God when he wrote this"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The funniest book I can ever hope to read"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.\\" G. K Chesterton.*This book's one flaw is that it neglects a discussion of the concentration camps. But more on that later. . . .Catch-22 is classic absurdist literature, focusing on bureaucrat's circular reasoning and double-binds. Although the story set in WWII Italy, anyone who has had to deal with hierarchy and bureaucracy--be it the military, college, the DMV, or the Board of Deacons--will resonates with the ideas expressed herein.It is the American equivalent of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" In style, Heller is a mixture of Douglas Adams and Dave Berry. He has the same with and the same dead-eye for human foibles, and the cumulative effect of compound incompetence. This is not a \\"Greatest Generation\\"-type book.I found the first third of the book fresh, with the mixture of absurdist and repetitive humor, the stream of thought, and mid-sentence scene changes. Heller's style gives the book not so much a dreamlike feel, but more of a surrealistic flow to the events. It reminds me of the old classic \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\"However, the second third of the book was tedious. The novel humor deteriorated into a gimmick, and a series of stream-of-thought gags. The repetitive humor therefore became redundant. I got the point that things were weird, but the humor-mechanism was overused.The last third got interesting as Heller stopped focusing on absurdist gags, and began focusing on the narrative. This book has a large cast of charters, and it is a fitting tribute to Heller that he keeps track of the mob, and is able to keep us interested in their lives and in the situations.What surprised me the second-most was that this book is definitely a seed-source for M*A*S*H. The most famous moments such as Hawkeye streaking, or his mental breakdown all have their roots in this book. What is that quote about flattery?What surprised me the most was the hidden religious aspect. The book's opening lines are: \\"It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.\\" The chaplain serves as a pontiff, the unit's bridge between man and God. And Yossarian's relationship with the pontiff is one of love.Brilliantly, Heller drops the subject and goes on with the narrative. However the religious ideas keep cropping up. Chapter 18 has a discussion of God by two atheists. I think the statement by Lt. Scheisskopf's Wife on page 180 is a classic example of someone trying to have their cake and eat it, too. Chapter 25 is devoted to the Chaplain's doubts--which leased me to wonder why Heller wants the character to be this way. Then there is the ironically titled of Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City.\\" So religion is clearly a leitmotif, but it also serves as book-ends to the story.The story (and Heller's sequel), focuses on Yossarian's and Milo's relationship. Yossarian is the rebel and outsider--even outlaw--of the system, while Milo's assimilates and takes advantage of the system. But as the incident with Snowden and the missing morphine illustrates, the assimilation backfires.So it is the death of a comrade, the unnecessary death due to the war profiteering system, that forces Yossarian to have a change of heart, and reject the sub-word of the black market. This is the essential Christian message of the Atonement.This incident forces Yossarian to shift loyalties from Milo and the conniving Generals to the Chaplain. This is an odd realignment, considering that in Chapter 36, the Chaplain Christically suffers for Yossarian horseplay in signing the letters \\"Washington Irving.\\"Once again, we have these Christic moments is this grim and gritty tale of the Other Side of the Greatest Generation. This reminds me of what ex-atheist C. S. Lewis observed, \\"A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere--\`Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and stratagems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.\\" (Surprised by Joy).This brings us to the concentration camps. The book's conflict is Yossarian vs. the absurd situation, with the enemy being the omnipresent Catch-22. But Heller does not discuss the nature of Nazism, except for the brief banter in Chapter 42. This omission is the key--the danger of bureaucratism is infinitely smaller compared to the dangers of Nazism. Or Islamofascisms for that matter."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book based on a friend's recommendation that it was \\"the funniest book ever\\". Sorry to say that I can't agree with her. This is one of those books that does have some funny parts but that's it... these funny parts simply aren't delivered on a consistent basis. Despite this, I did think that Heller did deliver a powerful message about the sheer absurdity of war.

I am always interested when an author's work trancends it own era, there by being relevant at anytime in the future. However, this is not one of those. Aside from the obsurd and unbelievable situation Yosarrian is in, the book was, in a word....MONOTONOUS! It is not the amount of characters, nor the repetative back story of each character that Heller takes every opportunity tell us, but it is more the repetive, cliche' discussions that yossarian has with just about every character he come across. It goes like this, \\"Your crazy. No I am not. Maybe I am. Maybe you are too becuase you are here and you think I am crazy. Oh yeah, maybe I am crazy too, blah blah blah.\\" I really wish I would have spent the money on cookbook instead, or really anything other than this. If you can find this book at a garage sale, do not pay more than a quarter for it.But..If you like unbelievable war stories, long drawn out repetative character back stories, shallow dialog, and no real point, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Greatest book I ever read. After all these others no more that I can say. Makes me sick that some people didn't give it 5 stars"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch -22 seemed like it would be interesting and different. From reading the book jacket this looked like an interesting book and I looked forward to reading it. As I was reading it, I changed my mind; I thought that this was a terrible book.The book took place during WWII. The main character was Yossarian, who tried to run away from anything that he thought would turn into a problem. He never faced his fears or responsibilities. Whenever he did something that he thought was good something else happened and wound up causing something bad to happen. Damned if you do damned if you don't either way you don't win. So much so that the term \\"being in a Catch-22 situation\\" has become a part of everyday language.Snowden was a friend and inspiration for Yossarian. By the end of the book Yossarian had to choose between himself and others. Yossarian cared about this boy very much. Snowden's wartime death shocked him. He had always run away from the missions, he never dropped bombs, he just got the air hours on his record. He hated being in the army and wanted to leave, he did not want to die. Yet after his friend died he decided to help hid friends and run away.For most of the book Yossarian is a patient in a military hospital. All he does when he is there is pick on the staff and other patients. But when his friend Orr picks on Yossarian he gets mad, but never defends himself. He is afraid to die. When he is in the hospital he acts like everyone is out to kill him and thinks that all the people in the hospital are crazy.I think Yossarian was a capable person who got in his own way when he tried to do anything. He would run from his responsibilities instead of facing them. At the end of the book he proved to himself that he was running from his responsibilities and finally ran toward them. He faced his responsibilities by going to help his friends when he rejected an offer that he had been asking for because he didn't want to lie. Until then he had been a very selfish man and only wanted to save himself and his close friends in the process.I think that this book was too long and that it could have been better in less words. This book did not hit home with me as I thought it would."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I usually prefer the English classics (eg. Dickens, Austen, Brontes etc.),but thought due to a friend's recommendation that I would give this a go - it was well worth it. This book is unique, with its gently facetious humour and the darkness which becomes more and more prevelant as the novel moves on. A situation strikes you as hilariously funny in one part of the book, but later it is presented in a light which makes you feel incredibly guilty for laughing first time around. This book plays with your emotions on a grand scale."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller began work on Catch-22, the story of a US airman's attempts to survive the madness of the Second World War, shortly after returning from the conflict himself.The book - tells the story of Captain Joseph Yossarian, a member of a US bomber crew stationed on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa. Yossarian is convinced that the military is trying to get him killed, and that those around him are insane, and he spends the book trying to get out of flying any more seemingly suicidal missions.Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else, the newly promoted Major Major, who spends most of the war trying to hide from his men, and the profiteer Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder, a pure capitalist whose only ambition is to make money out of the war, and who ends up charging a commission on every military engagement.Using satire, black humour and seemingly undefeatable logic, the book argues that war is insane, that the military is insane, and that, quite probably, modern life itself is insane too.As Yossarian struggles against the self-serving bureaucracy at the heart of the military machine, Heller argues that the individual will always struggle against the vested interests that control the world. And, perhaps, that madness is an entirely relevant reaction to this.Yossarian's dilemma is summed up by &quot;Catch-22&quot; of the air force's code of practice, &quot;which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind&quot;. What this means, as the book's Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian of another flyer's situation, is that &quot;Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to&quot;. In other words, the only sane reaction to war is to recognise its madness. But in doing so, and proving his sanity, Yossarian makes himself eligible to fight. As Yossarian puts it: &quot;That's some catch, that Catch-22&quot;. The doctor, whose job is to save lives only so that they can be put in danger again, can only agree that &quot;it's the best there is&quot;."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a war book for people who love war, people who hate war, people who fear war, and people who don't particularly care about war. But most importantly, this is a book for people who have a sense of humor. Catch 22 is filled with ridiculous, unbelievable situations that make perfect sense. For example, a commander who wants to move up and therefore orders his men to fly more missions than are required - therein lies Catch 22 (or one version of it) - a man can leave because he finished his required missions, but he has to stay, otherwise he would be disobeying orders from a commanding officer. There is Milo, the self-perserving capitalist, Orr, who constantly crashes his plane, the Chaplain, who is afraid of everyone, and unsure about God, and many more. Basically, this book is about survival - living to tell the tale. And Yosseran does his best throughout the book. In his words, \\"he had decided to live forever or die in the attempt.\\" So far, he's doing well..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Many have tried, but Joseph Heller went ahead and wrote the Great American Novel, Catch-22. If you haven't read it, please consider putting down whatever you are reading and dive into Catch-22 instead.It's about war, sure, but more than that it's about how the mysterious thing we can Human Nature can make such a mess of things for us humans. Mr. Heller looks into the center of man and sees our fatal flaws and pours them out on page after page in an utterly hilarious way. No one has ever created so many memorable characters in a single book: Major Major Major Major, Colonel Cathcart, Milo Mindbender, and the center of this off-center universe, Captain Yossarian.Read it, you'll like it. And, if you do, I also recommend most of the works of Kurt Vonnegut and my own first novel, Fate (by Mary Jane). Have a nice day."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Absolute, unadulterated genius. The funniest book I've ever read, but also the darkest, the most horrifying, and the most enchanting.Nothing else to say, really, but after a couple of reads it becomes remarkably easy to follow, the jokes still work, your perception of certain characters changes, and it becomes BETTER.A cornerstone of my life.And Heller was actually IN World AWar II. He knows what he's talking about.(The chapter &quot;Snowden&quot; never ceases to give me chills. I gave this to a friend of mine who was way inot joining the Marines. Now it's his favorite, too, and he's not so sure. So the message works.)"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"My sentiments exactly - spoken by Dr. Stubbs of Yossarian, the prodigious, yet pugnacious protagonist. In a paradoxical world, where the supposedly sane commanding officers run the miltary through methodical madness, the \\"crazy\\" Yossarian is deemed so because he values self-preservation over death.The military brass in Catch-22 proves not only utterly pretentious, incomptetent, indolent, and inept, but incongruously insane themselves. General P.P. Peckem ostentatiously states, \\"My only fault\\", he pauses for effect,\\"is that I have no faults.\\" General Peckem is only one of the many well-developed laughable characters developed throughout Catch-22. The general pedestrian reader might say that this is solely another \\"anti-war\\" book. I think that would be shallow and inaccurate as Catch-22 is much, much more than that. To me, Catch-22 sparks many thoughts and feelings concerning individuality vs. the system(and the Syndicate) and the willingness of one person in a sea of conformity to have the balls to stand up for what is right regardless what the consequences may be."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"contemporary classic; timeless; hilarious.i first read this book almost twenty years ago, and laughed aloud then and at each subsequent reading.catch 22 is a permanent fixture in my library, a terrific timeless comedy with laugh aloud moments that are rare for literature.heller is a wonderful author, and this work will remain relevant for generations.in short . . . i love it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Last summer, I read this book somewhat reluctantly. I figured I should read more classic books like that for my own personal literacy level, not suspecting I would enjoy it overmuch. However, after about 10 pages, I was delighted to find that reading it was one of the better experiences of my sedentary life. Sure, it's long, but regretfully not long enough, for it is so glorious that I wish it would not end. And now I make it a tradition to re-read Catch 22 every summer (along with the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, which I also highly recommend).Joseph Heller brings us over 40 characters, each with distinctive attributes. The plot is jumpy, but for some reason, it works. Heller keeps what is usually a mundane subject exceptionally interesting, and truly proves that writing is an art. Read this. It's funny too."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller classic is very well written, it contains wittiness, funny situations, and other life threating ones. Written at the time of world war two and lived in Europe.The book is not always easy to follow, since it jumps from one thing to another, but that what makes it even better, and more interesting to continue reading.Yossarian, the main character is just something else. He tries in everyway to get out of the war, he spends a lot of time in the hospital pretending to be ill, he even pretends to be the son of another family who has been greatly injuired in the war...A classic to be read..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"We read \\"Catch-22\\" in our \\"alternative\\" high school back in the 60's. It was just as the Viet Nam War was rising to its shocking crest, people were rioting in the streets, the young were questioning everything and rebelling, the draft was taking older brothers and friends, and it was a very crazy time. We asked the teacher who selected the novel and who had served in World War II \\"Is this an accurate representation of the madness of war?\\" He replied that, in his experience, it was.After recently re-reading Heller's novel, I realized that this book wasn't, as we had studied it, just about the madness of war. Sure, that was foremost on our minds at the time the book was published. But Heller really caught the moral dilemma of an individual caught up in the mob hysteria of war, where the rules of civilization and laws are temporarily and deliberately suspended by the authorities.The key paragraph, for me, is: \\"Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.\\" In other words, Man is no more than meat and bone EXCEPT for a brief period when he is alive...and if he does something to preserve his soul. This is deep and perceptive.At the end of \\"Catch-22\\", Yossarian is faced with a tempting choice. He has, however, learned something from the horrors and insanity. His decision takes into account not only his personal safety, but goes beyond to the greater good. He has risen.For that reason, \\"Catch-22\\" is more than just an amusing novel, a bestseller and the novel that gave birth to M*A*SH*. Yossarian's moral dilemma is one each of us must ponder, whenever we choose to go to war. I think this is one of the best 100 American novels"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book this spring, and it is now one of my favorite novels. The language is challenging, but not flashy. The story is rich, full of wit, humor, loss, friendship, hope, and triumph. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a great book in my point of view. It isn't just a war book; it goes a lot deeper than that. It has a variety of themes and morals, it just matters how you choose to look at it. Yossarian, the main character, is serving with the Air Force near the Mediterranean. As the time progresses, he understands that war is going on and there are enemies out there who want to kill him. His main goal is to stay alive.The book shows how Yossarian takes the war personally and tells it to us from his view. The novel contains passion with which later comes hate. For those of you who are into history, the book will tell you the situation in Rome through Yossarian's eyes. In the book, Yossarian is a rebel who is going against the society's beliefs. He manages to avoid death by knowing what a precious thing life is. By the end of the book he succeeds in regaining the control of his life.If you have read or planning to read this book, I suggest to also pick up a novel \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" This book is staged in the future, but the main character undergoes some of the same dilemmas as Yossarian."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"After picking this book up and setting it down many times in the bookstore, I was finally prompted to read it for school this summer. What I got was a fantastic journey through the mind of seemingly the only sane person in a bunch of crazed narcicists. From the moment I picked up the book I was conpletely enthralled, and every word had me hanging. I have never felt the frustration of a character in a novel more than Heller's Yossarian. Every time he runs into Catch-22, I feel the tension rise. And Catch-22 applies to more than just the paradox itself. Every little thing in this novel contradicts itself and shines new light on our own world. Milo telling Yossarian that he should not risk his civil rights by exercising them made me wonder about our world today. Heller's novel has relevance in most situations and it is a must read for anyone and everyone, and it has been the most frustrating; but greatest book I have ever read. It is most certainly worth the time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"Catch 22\\" is a reknowned classic for good reason. The book takes you on a journey that borders on the insane into the world of a squadron of WW2 medium-level bombers. With a cast of interesting characters who each have some serious issues and choose some interesting ways to deal with them, this book takes you on a wild ride.The character dialogues are excellent, and convey much of the sense of impending insanity that seems to lurk just under the surface. Orr and his crab apples in his cheeks, (because they are better than horse chestnuts), is a good example of the mental instability that most characters seem to exhibit.The book is brilliantly written and it has a great flow to it. Different characters all add their own qualities to the mix, making for a combination of personalities that will leave you laughing in distrubed nervousness. Darkly comic, this book is a laugh and a deserved classic that is sure to endure for generations to come."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of the best war-time novels that exists. Not only does it contain the type of comedy that can only come out of ridiculous army regulations and stereotypes but it contains a message thats important for all of us to address. It brings up the point that war has no point. We kill eachother for no reason and this book is about a man stuck in the middle. Yossarian is the kind of man we can look up to, he understands whats going on in the world and how he cannot do anything but run for his life. Although the movie was better, because of the explosions, this book was very entertaining and the characters and plot of the book are well rounded."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Some people judge satire on how funny it is. This is unquestionably one of the funniest books you will ever find. However, what makes this a classic, for me, is the force and power of its insights. It is powerful because it is true. It is not afraid to speak the truth. Catch 22 sustains a high level of devastating truth page after page. In this it is greater than any other modern novel I've read. In future generations, as long as there are people who are able to read and understand, this book will stand with Jonathan Swift, Rabelais, and Cervantes as one of the greatest satires. I'm not saying it is their equal, but it is definitely in their class. One last observation for those who know, or who want to know -- \\"T.S. Eliot\\"."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of those rare novels that remain will remain significant long after the time about which it was written passes.

But more importantly Joseph Heller explores the nature of human survival, morality, and patriotism in ways that few other authors have even attempted"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I just read some of the reviews which give this book only one star, and it amazes me how people can give up on a story just because its not structured like a normal story, and it dares critcize war and the military. Most people complain that the story had too many characters and no order. That's the point of the book. The point was to give the reader a story so adsurd and crazy that in reading it you gain insight into what it may have been like to be serving in the military in WWII or any war for that matter. I have never served for my country and respect all the soliders present and past who have fought either for America or against it. Stories like this and Slaughter House 5 really represent how pointless and absurd war really is. One reviewer said this book was \\"replete with needless descriptions, and depraved immortality.\\" Funny, I always that war was the best example of depraved immortality."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"At first I was skeptical. After hearing mixed reviews on the book, I wasn't sure if I could weather 450+ pages of nonsense. But I found the book to be a literary adventure, and a mentally stimulating experience. At one point, I found myself feeling almost as delirious as the characters in the book, only to realize that I may be the only one with my head screwed on properly. The book opens a gateway into the mind of humans as we strive to survive in this world of unexpected outcomes. And as you will see, Yossarian lives."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 was written by Joseph Heller. The book was excellent. It was a novel that showed the bad side of war. It starts out with the protagonist of the story Yossarian, in World War 2. Yossarian may be fighting in the war but he disagrees with it all the way. He tries to get out of the army anyway he can. He first tries to fake sick, but then that fails. He then tries to change the bombing map but that only worked for a little time. All of these things just delay his bomb runs. He later finds out that one of the officiers has raised the number of bomb runs so he runs back to the hospital again. Thats why the book is so great. He tries so hard to get out of the army. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who likes war stories, or just wants a great book to read."},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Canongate (Waverley Novels)","review":"This edition of Chronicles of the Canongate is scholarly enough to allow students of Scott's work, or Scotish Literature, to develop new insights to the work itself and to the contexts surrounding it's production in relation to Scott's own situation when writing it. At the same time, it is made accessible to the general reader through well researched textual notes, including translations of the Latin phrases peppered throughout the text, and a glossary of unfamiliar (most usually Gaelic or Scotish) words and phrases, allowing for an informed--and consequently more enjoyable, reading. I was directed to this edition of the \\"Chronicles\\" through a conference paper, recently presented at the MLA (2004) Conference in Philadelphia, concerning the story \\"The Two Drovers\\"--one of the better known stories in the \\"Chronicles\\". I am not disappointed in that recommendation. And I highly recommend this volume, in turn. The text, as a whole, presents a marvellous opportunity for readers to \\"experience\\" Scott through relatively short works, before taking on one of his larger (in terms of scope), longer novels."},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Canongate (Waverley Novels)","review":"Chronicles of the Canongate is a short masterpiece by Sir Walter Scott. The book is set within a framing device in which a fictional narrator Mr. Chrystal Croftangry relates three stories of Scottish life in the eighteenth century. Scotland and England were united in 1707 to become Great Britain. Scott's fiction helped the two countries understand one another's people and customs. He is the grandfather of historical fiction.Chrystal Croftangry is retired and living in Edinburgh. The well to do Croftangry decided to become a writer of fiction. Through his friendship with Mrs. Baliol and others he learns stories of Scottish life conducive to his efforts in fiction.The Highland Widow is set in the years following the failed uprising of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the final defeat of the Highland Clans at the battle of Culloden in 1746. Widow MacTavish lost her husband to English soldiery bullets during this bloody time in Scottish history. Her son Hamish joins the British Army being recruited to fight in America during the French and Indian War of 1755-1763. Mrs. Mactavish persuades Hamish, on leave from the army, to desert. When British troops arrive to arrest him for being AWOL he shoots an officer. Hamish is executed. The strange Mrs. Mactavish lives a solemn, lonely and angry life in the highlands. Scott had the ability to etch memorable characters: you will not forget this tragic tale.The Two Drovers deals with the Scot Robin and his English friend Wakefield who are cattle drovers. Over 1000,000 cattle were driven each year from Scottish farms to markets in the north of England. On one of their droving trips Robin and Wakefield argue over the right of their cattle to graze on rented land. Robin kills Wakefield and is executed by an English court. The story shows the revenge motif in clan life put into action when Robin kills his quondom friend. This is a tragic tale which is the shortest of the three in the Chronicles of the Canongate (the Canongate is a major Edinburgh thoroughfare).The longest tale in this collection is The Surgeon's Daughter. It deals with a love triangle. Surgeon Grey's daughter Menie is loved by two medical apprentices. The first lover is Richard Middlemas (he was adopted by the doctor and named for Middlemas the Scottish village where the story begins). His rival for Menie is Albert Hartley. Middlemas is evil while Hartley is a good hearted soul.The trio of young people emigrate to India. This story is one of the earliest set by a British author in India the exotic land which became the jewel in the British crown. Tragedy and death ensue among the characters as Scott delves into native Indian politics and intrigue.The Penguin Edition is based on the Edinburgh Edition of all of Scott's novels. Over 100 densely printed pages explain literary and historical references made in the text. An extensive glossary of Scottish words is included in addition to an incisive introduction to the work.Sir Walter Scott is difficult to read. His language is elaborately ornate and the Scottish dialect makes reading hard for 21st century American eyes. I am a fan of Scott, however, for with all his literary failings the man could tell a good story peopled with memorable and colorful characters."},{"Title":"Excursions into mathematics","review":"Now fully updated and expanded, this New Millennium edition of Excursions Into Mathematics takes the reader on short &quot;excursions&quot; into several specific disciplines in the field of mathematics and explains mathematical concepts in such an easy, &quot;user friendly&quot; manner as to make them interesting and accessible to the non-specialist general reader.

His reading is very pleasant to listen to."},{"Title":"Latecomers","review":"When i read Hotel du Lac, by the same author, i dubbed the novel 'Hotel du Lack', because i found it to be short on redeeming qualities. This book, on the other hand, is very satisfying.The two main characters, Hartmann and Fibich, are children in Nazi Germany when they are smuggled to England. They both arrive at a boarding school, where they endure not just the regular hardships expected in any boarding school situation, but the stigma of being German in post-WWII England. Having no one to turn but each other for support, they form a bond stronger than if they were brothers.Their personalities are completely opposite. Hartmann does not care to reminisce about the past, and is very successful at banning any negative or depressing memory. Even the woman he chooses to marry is a perfect example of vacuity.Fibich, on the other hand, is tormented by a past he cannot exactly put together, and toys with the constant idea of a trip to Berlin, to find his roots. At the same time, he is terrified of the future, and cannot seem to enjoy anything. His wife is melancholy personified.The book relates the two men's beginnings, their youth, and in summary the development of their 50-year friendship. This is not an action-packed novel, and in fact there is very little dialog, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking for a dynamic novel. However, this is a very touching portray of a friendship, where wedding vows were not uttered, but were practiced."},{"Title":"Puppy Care & Training: Your Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This is a nice little book for new puppy owners.

My roommate wanted to learn ASP 3.0 for a few projects he had lined up. He purchased this book and became more and more confused as the days went by. I reviewed each subject matter at hand and found numerous flaws inside of nearly every page.For example: Page 71, states that the ASP page will return certain values from the Request.Form method call. The \\"visual\\" aspect of this page is completely wrong. The extension on which the page is presented (in the address bar) explicity says \\"index.html\\". Someone please tell me how the hell a beginner is suppossed to understand how an HTML file PARSES ASP? Thats right, IT DOESNT.This is one of many mistakes throughout the book.Save yourself the 25 bucks and the associated headaches and go get a six pack of beer and watch a bug zapper. YOu'll probably learn more than this book can teach you. (Actually go to www.w3schools.com) and look at ASP.

I am a web professional, and I was looking for a book that would help me get up to speed quickly with ASPs. By following the examples, I was able to complete basic tasks, including retrieving data from forms, reading files, and accessing databases. It is clearly organized, and it was easy for me to skip around to the topics that interested me.The main drawback of this book for me is that I will probably need another book to help me with more advanced topics. Also, it tends to rely on the examples to teach the reader so if you're looking for a more general explanation of ASP objects and architecture, look elsewhere. Finally, the first 100 pages were a waste for me because I was already familiar with Visual Basic and HTML. The book could also use a larger reference section. Still, I give the book 4 stars because for the target audience of beginning ASP designers I think it's an affordable, effective solution.In short, I would recommend this to a beginner who wants to learn the basics of ASPs quickly, and doesn't want to do much reading."},{"Title":"Active Server Pages 3.0: Your visual blueprint for developing interactive Web sites","review":"I recommend this book if you are new to ASP and web development. It is a great overview of ASP and its related topics. Each concept is illustrated with short example code, along with extra info about the concept. I found it very clearly written and easy to understand. This is a lot like a &quot;dummys&quot; book. This book assumes very little prior knowledge of programming or even things like HTML forms. It's a great introduction and reference for beginners.What this book won't give you is very much context. It will give you a lot of tools, but not tell you how to put them together into a real project. You will probably want to use this book as a supplement to a more in-depth book like Beginning Active Server Pages 3.0 by Wrox Publishers. These two books actually complement each other. Where the Wrox book gives tons of information, this book gives the main points with no extra fluff.I am new to web development, and I am not a very experienced programmer. I learned a lot from this book. It even includes how to set up your Windows 2000 web server and how to make an ActiveX component in Visual Basic. I found a lot of helpful tips (for example, did you know that pressing Ctrl while clicking the refresh button in IE will cause a 100% refresh?)

It is more likely to confuse a beginner than enlighten them.The first major flaw: No real 'big picture' of the topic is offered. The book consists of small superficial sections, one devoted to each element of ASP. The problem is that each element is not satisfactorally placed in a context.But worst of all is the books 'visual' approach, supposedly helpful.

The author (the author is a family business as a group) should have included... an introduction, yes, a pointer to other sources, well ok, but not a whole 1/3 of a book!I was shocked by the layout because it made me feel like a was back in middle school. Pages with &quot;blue print&quot; graphics in the corners and TWO screenshots per page in EVERY page! This was a little bit too much.I give it 4 starts because I think that regardless of how useful or not the book was for me, it would make a great intro book to someone who has done NO programming before, and wants to pick up ASP. You'll learn, yes you certainly will, this I guarantee. And because of that it is a GREAT value!You will not only learn about ASP but also about IIS, VBScript, SQL and DSN, all at a intro level, but done amazingly well, simple yet not superficial. Of course ADO and some old and new Components are introduced in a manner that is brief yet elegantly and clearly explained.If you are looking for more &quot;undocumented&quot; information and/or new features of ASP 3.0 and its applications, please look elsewhere.This book was very hard to &quot;judge&quot; since it is a great book from the beginners point of view and for such purpose the layout is perhaps appropriate, but it is deceiving as an ASP 3.0 book for which you must not fall if you've done ANY ASP in the past, even if it was a one pager!"},{"Title":"In His Own Write & A Spaniard in the Works","review":"I first read, or tried to read, &quot;In His Own Write&quot; when I was 14, at boarding school in England.

Lennon was trapped in the Beatles, a world he both loved and hated, and one of the ways to express his artistic flair outside of the music was to write books. His books were sharply satirical and humorous, exhibiting an understanding of the world as Lennon saw it. Lennon's writings were primarily influenced by Peter Sellers and the Goons (predecessors of Monty Python), and the stories are sadly hysterical, carrying the same rapier wit and deep universal insight that Lennon expressed a few years later on the lyrics of Sgt. Pepper and the White Album. These 2 volumes really give an insight into the mind of Lennon, the callous and cynical but deeply philosopical and genious-inspired works of a major, influential artist of the 1960's. Lennon wrote and played music in the top supergroup of the 1960's, appeared in films, created obscure artwork, made political and religious statements and wrote classic books. These are those books.

Because he focuses on tax complexity as a political phenomenom, the book is a highly useful addition to the tax literature, and is somewhat unique in its focus. Chapter 7, on the causes of tax complexity, is especially interesting reading. While the causes of tax complexity are well-known, Mr. Pollack does an excellent job of discussing the various causes and why these factors are so intractible. Also useful is his discussion of the tax reform criteria 'fairness' and 'vertical equity'. Pollack points out that these terms cannot be objectively defined- fairness and vertical equity are subjective concepts that continually add to the complexity of the tax code. By and large, the book maintains a dispassionate, impartial attitude toward the tax reform debate. The author adds a 'postscript' on the 'flat tax' that is, however, somewhat partisan, and, for that reason, disappointing. He rails against the 'fairness' of the flat tax, after the bulk of the book is devoted to emphasizing that 'fairness' is a subjective matter. He questions whether the flat tax would really be any simpler than the current income tax. The flat tax is a wage tax; how could it not be simpler? Finally, he notes that there would be significant transition issues to deal with in switching to a different system of collecting revenue. That's certainly correct, but hardly a compelling reason to stick with the current mess"},{"Title":"Student Handbook Including The Young Reader's Companion Volume 2","review":"The Young Reader's Companion provides a plot and reading level for important children's literature.

It's one of those volumes you might buy because the cover looks interesting or the synopsis on the jacket is intriguing -- but once you begin reading, you realise what a gem it is.The story, in brief, centers around 12 swords forged by the olympian god Vulcan to give to mankind for the amusement of the gods. He enlists the aid of a local townsperson (Jord) during their creation and in return gives one of the weapons to him. Jord is killed but his son, Mark, carries on thru a series of adventures revolving around one sword or another.The fascinating part of the book is the swords themselves. Each has a special power, and a special weakness. Each is totally different than any other. This first book touches on only a couple of the artifacts in any detail. Subsequent books tell the stories of the remaining swords.For a good read with a decent amount of adventure and a plot that twists and turns, this book is hard to beat.~P~"},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"On the surface, this appears to be just another fantasy novel - young boy given a magical sword, sets out to seek his fate, blah blah bibbity blah. However, we see depths here, hints of a mysterious past in the world (technology was banished 2000 years ago for a length of time of 49,949 years - what a strange number - does it mean something), tales of other magical swords - which are apparently true, as evil-doers start coming out of the woodwork left and right seeking the boy to steal his magical sword in order to gain its power for their own.While I would like to see deeper character development, or more details on the mysterious past (although, now I see while browsing through other available texts that the past is described in other books - what a pity, I'll have to buy more books, oh, woe is me ... *grins*), at the same time it would likely ruin Saberhagen's forward momentum to slow it down and do so.I think I've discovered a new author to add to my list of \\"favorites\\" and a new list of books (what a HUGE list it is, too!) to add to my \\"want to get these\\" list.

Hunting game for the family and doing household chores for his mom. He probably didn't expect that one day he would have to leave his house to start life anew. But what is the secret behind his father's sword called Townsaver. And what game are the gods talking about. Now the life around Mark is changing, perhaps faster than he would ever would want or expect.This book is a prime example of a fantasy novel. This book was a joy to read and easy to follow. When the story follows Mark excitement is sure to trail. But Fred Saberhagen kept changing point of view every chapter. The many mysteries are unraveled throughout the story, but once one is, a new one springs from it. This feature makes you never want to put the book down. Fred Saberhagen is great at portraying a medieval setting. But it is odd that when the book refers to the old world it seems like it's referring to modern time.I would recommend this book to anybody but anyone into fantasy will love this book. This is a great read I can't wait to finish."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"The Book of Swords series was one of the first series I read and is still one of my favorites, even after ten years and countless other literary adventures. Once you start this series, you'll find yourself living through the characters, first hoping they survive, then hoping they prosper. The Gods' role in the making of the swords, giving them to humanity, then, like a greedy child, wanting them back for themselves, imposes human qualities on them and makes their exsistance in that world much more believable while creating the background for the series. I found this to be one of the best tales of MAN VS. GODS I've ever read. Thanks Fred."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"I found this book to be a very interesting experience. It is in no way typical. One trait I found fascinating about the plot is that there is no knight in shining armor. The main character happens to be a boy. I guess, while this gives me a break from everyday form-fantasy, I did gape incredulously at his strong resolve. It just seems out of character, to me, to a young person. I have never seen a human that age with such a terrible purpose. But all-in-all this is a very believable, entertaining story line."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"This is a good beginning to this series - there were a few twists and turns that were enjoyable and overall, this is a good read for me - enough that I will continue the series at this point."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"The First Book of Swords is simple, but I loved it! Swords with special powers and kingdoms at war are not the most unique things in the world, but interesting characters, gods, and a fast paced plot push this book into greatness. I admit, the story was slow to start for me. The prologue was boring, and the main character walking around made me skip sections, but that was only a small part of the book, and I'm glad I stuck through it. I couldn't wait to find out what happens to the swords and the characters, and since it's only the first part of a trilogy I was even more happy. But, I have to say, I really expected more. If there were only a few more things this book would have been five stars. I would have liked to have seen more of the 12 magical swords, instead of just four. I thought there would be a big event with all of the swords coming together. I thought different people from around the world would come together in a big way, but that didn't happen. This novel also has a definite conclusion, and the second book does not pick up the plot at all. I really want to read about the people who own these swords and what they can do, instead I have to settle for a 200 page book revolving around a few characters making a trip. A few hundred more pages added to the end would have been nice instead of an unrelated second book. Oh well, this book by itself is fun, exciting, and entertaining, and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"I may have made a tactical error, beginning this first volume of a trilogy before I had the second and third volumes in hand and standing by. Saberhagen is an old-school writer, best known for his \\"Berserker\\" series (which was also the model for Star Trek's Borg). This is straight sword-and-sorcery, but not really in the classic, Tolkien-esque mold. Saberhagen has the knack of combining fancy and fact in a way that's foreign to \\"high fantasy.\\" It's 50,000 years in the future, after the end of our present technological age -- 2,000 years in the future even of Saberhagen's \\"Empire\\" series, upon which this present trilogy builds. And society is more or less medieval again. Barons and knights and dukes run things, with millers and blacksmiths and yeoman farmers occupying the lower rungs of society. But there's also sorcery and mythological beasts, the most powerful of which are dragons of many and diverse species. Most important, though, is the return of the gods -- or that's how they represent themselves, anyway. And the gods are engaged in playing a game (a motif Saberhagen often invokes). Young Mark is the focus of the narrative, the second son of a blacksmith who lost an arm to Vulcan while helping in the manufacture of twelve swords of power, each of them with a different profile or personality. The sword Mark's father was given in payment for his arm has come down to Mark, who now finds himself on the run from the forces of Duke Fraktin, who wants to obtain as many of the swords for himself as possible. He becomes involved with Nestor, an ex-knight turned dragon-hunter, who possesses another of the swords and is also of interest to the duke. Balancing the Bad Guys in this power struggle is Good Sir Andrew, a do-gooderish sort who also provides a bit of comic relief. Saberhagen's narrative style is straightforward and unadorned, letting the story tell itself, and it works. If you've read a lot of fantasy and semi-fantasy in its various forms, you'll be interested in seeing how he sets up the story within the real-world constraints he has set himself. I would have made some different choices, though. Vulcan, for instance, belongs to the Roman pantheon, but most of the society in this future world seems to be northern European in origin; I would have depicted the smith god as Wayland, for consistency. (But perhaps there are unmentioned reasons for all that, since parts of this novel are derived from earlier books and series I haven't read.) It's also strange to hear distances by wagon and the length of a sword blade described in metric measurements. But that's carping, and the story, which ends here with Mark in possession of two of the swords and escaping the destruction of Sir Andrew's castle, is well worth reading as he and his companions move off into the next stage of their adventure. Now if I can only find those other two volumes."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"AS BEST DAMN SERIES I HAVE EVER READ BUT DONT BUY THE INDIVIDUAL BOOKS OF THE FIRST SET BUY THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SWORDS.

Badly written, by what seems to be inexperienced people who not only to have had no previous work or any serious contact with Fantasy (not even to mention the specifics of the Forgotten Realms Campaign World), but writing books-ANY books- in general! Myself, a mystery enthusiast of Arthur Conan Doyle?s and Agatha Christie's work and a Fantasy/Dungeons and Dragons &quot;Fanatic&quot; have no alternative, but to write this negative review in an effort to warn the potential reader of what they are in for. Both these authors should at least have read a Forgotten Realms novel before attempting to write one, and what's more if they did not want to or did not have the ability to write this type of book, they should not even have attempt it. However, since they did, how and why were these books allowed to hit the printing press and then the stores? They discredit themselves (the authors), they discredit TSR, but most importantly they discredit the readers/fans of the Forgotten Realms, especially those who thought that combining Fantasy and Mystery would be a great idea, like myself. From the weak plot, to the bad writing, to the ridiculous choice of names for the characters, to the jokes that fall flat, to the great lack of knowledge regarding Toril, the books fail miserably!It is very unfortunate that the Murder Series came to an end before the writing of Murder in Ravens Bluff and WotC should reconsider their decision now that years have gone by and maybe resurrect the project, but considering the poor work included in these books I can at least understand why they did so back then. In conclusion, it is with great sadness that I only give two stars to these books since almost all the Forgotten Realms novels that have been written have been more than wonderful-what with RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc. The books could have been fantastic if the right people or the necessary care had been given during the writing of the stories. A shame really! My advice, read them only after you're done reading all the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material; at least you'll get a slight hint/taste of Faerun."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"Among Webster's many scholarly achievements in this meticulous and devastating examination of Freud's life and work, he exposes the extraordinary number of myths about Freud which abounded in the twentieth century. A minor one is that Einstein was a great admirer of Freud. This is erroneous. In a letter to one of his sons in the early 1930s Einstein wrote that he was unconverted by Freud's writings and believed his methods dubious - even fraudulent (cited in *The Private Lives of Albert Einstein*, by Roger Highfield and Paul Carter, p. 233)."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"Richard Webster has done a marvellous job to show how fraudulent Freud really was. More revealing is that all ideas about the human psyche are to be questioned hereafter: the existence of defense mechanisms, existence of the death wish, the existence of the Ego, Superconscience and Id. If you ask me: nothing of these speculative concepts are really true. Webster shows quite convincingly the case against the 'diagnosis' conversion-hysteria. Still accepted in modern psychiatry but a complete misnomer: intrapsychic energy to be converted in physical pain/disorders, how? The whole Freudian thinking is still present in movies, television soaps and more frightening in forensic psychiatry, the military, national intelligence agencies, police departments. Obviously the 'dark side of mankind' has an extremely attractive side to it. What is frightening and disturbing is the fact that this whole conceptual pseudo-thinking about the human psyche (originated with Freud) really is a religionlike belief system. Very difficult to replace and really hindering better therapies for people who are suffering emotionally. Richard Webster's book should be th&eacute; textbook in psychology en psychiatry courses to show two things: 1. how our ideas about the human psyche and emotional system is largely based on a pseudo-theory and therefore a better alternative model of emotions and cognitions should be sought (for example in scientifically driven cognitive behaviour therapy).2. how science really should work and should not work.The strange thing is that Webster's book, to my knowledge, is nowhere in the world, really a textbook in psychology or psychiatry courses. Freud is still taught as if he has done some marvellous things and if some of his ideas are still correct. This is the most unbelievable thing of it all. And really frightening."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"Well over six hundred pages long, and boasting an extensive bibliography, Why Freud Was Wrong is a book that might look impressive at first glance. Webster undoubtedly put much effort into researching it, and his list of sources at least is helpful. It is dreadful, however, and it's only because of minor redeeming aspects such as its usefulness as a guide to other recent criticisms of Freud that I give it two stars rather than only one.Much of Why Freud Was Wrong is given over to a preposterous and unscholarly argument that pretends to show that Freud is a \\"Judaeo-Christian\\" thinker, and that psychoanalysis is really a disguised version of \\"Judaeo-Christian\\" belief; it would be a wasted effort to show why his interpretation is mistaken, and the less said about it the better. It's more interesting, for what it reveals about Webster's style of argument, to examine his attempt to discredit Freud's concept of the unconscious. Strangely enough, one of his key sources here is Gilbert Ryle, a philosopher who, as he does not tell us, happened to have a rather positive view of Freud and psychoanalysis. Webster thinks highly of Ryle's The Concept of Mind, but glosses over the fact that it calls Freud \\"psychology's one man of genius\\" and seems to endorse the concept of the unconscious.Webster seems to consider his own work the next best thing after Ryle, but he appears to have used Ryle mainly as a model for his prose style; all too obviously he put more effort into trying to write like Ryle than he did into thinking through the problems involved with \\"the unconscious\\" as a concept. If you compare one of Ryle's sentences from The Concept of Mind (\\"A pain in my knee is a sensation that I mind having; so 'unnoticed pain' is an absurd expression, where 'unnoticed sensation' has no absurdity\\") to one of Webster's key assertions in his argument against the unconscious (\\"A memory is something you have remembered and it defies logic to characterise as a memory something whose salient characteristic is that it has actually been forgotten\\"), you will see just how closely Webster imitates Ryle's prose.Viewed as a logical argument, Webster's attempt to show that \\"unconscious memories\\" are a contradiction in terms (and thereby show that there's no such thing as the unconscious) is ridiculous. Words do not have fixed meanings, and the meaning of the word \\"memory\\" has no relevance to whether what have been called \\"unconscious memories\\" actually exist or not. Even if one were to suppose (absurdly) that the word \\"memory\\" must have a single meaning set in stone for all time, and that this meaning must be the one Webster insists on, all this would show is that \\"unconscious memories\\" need to be called something else; it certainly wouldn't demonstrate that they don't exist, as he goes on to imply.Stuart Hampshire once perceptively noted of Ryle's work that, \\"There are many passages in which the argument simply consists of a succession of epigrams, which do indeed effectively explode on impact, shattering conventional trains of thought, but which, like most epigrams, leave behind among the debris in the reader's mind a trail of timid doubts and qualifications.\\" Webster tries to argue in the same epigrammatic way as Ryle, but with disastrous results, since too many of his arguments (like those against the unconscious) do not withstand minimal critical examination. Their flimsiness is one of several telling signs that despite his references to philosophy, Webster has little grounding in the subject.He makes no reference to Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness, another classic book from the 1940s and one which, unlike The Concept of Mind, actually does criticize Freud and attempt to discredit the unconscious. One could be forgiven for thinking that Webster doesn't mention Sartre's critique of Freud because, were he were to acknowledge it, he would be forced to admit that the Freudian unconscious has already received a thorough philosophical critique, making his efforts quite unnecessary and beside the point (Sartre is implausibly dismissed in the introduction as another \\"Judaeo-Christian\\" thinker like Freud, despite his being strongly opposed to Freud in most ways). It's not only classics that are ignored; Webster also ignores recent work by John Searle that is directly relevant to the issues he is concerned with. Searle gave a much more careful and thoughtful critique of the Freudian unconscious in The Rediscovery of the Mind (1992).One book that does seem to have influenced Webster's thinking, although he does not mention it, is David Stannard's Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory (1980). Like Webster's later book, Stannard's tries to base its arguments on Ryle, ignores the fact that Ryle actually endorsed the unconscious, and makes no reference to Sartre. This unusual combination of features would suggest that Webster has used Stannard as a source without acknowledgement. One only wonders why Webster bothers to write a book against Freud when he can claim that Freudian notions run counter to \\"our own experience and any intuitive assessment of the mental life and character of small children.\\" If that were true (which it is not, since different people have different experiences and intuitive assessments of things), his book and many another like it would never have had to be written, since we'd all know that Freud was wrong and wouldn't need him to tell us so.(Addendum: for anyone wanting to look up the references in this review, Ryle's description of Freud as psychology's one man of genius can be found in chapter X of The Concept of Mind, his comments about pain in chapter VII, Webster's discussion of unconscious memories in chapter eleven of Why Freud Was Wrong, and his comments about \\"our own experience\\" in chapter fifteen)."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"Richard Webster exposes Sigmund Freud as a charlatan, the inventor of a pseudo-science that falsely claims to explain the human psyche and restore it to health. Freud's theories are not derived from empirical data, or even from Freud's clinical experience. Nor are they original with Freud, but are instead lifted, without attribution, from the general cultural ambiance, or from crackpots like Wilhelm Fleiss, who \\"cured\\" mental illness by cauterizing spots inside the nose. Webster builds on the writings of Frederick Crews (\\"Skeptical Engagements\\"), Adolf Grunbaum (\\"The Foundations of Psychoanalysis\\") and many others - to produce this devastating portrait of a man of titanic ambition and few scruples. At the height of his undeserved fame, Freud boasted that he was another Copernicus; but history is more likely to remember him as another L. Ron Hubbard.Freud's theory of repression - \\"the very cornerstone of psychoanalysis\\" - is a typical scam: Neurotic symptoms, says Freud, are generated by repressed memories of a \\"traumatic\\" sexual experience. Therapy locates the trauma and makes it conscious. Pent-up emotion is released. Presto!! - the symptoms disappear! So much for the hype. In reality, Freud doesn't derive his theory from the \\"confessions\\" of his patients, but from a clinical method that is self-confirming. Traumatic experiences are assumed and patients browbeaten until they agree with the therapist's assumptions. As for the alleged remedial powers of the Freudian method: Beginning with Anna O., whose case launched Freud's career as a faith-healer, cures have been claimed but never proven. After therapy, Anna wound up in a hospital displaying all the same symptoms she had to begin with. The placebo effect readily accounts for anyone who feels better after therapy. No, psychoanalysis is effective for one purpose only: extracting money from gullible neurotics.It is remarkable that this rather shoddy confidence trick lasted as long as it did. But on this planet, credulity has never been in short supply."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"At the back of the book, a reviewer is quoted: &quot;What a great demolition job!&quot; And it really is. It puts Freud and all of his theories right where they belong: On history's scrapyard. The seriousity of this book is evident to the reader, one does not doubt that Websters side of the Freud story reveals some long hidden truths. Webster shows that all of Freuds &quot;scientific findings&quot; were nothing else than the thoughts of a very small man who hated mankind, and hated children most of all. Unfortunately, Freud also had a natural authority that made others fear and respect him, and tragicly enough, also believe him. Had Freud lived today, he would have been bancrupt hundred times over from loosing lawsuits, and perhaps also would have been put away behind bars. What Freud has done to patients is really an outrage. Webster also writes that his book is just the beginning - he has opened a door to the biographical facts, where most people have hesitated to go in before him. Freud protected himself from all future critisism by raising the self-made shield: &quot;If you question Freuds truths, that proves that there's something psychologically very wrong with you&quot;. Now everyone can search without being brandmarked and stigmatized in this way. And as more people will start digging, the more we will see of the damage Freud did to his patients. And it will become more evident the damage he has done to the conception of Man for a whole century. After the demolition job is done, Webster concludes: Man is nothing even remotely what Freud has described us to be. And he follows up with the most important question of all: When we are nothing of what has been the dominating psychological view for hundred years - who and what and how are we then? And he encourages each and every one to join in the creating of a new and ultimately much more optimistic understanding of Man."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"This a damning biography of Freud, making him out to be not only incorrect, but also dishonest - a man who fabricated evidence and theories in order to become famous. It's a great read. This is my bias (and was before I read this book): I don't like Freud's stuff. I think it's absurd, unhelpful and particularly damaging to women. Furthermore, I have come across no evidence to support it. For this reason, reading a book bashing Freud did not in any way offend me. I enjoyed it. People who quite like Freud, however, might not like this book so much. Actually, there is not very much at all about Freud's theories and publications(except his very early stuff), it's more a summary of Freud's acts of dishonesty and faking of evidence, and a general description of an obnoxious character who somehow sucked in an entire generation.There's a broad description of the precursors to modern psychology at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, which I found fascinating and recommend to anybody interested in the history of psychology."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"On one side, Webster's book strikes for the detailed historical research, the extensive argumentation, and the apparently impressive deconstruction of Freudian \\"mythology\\", in this being rather apt to leave the occasional reader with the image of a thorough refutation of Psychoanalysis.But to any scientifically-inclined peruser, it fails to deliver but a sense of biased aggression.First Webster starts with a psychodynamically-inclining analysis of Freud's personality. It would be interesting to see why, in a book intended to attack Freud as a maker of ideas, it is Freud's ideas and their derivatives that are used to pursue this goal in a quite evident ad hominem attempt. But the author would surely reply that he is just resorting to that poetic psychology he accuses Freud to have plagiarized and distorted into a pseudoscientific endeavour, so perhaps this objection can be discounted. And besides, we are told that Freud's personality is relevant as a token of his tendency to falsify evidence and misreport clinical cases in name of his desires of self-aggrandizement.Any honest knower of psychoanalysis and its history can but admit that Freud had more than his own share of megalomania, and in a Kuhnian perspective we all know that scientific trends are matter of consensus and authority as much as of evidence, as Freud knew all too well. Yet in a sense the subjective faults of the Father of Psychoanalysis are just any researcher's faults, or Webster perhaps assumes that people publish out of charity, and not ambition? The field of psychology deals with complex phenomena, and as such, Freud's initial post-hoc rationalisations (the subject of all the book's criticism) are certainly less than scientific: it remains to be seen if they led in time to valuable insights or only, as Webster would imply, to the birth of a religious cult.A rather specific and surely reasonable attack on the nosographic construct \\"Hysteria\\" follows, intended to show how the foundations of Freud's speculations rested on shaky grounds. While it is certainly true that Hysteria is a mysterious entity, and that temporal lobe epilepsy is a more than reasonable alternative explanation, in this we already perceive a less-than-forward criticism. Pages are spent on the examination of Le Log's case, but it is only in the notes that we are told that Freud never saw Le Log, as Charcot treated him after the Austrian Physician had left Paris. This case, and the others Freud reported are certainly dubious. But Freud, later on, was trying to explain psychoneuroses in general, not hysteria per se, and again we are to see if what Freud deduced from his erroneous or limited knowledge of hysteria cannot be scientifically useful.And what Freud knew as psychoneuroses, exist even today as recognized pathologies, under the names of anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, etc. Columbus did, indeed, set out with the intent to reach Cathay, but this doesn't erase America from maps.On the other hand, Webster himself openly asserts that some cases of hysteria are observed even today (at page 84 for example), and doesn't provide any conclusive evidence to claim that all cases of hysteria are cases of temporal lobe epilepsy (a rather strong experimental claim that would be) and neither that the reasons for the reduction of the prevalence of this, supposed or real, pathological condition, are to be traced in its nonexistence: in a bio-psycho-social perspctive, several alternative explanations are possible, first and foremeost the disappearance of important, to date unidentified, risk factors.But there is in truth no reason to discuss the book's conclusions on hysteria as in reality, these do constitute only an attack to what is an outdated vision of the phenomenon Freud investigated. Again, what we should be evaluating are the results he derived on human psychology, not the existence of a nosographic category. It is well known that at times, correct conclusions can be reached based on wrong premises: the observations of early physicists are still valid today, even though ether and caloric have been proven to be misconsceptions.At times not remembering that investigations of the mind are not the domain of cultural studies alone, because the mind is a physical object after all, ie. the brain (or at least the informational state of that physical object), Webster proceeds in a trial to some of the most important figures of 19th century psychiatry and psychology, openly and unflinchingly distributing labels of \\"scientificity\\" and \\"unscientificity\\" based on their attitudes, as much as their theories and practices. Striking is in particular, the treatment of Fechner, whose fault is to have cultivated mystical and religious fancies (like Goethe, Jung, Newton, Pascal and many others before him). Webster apparently forgets that the basic law of perception if infact Weber-Fechner's law, named after that uncanny religious figure.Noticeable is also the insufficiently documented discussion of Freud's \\"Project for a Scientific Psychology\\". It would have been benefitted by a less than nonexistent knowledge, or at least mention, of the field of Consciousness studies, and of the related works of, to mention an earlier case, Karl Pribram and Merton Gill (Freud's Project Re-assessed, 1976), containing a less skeptical (or even at times truly enthusiastic) account of the intuitions present in that fundamental work.Webster's attack on the existence of Neurasthenia, is even more disheartening. We could discuss the cultural factors involved in psychopathology and the problems with any descriptive take on mental illness from DSM-IVTR to ICD-10, but I deem it irrelevant, as yet this argumentation fails to touch the insights of Freud, and to discuss their relevance.From these arguments to the quarrel with Jung onwards, what strikes is not the inadequacy of Webster's journalistic effort, but the implicit or explicit idea that this book can constitute a decisive settlement of the questions raised by psychoanalysis, a settlement provided not by a psychiatrist, psychologist or a neuroscientist, but by what is at times more or less an attempt at character-assassination by a well-read literary researcher.It is the unfortunate truth about life that people (even those who advance or seem to advance our understanding of reality) have plenty of faults. Freud, I suspect, was not exempt from this human characteristic. But if Webster rightly discusses the inappropriate hero myth which surrounded his figure, we can but ask ourselves why he would expect a simple man to be a hero if he has to advance science. Is he not making the same mistake he reproaches to so many (including Thomas Mann and the whole 20th century culture): isn't he looking for perfection in human beings, and, instead of hallucinating its presence, taking its obvious absence as a justification to reject scientific theses?Why shouldn't we instead read a book on the neuroscientific, epistemological and psychiatric arguments to reject, or to accept, Freud's conclusions? Grunbaum's \\"the Foundations of Psychoanalysis\\" remains, for the skeptic,a much better choice, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"One of the curious elements of my college career as a psych major was that I never studied Freud. Hardly a mention of the old boy, except that \\"our hero,\\" Caro Jung, had a famous falling out with him. \\"Why Freud Was Wrong\\" helps me to understand why he was left out of the curriculum.Author Richard Webster lays out the facts about Freud's own messiah complex, and his puppy-like need to idolize certain other scientists including Charcot, Breuner and Fleiss. Freud's need to make a huge splash in the world of science nearly cost him his reputation. Based on grossly distorted evidence, he pushed cocaine as a harmless wonder drug, even as it was laying waste to a good friend. Freud's appropriation of ideas from others - the hypothesis of infant sexuality, and the traumatic root of \\"hysteria\\" - are diligently explored. Most damning of all, Webster quotes from Freud's letters to his mentor Fleiss to show that none of the 18 patients for whom Freud had implied a cure had actually improved under Freud's care. Webster describes how Freud's acolytes and biographers have systematically expunged their telling of these failing and foibles in order to present the man as an original thinker and great healer. Webster makes it clear that in spite of the attention it received from some very mart people, Freud's creation is a pseudoscience, a seemingly connected flight of fancy that is practically immune to criticism and correction. Moreover, psychoanalysis has more than a few elements of a religious cult, with Freud as its willing Messiah and \\"perverted\\" sexuality as its sin.The book is a slow read due to Webster's ponderous writing style. Yet I found it fascinating nonetheless. I would skip the last chapters, Webster's musings, which I found dull and incomprehensible. Suggested highly for those who wish to understand the origins of psychoanalysis and the way that personality can trump reason."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"I found this to be a revelatory book. It examines the intellectual context in which Freud's ideas were formulated. Some of these ideas we now know are unequivically wrong. Freud, not having the luxury of 20/20 hindsight, incorporated these ideas into his theories. Certain personality traits Freud possessed would allowed him to backtrack in certain cases to achieve the fame he desired and to tolerate no disagreement once his position of importance was firmly extablished. I found Webster's explanations of the ideas of the age to be clear and well documented. It is important to be reminded that new ideas are a product of one's historical and cultural context. They do not appear out nowhere. It is something we all need to remember in making sense of the past as well as the present. In one of the concluding chapters, Webster makes a most eloquent case for the necessity of art and artmaking in a materialist/scientific age. Freud, was an advocate of the Cartesian ideas so integral to the development of this age which now remains dominant. Art is a counter to the potentially dehumanizing aspects of this scientific materialism."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"One looks back on the Freudian age with as much wonder at its flourishing as its sudden demise. The confusions of psychoanalytic thinking and the poor foundations on which it was laid were always concealed in the humanistic insights that gave the theory appeal and seeming cogency in the reign of positivism. This brilliant disguise behind an incoherent metapsychology hides a theory that was a casualty of the impossible demands placed on a science of psychology by the demands of reductionist science. Finally, in the account of Webster, we see the fatal account of the details of record in Freud's early research whose great success seems more a brilliant feat of paradigm promotion than of any breakthrough in science. The oddity of Freud's thinking is and remains a mystery in itself. The legacy of the invisible strain of Schopenhauer botched is seldom seen here, and the source of confusion over the 'unconscious' can be instantly clarified by seeing this positivist nosedive of the earlier 'right sense of the noumenal self' and its unknowability. Perhaps this was the poignant ambition of the scientist triumphant here, where defeat was foreordained by the philosopher.This book reads as a relief to anyone who survived the onslaught of this charming muddle with its impossible financial demands placed on the curse of being neurotic, even as one senses we have not heard the last of Freud. One might fault the conclusion where sociobiology is seen to come to the rescue with still another confusion of the basic issues in still another ambitious science whose fate will be another book like this one. But anyone who suffered the arm-twisting pretensions of this reign in thought will find a swift exit from the mesmerizing contradictions of Freud's theories. And yet a legacy of Freud remains as soon as the mind is freed to reconsider the issues from scratch without the fixation on certainty in the basic tenets. But for the moment it is important to simply a necessity to be free from the false claims and demands of what was an impostor theory, hard as it is to make that statement of one of the most enigmatic minds of the twentieth century. This book can be very helpful in simply moving on without looking back."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"This is a curiously psychoanalytic review for an author who thinks psychoanalysis is just about the greatest &quot;con&quot; of the 20th Century.

On this view, which contradicts numerous other criticisms offered by the Freud bashers, the first psychoanalyst is a reductionist, a materialist, a determinist, or whatever terms that people throw around nowadays. Before we consider this view, it is worth pointing out one apparent contradiction, which I mentioned, at least to those who are not quite familiar with all this controversy. It is this: another major strand of Freud bashing, increasingly popular in recent years, indeed made popular by some of those who enthusiastically endorsed this book, is to denounce Freud as a pseudoscientist, a myth maker concerned with overinterpretation of elusive &quot;meanings&quot;, which ought not, and cannot, be part of the scientific enterprise. Freud, according to these critics, ignore the material/biological basis, emphasizing instead the stories told by his patients, thus impeding real process in psychiatry for many years. Those who defend Freud, therefore, can only be literary people, the humanities professors, etc..(which turned out to be the case). Now I hope the contradiction has been made apparent. But perhaps there is no contradiction: It is certainly possible that Freud is guilty of both. That is, he can be a simple materialist, a prime example of the dehumanizing evils of modern science, AND a mythmaker with no concern with science at all. Now the arguments of Webster and of the last reviewer. Clearly to dismiss such a criticism is impossible without some understanding of modern science, of its relationship with art, and of its role in our culture. Is science inherently dehumanizing? Or is it some tendencies in modern science which merit such a criticism? And what exactly is Freud's contribution, if any, to our understanding of science? Does he suggest a critical perspective on this matter; or is it merely thinking with the group, blindly following his positivist predecessors such as Meynert and Helmholtz? These are important questions, and good answers are still lacking. A critical examination of the matter is certainly more needed than throwing around words like reductionist and preaching the need for artmaking. Jung said precisely these things, while praising the leadership of Hitler. And one final note: perhaps the reviewer below should also learn something of Freud's complex relationship with artists. No other thinker has made so many artist-friends. That he was admired by people from science (Einstein) and art (Mann) is a fact not to be ignored; nor should we forget, as even his critics admit, Freud is one of the greatest prose stylists of the century, admired throughout the world for the patience, clarity, and power of his writings."},{"Title":"Status of the red drum stock of the Atlantic Coast: Stock assessment report for 1991 (NOAA technical memorandum NMFS SEFC)","review":"Any book that Anthony Storr calls original is suspect.

Unfortunately Mr. Webster does not tell us much; his book mainly consists of recycled material from diverse sources, confusingly assembled, plus a pseudo-philosophical meditation at the end. Curiously it seems popular to bring in Darwin, who is on the chart of all the &quot;critics&quot; of Freud. another interesting fact: people who are most eager to attack Freud as a pseudoscientist today are English Professors... And finally, as John Forrester noted, none of these people encourages us to actually read Freud, and to find out things for ourselves. Is there a pattern in all this?"},{"Title":"Chaucer's Host: Up-So-Doun","review":"Geoffrey Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES has been viewed within narrow parameters for nearly 600 years. Recently new insight, well worth considering, has been offered. Dolores Cullen, in her book CHAUCER'S HOST UP-SO-DOUN, tilts the TALES upside down to reveal a previously unrecognized allegorical level.Written in our modern English, Cullen intends CHAUCER'S HOST to be readable and understood by those with only a passing acquaintance with the TALES. It actually is. Through extensive research, and possibly some divine intervention, Cullen proves that Herry Bailly, the host of the Canterbury pilgrims and judge of their tales, is another Host and judge as well. She uncovers the identity of Christ in Bailly. Given the politic and religious environment in Chaucer's time, it's understandable why he would hide this alternate level of commentary.Cullen's vision is remarkably clear and makes one wonder why this truth was not seen before. The academic world has been too uptight about how Chaucer was to be interpreted to allow revelations. Cullen's dedication and perseverance are to be commended. Unable to ignore the masterpiece beneath the masterpiece that was unveiled for her eyes, she refused to be silent.CHAUCER'S HOST is a wonderful gift for anyone interested in great literature, or complicated literary puzzles, for everyone from high school students to book collecters. It is certain to spark a revolution in Chaucerian studies. If any one author is going to change the world of classic literature, it is Dolores Cullen. --Lisa C.

The book is geared for DBA's, system admins and developers. The book assumes some general knowledge of databases, but most concepts are explained as they come up. For example, there are sidebars for normalization and RAID.The third edition is updated for Oracle 10g. Since the authors point out which features are specific to Oracle 8i, 9i and 10g, this book is just as useful for older versions of Oracle. For readers of previous editions, the book has an appendix directing the reader to the new 10g content.For developers, using Java with Oracle is explained. There are good sections on SQLJ, JDBC, EJBs and Java stored procedures. For DBA's and system admins, the book covers architecture, failover and deployment.The book uses a good mix of text, diagrams and examples. Many cutting-edge topics are explained with a non-platform specific background of the topic and examples. These topics include OLTP, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence and of course - Grid Computing.I found the list of major technologies to be extremely useful. Chapter 1 has a paragraph on Oracle features in the database, application server and standalone development tools. The rest of the book focuses on the database itself. This book covers almost everything you would want to know about Oracle and provides references for more detail on each topic. If you are only going to buy one Oracle book, this is the one to buy."},{"Title":"Oracle Essentials, 3e: Oracle Database 10g","review":"I've used a number of different database systems before, but never had the pleasure of working with Oracle's software. I installed a development version of 10g and was somewhat taken aback when the installer proudly announced \\"169 products installed.\\" I glumly thought \\"Gee, hope the database server is in there somewhere.\\"I picked up a copy of Oracle Essentials and found it to be an excellent introduction to Oracle. The book is short enough to read end-to-end, but it is packed with information about Oracle's architecture and most of those 169 products. The authors write lucidly, in an easily accessible style. Even though the book is eminently readable, it doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the reader, nor skimp on details. There is surprising depth in so short a book with such broad scope!As another reviewer mentioned, there is essentially nothing about SQL and PL/SQL in this book. That's okay with me - there are plenty of excellent texts on those two topics.Oracle Essentials claims it is \\"What you need to know about Oracle Database architecture and features.\\" I agree completely!"},{"Title":"Oracle Essentials, 3e: Oracle Database 10g","review":"I agree with the good things my fellow reviewers have to say about this book - it is an excellent introduction to the Oracle architecture. But be advised that although the book is rich in theory, there is virtually no hands-on, how-to information. As a result I sometimes spent hours researching how to implement a feature described in the book, when the author could have explained it in a couple of sentences. I highly recommend it - but if you plan on working with the database yourself you will need to supplement it with a good hands-on book, the Oracle on-line documentation, and a lot of trial and error."},{"Title":"Oracle Essentials, 3e: Oracle Database 10g","review":"I code databases for a living and use Oracle quite often. I picked this book to increase my knowledge on the oracle database partly out of curiosity. The book is refreshingly small (~300 pages) but make no mistake, this doesn't leave many essentials out. It doesn't cover SQL and PL/SQL though. It's a one trick pony which is very good at what it advertises i.e. good intro to database architecture and features"},{"Title":"Oracle Essentials, 3e: Oracle Database 10g","review":"I approach each release of Oracle with trepidation simply because each release contains so many new features and with it a considerable amount of documentation.I think everyone who is considering Oracle 10g should definitely purchase Oracle Essentials - Oracle Database 10g. It succinctly gives the highlights of the database in general as well as specific new features in an easily digestable manner. It not only explains the parts and pieces of the database, but why and how they are used. This book is heaven sent for me. This compact book gives me everything I need to know in one terrific volume and encourages me to delve further in the specific areas I need to know.As for one of the authors, Bob Stackowiak, I have known him for many years and have always been impressed with his breadth of knowledge on the database. To recently discover that he is one of the authors of this book makes it all the more compelling to read.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Oracle Essentials, 3e: Oracle Database 10g","review":"Prior to this book, I had almost know experience or knowledge of the Oracle database. I really like the approach the author's used with this book. What I really want when I'm learning a new topic is to get a fairly broad, fairly shallow introduction to the material. I want the most important points summed up in a way that makes sense to a new guy. I don't want to delve deep into each topic and I don't want things explained in a way that requires me to look up and learn every other term in order to understand the points. And that is the approach the authors have taken. The point of the book isn't to make you an expert at any one area of Oracle. At lot of the book is spent discussing *why* certain features are important and how they fit into the big picture, sometimes without a lot of discussion on the features themselves. This may frustrate some readers, but I found it to be very helpful. For example, I don't need to know everything about Oracle redo logs or all the ins-and-outs of Oracle's support for business intelligence. What I *do* need to know is why the redo logs exist and a high level overview of how Oracle handles BI. This book gives you the bird's eye view of the Oracle landscape and let's you make the determination on where you need to take a closer look.The book is well written. It's easy to read, generally very clear, and does not contain many errors (I don't think I found any).Another really nice feature is the appendix containing a listing of additional resources where you can go to find more information about Oracle. These are broken out by chapter (i.e. topic). This is a great feature because it really helps with the next obvious step--digging deeper.All in all, I can't recommend this book enough. An enjoyable read with a great strategy behind it."},{"Title":"Oracle Essentials, 3e: Oracle Database 10g","review":"This book can probably justify its cost by removing the 10g bit from its title. There is very little information about 10g [except Appendix A, which is simply defn of terms]. In general, this book is very shallow. I was completely disappointed."},{"Title":"The Inclusion of the Other: Studies in Political Theory (Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought)","review":"After his major work on legal theory (Between Facts and Norms), J&uuml;rgen Habermas revisits some of the hottest issues on metaethics, political theory and moral philosophy. The book is nicely divided in five parts. The first is the most specialized one. Habermas offers an exciting contribution to metaethics. As readers might know, most disputes in contemporary metaethics revolve around the question whether we could find a cognitive basis for &quot;first principles&quot; or &quot;values&quot;, or what is the same, whether there is an objective ground for things like human rights and principles like those of liberty and equality. By means of reflecting on his discursive ethics (the main insight of which is that standards of right are to be related to the necessary assumptions which we make each and every time we enter into discourses concerning practical questions, like that all those with which we talk could contribute something to the issue at stake), Habermas puts forwards a convincing case for a moderate cognitivism, or what is the same, for an objective foundation. This implies moving beyond the relativism characteristic of much liberal thinking. Specialized readers will be interested in confronting Habermas' argument with that of Alexy, and will find the chapter an expansion of his 1997 article on the Aristotelian Society Proceedings. The second part contains two chapters, devoted to one of the major events in contemporary political thinking: the lectures in which John Rawls (author of the world-known Theory of Justice, second edition published in September 1999) and J&uuml;rgen Habermas revisited the work of each other. Habermas stresses the similarities of his and Rawls' theory, but stresses the dialogical conception of his theory of justice, vis a vis the monological character of the well-known Rawlsian original position. The third part is an essential reading for all those interested in globalisation. Habermas offers his insights on the process of European integration. The articles there included reflect his commitment to the further development of the Communities, based both in his own fear of an isolated Germany and his hope for extending solidarity beyond nation-states. Specialized readers will find specially interesting his new insights on the cement of liberal post-nationalistic societies, what Habermas himself labeled as &quot;constitutional patriotism&quot;. The fourth part contains Habermas contributions with the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the publication of Kant's pamphlet &quot;Towards Perpetual Peace&quot;, a major statement in favor of cosmopolitan democracy. Habermas takes the opportunity to challenge realists, that is, those claiming that international relations are mainly a matter of force and deception (the like of Carl Schmitt, a favorite target of his criticisms). The fifth and last part deals with the expanding number of writers who adhere to deliberative democracy as the legitimate political arrangement (like Joshua Cohen and Seyla Benhabib, to quote some names). Habermas makes a nice analysis of the main trends and implications of this line of argumentation, which basically aims at transcending majoritarian politics and reinforcing the effective participation of citizens in politics. The Inclusion of the Other is especially recommended to all those interested in having a taste of the work of Habermas but who were deterred by the complicated prose of Continental Philosophers. The book is clearly written and crisply translated. Habermas himself supervises the English translation of his books. A colleague from Germany told me that she preferred reading him in English because the texts were always more rich and complete than in the original edition!"},{"Title":"A Critical Look At Performance Management Systems - Why Don't They Work?","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I actually read the the entire book and not just the first chapter, after having heard Mr. Bacal speak at a Human Resources conference in Rochester, NY. If you are looking for a nuts and bolts step-by-step explanation about how to do performance management, then there are dozens of books on the subject, including others by the same author. If that's what you want do NOT get this book.That's because this isn't a step-by-step book. If anything it's an \\"emperor isn't wearing any clothes book\\", which explains some odd situations in management and HR, where everyone but the executives and HR people know the company's performance appraisals are useless.The book explains why most systems fail, and lists a number of possibilities so managers and HR pros can evaluate more accurately where they are going wrong and how to fix the problems.One of the things I like best about the book is that it's exceedingly \\"tightly\\" written without losing meaning. It says what it has to say quickly. It is the kind of book where you sit and smack your forehead, saying \\"Well, of course we're doing that dumb thing in our company\\". And, it opens some doors about a new vision of performance management and how it can be developed to meet a very specific goal -- how to help everyone succeed, from shareholders, to executives and managers, and each employee.It's not rocket science, but I think it should be mandatory reading for all HR professionals before they go about foisting off their newest version of performance appraisal, which is going to look exactly like the older version but in different clothes and fail as badly. If you do the things that cause performance management to fail, as outlined in this book, you WILL fail at it."},{"Title":"A Critical Look At Performance Management Systems - Why Don't They Work?","review":"I had the opportunity to read the 1st chapter of this book before buying it, and that was enough for me to realize that it was not worth the purchasing. To support his points, the author selectively cites obscure, outdated research that is inconsisent with the vast body of literature that exists on such topics as goal-setting. One of the author's central points is that by focusing on individual performance, cooperation does not take place and organizational performance suffers. While this may have been true years ago for systems that focused exclusively on core job tasks, those knowledgeable on performance evaluation recognize that expectations of cooperation and teamwork behaviors can easily be integrated into an evaluation system. The author also repeatedly criticizes evaluations that focus on results. Although it is true that these systems often reward the wrong types of behaviors, the author fails to note that behavior-based systems avoid many of the shortcomings associated with evaluations that focus on outcomes. The author is one consultant who needs to educate himself on behavior in the workplace before considering himself an expert on it."},{"Title":"DK Classics: Aladdin","review":"I just wanted to advise of a correction relating to the \\"Editorial Review\\" for this book. It refers to the series \\"D.K. READERS\\" (formerly \\"EYEWITNESS READERS\\") rather than the series \\"D.K. CLASSICS\\" (formerly \\"EYEWITNESS CLASSICS\\"). The two series share some of the same titles, but the text of the D.K. CLASSICS is closer to that of the origninal works upon which they are based. There are also sidebars on most pages that describe the historical setting for the book and sometimes provide a comparison of the same setting as it is today. The D.K. CLASSICS series are great for doing book reports or for making history come alive through great literature."},{"Title":"DK Classics: Aladdin","review":"My daughter and I have been reading (and re-reading!) the DK Classics (of which &quot;Aladdin&quot; is part of) for several years, since she was 5. These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"DK Classics: Aladdin","review":"As this book will reveal to many children, Disney didn't invent Aladdin - he is one of the characters found in the 1000-year-old tales of Arabian Nights. Read about an Aladdin that is closer to the original, and also about Alibaba and the Forty Thieves, and The Enchanted Garden, two other stories from The Arabian Nights. There is some violence here - but, hey, it's classic literature and it keeps the kids' attention. There are two interesting heroic women in the stories. This gorgeously illustrated book is printed on good-quality glossy paper, a rare find at this price. The main text is complemented with historic notes and photographs adding background to the story, and there is a glossary at the end. Overall, it's a first-class book that adults will enjoy along with kids."},{"Title":"The old Reformation and the new (The Cato lecture)","review":"I love a book of good lectures now and then because it's not weighed down by too much detailed scholarly analysis. Originating as spoken presentations to a live audience they give scholars (and Rupp was an outstanding Reformation scholar) an opportunity to get into free style mode. When such reflections are based on a lifetime of scholarly activity, the peppering of anecdotes and well chosen aphorisms are a delight to read. Rupp was one of the greatest Luther scholars of his day and a Methodist to boot! (His 1947 Lectures on \\"The Righteousness of God\\" constitute a classic in the field.) This slim little volume reflects on the nature of the twentieth century as an Age of Revolution, examines the revolutionary impact of the sixteenth century Reformation (as a Crisis of the Word, a Crisis of Communication, and Crisis of Compassion) and then brings some words of sage advice to those engaged in the \\"New Reformation\\" of theological revisionism. He has little patience for innovators such as the Bishop of Woolwich, John AT Robinson, who compared himself with Martin Luther. \\"I wish him well,\\" says Rupp. \\"He has now only to be unfrocked, tried and condemned for high treason, to write four of the world's classics, to translate the Bible and compose a hymn book, and to write some 100 folio volumes which 400 years hence will concern scholars all over the world, and to become the spiritual father of some thousands of millions of Christians - to qualify as the Martin Luther of a New Reformation.\\" (p. 51) Rupp has no aversion to contemporary constructions of the faith but has only scorn for superficial mass media treatments that offer the same \\"baloon-like inflation\\" to theology and liturgy as are given to the Beatles and James Bond! (ibid) Though he has admiration for Bonhoeffer and his \\"religionless Christianity\\" he is not willing to \\"unchurch the Church\\" or \\"unpeople the people of God.\\" \\"Once we admit that God has called us not because of our virtue or wisdom or efficiency - the ability to be up-to-date and impressive or exciting or brilliant - but simply because in His mercy he has pitied us, then we have another measure for the life and death and reformation of the Church.\\" (p. 64). There is something here for contemporary missional and emergent thinkers who often speak as though the church is a hindrance rather than a help in engaging in mission and can even speak of being \\"post-church.\\" Augustine, Luther, Newman, and Bonhoeffer (Rupp reminds us) were not only \\"incurably religious men, but professional religious men.\\" (p. 64) That is, they were clergy - professional church leaders Even Bonhoeffer with his secular Christianity was consumed with zeal for the house of the Lord. Rupp was convinced that there could be no genuine renewal of the Church in his time without the same kind of prophetic voices. The same remains true today."},{"Title":"Come to Dust (Keith Moody Mystery)","review":"In need of something to read and only a few choices on my shelves, I finally settled for this little book I bought about a year ago in the bargain section of a local bookstore. After blowing the dust off the rather nondescript jacket, I settled down to my usual hour or two of reading after going to bed. Suddenly it was four hours later and I was halfway through the novel!This quirky little mystery is like watching a Nick and Nora Charles Thin Man movie from the \`40s. I pictured Keith (the protagonist) and Myra Moody as William Powell and Myrna Loy. The dialogue is full of that elegant, sophisticated banter they spoke so well. Keith, a failed novelist/former screenwriter, just can't keep trouble from finding him. Thus, his escapades, like having an imbecile threaten him with a gun on the beach in broad daylight to stealing a body from a nursing home, make this a laugh-a-minute twists-and-turns kind of novel that you can't put down. And there is a plethora of wacko characters, one of my favorites being the daffy desk clerk at the hotel Keith and Myra reside after their house is trashed. This fragile-egoed schizoid definitely deserves an award for best supporting character in a novel!The novel goes through many twists and turns with several seemingly unrelated events suddenly coming together and making sense. And after you cut through the humor, there is a seriousness that raises the question of where the dividing line is between obligation to a friend and integrity to oneself. All in all, this was a most enjoyable read. This is a sequel to Greg Matthews' FAR FROM HEAVEN, which I intend to read soon. Let's hope this isn't the end of the series."},{"Title":"Come to Dust (Keith Moody Mystery)","review":"Another great Keith Moody mystery by Mr. Matthews.Moody is the ulitmate anti-hero. Although he has become more sophisticated than he was when we first met him in &quot;Far from Heaven,&quot; his sense of humor had me laughing out loud at several points.But this is not solely a comic novel. It has moments of beauty,sorrow, and clarity that are uncommon in the mystery genre.I certainly hope there is a third installment, although the novel's ending has me guessing there will not be. That is a shame. Keith Moody and his smart-ass wife Myra are two of the most likeable charactors I've ever encountered in fiction."},{"Title":"Come to Dust (Keith Moody Mystery)","review":"Walker is not known for publishing the best mystery novels, so the quality of COME TO DUST comes as a surprise. The opening chapters, in which a 4-F novelist comes across an equally 4-F thug while walking along the beach during WWII, are among the funniest I've read. The comedy slacks off a bit in later chapters, which begin to read a bit more like your average mid-list mystery (protag butts heads with a pair of sarcastic cops; protag comes across an injustice and rights the wrong; obligatory climactic twist, in this case ripped off shamelessly from the film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;), but even then the writing remains unusually strong (especially the crackling dialogue) and the novel sports an atmosphere of seriousness the average mystery lacks. The main character is a failure, and his sense of being a failure pervades the book. Far from being the turn-off this sounds like, it infuses the story with a richness not often found in its peers. A funnier and more sober mystery than the average, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Come to Dust (Keith Moody Mystery)","review":"In May 1944 in Redondo Beach, California, writer Keith Moody had the dream encounter of a lifetime for a not so successful novelist. He ran into someone reading one of his books. However, Keith's dream encounter turns into a nightmare when the reader takes out a gun and demands his cash, not his autograph. This incident is a microcosm into the professional life of Keith Moody.However, his professional life apparently takes a swing uphill when Keith is hired by Empire Productions to write the script to a movie. However, this dream assignment turns into a new nightmare when Keith finds that someone violated his home, looking for something. Subsequently, Nazis under the direction of Herr Fuhrer begin a deadly chase with the target being a bewildered Keith and his beloved spouse Myra.The second novel, COME TO DUST, in the Moody mystery series is an interesting period piece that brings alive the World War II era, especially in Southern California. The story line is reminiscent of the movies of the forties as the theme seems to run all over the place. Still, this majestically works due to the genuine portrayal of the era and a flustered Keith, who is really a remarkable anti-hero. With this book and the prequel tale (FAR FROM HEAVEN) Greg Matthews demonstrates his talent as he hits his second home run with this amateur sleuth story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Stories from the Bible","review":"This book is so beautiful - I wish it was back in print! I paid too much for a ratty old copy, but I'm glad I did.Edward Ardizzone is one of my favorite illustrators and he doesn't disappoint here.I was not familiar with Walter de la Mare, but his writing is beautiful. He adds a lot to the stories, but it doesn't feel forced or artificial. And he picks some stories I did not know (and I really thought I knew them pretty well!).The language may be a little complicated for my 6th-graders, but it is so beautiful that I think I will read them aloud so it can at least wash over them. This is a poet's voice, not an encyclopedia's, so I don't know what I would leave out."},{"Title":"Tarawa;: The story of a battle","review":"Robert Sherrod was a war correspondent for Time when he waded ashore Tarawa on the afternoon of D-Day, 11/20/43. Aboard his transport ship Sherrod heard fascinating tales of the Gilbert Islands before the war, tales told to him by his shipmates, Karl Tschaun and James Forbes. Both of these men had lived and worked among these island paradises and now returned to share their knowledge of the waters with the allies.One does not get the big picture from such first hand accounts. Indeed, for the first three days Sherrod's movements were confined to an area 400 yards along the beach and no further inland than 100 yards. Instead, the reader hears the authentic voice of one who has been there, one who heard first hand the anticipation that the island would be a cake walk and then saw men horribly chopped to pieces as they went ashore. But for Sherrod to get to Tarawa he too had to wade 700 yards across the reef which surrounded and protected the island. During this march no fewer than five machine guns were firing upon him and the few Marines with him.Reaching the beachhead, he sat for hours with his back to the coconut log seawall. A Marine walks by, a sniper hits his helmet and amazingly he is unharmed. The next one a moment later takes a bullet through the heart just inches from where Sherrod sat. Looking out over those coral flats the next morning \\"...a half dozen Marines lie exposed... They are hunched over, rifles in hand, just as they fell. Further out on the flats I can see at least fifty other bodies...The smell of death, that sweetly sick odor of decaying human flesh, is already oppressive. Now that it is light, the wounded go walking by... Some have bloodless faces, some have bloody faces, others only pieces of faces.\\"The second day was worse for the waves of men and machines coming ashore. Japanese reinforcements had moved across the island and waited for the assault craft and the men who trudged through the water. Through the trained eye of a seasoned reporter, Sherrod tells of the horror, the cacophony of large cannon fire, machine weapons, the crack of rifles and the unending shaking of the earth from multiple explosions. Across this half-mile square of hell and mangled bodies the Marines, the men of the 2nd Division, inched forward, dying by the hundreds but always moving towards the enemy.Sherrod tells of their ultimate victory in a manner befitting their valor."},{"Title":"Tarawa;: The story of a battle","review":"Robert Sherrod takes you on a voyage into the vast Pacific Ocean to the bloody beaches of Betio with the second marine Div.

Full of imagery and horror, brought alive with details of overheard conversations and on the spot interviews with marines of all ranks and backgrounds.

Sherrod's &quot;Tarawa&quot; is to books what &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is to the movies. Except Tarawa is real while many of the scenes in Saving Private Ryan are recreations of anecdotal incidents which took place on the beaches of Normandy. Sherrod's Tarawa is an actural account of the grisly battle for Betio, which cost the lives of almost 1,000 Americans and thousands of Japanese Marines. Sherrod's &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; is much more vivid andeasier to read than than most technical descriptions of the battle. Tarawa and the opening battle scene of Private Ryan almost compliment each other, especially with Sherrod's description of almost being able to &quot;reach out and touch a thousand bullets.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tarawa;: The story of a battle","review":"Read the books on the battle of Tarawa, but read this one first. It is the classic account of a war correspondent, unarmed, who wrote from what he saw, heard, and thought, together with his notebooks, only a few days after the Hell ended. Consider:1. The author, Robert Sherrod, asked for, and was granted, permission to be included in the initial assault waves of Marines, rather then land after a beachead had been secured. The battalion to which he was assigned took a 60% casualty rate, the heaviest of the three main battalions.2. Sherrod was caught 700 yards off shore when, among 30 assaulting Marines in his Higgins boat, they could not navigate in the shallow water over the coral reef surrounding the island; they had to transfer to an amphtrack (like so many others), and then had to wade from neck-deep water the remaining distance through the fire of 5-6 Jap machine guns \\"whose bullets already were whistling over our heads\\" and shortly later \\"six inches to the left or six inches to the right.\\"3. Sherrod spent the first 1.5 days with others on the 20-foot beachead, protected only by the four-foot seawall, while Jap gunners overhead were doing their best to slaughter Marines in the water, 300-400 to the last count.4. After the battle ended, true to his duties, Sherrod made a thorough trip around the island with his notebooks to survey the carnage, on both sides, before departing to write what he had experienced.In hindsight, it seems remarkable that Sherrod, despite having experienced the Hell he did, is adamant in defense of the battle operation plans, execution, and costs in terms of Marine lives, in sharp contrast to the view of the American public at the time. Subsequent accounts reveal two colossal blunders made by American military brass: failure to take seriously the reports of those who had actually lived on the island that the tide at the time for which the battle was planned did not allow enough water over the coral shelf surrounding the island to allow the assault boats to carry men all the way to the shore (only the amphtracks could crawl over the shallow reef, and they had to shuttle Marines in and wounded/dead back); and secondly that the pre-assault Naval bombardment of the island was not long enough or effective enough to penetrate the powerful Jap fortifications, together with the lull in the bombardment that allowed defenders to switch sides of the island to concentrate on defending the assault side. The extent of those blunders was not known at the time Sherrod wrote his story, of course, but the costs were: 300-400 Marines slaughtered in the water.Despite this, for every Marine killed there were 4+ Japs killed and the ultimate objective, the airfield, was preserved for subsequent use. Only about a dozen and a half enemy remained alive at the end of the battle, mainly those who did not chose suicide.For a good follow-up to this book, read One Square Mile of Hell: The Battle for Tarawa by John Wukovits. It traces the lives of half a dozen men from birth to death, and includes the impact of their tragedic loss to their family, loved ones, wives, and financees, and schools.Then read Utmost Savagery: The Three Days of Tarawa by Joseph Alexander, for a view from the technical military perspective.On tap for me is: Tarawa 1943: The Turning of the Tide by Derrick Wright & Howard Gerrard.All of these books can be purchased at Amazon."},{"Title":"Tarawa;: The story of a battle","review":"I am a WWII history buff and this is a \\"must have\\" book.

This debut offers the reader a great new hero who is a bit of a different kind of character we usually see. Retiring from the army, a Captain in the Napoleonic Wars Rifle regiment, Matthew Hawkwood now works for the famous Bow Street Runners catching criminals. The reader does not encounter the wealthy ton of London, but is introduced to the seedy side of the city, complete with rapscallions, pick-pockets, wharfrats, prostitutes, mudlarks, and the entire array of anyone and everything unsavory. The book has great characters, a vivid depiction of what life was like in the late 1700's and early 1800s London and lots of action, humor, and mystery. I loved this debut and hope the author continues with the series in the same adventurous flavor. McGee's writing style could be compared to that of Bernard Cornwell, polished and engaging from start to finish. The character of Hawkwood could be compared to Clive Cussler's famous Dirk Pitt if put in a historical setting. Bravo Mr. McGee, keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"The book can be best described as light action-adventure story set in 1811 London. It starts with a coach robbery. The highwaymen not only rob the passengers, they also kill a naval officer and steal the documents he was carrying. The case is assigned to one Matthew Hawkwood, who is a Bow Street runner (police inspector). Soon it is discovered that the robbery was a smokescreen and the highwaymen were in reality after the documents, and all that because of a plot organized by Napoleon's agents. What the plot is, I will not say in order to avoid spoilers, but it is something straight from a James Bond movie.The book overall is enjoyable, but it suffers from serious faults. The biggest one is clich&eacute; writing, clich&eacute; characters and clich&eacute; dialogues. There are few brilliant scenes, but most of the writing lacks originality and at times is painful to read. This especially applies to the main bad guy who apparently was modeled on James Bond villains. Every time he captures the hero, rather than kill him straight, he explains his evil plan in detail and then hands the execution to his henchmen, who, needless to say, screw up.Also, it is not a mystery novel despite its premise. Although he is a police investigator, Hawkwood does very little actual investigating. Actually, almost none at all. He walks around, talks to witnesses who always happen to know a crucial piece of information, has evidence and clues literally land into his hands and meets people who explain him everything in lengthy monologues.I understand that this is not a Sherlock Holmes story, but for a (supposed) mystery novel about a cop doing investigation, there should be more investigation.Still, the novel does have redeeming qualities. The writing is perhaps clich&eacute;, but it is still enjoyable most of the time. The author did his research. The novel is a treasure trove of information about early 19th century London. For someone who is interested in that time period, it is a good read.Plus, for a light hearted action-adventure book, it has a very dark ending and graphic scenes of sex. I think I will give the author a chance and try the second book in the series. (There are four books so far.)"},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"I really enjoy historical fiction especially stories set in the Regency period in England. Unfortunately this book didn't impress me like it did everyone else here on Amazon.I was an easy read with a somewhat straightforward story unencumbered by a variety of story lines, which is perhaps part of why I was disappointed.The main character, Matthew Hawkwood, wasn't developed enough for me to really sink into the story. And it was plenty long enough to develop him. I will say I did enjoy his relationship with Sergeant Nathanial Jago and the action scenes, but they weren't enough to leave me satisfied at the end of the book.Sadly, I purchased the sequel in anticipation of loving this book and wanting to read the next installment but the first story hasn't left me wanting more of Hawkwood or the writing of James McGee."},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"This book starts off like any great novel, but being besed in the 18th century, has excellent research behind the basic story of the origins of the \\"Bow Street Runner\\", who were the forefathers of the Metropolitan Police, and Scotland Yard. The story grips you with feel of yesteryear London, as well introducing you to real historical people. One of the best books that you will read. Think James Bond, before there was a James Bond,and McGee takes you there in style and wit. Ranks up there with Ludlum, Higgins and Follet, and probably better and more readable. VERY difficult to put down, trust me."},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"Excellent service. Very prompt. Even coming from UK, received the book before it was due. Very happy with the quality of my purchase!"},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"As a big fan of historical mysteries, I snapped up two of James mcGee's books on a used basis. I received the second in the series first .. and put it aside after one chapter. Days later Ratcatcher arrived per post and I started it with a little skepsis. Soon the story had me in its grip. Hawkwood, the Bow Street Runner protagonist, has an interesting background - many details of which were revealed in this first of the series. The book also doesn't lack atmosphere - one can almost smell the horrible slum areas of then London. The bad guys were suitably creepy, which added to the suspense. Additional details to the plot are already summarized above. Needless to say, I look forward to the next in the series ... and will hopefully learn even more about what makes Hawkwood tick!"},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"While the plot line is intriguing, some of the characters are a little hackneyed, especially for an English person to read. It is a touch formulaic but nothing wrong with that per se, I am not a fan of the 'experimental' style of writing. Some areas are a little crude, especially the sexual scenes and references. If you are not looking for much and want an easy to follow story line with bodice-ripping action then you won't be disappointed. Like my title says, all the good ingredients are there but maybe they could have been mixed with more care."},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"James McGee became a writer after working in banking, sales and the airline industry both here in the UK and also abroad. He is now a bookseller, a very honourable profession. Where would we be without them. I am not sure whether this is his first novel or not, no matter, I found it an excellent read about a period of history, Regency London, a time perhaps that is not as done to death by authors as say medieval or Victorian. The book is fast paced, full of the atmosphere of the period.Matthew Hawkwood, the lead player in the book is a man of complex character, feared by those who operate outside the law, loved by the ladies, a hero who is handsome, mysterious and has a ruthless streak. A man who want to do his job, helping to keep the peace on the street of a city that is rife with criminals, prostitutes, pickpockets and so-called beggars who would slit your throat for the change in your pocket.He is a man whose past keeps haunting him. A past that worries some of the people in high places. But the Chief Magistrate thinks he is just right for a crucial mission . . .The book has everything you could wish for in a period murder mystery. I enjoyed it tremendously. I am sure you will too."},{"Title":"Ratcatcher","review":"Matthew Hawkwood, a former soldier and a sharpshooter, is now one of ten Bow Street Runners. When Highwaymen stop a coach and kill a government courier, Hawkwood is called in to find them. In time, he finds what he is really seeking is the contents of the couriers pouch and those behind a plot to destroy the strength of England's war fleet.Hawkwood, for all this reputation as a top Runner, isn't the most capable. Were it not for his friend, Jago, he wouldn't have made it through the book. In fact, of the two characters, Jago is the more interesting. What McGee did do extremely well was depict the seamy side of London during this period. The other element of the story I found fascinating were the descriptions of the weapon invented by Robert Fulton. I am also always fascinated by reading the history of the Bow Street Runners. While this wasn't the best book, it wasn't terrible either and, being the first in the series, I shall probably read the next one just to see how the author is progressing."},{"Title":"Contemporary Urban Sociology (Contemporary Sociology)","review":"It is one of the greatest books that I have ever read in my life!

Numerous books have been written about him recounting his life, his amazing spiritual gifts and powerful prayer intercession (both while he lived and since he passed on into eternity and into God's Kingdom). And his own writings (letters) have also been published, not all are easily accessible however.Eileen Dunn Bertanzetti has obviously been a student of and a devotee of the saintly life of Padre Pio of Pietrelcina and has authored and assembled colections of his words and thoughts in several volumes of her writing. I had obtained a copy of her book: \\"Padre Pio's Words Of Hope\\" in which she arranged a series of 150 meditations each which included a scripture passage or verse, followed by a thought in Padre Pio's own words, and ending in a prayer. When i noticed that there were exactly \\"150\\" meditations included, it was obvious by that more than symbolic number that the book brought to mind imagery of the Psalter, the Book Of Psalms. So i was not at all surprised, yet happy, to discover that Eileen has followed that book with this one: \\"Praying The Psalms With Padre Pio\\" where she makes a pilgrimage psalm by psalm through all 150 by including a key verse from each, followed by Padre Pio's own words and thoughts centered on the thought of that psalm and verse, and then ending in a prayer -- again 150 meditations of spiritual thought and guidance of Padre pio psalm by psalm . . .Through the many centuries and centuries, the Psalms have always been integral in the life of prayer: both ecclesial as well as private prayer . . . the psalms spring from and speak to the very core needs and feelings and common (even if individual and personal) experience of every person. At one time or another in our lives we share the same hurts, confusions, joys and gratefulness of the psalmists . . . as did Padre Pio himself . . . and to share the wisdom of the scriptures and of one who lived the scriptures so eloquently (Saint Padre Pio), as we pray our own union with the procession of the saints can be most spiritually enlightening. We find that in truth: \\"there is nothing new under the sun\\", what we experience now, others have before us; both long before us as well as more recently before us. And that gives us not only a sense of direction but also of hope . . .and peace.Eileen Dunn Bertanzetti has provided a great spiritual treasure for us in her books on Padre Pio . . . and this volume is a true gem from that mine."},{"Title":"Praying the Psalms with St. Padre Pio","review":"Bertanzetti is such a wonderful author, and like her other books, she again eloquently expresses the wisdom of St. Padre Pio's words in terms of the psalms. There are 150 psalms in this book, each with a meditation and accompanied by the eloquent words of Padre Pio. Again, a book not to be read and placed in the bookcase, this is a book that offers wisdom and serenity in dealing with the challenges and adversities in life.The theme or mandra of St. Padre Pio is - Pray, Hope and don't worry! Not always easy to do, but this author's books are very inspiring in terms of moving us in that direction."},{"Title":"Praying the Psalms with St. Padre Pio","review":"For anyone trying to stay on the spiritual path,and coming up against the trials and tribulations that life throwsin our way,and especially for anyone who has a devotion to Saint pio,beleive me this is a great book.why?Its thekind of book that,If your searching in vain for an answer to a particular problem,youl find that you will probablyopen this book on the very page that provides you with the spiritual solution for your troubled mind.If so,dont be surprised,as these are the answers of Saint Pio,the maestro of spiritual surprises.along with getting an insight into the deep thoughts of this holy man,who said,I Am a mytery even to myself,the pages combine,the wisdom of the scriptures and psalms,with the gentle advice and insight of a manspeaking to us,with all the gifts of the holy spirit,these are truly answers from heaven,for those stillstruggling in this valley of tears."},{"Title":"Praying the Psalms with St. Padre Pio","review":"If you have any difficulty, grab that book and read a page every day.

But the collapse of Everyman USA's financial mainstay in 1991 Rhode Island proved otherwise. The Aberration will pull you into the actual, surreal and unreal horror hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders faced less than a decade ago. In the tradition of Grisham and Ludlum, this astoundingly readable book will keep you page-turning well past your bedtime. Mr. Giannini's fabric of fact and fiction, imagination and research is a compelling and admirable work."},{"Title":"The Aberration","review":"A fast paced story that encompasses the actual behind the scenes workings of a banking organization which the author uses as a background. The author, Al Giannini, is obviously a many faceted individual who appears to be knowledgeable in a multitude of subjects which he succeeds in blending into the novel.

This book held my interest throughout, and I eagerly highly recommend it to all lovers of fiction with a factual back ground."},{"Title":"The Aberration","review":"I suspect that my conclusions regarding this book have to do with dreams and realisms of immigrant forefathers versus the greed and lewedness of a wayward son. The sinister plot unravels itself almost immediately corrupting Mickey and endangering the financial success of Phil not to mention an entire banking institution. How can a son born of a father so loving go so wrong?Mr. Giannini writes in a skillful dynamic fashion using colorful, descriptive phraseology. He involves places, times, and sequences necessary for continuity and clarity.All too often one finds a way to continue the story of the pages one has read coming to the conclusion of one's choice. I have done that with this book....coming to my own conclusion regarding the presence of Luco. I look forward, therefore, to a sequel to The Aberration and for Luco to discern his very self."},{"Title":"The Aberration","review":"The most basic of human frailties are embodied in a single person, the title character, Luco Parisi. Giannini explores Luco in depth -- his greed, his craving for vengeance, his uncontrollable lust, the ease with which he can betray -- and the extent to which others are affected by the consequences of his amorality. So blinded and preoccupied is Luco with his self-serving pursuits, he is unaware until it is too late that he has incurred the wrath of two very diverse individuals. One, a gangland boss, wants the return of his ill-gotten money and will stop at nothing to get it. The other, Vince Bonetta, is the antithesis of Luco. Vince's sense of values and morality clash with Luco's at every level. Vince is driven not by money, but by a sense of honor and loyalty to old friends that can be satisfied only by exacting just and total retribution from Luco.Giannini's telling of this story is interwoven with human emotion -- pathos, love, fury, greed, humor -- and told through characters who come vividly alive with dialogue that is compelling and memorable.It's hard to believe that The Aberration is his first novel. I look forward eagerly to the release of his next work, The Third Wire."},{"Title":"Kennebec, cradle of Americans","review":"Just back from vacation -- have spent past over thirty years summering in Georgetown, ME -- in small cottage at the mouth of the Kennebec (across from Gilbert Head and Fort Popham) and can't believe I have only now discovered Coffin's beautiful (and often times entertaining -- that's right -- history can be fun!) narrative.

In America it was published as a Gothic Romance and I doubt that it found its proper audience, although it had some different editions. It was filmed as AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS -- a wretchedly stupid film title, when the original title, FENGRIFFEN, has so much atmosphere and simplicity. The book relates the story of a family curse, delves into the past from which that curse infiltrates into the future and clutches its victims with remorseless hold. The atmosphere of gothic mystery is superbly evoked, and the final supernatural revelation, subtly revealed, is absolutely chilling. The author, David Case, has read a number of books for Books on Tape, and one wishes that his excellent voice had been used to narrate this, his finest book. He will be appearing as a guest this year, 2010, at the World Horror Convention in England. I love this book and have read it many many times. The writing is -- one could almost call it elegant, it is so beautifully expressed and realized. And yet never has writing been so effective and evocative. It's not just fancy, beautiful prose -- it tells this amazing story, and tells it very well. It pulls one in and hypnotizes with its effectiveness. An utterly bewitching book.

It is most useful for, and geared towards, the active ringer or bander. This is a very detailed guide with a strong focus on measurements and on descriptions of age classes. The 117 waders (aka, shorebirds) that breed in the Holarctic (i.e., Alaska, Canada, and northern Europe and Asia) are covered by three key topics: Identification, Ageing, and Biometrics.This information is quite detailed and comes from many years of research and from many sources. It is incredibly useful for identifying the shorebirds; however, it often requires that you have an excellent view of the bird as well as a detailed oriented eye. Holding the bird in hand would be ideal, but quite unrealistic for most birders. Still, the book is still very useful for field identification (i.e., with a scope).To be clear, this book is not for someone trying to learn the shorebirds. This is geared and useful for people who've spent a fair amount of field time observing these birds. Having some experience with scrutinizing the various body part of the shorebirds will help to make this book more relevant and useful. The birder should also enjoy delving into finer identification detail. As an example, the book has wonderful illustrations that show individual detail for the median coverts, tertials, or tail feathers for most of the birds.The black-and-white photos of 29 species are supplied for demonstrating specific identification characteristics mentioned in the text. These are excellent photos that clearly show the distinct patterning that is key for identification.Just as an extra note, a great color photo of a Spoon-billed Sandpiper is found at the beginning of the book. There is also a great 2-page table (page 81-82) that offers columns of details to help distinguish and identify seven similar Calidris species. This would be a good section to copy and keep tucked into your field guide.One other note about this book is its slant towards the British names. Examples include Grey vs. Red Phalarope; Grey vs. Black-bellied Plover; and, single names such as Knot or Curlew.If you are intrigued by shorebirds and willingly take on the frustrating challenge of this group, then you must have this book. -- (written by Jack, with sample pages at Avian Review, September 2008)I've listed several related books below...1)The Waders of Britain and Europeby Colston/Burton2)North Atlantic Shore Birdsby Chandler3)The Shorebird Guideby O'Brien/Crossley/Carlson4)Shorebirds: An Identification Guideby Hayman/Marchant/Prater5)Shorebirds of North Americaby Paulson6)Shorebirds of North America, Europe, and Asiaby Message/Taylor7)Shorebirds of the Pacific Northwestby Paulson8)Geographical Variation in Wadersby Engelmoer/Roselaar"},{"Title":"Out of Canaan: Poems","review":"I have just reread this wonderfully thoughtful book of poems.

The recorded pronunciation and automatically graded exercises are valuable to the solo learner. Unfortunately, the actual book's organization is poor. For example, the vocabulary appears haphazardly throughout. Occasionally words are used in reading passages which will not be defined until later chapters; in many cases, words are not defined at all. Cognates are relied upon heavily, and sometimes pictures are supplied in place verbal definitions, presumably based on the assumption that language students are visual learners. Additionally, the future tense and subjunctive are not introduced until the last fifty pages. More practice with these common constructions would be beneficial.But more frustrating than any of the above is the book's poor presentation of grammar. For example, the explanations of words like \\"en\\" and \\"y\\" are weak. The authors are either attempting to avoid advanced terminology, or do not know how to describe complex grammar. If you can guess what is meant by \\"a pronoun with adverbial force,\\" then you don't need the authors' ponderous, inaccurate explanations or the pages of example sentences they employ in order to avoid the short, precise phrasing above. These problems are not insurmountable, but after months of working with this book, I found the accumulated frustration to be distracting.

I used this book for review exercise. After reading the book I felt confident enough to tackle challenging questions. I was able to finish the national section with 20 minutes to spare!Each section of the book has a glossary of terms and ends with a \\"False Friends\\" (a list of oft-confused terms) subsection. For those in hurry, the book has a selection of representative questions in grey boxes. Review those and you will have a feel for the questions on that section. There are a few separate review exams for salespersons and brokers. I found that questions were probing and required a good understanding of a chapter. Compared to these, the real text book end-of-chapter questions looked like kid stuff. The book is recommended for all those taking national portion of the real estate related exams, sales persons or associate/broker.The book is not without its weaknesses. As alluded to above, the book does not touch state portion of the exams. But that is not nothing compared to its handling of math probems. The readers are advised to ignore the math section altogether. Questions suffer from inaccuracies (e.g. the diagram of two adjacents rectangles with equal width shows length of the bigger rectangle less than that of smaller one.) Explanations for math problems have so many problems, that after spending an hour on math section I decided to forget it (I found 8 errors in an hour; and I am not a math genius.) Sometimes it looked like a poor case of cut and paste: answer for question 7 contained figures from (unrelated) question 6! Still the solution would come out correct.

The heat fo the summer is keeping Issac and his assistant, Yusuf very busy as everyone, even the Bishop of Girona, is suffering the effects of the summer heat. Unfortunately it's not his patients's health that is occupying Issac's mind, but murder.It looks as if a con artist has come to Girona in hopes of conning some of the wealthier merchants of the city into buying a cup he claims is the Holy Grail. Gualter Gutierrez, a merchant that deals with fine leather, believing that the Grail will bring him more food fortune, sells all his asserts to raise the necessary cash to but the Grail. Unfortunately he is murdered and all his money is stolen, thus leaving his remaining family quite destitute. However it is Gualter's son, Marti, that causes Issac to become more involved in the doings of the Christians in his city. Marti gets it into his head that Astruch, the Jewish banker who had lent Gaulter some of the money for this failed enterprise, was somehow involved in his father's murder, and drunkenly begins to procalim this about the city. This of course dismays Issac -- it is quite a serious thing to accuse a Jew of killing a Christian -- and so in spite of his rabbi's disapproval, Issac decides to investigate matters before Marti's accusations against Astruch is taken seriously by anyone.Who could have murdered Gaulter? Was it the conman? Or was it someone else with a more nefarious purpose? Issac will have to sift to much before he finds out the truth about who murdered Gaulter and why.This is an interesting novel, and Caroline Roe does a wonderful job of evoking the feel of 14th century Spain, esp the politics and intrigue of the times. Another nice point was that she fleshes out more of the peripheral characters that surround Issac, thus making the novel more interesting and involving the reader more in the goings on in the novel. Also, I think that Caroline Roe has struck gold in her creation Issac the physician -- here is a chracter that does not allow the petty opinions of others to rule his judgement in his pursuit of justice. An enjoyable installment in an interesting series."},{"Title":"Solace for a Sinner (Isaac of Gerona)","review":"In 1354, rumors abound that in the Pyrenees Mountain village of Taull lies the Holy Grail. The cup that Jesus and his disciples used at the Last Supper is blessed and contains powers that many mortals want for selfish reasons. A peddler, Baptista offers a silver cup to the highest bidders among Christian travelers in Gerona, Spain. The winner Master Gaulter arranges to meet with Baptista at the nearby cathedral to complete the deal.The exchange never occurs because someone kills the buyer and apparently takes the money too. Rumors fly that the sacred chalice is in Gerona leading to mass hysteria that the powers of the Holy Grail will destroy everyone. Isaac, a blind but respected Jewish physician realizes that Baptista's cup has no power except that being spread to misinform and frighten the townsfolk. When an unknown assailant murders Baptista, fear grips Gerona forcing Isaac to investigate what he believes is a human killer.Readers receive a vivid picture of the Jewish community in mid-fourteenth century Spain and how the segregated group relates to their Christian neighbors. Some prejudice exists, but for instance, Isaac receives much respect as a successful physician in spite of his religion. The well drawn historical mystery pulls the audience into the tale and will send readers seeking previous novels in a strong series that gets better with each new book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Technical Writing For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"As an experienced technical writer already, I bought this book as a general desk reference. It has been a helpful guide when I needed to check something in particular, but I would not use it as a &quot;course textbook&quot; if I was learning the trade.Generally, the content is excellent - it covers all the basics a novice tech writer needs to know. However, I question the way the content has been organized and presented... it doesn't follow a logical order. There's a section on editing, then a section on brainstorming and figuring out how to start writing, and then later on it swings back to proofreading. Ideally, the information should be presented the same way the writing process generally works: brainstorming, writing the first draft, THEN proofing/editing, and so on.I also found the short section on &quot;preparing the technical brief&quot; inadequate, considering planning and scoping out requirements is THE most important phase of any documentation project. And for some reason, this information is buried in the &quot;understanding your reader&quot; section, when it should be a separate section all its own (as information about your audience forms only PART of a project plan).The author has included a few too many personal experiences in this book - understandably she wanted to inject some fun into what could be pretty dry reading material, but her style sometimes comes off as too &quot;cute&quot;.Overall, this book contains a lot of excellent content - the structure and presentation just need to be re-tooled for maximum effectiveness."},{"Title":"Technical Writing For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"From the Introduction to the Appendixes in the back, the author covers a lot of different and important topics about the business of Technical Writing with this book.

I liked that especially, considering how many manuals I've read that were full of &quot;gobbledgook.&quot;There are also sections on various kinds of technical documents, including the famous &quot;user manual,&quot; abstracts, specification sheets (with detailed explanations of the different kinds of spec sheets), giving presentations and &quot;white papers.&quot; Also informative were chapters on doing online research (and the type of search criteria to use when doing this), computer-based and web-based training, and online help.

I am literate but have had no formal training in technical writing.

Near the start of the book, the author recommends that you write your name on it clearly in case the book goes missing. If this is the kind of handy hint that you find useful, then the rest of the book will not disappoint you. Throughout it is written in a condescending, overly chummy manner, as if the author is trying to get a two year old to eat a Brussels sprout. I hope I never have to wade through any technical documents written by her if this is the style she usually employs to get ideas across.There are sections that are entirely useless and have presumably been added in to pad out the book (the useful points could certainly have been boiled down to a small pamphlet). For example, there is a lengthy chapter on 'using the internet to perform research', which roughly equates to a 'how to use google' guide. Helpful.Ultimately, this reads like it was written to make a fast buck. I really couldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you actually are an eight-year-old child putting together a manual on building a sand castle, in which case, this book's for you.

I have a large selection of books on this division and there are some photos here that I have never seen before.Granted some of the photos are grainy or are not able to be clearly seen, but it adds to the realisim of being under fire when these were no doubt taken.There are a large number of armour shots and of the prominent members of this division including Deitrich, Peiper etc.The maps are a little poor and lack detail and are not easy to understand.Overall a good photo history but do not going looking for a lot of narrative because that is not what this book is about."},{"Title":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology","review":"Eberhard Jungel wrote a book aptly entitled \\"God as the Mystery of the World.\\" If this is true, and indeed God is the mystery of the world, then to understand the world, and Christian doctrine as it interpretes the world, one must understand God. This has been the thematic task of many theologians, most recently and notably, Robert Jenson, Jurgan Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, the aforementioned Eberhard Jungel, and, of course, the late, great, Colin Gunton, to whom the essays of this volume are dedicated. Gunton was one of the few to understand that Christians for too long have viewed the doctrine of the Trinity as a mystery, a puzzle to be solved. But more than that, it was viewed as merely a doctrine among doctrines. Karl Rahner once complained that Christian theology (in particular Catholicism following the Scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas) seperated the theology of \\"De Deo Uno\\" (The One God) from \\"De Deo Trino\\" (The Triune God) seemingly relegating the Trinity to an uneeded appendage, mentioned only after the attributes of the One God were expounded. If the idea of God could be explained without initial reference to the Trinity, then the idea could arise that perhaps Trinitarianism was an unessesary addition to an otherwise \\"proper\\" monotheism. Rahner recommended that we treat the two doctrines together, so that we cannot understand the \\"what\\" of God's essence apart from the \\"who\\" of the persons of the trinity. Gunton took Rahner's idea a step further, understanding that all of Theology, even when it references other things like man or the world, was essentially an unpacking of its relationship to God, and hence systematic theology is itself produced within a trinitarian framework. \\"The Trinity,\\" writes Robert Jenson, \\"is not a puzzle to be solved, but a framework in which all puzzles are solved\\"; so too goes Colin Gunton, who saw in the Trinity the richest depths of reality itself encountering us in the Three-Personed God.The essays in Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology, edited by Dr. Paul Metzger of Multnomah Seminary in Oregon, a former student of Colin Gunton at Kings College London, are not only dedicated as such to Colin Gunton, but the scope and the framework itself is preformed always as an outworking of the idea of Trinity. The essays progress in a fairly standard order for systematic theology, e.g. prolegomena, scripture and revelation, etc... yet all attempt to move beyond tradition by heavily emphasizing the necessity of understanding and working the implications that our God is Triune and not a simplistic monad. All the contributors to the book are, obviously, related in some way to Gunton, some being Gunton's former students, former teachers of Gunton (in the case of Robert Jenson, who actually was Gunton's thesis advisor), and contemporaries, and all are equally motivated by Gunton's vision of a truly Trinitarian theology.Tribute aside, all the essays are quite well written, if not brief. Details of most of the essays have been mentioned in the other reviews, so I wont repeat them here. Most of the essays, excluding the essay by Miroslav Volf, which is actually extracted from one of his books and so is longer, are a mere 10-12 pages (and that sometimes includes the chapter-notes). This is both a curse and a blessing. These are pages densly packed with information, yet sometimes the unexpected insight leaves you wanting more (not a failing of a good book, to be sure) because it is rare that such a number of brilliant scholars come together with a unified purpose such as this. Also, despite enjoying the closing remarks, and brief theological discussion, of Robert Jenson, I was hungry for an essay and didn't get one. Yet all of this is small complaint, especially when weighed against the greater contribution of the book as a whole. Some of my personal favorite essays include the interesting discussion of the atonement by Pfleiderer, the essay on Scripture and Revelation by Metzger, the essay by Frost on Sin, Miroslav Volf's essay, and the essay on the Trinity in the Old Testament (I would, in particular, have enjoyed an expanded version of it) If you are at all interested in theology, this is an absolute must read, no questions asked. I also heartily recommend any works by Colin Gunton himself (e.g. Act and Being; The Promise of Trinitarian Theology; The Triune Creator; The Actuality of the Atonement; The One, The Three, and the Many; Yesterday and Today; etc....)"},{"Title":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology","review":"As Shakespeare wrote, \`Come what come may/ Time and the hour runs through the roughest day' (Macbeth, 1.3.156-7), time has a way of exposing mystery, and the greatest of all mysteries today is that of the Trinity. The typical mind set of the Trinity being the greatest mystery of the Christian faith tends to create an atmosphere of distance within the sphere of theology. This distance however, is made to be but a small step through giant leap of excellence in Trinitarian scholarship found within the pages of Trinitarian Soundings. Dedicated to the memory of a pioneer in the resurgence of Trinitarian theology, the late Professor Colin E. Gunton, the essays in this volume are as Bruce McCormack states in his forward to the book, \`proof that his legacy lives on.'Gunton's legacy draws out the crucial element of theology as it approaches all aspects of the faith from a Trinitarian perspective. Because a Trinitarian perspective is central to the theologian's overarching enterprise, this book is a must for all who desire to step further into the reality of our One and Triune God. As Paul Metzger, the editor of Trinitarian Soundings notes, \`Ultimately, much of the renaissance in Trinitarian theology involves reflecting on the revelation of the Triune God, and seeking to think outward from it.'For when man lives apart from the revelation of God in Christ and through the Spirit, chaos is the norm. But life lived in and through the Trinity as revealed by the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit, humanity becomes fully human. Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology explores interfaces between Trinitarian thought and major themes of systematic theology such as Prolegomena (Rae, Chapter 1), Revelation (Metzger, Chapter 2), the Imago Dei (Grenz, Chapter 7), Atonement (Pfleiderer, Chapter 10), the Church (Volf, Chapter 12), the Eucharist (Molnar, Chapter 13), and Eschatology (Kapic, Chapter 14).Trinitarian Soundings is a must read for all who wish to be consumed further by the overflowing love of the Father Son and Spirit that has been poured out into our hearts while also developing a deeper understanding of our One and Triune God. As noted in the introduction of the book, the Trinity is not a \`separate puzzle to be solved, but the framework within which all theology's puzzles are to be solved.' Trinitarian Soundings is an excellent resource for the scholar and the layman as it is a theological gem that builds upon the resurgence of Trinitarian theology initiated by Gunton while sustained through the work of the fine scholarship of each of the contributors.The importance of this present work is crucial in today's ever-present desire for a better understanding of both theology and humanity. It is only through a Trinitarian perspective that the union--the relationship between the divine and human being in interpersonal and communal terms can be understood. Thus, as Metzger notes in his introduction, Trinitarian Soundings offers the essential \`theological enterprise that recovers and extends the Trinitarian tradition in order to reshape classic systematic loci in particular ways.'There will be no disappointments in reading this book--except maybe that it had to end. Trinitarian Soundings is sure to become a classic reference for all who seek to enter into the reality of the Trinity."},{"Title":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology","review":"Trinitarian Surroundings presents a great introduction to the study of the Trinity.

I wish the Gaithers would republish. This has all the old familiar hymns and the Gaither music we all love."},{"Title":"Worship His Majesty","review":"This review is of the navy-blue (hardbound) pew hymnal called WORSHIP HIS MAJESTY, edited by Fred Bock, (c) 1987 by Gaither Music Company, ISBN G-941565-00-9. It's now over 25 years old, but believe me there are plenty of people who wish the Gaither Co. had kept it in print. In many respects it set the pattern for nondenominational hymnals to come, with bible verses subcaptioning the names of hymns and frequent spoken worship elements mixed in with those hymns (bringing the actual number of hymns down to about 550). It has an excellent mixture of traditional hymns, gospel hymns, and modern hymns and praise music. Hymn no. 1 in the book, echoing its title, is Jack Hayford's \\"Majesty,\\" followed by two far more traditional hymns, \\"Come Thou Almighty King\\" and \\"All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name.\\" Other selections in this very versatile hymnal include \\"I'll Fly Away,\\" \\"He Touched Me,\\" \\"Let All Things Now Living,\\" \\"Let's Just Praise the Lord,\\" \\"It's Beginning to Rain\\" (Yes, there are a great many Gaither songs here), \\"His Eye Is On the Sparrow,\\" \\"If That Isn't Love,\\" \\"Wonderful Words of Life,\\" \\"Bind Us Together,\\" \\"Because He Lives,\\" \\"Fill My Cup, Lord,\\" \\"Children of the Heavenly Father,\\" and \\"Holy Ground.\\" Personally, I missed \\"Here I Am, Lord,\\" \\"Hail Thee, Festival Day,\\" and \\"Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life,\\" but you can't have everything. WORSHIP HIS MAJESTY indeed, in my opinion, so closely approximated perfection (at least at the time of its compilation) that it still ranks among the very best. Good used copies of WORSHIP HIS MAJESTY are usually expensive and understandably so, because few owners want to give this treasure up. If the Gaithers don't intend to bring out a new edition of this work, I wonder which of today's nondenominational hymnals they'd recommend? WORSHIP & REJOICE, CHRISTIAN LIFE, CELEBRATING GRACE?? All fine hymnals but they haven't yet acquired the lustre of WORSHIP HIS MAJESTY."},{"Title":"Beyond horizons : a half century of Air Force space leadership (SuDoc D 301.2:H 78)","review":"If you are interested in the details of how the military space capabilities of the United States grew, this book has most of the unclassified details. I wouldn't read it if I wanted an entertaining novel-like read. However, if you want to know what missions Air Force Space Command organizations are tasked with, and what systems they fly, this book tells the story in as much detail as possible. The author had to submit a proposal to Air Force Space Command Headquarters and be chosen from several competitors to be able to write this book. The creation of the book had support from the Air Force and was reviewed by the Air Force. It is very informative.Meanwhile, the copy I received, which has a cover that looks like the picture on the Amazon web site, is printed from a bad scan of the book. The font is too small and it is also fuzzy. It is almost impossible to read. Also this copy has no pictures, even though the forward of the book describes how carefully they selected the pictures. Since the Air Force paid for this book, there is no copyright, so someone scanned it and printed it and they did a very poor job. You can find the scan on the web just by searching for the title, so if you can stand the fuzzy font, you can read it for free without purchasing this poor excuse for a print job.

The introduction provides the thesis of the book: \`It focuses on the changing relations between Christianity and society and looks, in particular, at the ways in which Christianity has related to power' (1). Woodhead's book is a study of religion in its social locatedness; a study of Christianity's \`force relations' (Foucault). Christian faith, whatever else it might be, is a form of power; it is a form of religious, social, ideological, cultural, pastoral, and personal power.The author adds a further clarification to her thesis-statement, \`Above all, the book considers Christian history in terms of two competing models of power-power from on high and power from below-and the consequences of the church's tendency to favour the former over the latter' (1).There seems to be two parallel themes next to Woodhead's main thesis. The first is Woodhead's analysis of voluntarist/non-voluntarist forms of Christianity. The studied opposites are \`from on high/non-voluntarist/male' and \`from below/voluntarist/female.' The second parallel theme is the gradual subjectivization of the Christian religion. This topic shows up in the second part of the book, which studies the modern period of the church history.In Woodhead's own words, her book provides \`a thematisation of history' rather than a mere \`compendium of facts' (3-4). Precisely because her book is a \`thematisation of history,' one wonders whether the comprehensive title An Introduction to Christianity is completely justified."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Christianity (Introduction to Religion)","review":"Chapter 1, titled \\"How Christianity came to Power\\".

It is much more than a travel guide...."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"This was a terrific orientation to Cuba. Christopher Baker gave a thorough overview of the political and historical climate of the country, and his descriptions of the people and culture were always on target. He really demystified the labyrinth of getting into, around, and out of Cuba. We read the book as intently on our last day as we did before we arrived, always finding some new insight on every page. After looking at all of the other Cuba guidebooks, this is clearly the only one anyone could need."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"This is the best travelbook for Cuba, we have been there in feb '99 and even compared this book with The Lonely Planet. All (experienced) travellers agreed this book from Moon was much better than the Lonely Planet!!"},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"Baker's &quot;Cuba Handbook&quot; is unbelievably detailed and comprehensive. And those attributes are at the root of what makes the book wonderful and a pain in the butt. For example, the first 200 to 300 pages of this book (in other words, the entire length of a typical guidebook) is devoted to geography, flora, fauna, and a very good primer on the history of Cuba -- information that is good for pre-travel reading, but not particularly useful when one is there.The city of Havana takes up another 200 pages or so. Every detail of Havana is covered, from the most exhaulted buildings and museums, to the most trivial and mundane aspects of the city. But organization is sorely lacking. This is a book that is a daunting challenge in any respect to carry around with you (at 600+ pages, the book alone might tip the scales at airport check-in).One thing we were unprepared for during the trip is the sheer volume of attractions compacted in Old Havana. While Baker cannot be faulted for devoting a good amount of space in the book to these dazzling places and describing their unique details, they are unbelievably difficult to find in the book because they are not organized in the same fashion typical of many guidebooks (i.e., numbered and cross-referenced on a map). Instead, Baker uses the bizarre tactic of organizing Old Havana attractions by street in a straight linear pattern, making it daunting to find his comments on a particular building or museum if one decides to just wonder around. In other words, Baker expects that even if you are staying in the middle of Obispo street, as we were, you should walk blindly through to where the street originates so that then, and only then, you can follow along with his narrative. In fact, he offers no help whatsover in suggested walking tours anywhere in the country. Imagine a guidebook for New York being written so as to describe all of the attractions on Broadway, from lower Manhattan to the upper west side, then immediately continuing by describing the attractions on Greenwich back in lower Manhattan, and you get a good idea of what passes for &quot;organization&quot; in this book. Apparantly, the author and publisher expect you to travel a street in A to Z fashion, then continue on a parallel street back at A, with no numerical cross-references on a map to boot.I referenced the book while traveling in the area of the Bay of Pigs two weeks ago. First of all, there is not much to see or do in the Bay of Pigs other than to go to the beach (and there are much better beaches), despite Baker's claims and long passages about this area. The museum, which Baker raves about (&quot;superb,&quot; he calls it), I found terribly amatuerish (guns...lots of guns...and very poor quality photos and captions). If you have seen one Revolutionary museum in Cuba (and there are much better ones in Havana), then you have seen them all. It is a long detour to go to the Bay of Pigs only to find that there is not much to see once there, unless one is going to go through the nature preserve of Zapata. Buried in the book is a very useful detail that, once leaving the Bay of Pigs, make sure and take the first fork, because the second fork is a road that is unmaintained. Unfortunately, this valuable detail was so carefully hidden amidst other lengthy prose that I did not see it until being well into the bad road.Further complicating matters, is that Cuba is in a state of massive remodeling. Old Havana's and Trinidad's museums are in a state of massive restoration or adaptive reuse (for example, Casa Brunet in Trinidad is closed for a year of remodeling), and that makes some of Baker's descriptions moot. There are two massive art museums under construction right now. By the way, the architecure museum in Trinidad (and the wonderful guide there) is one of the best museums we saw in the country and gets only scant mention in this book. Also, I disagreed with many of Baker's beach recommendations -- the most astounding beach I witnessed, 23 kilometers of perfect and untouristed sand and water, was near Remedios (Cayo de Las Brujas/Cayo de Santa Maria), virtually ignored by Baker but given a strong recommendation in Fodor's.Despite its shortcomings, I found much useful information. With better organization, this book would easily be the essential guide to Cuba. Unfortunately, I could never figure out how to retain all of Baker's good details in a valuable way for my journey. This book needed a hard-nosed editor with a whip and a strong sense of organization. I bought virtually all of the guidebooks for Cuba, and a better guide for pratical travel purposes is Fodor's (I am usually not a fan of their books, but their Cuba guide is excellent in all respects)."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"Well written, informative and entertaining.

It is honest about Cuba, its people and history, and avoids the smug &quot;know it all&quot; political correctness of the Lonely Planet guide. It is also far more detailed and insightful.Cuba is challenging place to know and understand. There are multiple levels to it.

Chris Baker obviously knows Cuba quite well. Lonely Planet and Roughguide do not even come close to the thoroughness that he offers in the Cuba Handbook (our group was carrying a copy of each of these as well.) When the worst struck and all of my travel partner's belongings were stolen, the book was INVALUABLE - it contains a complete listing of all of the help services out there and ways to negotiate the Cuban police system and government offices.A few critiques: in reality prices tended to be lower than reported in the book (a nice change!), the book did not address the &quot;low income&quot; traveler as much as I would have liked, the maps of Havana are not detailed enough. Guess I should have gotten the Havana Handbook too!"},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"Chris Baker knows Cuba intimately. This guidebook is hands down better than the others (in fact, forget Lonely Planet on Cuba - trust me). It contains a brief history of culture and politics (the two entwined in this country) as well as in-depth coverage of the sites you want to see.Cuba is not a country where information is readily obtained. This writer shows he's knows his stuff, and has done years of homework. Read it closely.What you will need to supplement this guide are three things:1. A list of \\"casa particulars\\" or private rooms in private homes. The ones listed in Moon are already too popular and nearly impossible to get a reservation. (There are websites that will help you with this, or just ask a cab driver in Cuba to show you a few homes.)2. Restaurants. Moon does not include many of the the newer, better, private restaurants. No one goes to Cuba for the food, but nothing is worse than overpaying for a mediocre meal. Ask around for the good places, or do a search on Lonely Planet's Thorn Tree web postings.3. Clubs and bars. Some of the ones listed are institutions, but in Cuba the nightlife venues changes constantly. Ask locals, don't waste your money at some of the tourist traps mentioned in Moon.Have a good time!"},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"Reading Christopher Baker's book was one of the healthiest things I did before going to Cuba. The historical perspective Mr.Baker injects is not always objective but nonetheless very helpful. The maps were very accurate and helped me to discover some of the best out of the way places to enjoy music and good food such as the notorious 'paladares'.

The five star rating for these gudes goes to this prolific author Christopher Baker and his superb guide.Christopher Baker is an accomplished &quot;tell it like it is&quot; writer. He has a flowing writing style that keeps you engaged even during the dryer parts of a guide book.His condensed (38 pages) history of Cuba is one of the best I have yet read in any travel guide. Regarding his sections on Government, Economy, Society and the People, Christopher Baker's writing overshadows the other guides.After using his guide to investigate, and select,accommodations, food and sights to see in Cuba, I found only one case where the information was not current and that was with a restaurant that had closed. His reviews of accommodations and restaurants were informative, selectively bias and up to date; these are the most important characteristics of a good guide book. He has included superb imbedded blocks of pertinent subjects (i.e., Earnest Hemingway, Chi Guevara, Fidel Castro, the Cuban missile crisis, the special period, sex &amp; tourism etc.), good black &amp; white photos, scores of side bar topics that are full of informative caveats, a good selection of maps and the beginning of web site and Internet addresses.You owe it to yourself to get the best guide available before you visit Cuba: Get Cuba by Christopher Baker.

I bought it based on customer reviews published here, and it was the right decision. Before I left, it was great for orienting me -- after I arrived it was priceless as far as answering the many questions about Cuba that cropped up after a few days there. The book provides wonderful sidebars on such topics as: the Mafia in Cuba, sex and tourism, how Cubans feel about the Revolution, a brief bio of Castro, the history of baseball, how the governement works -- even info on what Americans can do to help end the embargo. My fellow travelers kept wanting to borrow my book during the trip. Although it was too bulky and heavy for carrying around all day in Havana (I preferred just a small map), it was perfect evening and morning reading to help me digest the incredible things I was seeing and learning about.

I do not think that there is a single town in Cuba that does not get mentioned at least once in the book. Havana gets a very extensive treatment totalling approximately 200 pages.Despite the research that has gone into this book, it is very difficult to recommend this book. Over 150 pages of the book are dedicated to very simplistic discussions of US-Cuban relations from a decidedly pro-Castro point of view.While many of the Moon Guides do provide some very brief political analysis, this one goes absolutely overboard with it."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Cuba","review":"We just returned from Cuba, using this guide and one by Knopf which we found useless.

The hardest part of the book is getting used to the different words and phrases that someone young in America might not be used to. But that shouldn't trip the reader up terribly to enjoy the central theme of the story. Chambers writes about a boy who comes to love another boy. What is interesting is how he understands the underlying newness that Hal feels towards Barry, and how Hal deals with his feelings towards Barry. The book never takes a high road on the subject of being gay, but tells it matter of factly, the story about a boy falling in love with another boy. Readers will know they are not alone in how they feel. I read this from an isolated high school in rural Iowa and this book certainly helped me get through some rough times.

One day he 'borrows' a friend's sail-boat without asking permission. A storm blows up and soon Hal capsizes the boat. Then into his life sails Barry Gorman, eighteen year old, expert sailor, who rescues Hal and who it seems will soon sort Hal's life out. Soon Hal finds himself falling deeply in love with Barry, and it seems his every fantasy is about to be fulfilled. But, as Hal reveals at the very beginning of the book, Barry's life is destined to be cut short.This book is written in a quirky, interesting, experimental manner.

The personal account features \\"action replays\\" in which Hal goes over the scene he has just described filling in the psychological details that could not be included in the flow of action. One important theme to arise is the 'postmodern' question of how much a written account mirrors reality?

This book made me cry, made me laugh, made me dream and wish; after all these many years, it's still as strong in its emotional power, and I recognise more than a little of my own personality in the infatuation and pain that Hal suffers.

In one of my classes, I had to read a book, We Are All The Same by Jim Wooten. The cover of the book tempted me at first because it was a real story and the comments of other people were praiseful. Although I had a hard time reading this book at first because several chapters such as chapter 1 and 2 were really boring, it was a really good book to read, overall. To briefly describe the book, this book represents the life of Gail Johnson and Nkosi. Gail is a woman who adopts a boy from South Africa, a segregated country, who is living with AIDS. This book shows many important qualities that we must have in life, such as courage and equality. Since this is a real story, this is more interesting and realistic. While I was reading this book, I felt as though I was part of the book. The strength of this book is that the book is not that long. The readers may become bored when the book is too long. a majority of pages tells of life's teachings while using very eloquent language. I really think this is the best book for any of the teenagers who are interested in reading the book!

There is a southern African boy with AIDS, Nkosi and Gail Johnson who tries to help Nkosi with her love. Gail Johnson adopted Nkosi and fought for his illness. When Gail Johnson took care of Nkosi and gave everything for him, we can realize our insufficiency of love and acceptance. I could feel how much I am taking everything for granted.

I was looking for some good material to expand my horizons about people infected with AIDS. But very soon my excitement diminished. I went through about half of the book, but then quit in frustration. Author takes an important issue of our day, topic that in my opinion does not have the attention it deserves (I'm referring to the problem of AIDS), but then adds a liberal spin to the subject, and promotes homosexuality, abortion, and other liberal propaganda, in the name of the fight against AIDS and love for the people that suffer from the virus. He sympathizes with homosexual people that carry the disease, and that's very noble - everyone deserves to be loved and cared for - but what annoys me very much, is the fact that the author promotes unhealthy and immoral lifestyle (I'm taking about both homosexuals and heterosexuals here..) that led great many people in to this problem in the first place..."},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"Too bad Jim Wooten couldn't get himself out of the story even tho he promised at the beginning to insert himself only where necessary.

He should stick to Tv or whatever he did before that made him famous."},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"When I read this poignant book, I wondered as to how some people seem to get it-- in this instance Gail Johnson who crossed class and race lines to care for Nkosi Johnson, the young Zulu boy who died at the age of 12 with AIDS-- and others either cannot or do not want to get it-- here I refer to President Mbeki of South Africa, Mandella's sucessor, who believes that an \\"omnipotent apparatus\\" is using AIDS as an instrument of genocide against black Africans. These instruments are pharmaceutical companies, scientists, physicians, medical researchers and Western goverments.The author of this book, Jim Wooten of ABC News, says that he is writing \\"about the relationship between a black child who never grew up and a white woman who never gave up. It has neither a happy ending nor even a promising beginning, for the child had no choice and no chance, and the woman knew all along what she was up against.\\" Like the current U. S. deficit, the numbers of AIDS cases in Africa, or anywhere else for that matter, have very little impact on us. They are so large and impersonal. But the story of the courageous young Nkosi puts a face on the pandemic and in a small way brings it home to all of us. As the youngster said so eloquently: \\"We are all the same.\\"Both Nkosi and his adopted mother-- she actually did not adopt him legally and, according to Wooten, made every effort to see that he maintained a relationship with his birth family-- were heroes of the first order. (I kept wishing as I read this book in one setting that Wooten had provided the reader with a photograph of Ms. Johnson. I wanted to put a face on Nkosi's adopted \\"angel\\" mother.\\") It is sad to learn that Nelson Mandela, certainly one of the world's heroes, did not speak out against AIDS as he could have while he was president because he was uncomfortable discussing sex. I would nominate the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, as an unusual hero too who did use his position to speak out about AIDS and when faced with opposition by the Catholic archbishop of the use of condoms by Uganda citizens to curb the spread of AIDS simply said to the archbishop: \\"'Your Eminence, shut up!'\\" According to the president, that's precisely what the archbishop did. He shut up. Finally Wooten is to be commended for breaking the rules of journalism and becoming emotionally involved as he fell under the spell of this young boy. If you read this fine story-- and certainly this is a great book for this season-- you will not soon forget Mr. Wooten's lying down beside the dying boy to say his own goodbyes.This remarkable story of courage and love will warm your heart."},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"Mr. Wooten has crafted a story of extraordinary elegance and simplicity.

In some areas of southern Africa the life expectancy has been cut in half. The hero of this book is a little boy born in South Africa. His growth was stunted by pediatric AIDS. He lived for 12 1/2 years before he passed away. The author met this little boy who had a wonderful sense of humor. The theme of his life is that he was a \\"normal\\" boy. He had a huge infectious smile that everyone loved. This little boy fought for the right to go to school and won that right for himself and others.In Africa AIDS is a heterosexual disease and a childrens disease. This little boy, Nkosi, fought for the rights of all persons with AIDS. Nkosi had tremendous courage and his mantra was to do all he could in the time he had. He was even the keynote speaker at a major AIDS conference in South Africa. He spoke in front of over 20,000 people at this conference.Nkosi had a wisdom beyond his years. He was a very smart little boy. He had a sense of himself and was sophisticated far beyond his years. He was always willing to talk about persons with AIDS as he believed it was a cause far bigger than just himself.Nkosi had a classmate in school who became his best buddy. Nkosi's teacher was just marvelous and treated Nkosi without a stigma. Living to 12 1/2 years Nkosi was one of the longest living pediatric aids babies in South Africa. As you read this wonderful book you will learn all about a this boy's courage and his mother's great love for him."},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"By the late 1980s AIDS had become an epidemic. The dreaded disease was particularly devastating to black South Africans, segregated by race, poverty and cruel social stigma. Those afflicted did not know the name of this illness; they called it \\"the thin disease.\\" They knew only that to contract it was to receive a death sentence.Veteran news correspondent Jim Wooten had spent much time reporting war, strife and upheaval on the African continent. It is through Jim's eyes, ears and soul that Nkosi Johnson's story is revealed. In February 1989 a tiny, sickly baby boy was born to Daphne, a single teenager living in poverty in a remote village with no name in what had once been Zululand. Daphne contracted AIDS during this second pregnancy, so at birth her baby was already destined to suffer.While more developed parts of the world were setting up AIDS care centers, shelters and hospices, South Africa remained, medically speaking, in the Stone Age. Public officials refused to deal with the grave situation. President Thabo Mbeki stonewalled efforts to provide information about the disease and any possible treatment for it. In fact, Mbeki went so far as to say that AIDS medications were poison.Daphne was frightened because her tiny baby was constantly ill and could not gain weight. She crossed social and cultural barriers just to take Nkosi to a clinic in the white part of town where a kindly doctor gave her the dreaded news that both she and Nkosi were afflicted. Daphne was determined to place her son someplace where he would be taken care of when she became too ill to look after him.Gail Johnson, a middle-class white woman who lived in a suburb of Johannesburg, became an outspoken advocate for AIDS patients after meeting a friend's brother who was dying of AIDS alone and uncared for. She was appalled that AIDS patients were treated like modern-day lepers. Gail set up a shelter for these dying white men, and Daphne showed up on the doorstep of the Guest House in Johannesburg begging the shelter's staff to take her son. Nkosi did move into the shelter and instantly became the darling of both patients and staff. Financial problems soon forced the closing of the Guest House, so Gail and her family took Nkosi into their home to raise as their own. Daphne died when Nkosi was three.In Gail's home Nkosi received unconditional love, healthy food, hygenic surroundings, and a chance to be a happy child in spite of his illness. Much of the book deals with Gail's efforts to educate people about the need for treatment and compassion for AIDS victims. She had a real fight on her hands just trying to enroll Nkosi in school. Together, Nkosi and foster mother Gail became powerful AIDS spokespersons. Nkosi considered it his duty to speak up to try to soften the hearts of government officials and others who could make a real difference in the war against AIDS.The title of this extremely powerful book is extracted from a speech Nkosi often gave. Everywhere he went Nkosi reminded folks, \\"We are all the same.\\" Nkosi and Gail appeared on television broadcasts in America and visited New York to give speeches at worldwide conferences. Though Nkosi was born into poverty and disease in a Third World country, he had become famous long before he died at age twelve. His obituary appeared on the front page of many prominent newspapers. The courageous poster child accomplished his mission.--- Reviewed by Carole Turner"},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"We Are All The SameIn his short twelve years of life, a young South African boy through courage, determination, and love taught the world that Aid's is a killer with no concern for race, age, religion, or sexual preference. \\"We Are All The Same written by Jim Wooten deserves a five-star rating for is raw and real depiction of not only the life of young Nkosi Johnson, but of that of his world in which he and so many others live. With the help and love from two mothers Nkosi used his life to bring the world's attention to his killer; making his own life an open book, this young child born to poverty only wanted to help others living with and dying from Aids; although, the author indulges readers into aspects of his life that are irrelevant to the story, or the life of Nkosi this does not take away from the strong courageous, and heartfelt message that this book delivers.In the late eighty's and early nineties the word Aid's was believed to be here in America as a gay disease. But in Africa a continent that this disease took hostage quietly over the years this was the number one killer. Not just of gays or loose women, but for wives, husbands, and their children. One child born with this disease that was passed to him unknowingly from his mother used his illness to reach out and teach a nation.Handy 2Unlike most children born with Aid's; Nkosi was given a second life when his mother did the only thing she felt she could to protect her son, and that was to take Nkosi where she felt he would be safe from the life, and people around him. Living in a shelter for aids victim's as a baby Nkosi was taken in by the shelters founder and her family when the shelter went bankrupt. It was there in that house, with that loving family Nkosi received the love, nourishment, and courage to live his life.Gail Johnson, and her family not only took in a baby who was at the time HIV positive, but together they took on his disease. Every battle was fought together as a family, and every triumph was celebrated together as a family. In the house Nkosi received the love that kept him living longer than he was expected to. It was with this love he and his foster mother felt for other Aids victims that sent the two of them on his life long crusade. From his first interview with Nkosi Johnson Jim Wooten admits to being drawn to him, and the courageous women that loved him.This book is truly a treasure. I was moved and enlightened by the story of this young boy's life. From this book any one who reads it will be in for an emotional treat that will live in your heart and memory forever. It educated me on the crusade of Hiv and Aid's, and just how far we as people have come with the acceptance and understanding of it's victims.

The book also details the social, environmental, and political environment which allowed this treacherous disease (AIDS) to pollute and emaciate entire populations of citizens: A disease which knows no boundaries; a disease which does not discriminate; a disease that kills all that are infected by its virus.Wooten is a writer to be revered for his honesty, and applauded for covering what is often regarded as a subject to be discussed in hushed circumstances.As compelling as \\"Tuesday's with Morrie,\\" this book will leave the reader in a state of deep thought and introspect. \\"We Are All the Same\\" forces the reader to enter an emotional state that opens the heart to the raw brutality of the consequences of AIDS and the unfortunate position that many developed nations take as they turn a blind eye to what is commonly referred to as the \\"Dark Continent.\\"Angela, PhD Candidate"},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"This a very touching book about Nkosi, a young South African boy who had the HIV/AIDS virus.

This story was definitely told by someone passionate about the subject and emotionally involved with the characters--in a good way. I am so thankfuls that someone has told Nkosi's story and the story of South Africa. It is pretty even and doesn't shy away from the flaws of its heroes or the truth of the times.

Also, just a great story."},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"The battle against HIV and AIDS can boast any number of heroes (and cowards), and ABC News correspondent Jim Wooten focuses on two of the more courageous warriors. Gail Johnson, a white woman in South Africa, selflessly took it upon herself to establish a hospice for adults living with AIDS--a non-profit undertaking that inevitably collapsed from lack of support and money. During Johnson's tenure as director, Nkosi, a three-year-old Zulu boy with AIDS, arrived at the hospice and Johnson and her family ultimately (and unofficially) adopted him for the remainder of his life. \\"The boy became an instant star,\\" both at the hospice and at home.Nkosi wasn't expected to live more than a few months or years yet, defying the medical odds, lived to the age of 12--and through a series of events (not to mention his preternaturally magnificent eloquence) became an international face of AIDS in Africa. \\"We Are Not the Same\\" is his and Gail's story: how they confronted ignorance and cowardice, the NAMBY attitudes of their neighbors, the horrific health issues, the forlorn poverty of the boy's blood relatives (as well as a distrust of Gail that alternated with an opportunism born of desperation), the bewildering media attention and global celebrity, and even South African President Thabo Mbeki's dangerous and egocentric denial of the causes of AIDS.I generally spurn anything that smacks of sentimentalism, and I'm not a fan of books that deliberately tug at your heartstrings. This account, however, is too raw and honest to be considered maudlin; while Wooten surely doesn't shy away from the tear-jerking scene, I don't think there was a more suitable way for him to tell this story. Indeed, Wooten admits, \\"with some reluctance . . . I have inserted myself into certain aspects of their story\\" as a means of \\"coming to grips on this historical, emotional, political terrain on which it occurred.\\" He strikes the right balance; to pose behind a fictitious journalistic mask of objectivity when faced with such a child and such a tragedy would have been a mistake. It's been many a year since a book's pathos affected me to the point of tears, and I can't imagine the reader who wouldn't be similarly touched."},{"Title":"We Are All the Same: A Story of a Boy's Courage and a Mother's Love","review":"Excellent book.

I found this book as a good assistant, very affordable, and works well on smartphones. Very well written and well organized, worth very penny."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"&quot;Wittgenstein's Mistress&quot; is a complex novel of simple sentences in short paragraphs describing thoughts that are all over the maps of history, the arts and the world itself. Presumably, the novel's structure is inspired by Wittgenstein's &quot;Tractatus,&quot; a series of short propositions, sub-propositions, sub-sub etc. presented in a logical sequence culminating in the final proposition, \\"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.\\" Similarly, the narrator of &quot;Wittgenstein's Mistress,&quot; a one-time artist who has come to believe she is completely alone in the world, presents a series of short descriptions of whatever pops into her head as she's typing. Places, people, works of art, episodes of history give rise to anecdotes, apocrypha and tid-bits about other places, people, etc -often inaccurate but always illuminating both our world and hers.The narrator forms this jumble of information into innumerable weirdly wonderful, laugh-out-loud syntheses. For example, a story that Rembrandt's students painted on his studio's floor images of gold coins, which Rembrandt would stoop to pick up no matter how often the trick was repeated, leads to the recollection that Rembrandt eventually had to declare financial bankruptcy. The narrator then combines these two anecdotes with the fact that Rembrandt lived in Amsterdam as a contemporary of the philosopher Spinoza to produce an imagined conversation between the two famous men in a corner shop. \\" \`Oh, hi, Rembrandt. How's the bankruptcy?' \`Fine, Spinoza. How's the excommunication?' \\"Sprinkled among these fractured observations are obscure hints as to how and why the narrator has reached the point of what can only be madness. As the insights into her personal history increase in the final pages of the book, a repetitious list of seemingly haphazard commentaries on largely external matters becomes ever more personal. By the time it concludes with its four beautifully poetic lines, the book has created a deep, disquieting pathos made all the more poignant by the narrator's immersion in a world that is a kind of embodiment of Wittgenstein's final proposition.Like the narrators of &quot;Flaubert's Parrot&quot; (by Julian Barnes) and &quot;Waterland&quot; (by Graham Swift), the narrator of &quot;Wittgenstein's Mistress&quot; takes refuge in a world of facts--in her case cultural scattershot versus the meticulous biographical fact of &quot;Flaubert's Parrot&quot; and local historical fact of &quot;Waterland&quot;--to avoid confronting a terrible personal tragedy. That this novel addresses such a theme with even more originality and craft than those two excellent books makes this a truly magnificent piece of literature."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"When I found myself describing to my friends the beguiling concept behind this book, I had to grin in spite of myself. The last person on earth sits down and starts to write, in a very particular style, whatever is on her mind. The inevitable questions flooded me: &quot;how did everybody die?&quot; &quot;What about animals?&quot; &quot;What does she do for food?&quot; And while these questions are certainly at the back of one's mind as one pores over her mental effluvia, it is much more entrancing to follow her trains of thought about philosophical questions, historical puzzles (not puzzles so much as head-cocking queries), and anecdotal information about great western artists, from Homer to Rembrandt to Martin Heidegger. Certainly the idea of being the last person on earth for years and years is appealing and frightening in and of itself; but what makes this such a fascinating book is that the narrator &quot;was&quot; an artist, and, without any real audience left, challenges the whole idea of the inherent value of knowledge, or for that matter beauty. Anybody who had fun with epistomology in philosophy class will like this one; also a treat for art majors, as a healthy literacy with art history is helpful in following those trains. A great read, slow in the middle, but utterly digestible on the whole."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"My, my, what a book. Such a difficult journey, for me: the endless art, historical and literary references were daunting. And the one-sentence-paragraph style and internal dialogue subject matter so jarring, especially after having just finished reading Infinite Jest (Wittgenstein's Mistress was a DFW recommendation). But I read on, aided by episodes of hilarity (such as the scene in which various painters and cats convene in the narrator's brain, or the speculation about whether Penelope really would have waited around for Odysseus' return) and moments of harrowing poignancy (the gravestone promised by a husband on a son's grave existing in the mind but not in reality). Well, it's hard to describe. But the last twenty or so pages were so intimate and frightening in their sadness as to make you want to reach into the book and hold her head to somehow stop the lonliness. Don't give up on this book."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"I have given this book only 2 stars to reflect my enjoyment and understanding of a novel I partially understood and thus partially enjoyed. My review is perhaps less a review of the novel than a short \\"diary entry\\" of my relation to this novel and to Markson's writng style. I have read 3 of David Markson's novels and greatly enjoyed Reader's Block and to a lesser degree The Last Novel. This one seemed by far the most impenetrable. A previous reviewer has said it was based on Wittgenstein's Tractatus. The reader seemed to enjoy the novel greatly probably due to his greater philosophical understanding. I guess I represent someone in between clued in and clueless. I read a book on Wittgenstein about 10 years ago so I as able to pick up on some of the subtlety but apparently one must really do some substantial homework to enjoy this book. This is less true of the previously mentioned Markson novels which do engage and reward the reader providing s/he has a broad awareness of diverse cultural references.On a literal level, the title is oxymoronic since Wittgenstein was gay and hence would not have a mistress but there is a sense in which those who are susceptible to to his philosophical probings are in a sense his mistress. In all 3 novels I have read, Markson's approach is to throw out statements that seem unrelated or linked in random ways, grouped in small clusters of \\"facts\\". Depending on the interests of the reader these ideas can be engaging in their own right. The more perceptive reader begins to see that what is actually being depicted are the mental processes and emotional attitudes of the narrator. Changes in the types of facts, their unique juxtapositions, repetitions of previous statements put in new contexts, and other strategies for arranging statements all point to the evolving changes in the narrator or the narrator's attempt to understand her place in the world. It is this underlying subtext that constitutes the \\"plot\\" of the novel. The effect can be quite moving, especially as the true significance of \\"random\\" facts come into focus. Occasionally, because of repetitions of various statements or obsessions, readers who are not maintaining focus, getting sleepy, or just returning to the book may incorrectly conclude they already read a particular page or passage.In this book, unlike the other 2 novels I read, the repetitions began to seem tedious. Some clarifications point to the limits of language,its contradictions and ambiguities, a classic Wittgensteinian concern. For example, the narrator notices that we say we \\"fight with someone\\" which can mean someone is fighting on our side as an ally or it can mean fighting against that person. Initially fascinating, this observation seems to become tiresome with repetition but this probably means I have missed some other subtlety in the novel. I suppose I was fighting with the text in both senses of the phrase. Another thing I found tedious was the long sections about a cat which may be non existent--again, I probably missed something.So, I conclude with a warning, don't come to this book unprepared. Be ready for an entertaining time but come armed. Read some of the other reviews and perhaps Tractatus."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"I found Markson's novel extremely engaging. Though comparisons to Joyce are inflated (comparing anyone to Joyce would be a mistake) I've never read anything quite like this book. An achingly sad exploration of loneliness and isolation - as well as art and literature - it is also (in places) quite hilarious. I highly recommend it - and not only to people with Art History or English degrees."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"This book has been recommended to me for years, mostly by websites who try to sell me books based on my high ratings of other books that might be relevant.Not that every other book I have read is relevant to this one of course.The websites, mostly selling stuff, lump certain books into certain piles.Like \\"Infinate Jest\\" and \\"You Bright and Rising Angels\\" and \\"Under the Volcano\\" for example.When someone has read and highly reviewed these books, per se, \\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\\" comes up as a must read.Not that any website can tell me what I must read, incidentely.Maybe nobody told me to read this at all.After having finished it, I feel like I've missed the points.Like history being written when there is only one person left to write it so it is flexible.Like being depressed and lonely can be traits while being alone or while being surround be people, also.Like history being depressed and lonely when there is only one person left to write it.Having said this, which I swear is the truth, I feel like I need to read this again until I understand every nuance that I am meant to understand.Maybe I am wrong about all of this.I might have read a different book now that I think about it."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"Original and inspiring, I find myself thinking about this book more and more since reading it.While I didn't find this book difficult, as others wrote, I think there's a dichotomy within it that contributes to that response.I think this:Markson wrote one book, a &quot;philosophical novel,&quot; if there were such a genre--the novel demonstrates, rather than describes, a philosophy--and in so doing, he utilized more information than just the plot, the style, and the philosophy itself; this information becomes a sort of second book.And I think the latter, the information that the narrator repeatedly discuses, are the &quot;difficult&quot; or perhaps simply &quot;different&quot; elements than the essence of the novel itself.A woman is alone. She tells us, in the first sentence, she is alone on the earth (&quot;At the beginning I left notes.&quot;) For me, there was a driving force to the plot - is this woman really alone, and to what extent? Is she alone in her house, holed up from trauma, or alone in her mind, &quot;mad,&quot; as she phrases it - though she claims she has had periods of madness, not that she *is* mad. I found this plot elemnt a mystery, and I was driven, as such, to find out the ending or &quot;truth.&quot;The other element of the book is the substance itself, what she writes--thinks about--and the way she writes it. This, I think, is where a reader can become tired (I saw reviews say it should have been shorter, though this is quite a short book) or wander from the material.The narrator talks a lot about ancient Greece, mythology, classical music, and limited-in-scope literature and art. Her focus is on &quot;high art,&quot; or certain pieces of, but not all readers will be interested enough in Helen of Troy or in Brahms to find her musings compelling. They can be at odds with the other compelling part, the plot.So, I think Markson has, in some way, two books. One is his plot/philosophical-novel and the other is the monologue of Kate, the narrator. I, too, perked up at times she did things near the beach house she lives - go for water, explore a neighboring house - and though I was/am interested in Helen, mythology, and literature, her musings were both limited in scope and each topic disproportionately covered. This would happen if any person's inner thoughts were put to paper - I may find Helen interesting, but classical music not so interesting.Where I think the novel fails to keep the interest of readers is in the disparity between her life (Markson's philosophical demonstration) and her personal interests.That said, for all my lack of interest in Brahms, et. al., there was an inevitable connection to her world - were there one or two copies of the book about Brahms? Did she burn one in a fire? Did she read it? Was it a children's book?I was riveted. I too skimmed parts, as others said, as there was just so much about topics not of interest to me. But, no sooner did I begin to skim, than I was reeled back in. The book is fascinating. Its execution nearly brilliant. If I may nit-pick, Markson's excessive use of the word &quot;doubtless&quot; drove me nuts. In character or not, it was too much, to the point of distraction and detraction.Last, I'll repeat what others have, the structure of each page, paragraph and sentence was wonderful. One-, two-sentence paragraphs, tangents of thought and reversal of thought, and her unreliable narration - contradiction of earlier things said, etc.I found the end heartbreaking, and reread the last line a few times to be sure of my interpretation what I'd read. It was fully unexpected; it didn't read as the jolt I'd expected but, upon thought, it was one.Riveting. Now, to figure out which Markson book to try next."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"Clever, philosophical, solipsistic, gimmicky, sophisticated, entertaining, maddening, playful, bewildering, funny, exasperating, poignant. WITTGENSTEIN'S MISTRESS is all of those and more.The novel consists entirely of a monologue - a selective stream of consciousness - produced at the typewriter over the course of many days, stretching from August to November, by Kate, an about-50-year-old woman, apparently living in a beach house, apparently on the shores of Long Island. Perhaps she is depressed, or mad, or grieving over personal tragedies from the past, or perhaps she is the last person on earth - or maybe all those explanations are operative.While her existential being is very lonely, the typed monologue must be a message she is leaving for someone else. And the 240 pages of that message are constructed by means of short sentences, sometimes sentence fragments, usually only one or two sentences per paragraph. The longest paragraph in the book is eight lines of print, but most paragraphs are three or less lines of print. That style made unusual demands on me as a reader, and although I adapted to it readily enough it still required a degree of concentration that I could not maintain for more than about 25 pages at a time.The novel actually is much more interesting and engaging than the previous two paragraphs probably make it sound, although I acknowledge that it is not for everyone (as reflected in the number of one-star reviews). As a general rule, I do not take to \\"post-modern\\" or \\"experimental\\" fiction - labels frequently attached to the novel - but ultimately I found WITTGENSTEIN'S MISTRESS very worthwhile.Part of the attraction for me is the wealth and diversity of the cultural references -- cultural baggage, if you will - with which Kate is plagued and obsessed: the Ancient Greeks (Troy, Helen, Clytemnestra, Electra, Cassandra, Achilles, Aristotle, Zeno, et al.); famous artists (Rembrandt, Leonardo, Willem de Kooning, et al.); composers (Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Bach, et al.); authors (Samuel Butler, William Gaddis, Guy de Maupassant, et al.); and even baseball players (including \\"Stan Usual\\"). Frequently, as do we all, Kate confuses and confounds her cultural heritage, at times in amusing and even enlightening ways. And sometimes the synapses simply won't work - as evidenced by her persistent inability to remember who T. E. Shaw was, despite numerous references elsewhere in her monologue to Lawrence of Arabia.The other major attraction of WITTGENSTEIN'S MISTRESS, for me, is signaled by its title. Despite her disavowal that \\"philosophy is not my trade\\", Kate's meditations often take a philosophical turn, especially in wrestling with the intellectual puzzles of solipsism and, a la Wittgenstein, the bewitchment of language. Some readers/reviewers opine that the novel is some sort of fictional \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\\". To be sure, one of Kate's sentences (in the middle of the novel) is \\"The world is everything that is the case\\" (the first sentence of Wittgenstein's \\"Tractatus\\"), but the novel does not develop logically or rigorously; it loops and spirals and interrupts and repeats itself. The philosopher evoked more by the novel is Martin Heidegger, and the philosophical epigram most apt is what Kate borrows from Heidegger: \\"Anxiety being the fundamental mood of existence.\\"Towards the middle of the novel, I became somewhat bored with it. I thought I understood the gimmick and, without much plot or character development, the novel was becoming threadbare. But the feeling passed - or perhaps Markson salvaged the situation - and by the end I was entranced. I hesitate to call it a great novel, but I reserve the right to settle on that assessment upon re-reading it, which I hope to be able to do in another few years."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"This is one of those stories that falls into the Big Two-Hearted River genre of stories, where what the characters are not thinking about is more important than the action on the page. For instance, the world has ended, and it is not directly stated how it has become devoid of people (but I think we all know). What does populate the narrator's thought are the biographies of the great artists of history. Is it possible to lead a meaningful life interacting only with dead history? This book makes an argument that yes, it can be done, but it will be no less tragic than a life with the living. The accomplishment of this book is that it almost convinces us that such a life may be no less rewarding."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"If language has ever or stolen your dignity in Paris, or slapped a large strip of duck tape over your lips; or if you've ever learned anything from a 4 year-old...I highy recommend this novel.

Not that oddness is bad (I enjoy Pynchon immensely), but this particular kind is. It is frustrating, repetitive, and does not offer much in the way of style and language.

Certainly not worth anyone's while who is not a student of philosophy, and hardly worth while for one who is."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"Honestly, I don't know what to make of this book. It was definitly a good read. A bit repetitive? Yes. Original and provacative? Again, yes. Comparable to Joyce?

This I can believe.It also received some highly favorable reviews from some hoity-toity New York critics, and this I have a harder time understanding.The concept of the book is dead simple. It is supposedly the journal of a mad woman who is, or believes she is, the last person on earth. Short declarative sentences loop feverishly around her brain, repeating themselves, correcting themselves, contradicting themselves, and filling in missing information many pages later. The tedium of this conceit is even worse than it sounds.The cover blurb compares it to Joyce -- presumably because of the questionable sanity of the narrator -- while the Wiki on it compares it to Wittgenstein's own \\"Tractatus,\\" probably because no paragraph is more than a sentence long. Both comparisons are entirely specious: this book is noFinnegans Wake (Penguin Modern Classics)nor is itTractatus Logico-Philosophicus.What it is is a long tedious experiment that, like many experiments, fails. Fails to entertain, fails to enlighten, fails to engage. Time to move on to something more rewarding."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"David Markson, Wittgenstein's Mistress (Dalkey Archive Press, 1988)I gave up on it. I understand its appeal for many, and it's probably the best example of what stream-of-consciousness would look like written down in first person by someone with an obsessive mental editor, but that as a convention doesn't hold up for as many pages as this novel wants to be. It would have been a great plotless short story, though. The narrator's voice rings true, if somewhat grating, like reading the two-hundred-fifty page rough draft of a meandering Andy Rooney column. And that's its major problem, it never centers on anything. There's nothing for the reader to latch onto and follow, other than the voice.Other reviewers have commented on the novel's originality, and I was never quite able to find it. Those who thought it original for being a first-person last-woman-on-earth narrative are encouraged to go read, well, any number of last-person-on-earth sci-fi works. Those who found it in the narrator's existential angst are encouraged to check out Alain Robbe-Grillet's The Erasers and Jean-Paul Sartre's Roads to Freedom series of novels. Those who thought it original for being a whole novel told from the single perspective of an unreliable narrator can turn many places, most notably the work of James Baldwin, to see influences. In any case, I missed the originality. (zero)"},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"This book was recommended to me by a lawyer friend who thought it was brilliant. The book makes great claims on the book jacket, eg &quot;it is &quot;as precise and dazzling as Joyce.&quot; Thats ridiculous! This is a quite shallow book for literary wanna bees! It has no depth. Literary allusions are sprinkled through it, but in a quite silly way with no integrity at all with respect to such plot as there is. The author will merely pick up the name of a great writer and make childish jokes: Joyce by comparison is brilliantly literate. Anyone who reads would be horrified by the comparison! The book is silly from beginning to end and hardly even at the level even of a parody. For that reason and a number of other reasons I got more and more annnoyed as I read it.

I really can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"David Markson's novel, Wittgenstein's Mistress, follows the stream of consciousness of Kate, a woman in mid-life who is cut off from all human contact. She has \\"gotten rid of all unnecessary baggage,\\" meaning that she is living a minimalist lifestyle in an abandoned beach house without electricity or running water.She is sufficiently self aware to know that she is insane. She refers to a number of events in her past that point to the cause of her mental decline -- the death of her only child at age seven from meningitis, the breakdown of her marriage, the deaths of both parents and the guilt and loneliness ensuing from all of the above. Gradually, the reader becomes aware that there is no other living being in the protagonist's existence.Gradually, the reader starts to suspect -- without ever quite knowing for certain -- that the world has somehow come to an end and that the protagonist is the sole survivor.The stream of consciousness narration is the most fascinating and challenging aspect of this novel. The protagonist's thoughts are out of focus, obsessively repetitive, factually inconsistent (she refers to her only child first as Adam, then as Simon and, finally, as Lucien) and without logical sequence -- all of which are indicative of her mental state. This makes the novel all the more intriguing. However, it also makes for difficult reading. Unless you're planning on reading this book in a single sitting, be sure to have a bookmark handy. Finding one's place in this book can be a challenge.Nonetheless, the protagonist always remains sympathetic. There is a purity and sweetness of soul that shines through the ramblings. Toward the book's end, she has what appears to be a moment of lucidity where she comes close to acknowledging the pain of her situation -- whatever that situation may be. The passage is absolutely heart-breaking.This novel is filled with hundreds of references and anecdotes relating to music, art history, poetry, drama, mythology and the classics. These references cry out to be looked into further. In this respect, this novel reminds me of the works of Markson's friend and mentor, Malcolm Lowry. I suspect that there may be hidden gems in this book that won't become clear until the references are checked out and the book re-read."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"This book initially struck me as a little pretentious and, I dunno, sort of experimental simply for the sake of being experimental . . . but, once I'd read maybe twenty or thirty pages, it started moving with extraordinary momentum . . . and how Markson's able to get across such complex ideas, such heartbreaking sadness, out of, essentially, modulated repetitions of a bunch of anecdotes is beyond me. Absolutely magical."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"The form of this work is unsettling. This is a good thing, as the world is unsettling. Good writing takes us to places we would not otherwise experinces and presents us with a humaness we may deny, yet share. This is the beauty of our look into the mind of Kate (Markson), a deconstruction like that of no other. The metaphors and symbols of this pained mind are well worth the work for those who make the effort--especially for those who are versed in philosophy, history, literature and arts. By the way, I no longer have periods and am now taking hormones. ; )"},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"I read books on the bus and on the subway between work and meetings, etc. With some books I feel like I make progress if I get through 3 or 4 pages at a time, and others I can breeze through as much as 10. With this book, I can get through 10-12 pages at a time on the bus/subway, etc. But it's still slow-going. It's not because I'm bored--parts of this book make me laugh out loud to the point of visceral pain. It's because I'm using my brain in a different way, and I feel a bit tired after reading those 10-12 pages. Tired in a good way. This book is a fascinating picture of the way someone's brain works, someone who's a bit off. I loved &quot;Kate's&quot; openness to putting things together, like imagining Rembrandt and de Kooning in the same room in Delft. The playfulness of the text and its underlying sadness moved me. But make no mistake, this text requires some work on the part of the reader. I like these sorts of challenges. Markson is not exactly &quot;bus-reading,&quot; but I do think he writes some wonderfully nutty stuff and there is a reward in it."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"The \\"I\\" who left messages in the street, the writer-narrator, is a woman of about 50, a painter, who presents herself as the sole surviving human on Earth. After years of searching for others, two decades perhaps, traveling the length and breadth of Eurasia and North America chiefly by commandeering abandoned automobiles and driving until their gas tanks are empty, she has cast off her her baggage and appurtenances and has settled in a house at a beach. She's now certain that there is no one else. All animals, from seagulls to scorpions and especially cats, are extinct. The woman has \\"occupied' several of the former world's great museums during her years of madness and searching -- she was a painter, remember -- and has traveled to the site of Troy, being somewhat obsessed with thoughts of Helen. And Penelope. And Brahms. And Heidegger. She has, obviously, all the time in the world to obsess. At present she is occupying her time by typing her thoughts. The typewriter must be pre-electric, one supposes, and must have an endlessly self-renewing ribbon; that's one of the most minor technical improbabilities of this story. In format, this typescript of hers might be called Stream of Consciousness, if only she could type that fast. Her thoughts, however, invariably get ahead of or behind her fingers on the keyboard, so digression and redundancy reign.That's how \\"we\\" the Unreal Readers of a non-existent future are supposed to conceive of this fugal, centrifugal narrative. Most real-time readers, myself included, will persist through most of the book in expecting some sort of back-fill, some explanation of what happened and/or what the actual state of the woman's mind might be. That's a bit of literary legerdemain by author David Markson, to keep us ploughing ahead despite the fact that the book is page after page of inconsequential dithering, excruciatingly boring and insufferably pretentious. Yes, I did keep ploughing. It's hypnotic, all that dithering, and besides, our clever Mr. Markson is not above tossing in sly allusions and witticisms, like those in a book for children that only the adults can appreciate.Honestly, I didn't like this book at all ... until I finished it. It's a midden of language, the half-buried trash heap of some perished tribe -- us -- but naturally no Indian ever foresaw archaeologist excavating the midden where he casually tossed a gnawed bone or a broken tool. The woman's trash includes some memories of her personal life but many more shards of her intellectual life, of paintings recalled, of books read and/or not read, of famous and infamous personages both once-real and once-unreal. Her memories are unreliable. Markson takes sly liberties with that unreliability, mind you, since this is after a \\"fiction\\" for sale. Stan Musial becomes Stan Usual in her tumbling consciousness, and Fyodor Brahms christens the boy Wittgenstein's cat.Wait! Is the woman actually dead herself? Or in a vegetative state? Is her stream of consciousness a simulation of Mind without Body? Is \\"Life After Death\\" just a perpetual flow of babble, an endless artist's cocktail reception that awaits us in Hell, where the names of every single painter -- or in my case, composer -- in history will be \\"dropped\\" over and over for eternity?No no no, I'm NOT going to tell you what happened! Would it matter if you knew? Suppose the woman is merely lying... Suppose she's typing away in solitude and pretending to herself and to us that \\"we\\" no longer exist? Solitude is an abnormal state for humans, isn't it? One does talk to oneself in solitude, though not necessarily aloud. One does still think in words, of words, even when there's nobody around to exchange words with. The fantasy of solitude isn't new. Robinson Crusoe talked to himself and scribbled notes. What if, what if you were the sole survivor of an extinction -- imagine yourself as the last ivory-billed woodpecker in a Mississippi bayou -- might you not keep thinking words, words, words? Or, if you had an internet connection after the Rapture or the Apocalypse, might you keep posting reviews on amazon even though there would never be a reader for them?So ... how does \\"consciousness\\" work?

In spite of its simple and aphoristic style, inspired by the book's namesake's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, there were times when I wanted to give up on the book on account of it being really intellectually daunting to interpret. The narrator's meditations may initially seem to amount to hardly more than an aimless plenitude of diffracted & atomic allusions/facts lacking any genuine connection to one another, which indeed would do little to engage and compel the reader to read 240ish pages thereof. But ultimately what Markson is trying to do (and in which I think he succeeds marvelously) in this novel is establish a fictionalized extension of what it would be like to live in a Tractatus-ized world, such as set forth in its eponym's first work. He weds abstraction with lived life, concretizing the ultimate loneliness and depression and the horrific solipsism that would inevitably ensue. Kate, the narrator of WM, possesses an obsession with factual and linguistic precision reflective of her appropriation of Wittgenstein's Tractatus-era worldview (in which \\"The world is everything that is the case,\\" nothing but a mass of logically atomistic facts) and of the attendant responsibility of creating and animating this otherwise empty world (\\"I have been appointed curator of all the world\\") via recalling and arranging and populating w/ facts, and forcing connections between said facts; she makes external history her own personal history. Aside from a few parts in the middle that are a little heavy-footed, the narrator's voice is compelling through and through, propelling the you, the reader, onward to a conclusion that might just end up crushing you."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"Wittgenstein's Mistress received 54 rejections before it was published by Dalkey Archive. I am glad this publisher from Illinois wasn't drinking straight whiskey bourbon when they chose to read the book for publication. The book is good (quite good actually) but I can imagine that it may be difficult to grasp for readers who cling to linear narratives or plots. This book is plotless! A plot can't truly exist if the protagonist, Kate, spends most of her time in her mind. And when she is not in her mind, she does bizarre things (or maybe not) like put a bullet through the ceiling of a museum. Though with this review, I can be uncertain about everything I write. I can even doubt about how I feel about this book. And I can change my mind if I want to. A book for art historians and super-postmodern enthusiasts (like me) and the like.

It is journal of an unreliable and possibly insane narrator. Her insanity is expressed not by any irregularity in her writing or by any dramatic illness, but by the fact that she appears to be the only one left in the world. She lives in museums, burning frames for warmth. She moves around using cars using the gas remaining in their tanks, and ultimately finds herself living in a shack by the ocean.Written in short paragraphs that slowly accrete and imply a larger narrative, the language is spare, with glancing beauty. The narrator's loneliness feels like our shared personal loneliness written large, imposed on the world. The spaces in between the entries, the activities implied by the gaps, engage as much as the frequently comic picaresques.I always leave this book in a fog, a little distanced from a world that seems newly strange; exactly what I seek from fiction. If that's not what you desire, this may not be your cup of tea.A fascinating book for Markson, bridging the antic intellectual hilarity of \\"Springer's Progress\\" (a book I unreservedly recommend) with the far more hermetic late novels, which even I find an acquired taste."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"there are numerous sensations we are unable to put into words. these are the reasons that i enjoy an intense conversation, sit on the beach, sip a cup of tea and perhaps most of all...pick up a book...wow...what a book...i am reminded of the solitude of beckett's ill seen, ill said; the relativism of pinget's recurrent memory; the textual exploration of robbe-grillet's topology of a phantom city; and so much more...so very much more...markson has allowed me to see the world and especially how i recall it in a remarkable new way...this the book i would take to a deserted island."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"Who is it?

But her oddly funny musings on history, literature, music and painting develop this weird, enthralling rhythm, as does the incredible sense of loneliness and isolation that those musings seem meant to ward off.

It's the type of book best discussed in groups, since it does bring up some interesting themes--the fragility of memory and sanity, the ineffectiveness of language, the impact of philosophy and literature--but oh, God, it's been done so much better by so many other authors (Joyce, Baldwin, Pynchon, Cortazar). In an interview published as an afterword, Markson even has the gall to scoff at the 54 editors who rejected his book, saying that all editors were nothing more than C students anyway. Subtext: if you hated my book, you must be an intellectually challenged and apathetic cretin. Call me a cretin, then, because I really hated it. It read like someone smoked too much pot after a few too many philosophy 101 classes and vomited into a typewriter."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Mistress","review":"What a disappointment. Highly touted, as an experimental, philosophical novel, it is instead a sappy obvious little boring nothing. The idea is this: Kate is a painter; she is the last person on earth, maybe; she is alone in a house on the Long Island beach, typing her trite observations. That's it. If this is a philosophical novel, it is bad news for both the state of philosophy and the art of the novel. Her little apercus are all about observation and remembrance, the real and the false, blah, blah. Nothing that wasn't covered with more wit in your average dorm bull session at any good university in the country. Like Wittgenstein said, \\"Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent.\\" Inside so many \\"experimental\\" novels, there is a little Stephen King story, crying to be let free (cf: \\"The House of Leaves.\\") Avoid this dog."},{"Title":"The True Face of William Shakespeare","review":"The professor makes a convincing...and very well supported...case for her major premise. Briefly, she establishes the authenticity of the Flower and Chandos portraits of William Shakespeare and the Davenant Bust as the work of people who saw or even knew William Shakespeare. Most importantly, she makes a convincing case for the authenticity of the Darmstadt death mask, which means it probably was taken from a plaster mold of Shakespeare's face made the day after he died.Why is it important to know what Shakespeare looked like? Mostly for the sake of natural human curiosity. But also because the authenticity of these four items helps to prove that Shakespeare was a well known and important person in his own time, not simply an obscure nobody from a small town, as claimed by those who favor alternative authorship of the canon."},{"Title":"The True Face of William Shakespeare","review":"This book covers scientific research validating the true face of William Shakespeare and the bust that resides in Garrick's Mens club in London. Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel spent ten years researching Shakespeare with bulldog perseverance. Although at times redundant in her writing style, she presents irrefutable facts that conclude his death mask has survived and, as I mentioned, his bust and that with significant numbers of facial markings match his known portraits, like the Flower portrait the portrait on his First Folio, his funeral bust, to be truly images of one man, William Shakespeare. Forensic science was used for validation just as would be used on anyone today. Because her research and efforts involved the best that forensic science has to give us today, it cannot help but be conclusive that William Shakespeare had to be a man of wealth... Only the wealthy had tombs with their bust on it such as is found in Stratford and his bust was done shortly after his death. Note: Since his father was the bailiff, known as mayor today, of Stratford, it stands to reason, William Shakespeare was not illiterate.I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves Shakespeare or who would like to learn more about William Shakespeare."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"'The Waves' is a sublime and gentle book full of diversity of V.Wolf's troubled life. I find this book very soothing at the same time and there is a certain continuity in it too. It may appear as hard work when reading it but I think time well spent. In my view it is a unique experience due to its unsual settings and characters. Although with no conventional plot the book is a masterpiece in its best form. My recommendation is high - in fact I believe the best book among Wolfs' prose."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"The Waves is a novel that both defies categorization and full intellectual comprehension. It succeeds in defying the former assertion because it so gracefully and so thoroughly casts the lives of six very human humans in a mosaic of sheer, nearly inexpressible emotions, thoughts, actions and poetry. The novel is a tapestry of whispers, each breath of each individual whirring off the page, soaring, then sinking into the psyche of the reader. I must admit, upon first reading this book I thought it possessed some incomprehensible message that would be lost amid the stylisitic flourishes and heavy narration of Woolf. I was wrong. No grand, incomprehensible intellectual discourse couched in the language of a great novelist here.This novel is about life: simply put, the progression of life from youth to death.Percival is the central character of the novel, personifying the mystery of colonial India, the grim reservations of his childhood friends regarding his station in the colonial apparatus, and his very existence, defining a Romantic ideal juxtaposed with a very serious, tragic reality under the Raj in India. After Percival's tragic conclusion, Bernard assumes the central narrative voice; he is the poet who will speak for the rest of the more reticent friends as the book moves towards a conclusion.I will leave the review here, having allowed The Waves to wash over me once again, so simply complex, simply put."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"I was lucky enough to find a first edition of this book (1931) in a used bookstore. It was a gift for my wife's birthday. With no dustcover, I did not have any information about the storyline. Afterward, I started the story, to see if I made a good purchase. With the slow beginning, I thought that I had made a mistake. I was wrong. The characters are honest and timeless. They allowed you to explore their personal thoughts as they did. As a reader, I became interested in their activities and viewpoints. This is a wonderful novel. I am glad that Ms. Woolf explored this style so eloquently."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"I must say, as a big Woolf fan, that this one was slow going at first. But persevere!

Just beautiful, extraordinary."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Expertly read by Frances Jeater and superbly enhanced with classical music, The Waves is the succinctly abridged and highly recommended CD audiobook rendition of Virginia Woolf's classic accounting of six friends, ranging from childhood to old age. Enduring monologues are presented with the rhythm and impact of poetry to showcase a complex work of literature that runs the gamut of the difficulties and enduring loyalties of the human experience. 4 digitally mastered CDs, 5 hours 14 minutes."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"One peculiar quality of many of Woolf's novels is the fact that they are more fun to talk about - afterwards - than they are to actually read, probably because the author had very peculiar ideas about what she wanted her novels to do. Because Woolf was always pushing the envelope of what a novel was, many of her books are very difficult to read. The Waves is probably the most difficult read this reviewer (and student of literature) has ever encountered.The lives of six friends are presented from childhood in a series of interior monologues. There's a glacial slowness that challenges our yen for action, and the episodic nature of the book (covering decades) is not really designed to hold our attention. The point of the book is in how its characters perceive themselves and each other, but since we never get \\"outside\\" to form an objective opinion, it's difficult to care what's going to happen next. Maybe that's good, because there's only one significant event that transpires during this long novel (a sad death), and if there's even the slightest hint of humor in the book, this reviewer missed it.Other \\"modern\\" novelists, such as William Faulkner, propose that each of us has our own unique inner voice, and they try to make their characters' interior monologues reflect these differences. But Woolf implies that these inner voices are all the same, or at least all six of these characters inner voices are all the same, perhaps by virtue of certain similarities in their environment. Or was it merely a shortage of imagination (or, dare one suggest, technique?) on the part of the author? In any case, this reviewer found that the sameness of the six characters' narrative voices tended to overpower the fact that they each had their own individual lives and personalities.Lest one get the wrong impression, this is indeed a beautiful book. Woolf's prose has a sonorous quality that borders on poetry, yet is so exhausting that it's hard to get through more than a few pages at a sitting. The first few dozen pages are especially trying, since we are never formally introduced to the characters, and it takes some time before their personalities are established.Some critics consider The Waves Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, and certainly it is the most extreme example of the interior monologue she ever produced. But because this review is for the general public rather than the literary press, I can not in good conscience recommend this book. Certainly it's a novel you'll either love or hate, and since you're reading reviews of Virginia Woolf novels, there's at least a chance you'll love it, but I'm giving it two stars, since despite its merits, the average man-on-the street won't get through 10 pages of it. Add one star if you are female, since you are likely more interested in the subtleties of human relationships than most men. Add another star if you majored in English at college, and one more if you've done graduate work in English. Satisfied? For the rest of us, Woolf's To the Lighthouse is a warm, delightful novel about art and family and the passage of time that nearly everyone should enjoy."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Typos galore. I am serious: Every few pages (screens) of 'The Waves'! This, a great, great work of literature -- proofread as if it were a company newsletter. Come on, ebook publishers, show some respect. For the artist, and for us readers."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"When you hear about this book, the story of several people told in thier own soliloques, from birth to death, from morning to evening, you think that it must be confusing to read. It is not. Woolf writes in an extreamely different form of narrative but still creates a novel you can read easily. You can read this book on so many different levels - and it opens itself up for very rich study. But you do not need to study the work to get so much out of it. You just need to sit back, open your eyes, and let your vision dance across the waves. A true masterpeice and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"The great thing about Woolf is that I can't choose a favorite of her books. After reading Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse, I couldn't choose, but it continued with The Waves. If you like her other stuff, you will enjoy this book. Be wary if you haven't read stream of consciousness before since that is all this book is, and I don't know how good an intro this book is to the style. I wouldn't recommend this as the first Woolf book, but if they liked her, this would definitely be on my list to them"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"The Waves is everything that a book should be. It is important to not get to hung up on the plot, or the characters, but to simply roll along with the ramblings as they illuminate life's stages and processes and perspectives. Allowing yourself to become each character as they are speaking enables you to experience your own life from a new, perhaps wiser, and certainly more informed perspective. It is hard to recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"English speakers everywhere should thank whatever higher power allowed for Virginia Woolf to write in their native tongue. They should, at the same time, thank her for gracing the world with books like \\"The Waves.\\" Difficult? Of course, but so is existence, and no one, in any tradition, has been better at expressing the tumultuous inner space of being. This book, told as a series of interior monologues told by six characters, broken into chapters by brief descriptions of a beach at different times of day, is not an easy read, there is no doubt about that, but it is not obscure or pedantic. Its \\"difficultness\\" lies in its idiosyncrasies, in its subjective view toward reality, in its fragmentation, in its personality: its difficulty lies in how well it parallels individual experience and existence. By allowing each character to speak exclusively from its own private and self-serving platform, it makes a noble attempt at rectifying the artificiality of the text with the unknowableness of life, even if it fails to truly rectify the rift (which is impossible anyway). Perhaps, however, it would be better appreciated if other works are used as an introduction to Woolf's style; not to say that To the Lighthouse or Mrs. Dalloway are easy books, but they are easier for the novice to Woolf's style to wrap her/his mind around. Reading it requires concentration and effort, but like trying to truly know a person, all the travail is worth it in the end. Immerse yourself in the book, and feel how great literature truly can be."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Woolfs book The Waves is a modern breakthrough. It is difficult to read, but satisfying if you take the effort. The book is about seven friends, and vi follow them from nursery school to their middle aged. The book has no traditional narrator, it is told trough the speeches of six of the characthers. They seldom communicate, its rather some form of poetic reflection. Although there is no narrator, the six characters voices is united by the same poetic imagery, so the reader gets a strong feeling of listening to on person, only reflected through the persons. Besides beeing an extraordinary novel, the book is made as part of the ongoing litterary debate at her time. The moderns wanted to write a novel without a plot, the important thing should be the rich life on the inside, with preferably no &quot;outer&quot; references. Some critics mean that her attempt has failed,I think the book is great, but read it at least twice! If your interested in modernism, you can't go around this one."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"This book is without a doubt the best book I have ever read. It is based in the early 20th century in London and the surrounding counties. It is divided by short passages describing the sun rising and falling, which are described in language which corresponds to the 6 narrator's increasing level of understanding about the world. At the beginning (when the 6 are in nursery school) the language is very symbolic and full of physical observation, which progresses to more socially aware language as their lives and their own understanding of the world increases. The events in the book are never described in a third person style, but are told as interpretations from the character's own viewpoints. The progression in the book is subtle and very moving, and I found at times that reading this book was like reading my own thoughts, so lyrically is the writing. The contrast in style and outlook between the 6 characters is well defined, but keeps the vibrancy of description and lyrical prose style throughout. This book is quite difficult to read, as the language and feelings of the characters can have priority over traditional descriptions of events in the book, but then it is so rewarding to read, that you won't care! I have been looking for a long time for a book that matches this in terms of vision and emotional depth, but have yet to find it either in contemporary or more traditional authors. I have read this book twice, and found it to be a more fulfilling experience the second time around, as my understanding of the world increased, so did my understanding of the character's feeling within the book. In short, a mind-blowing read!"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Before reading \\"The Waves\\": 1) develop your own understanding of Virginia Woolf by reading two or three biographies of her; 2) read \\"To the Lighthouse\\" and \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" --- note the poetry and the biographical relevance; and 3) then read Plato's \\"The Symposium,\\" or at least read Cliff's notes to get the gist of his symposium, or even a Wikipedia synopsis of \\"The Symposium.\\"Virginia Woolf was haunted by the Greek classical writers throughout her life. You first see those references in \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" (through Septimus). \\"The Waves\\" was Virginia Woolf's response to \\"Symposium.\\" Whereas Plato limited his symposium to meaning of love, Woolf expanded the discussion to the meaning of life."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"If I was forced to choose the most poetic and beautiful bookever written, The Waves would be a prime candidate.It far exceeds any other book by Virginia Woolf in terms ofsheer ecstatic poetic writing.

This is a book that I enjoyed, and will pick up to read again. I could hardly put it down. The themes are so universal that anyone can relate to them. I really felt for the characters and would like to know even more about them and their lives. I highly recommend &quot;The Waves.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"The style of The Waves may be daunting at first, but I urge readers to stick with it and open themselves to the rhythm, the beauty and the many insights the novel has to offer. The characters may be seen as individuals in the various stages of life, but I view them more as an amalgam of humankind, male and female, child and adult. Each one expresses, through private thoughts and reflections, the ebb and flow of life and perception. Woolf's language is as gorgeous and penetrating as ever, reaching the heart and bone of all that conspire to create a human life, a human consciousness. Virtually all of Woolf's works break with tradition, this one perhaps more so than the others, and it is, like the others, a stunning success."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"My exploration of Virginia Woolf has been a progression from To the Lighthouse to Orlando to The Waves. The Waves is not the best of the three, but does seem to be the pinnacle of Woolf's technique. Like impressionist painters in the same time period, Woolf was trying to see what the limits of her medium were--what could be expressed with the written word that could not be expressed in any other way. Her amazing creativity with metaphor and blurred boundaries of time and mind are in full force here. In addition, the book has a poetic (yes, oceanic) rhythm that is unlike anything else written. Ultimately, it is not an easy read, but is nonetheless an entrancing experiment of literature as dream."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"'The Waves' is a sublime and gentle book full of diversity of V.Wolf's troubled life.

And we each do. This \\"playpoem\\" is an intense and meticulous examination of self and being. It is driven by psychology rather than plot or even character. Six characters (Bernard, Louis, Neville, Rhoda, Jinny, and Susan) out of the main seven provide the interior dialogue which constitutes the novel. The seventh, Percival, is central to the novel, but only discovered and revealed through the thoughts of the other six. The point of view shifts almost seemlessly from one character to another, the only indication being \\"said Bernard\\", \\"said Jinny\\", etc.The book is dense. Woolf blends the characters until it is not always clear whether they are a single individual with different aspects or whether they constitute a single social organism. I, and I think most, readers will take some time (pages) to become accustomed to the style.Things are confused at first. But then, I think that is part of the effect Woolf was trying to generate. The world is a confusing place to young children and so perhaps a novel should be when the thoughts of young children who are not confident of their fit in the world are the medium. I found that the book became more comprehensible and the meaning clearer the further into the book I went. By the end, with the seven primary characters aged or dead, I felt I knew each intimately.This book rewards careful reading, patience, and faith in the author. The gems abound:\\"Beneath my eyes opens -- a book; I see to the bottom; the heart -- I see to the depths. I know what loves are trembling into fire; how jealousy shoots its green flashes hither and thither; how intricately love crosses love; love makes knots; love brutally tears them apart. I have been knotted; I have been torn apart.\\"\\"I have a little dagger of contempt and severity hidden up my sleeve.\\"Woolf writes a sentence as well as anyone and THE WAVES is full of well-crafted sentences. What you will not find is an intricate or traditional plot. The psychology of the characters takes center stage. Know that is what the book is about and you will not be disappointed. THE WAVES is not my favorite of her books. TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is more accessible and, I think, more enjoyable. THE WAVES, however, has a depth seductive."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"I had never read a book like this one. It made me feel like the bathwater after someone has pulled the plug. This is partly because of the unusual construction of the story. The characters never speak to each other! There are many things that occur to you to do to this book. For example throw it across the room, stomp on it or flush it down the loo. This book threatens your comfort zone. The waves is not just the name of the book, it is the book.

I thank the stars that this woman was born and was able to create all that she did in her short turn on this earth. Nothing, and I mean Nothing compares to the experience of Virginia Woolf.(well Proust does) If you have a hard time thinking as you read a novel just stay away from her novels. One must think and feel to be able to understand Woolf. There is no elementary school writing here like most of todays best seller authors who type out the same crapfeast with each new installment of trilogys.

Something that makes you think about life and your existence, or that just completely messes with your mind. Unfortunately, I'm finding books of this sort quite difficult to find thus far. I expect that when reading a book with lots of psychological aspects in it, that if it is good, it will certainly draw out some sort of emotion in me, be it good or bad. When I started reading The Waves, I fully expected that would happen (and was ecstatic to find something along the lines of what I had been looking for). Sadly, it didn't draw me in that much.I'm not at all saying this was a bad book. I did love the concept of it, the fact that there wasn't really a plot, you're just exploring the minds of a group of people. I also loved the way the surroundings were described, it painted quite an amazing picture of the landscape in my head. But that's about all I can think of that really interested me about this book. The story itself just didn't draw me in as much as I'd hoped. So while I do not think this was a bad book, I also didn't think it was spectacular. It was only mediocre to me."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Lacking much semblance of a narrative, \\"The Waves\\" is unlike any of Woolf's other novels, and it has a certain notoriety for being a \\"challenging\\" novel. It's not that the prose is hard to read--it is a short book, the language is actually pretty straightforward, and Woolf's sentences are nowhere near as lengthy as in many of her other works. Instead, it can be hard to follow; written almost entirely as the internal monologues of six characters (Rhoda, Susan, Jinny, Louis, Neville, and Bernard), the novel is somewhat like a puzzle, its lack of storyline requiring that readers assemble for themselves the various threads of six interrelated lives, from childhood to old age.Thus, the emphasis is not on what they did or how they lived, but on what the six friends thought during various moments of their lives. The alternating soliloquies display how the characters affect, mold, and influence one other, and there are moments when the thoughts of one friend becoming inseparable from the thoughts of another. They are, as Bernard muses, \\"a six-side flower; made of six lives,\\" six voices creating a unified chorus and finally merging into Bernard's final, chapter-long soliloquy. Pondering \\"the meaning of my life,\\" he, an inveterate storyteller, confesses, \\"How tired I am of stories.\\" Sequences of events and daily routines seem inadequate to describe his existence because \\"this is not one life; nor do I know if I am man or woman, Bernard or Neville, Louis, Susan, Jinny, or Rhoda--so strange is the contact with another.\\"It is a bold literary experiment: not quite fiction, not quite poetry, not quite a play. While she was writing it, Woolf had hinted that her forthcoming \\"novel\\" would be \\"written in prose, but in prose that has many of the characteristics of poetry. . . . It will give, as poetry does, the outline rather than the detail.\\" Behind the poetry, however, there are suggestions of a story (several of them, actually) involving love, friendship, life in London, a reunion at a resort, and a death that forever haunts the friends--or as Woolf put it, \\"people's relations to each other and their activities together,\\" told through their interwove thoughts. Separating the nine sections of these thoughts are interludes describing the waves of the seashore from early morning until nightfall, paralleling life's dawn and dusk and, of course, giving the book its title.Woolf admitted her nervousness about such novelty; she didn't think the book would sell and was surprised when it became a modest success. Readers who can forgo the pleasures of a \\"story\\" will find that it a thing of beauty. If it has a fault, it is that Woolf's experimentation is circumscribed by her adherence to the structure she has invented and by the somewhat overwrought (and certainly not original) symbolism comparing the lives of the characters to the passage of a single day. As a novel, it doesn't seem to me as compelling or as memorable as \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" or \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" but as poetry, it is sui generis."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"So happy to be able to have this on my Kindle.

This has proved a very popular book that Leonard & Virginia Woolf were not sure would be profitable.They ran the press by hand themselves. Balancing true creativity against the vagueries of endless social interaction in England was no doubt very taxing. Individuality and introspection did not come easily. Norms are always shallow containers and very easily irritated. I enjoyed leonard Woolfs tales of Africa and their travels together and always wished she had written a sort of Waves about similar things. In fact it is too bad there wasn't more books like Waves because it is in its own class.

I don't think she had any, but I have an independent brain. This is a tedious read, so tedious in fact that if you take this to some park to read, you'll fall asleep in a few hours.

Although I had never read any of her work before, I quickly became a fan. My professor saved the best for last - The Waves. This book is the most poetic, most profound, most intimate book I have ever read.No one speaks in this book. You follow the characters' lives from childhood to adulthood by entering their minds and listening to their thoughts. At first it is difficult to figure out what is going on. There is no narration except short poetic passages about the sea and the sun's placement over it preceding each section of the book (and each period of the characters' lives). By the middle of the book, you know who is speaking without reading the name of the character. You know how they think.I strongly encourage anyone who is even slightly curious to buy this book. This small investment can change how you view the world. The Waves takes much longer to get through than some whodunit, but that's the beauty of it. My husband and I read a passage at night before going to bed. It's best when read slowly, with time to reflect after a small amount of pages. You'll be highlighting sentences that make great quotes as you go. What a glorious book!"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Even if you've read other Virigina Woolf, you haven't come close to the experience of The Waves. Did you have to read To the Lighthouse for some class back in college? The Waves seems like a totally different author. Perhaps Jacob's Room comes closer, but still The Wave is unique:The whole text is entirely soliloquys in the first person. No 3rd person description, no omniscient narrator, just the opening of quotation marks, one of the few characters begins to speak, then the ending of quotation marks... beginning once more with the opening quotation marks for the next speaker's soliloquy, and so on and on in waves of thought.We follow each speaker from early childhood to old age, and we know them intimately by the book's end. Give the book a chance; at first I could only take three or four *pages* at a time, but also looked forward to these few pages every day. Later, I could easily read more and more, and truly the experience was like &quot;waves&quot; of life, lapping over my consciousness.If you like unique &quot;novels,&quot; e.g. Nabokov's Pale Fire (although different it's unique too), this is a must-have. There's nothing else like it, even in Virginia Woolf's body of work.If you can't take the full load of first-person consciousness, but like her dreamy style, then go for her book of short stories. But I recommend keeping the book, and treating yourself, a few pages at a time... you too will feel at the end of a magnificent life's journey by time you follow each character's thoughts to the end."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"You have never read a book like this. But don't let that intimidate. This is her most experimental work, but it is still much more accesible than many other modernists. Her sentences and paragraphs are intelligible; it's more the accumulation of pages that might begin to baffle some readers. Woolf obviously requires a good deal of concentration, but her best works are rewarding in a way that many difficult writers are not. (You won't need a professor nearby or a mess of annotations to guide you through dense thickets of allusion-filled, abstract prose.)I consider this to be Woolf's greatest work. Mrs. Dalloway may be a more pleasurable read and more consistently a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, but the Waves is often so intense and beautiful that it's devastating. In fact, there are times that one is a bit overwhelmed by the surfeit of emotion, poetic words, unremitting interiority.My Woolf pix in order: 1. Waves 2. Dalloway 3. Jacob's Room 4. A Room of One's Own 5. OrlandoI personally feel that To the Lighthouse is more of a work to be appreciated than liked--it's simply too refined. And I couldn't make it through Between the Acts--too many upper class English people sitting around a table in the country sipping tea and performing their subtle, boring manners.Wait, I can't end on a sour note: Woolf is a bloody delight!"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Although at times I consider myself intelligent, after reading \\"The Waves,\\" I must now concede to being mediocre in my intellect. Upon finishing the novel, I consulted various criticisms and opinions on the work to find that I missed much of what was portrayed in the book. Therefore, I admit to being ignorant. However, I still believe everyone's response to a work is valuable and this is mine:Just like many other works by Virginia Woolf, there were moments when I was absolutely swept away by the depth of her narrative and the poignancy of her descriptions. Put simply, she blows my mind and this is why I continue to read her. However, I often wonder if the subconscious mind babble that we encounter everyday is worth repeating. Perhaps there is a reason why we have public presentations and filter out much of what we typically are thinking. Therefore, my response to this novel is undecided. Upon finishing the novel, renditions of Shakespeare's \\"To be or not to be?\\" ran through my head. I find Woolf's characters and their ambiguous identities and feelings to be confusing and I feel frustrated by their inability to provide me with an answer to the great questions of life. Of course, I realize that life is supposedly more about the questions than the answers and if the goal of good writing it to provoke conversation and thought, Virginia Woolf certainly has done that here. If the purpose of reading is to somehow see ourselves and our struggles reflected in someone else's writing, then Woolf has accomplished that much. Nevertheless, I found the novel to be frustrating in that Woolf provides very little direction or resolution for the reader. I felt as if I was left hanging in so many ways.Final verdict (after my convoluted and likewise ambiguous review):It is certainly worth reading for those moments that resonate with the soul, but don't be surprised if it shakes you up, tosses you around, and then leaves you feeling more bewildered than ever before.And I still wonder what caused her to kill herself. I wish I had that answer."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"I loved this book, for both what it says - about life, time and relationships - and for how it says it. It is also true, though, that it is one of her less accessible works, and can occasionally be frustrating in its vagueness. To anyone considering buying this book, DO - it's worth it - 2 things that I learnt, though:1. This is probably not good as an introduction to Virginia Woolf, modernism or 'stream of consciousness' writing - it may be a good idea to read &quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; first.....2. If you're a genuis or an English teacher you may understand this right off, I don't know - but for the rest of us, I think that it's worth a second read, the first to feel the rhythm, and the second to actually understand the message (if that doesn't sound too ridiculous!) - otherwise it is easy to get bogged down and frustrated, as I did it the first time I read it. Every time I reread this book, I discover something new, despite the fact that spent almost a month studying it in depth....Good luck!"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"In this somewhat puzzling novel the sun rises and it sets, six people grow together from infant children to old age, and the waves crash endlessly upon the shore. That is about as close as you will get to a plot in this book. Everything else that happens, school, marriage, even death, seem to be nothing more than passing intensities amid the overbearing silence that is the roar of existence.I picked up this book after reading Mrs Dalloway. I loved Dalloway. It was the first Woolf book I had read and it blew me away. In comparison, reading The Waves was like taking a sandblaster to my eyeballs. She uses stream of consciousness as a medium to delve as deep as she possibly can into the intricacy of existence. Not much happens on a specific and literal level outside of the rising of the sun, but the endless poetry pouring forth from the perceptive cores (I'd say \\"minds\\" but I think it goes a bit beyond even that) of these six characters speaks volumes on the fearsome intensity of beauty, the vast complexity of sadness, and the endless endless isolation of the human soul.It is at times so deep and so personal that I felt more than a bit uncomfortable reading it. The effort is well worth it however. Woolf more than any other author I have read, struggles to communicate the hidden message contained in all stories and books... A message forever clouded in meanings and phrases... Lost in its own words."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"In my opinion, The Waves is the best English Novel ever written. Through this novel, Woolf solves one of the main problems of modern writing -- the problem of subjectivity, namely, how can we connect with other people in a real way, if we are limited by our own conscious experience. In the Waves, Woolf helps us transcend our own consciousness, helps us break down the divisions between ourselves and the rest of the world through her use of language.In The Waves, Woolf does not merely drop us into the consciousness of her characters. For example, the language at the beginning of the novel describing the very first sensory experiences of each of her characters, is too complex for a new born infant. Instead, Woolf uses sophisticated language to place the reader in the same mindset as each character, and in doing so the reader comes to have direct experience of another person outside of themselves.Every sentence in this book describes something real and true about the world. She puts voice to experience that I didn't know that I had. She communicates the very hardness of communicating and she does it beautifully. This book changed my whole life.The Waves is definitely a challenging read, but well worth it. I believe that anyone can enjoy this book if they are willing to put in the effort. Read it -- you will thank yourself."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"With Woolf, as with Proust, it is easy to accuse the writing of being &quot;dull&quot; and lacking action or even plot. But for these authors the language itself IS the action. Nothing happens and yet everything happens. Just as their work tends to shy away from the conventions of the novel, I believe they are to be read just as unconventionally as they were written. Specifically, The Waves reads like the longest prose poem in the history of the language. When read as a &quot;novel&quot; it does indeed become every bit as difficult as a lot of readers say it is. Though Woolf attempts to differentiate between characters as though straining to achieve at least the skeletal image of the &quot;novel,&quot; she does this only superficially by drifting from one name to another. The unwavering language maintains precisely the same tone and intensity throughout, and the focus of Woolf's lucid inquiry never drifts far from its central themes. The book is a series of dramatic monologues that blend indistinguishably into one another. Woolf was preoccupied here with mortality, transience, loneliness and the meaning of friendship, not with telling a story (though a story does get told in the process). As a poem, though, it reads like a great lost chapter of the Bible; a curious, explosive and inward lexicon of the human experience so sacred in its expression as to be humanly impossible. &quot;All mists curl off the roof of my being,&quot; Woolf muses in one of the book's most gorgeous lines. It is a perfect description of the alert reader's response: an exuberance bordering on epiphany. If Dickinson is right and the great poem makes one feel as though the top of one's head has been sawn off, then The Waves is a great poem. There have been many great writers, but few who approach the eloquent desperation of this text."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Considered by many who should know (e.g., E. M. Forester)to be Woolf's most brilliant work of genius, The Waves is a challenging book to read for many reasons, not the least of which is the style she has adopted. More like an extended Greek chorus than anything else, the six characters, whose \\"voices\\" sound identical to one another, speak their life stories in short, alternating monologues. Although the writing is very poetic, it is also very dense and very distancing. We never really warm up to any of the characters or get involved in their stories.I had to read this book for a class and, though I'm glad I made it through to the end, it was difficult going and I know I never would have finished it (or even gotten through ten pages of it) if I hadn't had the carrot of a grade hanging over it. We had to read the whole thing in a week which is really not a good way to tackle this book. Best read in small segments, leisurely, absorbing each moment Woolf choses to highlight. Definitely not a plane or beach book!If you haven't read Woolf before, this is not the book to start with. Mrs. Dalloway is, in my opinion, the best and most accessible of Woolf's experimental fictions and a good starting place for access into this great 20th century author's works. Then, if your brave, move onto \\"To the Lighthouse\\" and then, shudder, \\"The Waves.\\""},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Our book club in Cancun read it for April. We can be a critical group, but this one received nothing but praise from those of us who actually FINISHED it. Through the night the message was \\"It's well worth it! Stick with it!\\" It is confusing at the beginning for those of us who've been reading best sellers awhile, and it was hard to learn to pace your reading. (Some advice: don't tackle it for less than 30 minutes at a time, and do some biographical research on Woolf before or while you read it).I'd love to give some of our group's analyses, but that might ruin it for some of you. I'll limit that to just saying that we had a very fine conversation that night, full of thoughtful speculation. And many of us have been commenting that meeting for days afterward. We're a very small community here, and culture is hard to come by. Woolf brought it to us on the waves (sorry). The Waves is prose; it's a work of art. What a pleasure! You can expect conversation about this novel to be of a higher literary level. It's a great book club read because it creates lots of thoughts to share."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Virginia Woolf,incredibly, weaves a magnificent prose poem that left me - almost - speechless. The tone, the sheer emotionality of this creation (I feel the mere terms book, or novel, are somehow unsuitable), transported me into the inner worlds of Bernard et al. and away from my own mundane strivings. Read this book for beauty, for escape. Read this book to feel."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"This is my second attempt to publish a review of this novel at Amazon. My first attempt was rejected because I exceeded Amazon's allowance of twenty quoted words. And that tells you something about what I think about this novel - there are so many great words and expressions that deserve quoting, that - I expect - would stimulate the readers' interest. Having said this, I need to point out that this book is not a great story - but it is fabulous writing, almost poetry.Here is my one quote (so hard to choose):'And now I ask, \\"Who am I?' I have been talking of Bernard, Neville, Jinny, Susan, Rhoda and Louis. Am I all of them? Am I one and distinct? I do not know. ......' (p222, Penguin Books, 1992)If you think the quotation marks are strangely placed here it is because Woolf uses a very strange voice in this novel - an experimental style - in which all the friends address the reader almost personally but in a way that merges their self in some way. Perhaps for me this was the least successful aspect of the novel - the friends were insufficiently distinct and identifiable - their voices were too similar. But the quote above suggests that perhaps this was deliberate.Other pages that I would have liked to quote are:p36, p38, p45, p60, p68, p90, p94, p96, p124, p136, p148, p150, p164, p179, p190, p192, p216 (not all of these were in my original review!)"},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Virgie was a rare poetic master. Consider The Waves a maximization of those frilly words. They clothe the concept novel purely based upon six character soliloquies. The events are thus reflectively bounded by \\"their\\" intermingled perceptions. The prospect is undoubtedly intriguing, but her application proved to be a tad too much for me to endure for very long. I'm usually in favor of highly imaginative writing and casting practicality aside; but alas, my realism kicked in. Within this impressionistic discourse, it is all too obvious that everyone's perceptions are pure Virigina Woolf, regardless her constructs of mood and motivation. This makes it all too \\"unbelievable\\" to consider the thought that these men and women, beginning in their youths, are all given to *precisely* the same style of flowery, verbal introspection. Ironically, this expansive, multiplicative approach actually gives a more one-dimensional feel due to that intimate profusion ultimately originating from a single human being! (Although, perhaps a writer need have multiple personalities to implement such an intensely intimate yet scattered task?!) Am I bashing the omniscient perspective completely? No. I believe it is the intensity of this work accorded to its particular design that has revealed this perspective's best limit. Some avid fans apparently can suspend that judgment and endure it on poetic and innovative merit alone (by innovative, I mean *anything* new). I, however, could only reduce my intake to samplings of her basic style. A few moments are surely somewhat enjoyable. \\"Endurance\\" reading is what causes the book to falter. As balanced, The Waves is a series of pointed crests and weary troughs, excessively decorated on perhaps too implausible a concept."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"We think: We ask why one would value the review we wrote of The Waves..but we know that Mrs. Heilbrun would be grateful that we still road this sanguine surf.."},{"Title":"THE WAVES (WORLD'S CLASSICS)","review":"Literary arrogance at its height, this book takes simple concepts and makes them obtuse.

Wade Davis takes you to his homeland Canada, to the heights of Peru and the depths of the Amazon basin, to Haiti and Tibet in pursuit of the secrets of plants and how mankind has used them over the centuries. The accounts in this book of travels reveal mysterious practices of the shamans in Amazon, the horrid outcome of human intervention in nature's plan, and the importance of our connection to the land. You will learn, you will smile and you will wonder why this author has not received more popular acclaim. The message is clear. We are living in an ecological disaster.

The material covers the uses of oils, with notations for tracing the information back to the source readings.While the illustrations are of use, it is important to understand a key Cayce concept, that of - the coordination of the nervous systems... This may not be as clearly stated as it might, but it remains as of underlying importance as to what the readings had to offer.Throughout the Cayce material, over 9,000 of the 14,000 readings were on health issues alone, the coordination of the nervous systems was critical to the progress towards healthful conditions. Additionally, the use of the various formulated oils in combination with the massage techniques especially focusing upon the spinal areas, brings great relief for a large number of conditions.I gave this a two star because its scope is limited. Limited in that there is so much more that could have been related from the readings to make it a more valuable piece of work. Its downfall is in that it relates the material garnered from the relationship between the authors and the doctor mentioned - Reilly, rather than with Edgar Cayce. And that it has not been updated with a fresh eye to editing for the antiquated speech patterns from the earlier part of the last century.So, the efforts to extract from the readings - in computer technology terms - a bit of reverse engineering, did not go sufficiently deep.However, I can still recommend the text for its illustrations and oil formulations."},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce's Massage, Hydrotherapy, and Healing Oils","review":"It's true what the previous reviewer said, she made alot of good points, but 2 stars is a bit too harsh. I found alot of valuable information that I didn't glean from any of my 12 teachers at massage school, despite their many years of practice and expertise. The material from Edgar Cayce, for whatever reason, was never discussed or included. It's true that the language is a bit antiquated, but it's definitely worth the slight effort involved to understand.There wasn't enough emphasis on the oils in my education, or the fact that whatever's applied gets absorbed, directly and quickly, into the bloodstream. Alot of people are chemically sensitive nowadays because their livers are toxic or overburdened, so it makes alot of sense that those substances applied should be nourishing,(barring any allergy to nuts); this book points out the healthful benefits of oils I would not have considered using otherwise, such as peanut oil for arthritis and general well-being. Many people comment that it smells like Chinese food. I really expected alot of objection, so the pleasant feedback has been surprisingly nice.The 2 points I thought were most valuable were 1) the recommendations of using food based oils, the combinations, and 2) the massage strokes down the spine in a circular motion.Since the ESG's contain nerve bundles emanating from the spinal cord, feeding and enervating every major organ in the body, (as any chiropractic chart will describe), it's a logical technique to include in any routine, and it has a very soothing effect releasing congested energy. It's surprising how many massage techniques touch on the spinal nerves, but without much conscious awareness.Consciously including this circular movement down the spine makes the massage a much more effective and beneficial treatment in general, regardless of body type.I appreciate this book for its collection of unique insights specifically regarding massage. It's helpful to have reassurance that what I'm doing has more than just good intention behind it."},{"Title":"Shattering The Cancer Myth: A Unique Positive Guide to Cancer Treatment using Traditional and Natural Therapies","review":"The front cover comment \\"A unique positive guide to Cancer using traditional and natural therapies\\" is an acurate summary of the book.

Then they have to face up to treatment and this is where this book is extremely valuable as it covers all the treatment options. The philosophy of the author may be best summed in a sentence in the book \\"If the egos of both natural and orthodox practitioner were to be set aside, and the financial incentives to prove the other wrong were eliminated, we could remember what the true essence of healing is about.Perhaps some of the Chapter titles best indicate the theme of this book. \\" Understanding Surgery\\" Understanding Chemotherapy\\" Understanding Radiation Therapy\\" \\"Natural Vs Orthodox- Pros and Cons\\" \\"The Immune System and Cancer\\" etc.etc.Cancer sufferers (both new and long term) to whom I have loaned this book have found it extremely informative and while all the \\"new\\" patients have gone down the conventional treatment path, they have used many of the naturopathic suggestions to succesfully ease their travel.Probably no better endorsement for this book would be that a local Naturopath now loans it to all her clients dealing with cancer and maybe agonising over conventional versus natural treatments or just wanting to understand, a little better, cancer and possible treatments."},{"Title":"Better Than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream","review":"This book, beautifully written, is a meditation on the looking glass world American Medicine has become.

It's written very casually and gently wanders from topic to topic, but lacks structure and rigor. It drops many keen perceptions about contemporary life and selfhood, but the better ones are all from works cited. And uncited-- what really pisses me off is that the great 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger is never mentioned even though he more than anyone else got people talking about the major themes of this book-- the tension between egoism and authenticity, the plagues of anxiety and boredom, the life-draining force of technological thinking and the need for an appreciation of experience, and so on. So, if you want a serious meditation on these themes, one that reaches far deeper than Elliot does, read Heidegger, his influences, and those he influenced. But if you want a place to start, Elliot is far easier. Or, if you want to reminded of many themes of existentialism with reference to contemporary life, give it a read if you have some extra time."},{"Title":"Better Than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream","review":"Though Carl is formally a philosopher and a doctor, this book demonstrates his incredible ability to deftly play the role of a sociologist, anthropologist, and journalist as well. As the book meanders its way through topics as diverse as attention deficit disorder and foot binding in Japan, Dr. Elliot makes astute insights on the concept of satisfaction and happiness in the age of enhancement technologies. As Peter Kramer notes in his introduction, he accomplishes his goal without a tone of condescension, but with one of compassion, rare amongst writers on this topic. Dr. Elliot does not concern himself with normative theories, but instead opens up the door for more conversation on a fascinating subject. The conclusions he makes can be depressing, but they are never sensationalist.

Not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Better Than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was incredibly interested to find out how American medicine met \`the american dream'. Upon opening the book, I was surprised at not only the structure of the novel but the incredible amount of scientific references provided by the author. With the insurmountable amount of references, I began to feel intimidated with the thought that comprehending such a scientific novel would be unobtainable. The moment I began to read the novel however, I was incredibly surprised at Elliot's writing style. I was able to easily understand the concept of each section while also being incredibly informed on an advanced scientific level about drugs, illnesses and our society as a whole.The book, Better Than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream is written not as a whole novel, but in different sections. The sections range from topics about the appeal of drugs such as LSD to neurological disorders such as Apotemnophilia. I believe that these divisions of sections made the read much easier and allowed me as the reader absorb a new level of knowledge on a more graspable level.I am a student taking a Neuroscience course and our assignment was to find a book about a specific neurological disorder we were interested in. The neurological disorder I chose was Apotemnophilia. When I first researched the illness, I realized that the patients with Apotemnophilia were proclaimed self-desired amputees. Other than the illness being related to self-proclaimed amputation, I wasn't aware of the sociological relationship the illness had with the American society. The illness seemed like any other neurological disorder with damage to a specific lobe of the brain. It wasn't until I picked up this book by Carl Elliott where I realized Apotemnophilia was much more than a neurological disorder pertaining to self-amputation. Carl Elliott begins the section by introducing the illness as something not labeled completely as a neurological disorder nor a psychological disorder. Following the introduction the author begins to tell greusome stories of Apotemnophiliacs and how severe the \`self-desired' amputation really was by describing ways the patients \\"severed their arms\\". With a cringed face and my imagination running wild, I proceeded to read the rest of the section to be completely turned around. Carl Elliott has proved to me that he has done an insurmountable amount of research pertaining to Apotemnophilia by talking to not only medical experts, psychologists but also patients. Carl Elliott's interview with patients seemed to make the biggest impact on my view of Apotemnophilia. The people that were interviewed would talk about how they were unable to picture themselves with these certain limbs. They felt that the limb they possessed weren't naturally theirs and amputation was necessary. The author consistently involves the opinions of every angle of the discussion which made me feel as though none of the statements were written in an unbiased manner. The amputees were not classified as anything more than \`wannabes' - a term Elliott used to describe the apotemnophiliacs and not as a degrading fashion, and the psychiatrists and doctors were represented professionally. Elliott makes a strong effort to make sure that the reader understands every point of view on a professional level. It was then when I realized that this simple \\"neurological disorder\\" was much more than damage to a particular lobe on the brain.The first thing I noticed in this book that really caught my attention was the author's choice of words. When I was searching for scientific novels about a neurological disorder, my greatest fear was that I would be stuck with a novel with unbelievable vocabulary beyond my comprehension and that I would have the most difficult time understanding the simplest concepts. My presumption was definitely proven wrong when I picked up Better Than Well. Carl Elliott presents his ideas with not only simplistic statements, but his statements are filled with scientific background and knowledge. I felt that with the knowledge I had going into the book was definitely not tested when reading the novel. I was incredibly pleased with the way Elliott wrote the book and presented it to his readers. The second thing I noticed in this book that caught my attention was the dialog he included in the text. Again with my assumptions, I assumed that a scientific novel about something as serious as neurological disorders, drugs and American society toward medicine would have no form of dialog whatsoever. However, I was definitely proven wrong when I picked up this book. Elliott seemed to really have done his research and it showed in this novel. He actively interviewed patients, physicians and psychiatrists and included their dialog and personal statements in the text. An example that really came to mind when thinking about dialog in this novel was when Elliott wrote about a woman with apotemnophilia. The woman was asked to describe the \\"life-changing\\" experience she had with an amputee as a child. The similarity Elliott found within all the apotemnophiliac patients is that they have had this ideal image of the perfect body encased in their minds as early as the age of 6. The patients have no recollection of the last time they did not want an amputation. The woman that Elliott decided to include in his novel made an impact on my personal feelings when I realized that people like this really do exist and apotemnophilia is more than a neurological disorder. The woman expressed that when she was three years old she met a man who was completely missing all four of his fingers on his hand. Ever since the woman met this man, she has had the strange fascination for amputees. This experience caused her to realize that she was interested in women amputees who were \\"missing parts of their arms and wore hook prostheses\\". Although this seemed like an unusual statement, Elliott makes it incredibly clear that statements like this is very normal for people diagnosed with apotemnophilia. The last element that caught my attention was Elliott's ability to bring in different ends of each discussion into play. Again, like the apotemnophilia topic, Elliott brought in the discussion of whether or not surgically removing perfect limbs is an unethical decision made by physicians. Before reading this book, the medical side of the apotemnophilia topic never occurred to me. Being new to the topic, I always believed that the patients had every right to want to amputate whichever limb they wanted to amputate. However, Elliott brought in a new perspective - an ethical perspective into play. Is it ethically correct to amputate a healthy limb? Is it considered as surgical treatment for the disease to make emotionally unhappy patients finally satisfied with their body? Is it considered as plastic surgery? These are all the points that Elliott played in with the text.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with this novel. I never would have expected a novel based on American society in relation to medicine to be an easy read with interesting topics. I was able to dive straight into the book and finish the last page with complete satisfaction. I have no regrets purchasing this book and would recommend this book without a doubt to anyone who is interested in such a topic."},{"Title":"Fighting Amphibs: The Lcs in World War II","review":"My father was a wwII veteran and my uncle was a Korean war casualty and I am a father. I recently bought the book Fighting Amphibs at the Mystic Seaport Maritime bookstore. when I started to read it i could not put it down. It is an extremely well researched account of an important strategic ship in wwII. The book is written by someone who exhaustedly researched it as well as lived it. The joy of fatherhood has led me to a profound appreciation for the men and women of all wars. This book accounts a sliver of life, courage, and teamwork in the days and historic battles of wwII. The lcs ships were unsung pieces of a very precarious puzzle.

I can even understand the peculiar nature of the relationship between the heroine and her husband, but it is on the whole, overly simplistic and I was annoyed most of the time with waiting interminably for the inevitable conclusions.

I was pleased to find an old edition of the novel at a library bookfair last year and just got around to reading it last week.When the book begins, we're introduced to Miranda, who sounded to me to be a little too perfect except for the haphazard manner she attacked chores on the family farm. The early chapters of the book seemed to me to have a little too much telling and not quite enough showing in terms of what the characters are like.The plot is interesting enough for the first hundred pages with Miranda getting a taste for a life she couldn't have imagined as the daughter of a farmer now living on an estate with only reading and embroidery to keep her occupied. The story becomes much more interesting in the second half of the novel and even difficult to put down.The book changes point of view rather often without warning and may only stay with that character for a paragraph or so, which was a bother at first but eventually I got used to Seton's writing that way and even appreciated it.The highlight of this book is the degree to which history plays a role. I knew nothing of the history of New York in the 1800s before reading this novel. Seton has the ability of weaving history with her gothic romance and its characters, making it a much more enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This story has a very similar Gothic sort of story line to many of your favorites.

In fact, it very much reminds me of Jane Eyre on a slightly smaller scale.Dragonwyck is a Cinderella story with a dark background and gothic touch. Our beautiful Miranda arrives at Dragonwyck with storybook dreams, but finds in her hero a sinster mystery that only she can solve.I am completely new to the writings of Anya Seton (where have I been?) and so taken with her that I have now ordered all of her works. I love a good gothic tale complete with the dark old homes and beautiful manners of the past; Dragonwyck completely mesmerized me and held my attention from the beginning. It is fast-paced, heart-stopping, and beautifully written. If you like entering a Cinderella world, you will love this book. 5+ stars*****"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This is a beautifully written work of historical fiction, set in 1840s New York. It focuses on a young Connecticut woman, Miranda Wells, who sees a change in her station in life through a chance invitation by a wealthy distant cousin. Handsome, gallant, and a renaissance man in terms of his interests, Nicholas Van Ryn invites his young cousin to visit and stay at his lavish home in upstate Hudson, New York and act as a companion for his young daughter.When she meets him for the first time, Miranda is smitten, as Nicholas is the embodiment of all her romantic yearnings. Moreover, her stay at his luxurious, palatial home on the Hudson River, a mansion with the fanciful name of Dragonwyck, is an answer to her prayers and a chance to escape the hard work and tedium that has been her lot on her family's Connecticut farm. Dragonwyck, however, has its share of secrets and a miasma of evil that lurks in its halls and grand rooms.The only thorn in Miranda's side is her cousin's wife, Johanna, who does not care for having a younger, more attractive woman, bustling about the house and preening before her husband. Johanna finds ways to make her feelings understood by Miranda, but Miranda, reckless in her admiration for her cousin Nicholas and relatively naive, is somewhat obtuse. Moreover, there is a pre-existing undercurrent of tension between husband and wife in the Dragonwyck household of which Miranda is seemingly oblivious.Miranda's presence exacerbates the tension in the household that, ultimately, ends in tragedy for all concerned. It is that tragedy that will, for Miranda, mark the beginning of a life journey that will provide some painful and unsettling lessons. It is a journey that will ensure a measure of painful self-discovery and remove the rose colored glasses through which she had viewed her world.The book is well researched and redolent with information about the Dutch influence in New York and its aristocracy. It details many of the issues and traditions that were germane to the period and is richly descriptive of a way of life in New York, both downstate and upstate, that has since gone by the wayside. It intertwines a number of historical events and personages with the lives of those characters who are at the heart of this wonderful and vastly entertaining book. It is a book that will keep the reader turning the pages until the very last."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This book enjoys a special place in my grandmother's bookshelves, and both she and my mom always told me when I was little that I should read it someday. So a few years ago, on an extended vacation to my grandparent's house (which, I have to say, can be nearly as creepy at night as Dragonwyck) I picked up the book and curled up in a corner with it. I absolutely couldldn't put it down. Miranda is an engaging character who you instantly identify with because I think everyone feels sometimes the sense of oppression of their mundane lives. It definitely fits in nicely with the Gothic romance of the time, though doesn't *quite* stand up to Hawthorne's THe House of the Seven Gables. However, Seton's language is wonderfully detailed and captures the beauties and terrors of the moments to a point where you are nearly breathless. I highly recommend finding yourself a copy, no matter how dog-eared, and immerse yourself in Dragonwyck."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I searched for years for a copy of &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; and finally found an old copy in an East Hampton church sale. Why such a quest? Because I had seen the movie version with Gene Tierney and Vincent Price at least 10 times as a child. And the book is no disappointment--rather, it went beyond my wildest expectation! I've read it over quite a few times. The most appealing part for me is the early part of the novel, when Miranda is first in love with her handsome but remote cousin Nicholas, a married man whose daughter she is governess to. Seton captures the inexpressable longing of a crush that can never come to fruition. How every glance, every chance encounter takes on a significance to us alone. Then, the unthinkable happens, and Miranda gets her wish, marriage to Nicholas. But like most answered prayers, the reality bears no resemblance to the fantasy. In spite of riches and every kind of luxury, Miranda cannot find happiness in her marriage to Nicholas, a man incapable of spiritual and emotional intimacy. I highly recommend &quot;Dragonwyck&quot;, for this wonderful plot and also its considerable research in the period, 1840s New York."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I am quite a big fan of classic gothic love stories. Jane Eyre is one of my all-time favorite gothic romances, which is why I cannot believe it took me so long to give Anya Seton's Dragonwyck a whirl. This is a wonderful, yet underrated piece of fiction, \\"a classic in the tradition of Jane Eyre and Rebecca,\\" as the back cover blurb says. Set in the year 1844, Dragonwyck tells the story of Miranda Wells, an eighteen-year-old daughter of a strict farmer. She has romantic notions of being swept by her feet by a tall, dark and handsome man. She also dreams of a better life. So when she is invited to work as a governess for her cousin, the dark and dashing New York aristocrat Nicholas Van Ryn at the Dragonwyck estate, she feels her dreams are coming true. Dragonwyck is an enormous estate that is often visited by the European nobility and American gentry. And Nicholas is as handsome as the men in the romance novels she reads and, in spite of his being married to the unpleasant glutton Johanna, Miranda cannot help but fall for her charming, yet mysterious cousin. But Dragonwyck is full of dark secrets and mysteries, taken from a curse that began some generations ago. And the rent wars that go on between the disgruntled farmers and their proud, arrogant master make things all the worse. A local doctor, Jeff Turner, is in charge of helping the farmers change the farm-rent laws, and in the process more conflict ensues between the people in Hudson Valley and the Dragonwyck estate. There are more twists throughout the novel.This is one dark novel! The gothic elements aren't overdone here like I've read in some novels. Instead, the gothic elements blend quite well with a well-researched backdrop of the manor system and the New York gentry and a plot that is beautifully constructed and developed. This one is darker than Jane Eyre. I compare it to Jane Eyre because there are some similarities between these two novels (and it is also similar to North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell), but this one is an excellent love story in its own right. I enjoyed the characters. Even though it was obvious to me that Nicholas was the antagonist in this novel, I nevertheless fell in love with him. Anti-heroes have always intrigued me more than the sweet, good-doer types (in this case being Jeff Turner) and this character intrigued me from beginning to end. He is an enigma, very complex and unpredictable, for despite his reservations, condescending treatment to his workers, poor treatment of his young daughter, and other dark qualities, his love for Miranda is evident from the very first pages. Miranda romanticizes both Nicholas and the grandeur of Dragonwyck, and her realization of how things are really like with the farmers and the society people she wants to be accepted more than anything is staggering. Like all gothic novels, there are ghosts and an eccentric character, but these elements only enhance the overall sinister feel of this novel. I truly enjoyed reading Dragonwyck. First published in 1944, this is a true classic and it should be placed among the very best of romantic literature. Anya Seton was a great author. I also enjoyed Katherine and Green Darkness and I look forward to reading her back list."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"The premise of Dragonwick seems very much like that of Jane Eyre--a young woman goes tot he house of a very wealthy man to teac his child and ends up falling in love with him. However, this book adds a completely new dimension to this story outline. The main character is absolutely nothing like the demure, humble Jane, and everyone else is sinister in a way that Charlotte Bronte's characters never could have been.The book begins in 1844 and ends in 1849, covering the land rent problems the landlords face, the Astor Place Massacre, and the far-away wars in Texas. The Mid-Atlantic is peopled solely with those of old Dutch ancestry, and cattle still live in downtown Manhattan, which is more farmland than city real estate in the mid-19th century.Miranda Welles is the daughter of a poor farmer from Connecticuit. One day the family recieves a letter from a wealthy New York cousin of theirs, the Van Ryns. Nicholas Van Ryn, looking for a governess for his six-year-old daughter, asks the Welles family if they might be able to spare one of their daughters for the task. And so Miranda goes to New York, a place much finer than she had ever expected it to be. Van Ryn is of old Dutch stock that came to America two hundred years before, and are landlords and adherents to the old way of living, a way that is quickly disintegrating.Upon arriving at the family estate, Dragonwyck, Miranda meets the Lady of the House, the corpulent Johanna. It is clear that Nicholas is no longer in love with his wife, and his attentions turn toward Miranda, who is his cousin by marriage. The book has an omniscient narrator, with intervals in which various minor characters interject their thoughts and feelings (the French Count's are the funniest and most astute). Vvery quickly, Miranda notices something discomfitting about the house, despite its beauty. All the members of the blood line of the Van Ryn family can hear the ghostly cries of one of their ancestors, and Miranda can feel that ancestor's presence in several areas of the house.Upon Johanna Van Ryn's death, under suspicious circumstances, Nicholas immediately proposes to Miranda, though they must wait a year to allow for mourning. Nicholas comes back to her exactly as promised, and they marry. But there is something not quite right with their marriage; Nicholas has a tendency to turn away from distressing situations--or he faces them and does something foolish. It is clear that Nicholas's moments of tenderness towards his new wife become few and far between.Added into the mix is a country doctor, Jefferson Turner. A local man who supports those who are trying to overthrow the manorial system, Jeff has an intense dislike, yet an admiration for Van Ryn. He also develops feelings towards Miranda, who increase as the book progresses.Oone thing that I liked about the book was the number of contemporary authors who had cameos. We meet, briefly, Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. By the way, it is from the latter that Nicholas acquires a foul habit that will affect him significantly later on in the book. In sum, I thought this was a wonderful book, though not on the same level as Katherine and Green Ddrakness. Nevertheless, its not difficult to see why Seton's books are being reprinted; they're truly wonderful novels in the gothic style."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"With its haunted mansions and American \\"aristocrats,\\" I tend to remember this as a far-fetched story, yet it always succeeds in drawing me into its world, on its own terms. This past reading I saw more depth and even believability to the story than I have ever seen before. Even the haunted mansion, with the ghost's New Orleans connection, has an American (as opposed to faux-British) reality.Nicholas, the cold, controlling husband, is not so far-fetched for a 19th century man raised in absolute privilege. The spiritual isolation inherent in that believeably fuels his madness. Miranda's sufferings with him are not too far from any abusive marriage with a great disparity of power between the man and woman.Seton's gift in this story is in making us identify completely with Miranda's experience. Her distaste for farm life and desire for a better world are sympathetically portrayed (and in the end perhaps punished too harshly by fate).I disagree with Phillipa Gregory that Miranda \\"treads a well worn path\\" or that she is derivative of Jane Eyre. What Seton does so well is take the fantasy of the standard romance novel, of the type Miranda is reading when the story opens, and turn it on its head, making it both real and dark. In those stories, marrying the wealthy, high born hero is the beginning of \\"happy ever after.\\" For Miranda, that event is literally the end of the dream and the beginning of the nightmare. Because of who Nicholas is and what he did to make the \\"dream\\" real, the reality can only be painful. And if he had been different kind of man, it would never have happened.Miranda is almost the opposite of Jane Eyre in personality and desire. Jane never wants to belong to the aristocracy; it is Miranda's fantasy. As an orphan governess, Jane is inherently an outsider to the world of wealth and elegance; as a relation, Miranda can, within limits, have whatever status her relatives choose to let her have. They can treat her as family or a glorified servant. In that sense, Johanna's treatment of her is a form of petty cruelty. Jane prefers the simple to the grand; Miranda of course does not.Yet the two women's stories share a similarity, in that for neither of them is it the love story, the hero, who ultimately provides the happy ending. It is their own spiritual growth. This is what raises Dragonwyck above the simple Gothic novel. In those, it is escaping from the bad man to the good one that signals happy ever after. In Dragonwyck, it is Miranda's realization of her own weakness, her acceptance of responsibility, and the integrity she gains, that provide the happy ending.So read Dragonwyck and enjoy the tour of 19th century America's own aristocrats, Gothic figures (Poe), and struggles with the meaning of democracy. Plus two love stories: a chilling story of the \\"subjugation of the soul\\" and the kinder gentler story of two people who initially turn their noses up at one another."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"Dragonwyck is a great historical, gothic romance novel, especially appealling to those of us who live in the historic Hudson valley region of New York state. I first read Dragonwyck when I was in junior high school. I picked it up in a yard sale for 10 cents. It was compelling. There was a naive girl from Greenwich, Ct., a wealthy, mysterious older cousin, drug addiction, ghosts and famous historical persons such as Edgar Allen Poe and the Vanderbilts. The Hudson River itself becomes a character with the steamboat races and travel to glamorous turn-of-the-century New York City. The pace of the novel is steady and quickens as the plots unfold.

It stirs together flavors of American rustic reality (like that found The Grapes of Wrath or the Little House on the Prairie Series) and enchanting fairy tale (the rags-to-riches themes from classics like Cinderella and The Little Princess) into a thick broth of emotional turmoil ala Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Rebecca.Surprisingly, the gothic castle for which the book is named is on the Hudson River in New York. On first thought, I found that fact uninteresting, but turns out the area is very colorful, and Lord Nicholas Van Ryn's manse does seem like a medieval feudal kingdom, right smack dab in the middle of pre-Civil War America. Our protagonist, Miranda, goes through several very human transitions and her feelings are always deeply imaginable and relatable. A good dose of history is served as she meets literary characters from the period like Edgar Allan Poe, James Fenimore Cooper, and more. The book reads cozily for all its familiarity of themes, yet still has the power to haunt on a more psychological level than its predecessors.

I read the book in 8th grade, when I was 13 years old - wow, can it REALLY be 21 years ago? - and I can still remember how I felt - I HAD to keep on reading, it was so gripping!!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This book turned me into an Anya Seton fan when I was about ten years old. When I later studied New York State history in school, I knew more about the rent wars than the teacher -- thanks to this book. It inspired a lifetime love of history and of Anya's delicious way of delivering it. I went on to read \\"Katherine\\", \\"The Winthrop Woman\\" (about an ancestress of mine), \\"Green Darkness,\\" and others.This one was/is my favorite. I'd love to see the Vincent Price movie once more."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"As one of the first of Anya Seton's books that I have read, I was astounded. I won't bore you with a repetition of the plot synopsis, as there are several already available, but I can tell you that Seton's writing is flawless and that this book is one of the best written historical fiction novels that I have read in some time. The characters are believable and I became quite fond of Nicholas, despite his bi-polar moods, distorted sense of importance, and his need to control everyone and everything around him. He was very believable, and so was the world in which he lived. I was satisfied with the plot twist, though a little let down in the end. But overall, this is a great book, much better than many of the modern so-called historical fiction writers that are popular today. Find it used, buy it, read it, and if you don't like it, pass it on to a historical fiction lover. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I have other Anya Seton's books - I found this to be very different from Katherine or The Winthrop Woman, but just as enjoyable. I read it until 2am and had to get up at 7am, but I just couldnt put it down. A romantic period story which is not your typical 'bodice ripper'and is well founded in historical details."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I can't believe that I've ignored Anya Seton for all of these years. I thought this would be a simple gothic romance novel/ghost story and it was so much more.

I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the rest of her novels."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"After I read Katherine a few years ago, I promised myself that I would read other Anya Seton novels. I finally read Dragonwyck and was swept away with the plot and the dark and intriguing anti-hero. Anya captured the foreboding theme of this story from the beginning and wrote a well constructed plot.I felt the heroine to be a bit \\"wimpy\\" by today's standards, but she was probably very representive of the era. It was good to see her mature and become stronger as the story evolved. I learned about the manor system and rent wars which I never knew existed. This is a well written book, not as enchanting as Katherine, but I still highly recommend it to historical fiction fans."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This is a beautifully written work of historical fiction, set in 1840s New York.

So what is it about &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; that draws me back to the literally falling-apart hardcover copy that I borrowed from a friend 15 years ago?Perhaps it's Anya Seton's realistic rendering of a Connecticut farm girl's yearning for a more elegant lifestyle, and the authenticity of Seton's description of life in New England and New York right before the Civil War, in the age of Dutch patroonships. Names of prominent Americans -- particularly those of Dutch descent, like Melville, Roosevelt and Van Buren -- are scattered throughout each chapter, which make the reader feel like a part of august society in upstate New York. And the tall, dark and handsome man who seduces naive Miranda and suppresses his tenant farmers can't be such a bad guy -- because, after all, he has a real appreciation for 19-century American literature. Come on, haven't we all done a lot worse, relationship-wise?I anxiously await a new printing of &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; so I can revisit these compelling characters once again and finally return the ailing copy I've appropriated for all these years to my best friend from 8th grade ... wherever she is."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"Dragonwyck was an excellent book and as you research the settings and the characters you get drawn into the mystery that is dragonwyck. While researching the novel I found that the book had been made into a movie, so if anyone knows where I can get a copy I would love to hear from you. If you have the chance to read it, do and you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I first read this book at age 17, nearly 30 years ago. I pulled it from a dusty shelf at my grandfather's home. I loved it then; I was swept away into a history of which I knew nothing and an unconventional love story with supernatural elements. I have been thinking of it ever since and for the longest time could not find a copy anywhere (should have stolen granddad's!) I caught the movie version of it on the classics TV channel and was disappointed in Vincent Price's portrayal of Nicholas - he is not at all what I imagined while reading the book. However, since Anya Seton's books have been reissued, I now have my own copy which I finished reading yesterday. At last! I was just as riveted by it this go-around as I was at age 17. Yes, it is melodramatic. Yes, sometimes you must suspend disbelief. Yes, Nicholas is over-the-top. And I loved every minute of it. Part of why I appreciate it even more now is that there are no graphic sex scenes; Ms. Seton wrote this in an era where there were constrictions on such things, and she leaves enough to the imagination so that we get the picture without all the huffing, moaning and puffing. And it still makes for an exciting, titillating story - imagine that. So if you are of a mind for this sort of thing, \\"Dragonwyck\\" does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I devoured DRAGONWYCK. I finished it entirely in a little under four hours in two days, with all the studying I had to do for school. What compelled me at first to read this novel was that it's author, Anya Seton, had also pennedDevil Waterwhich I quite enjoyed. However, I soon found that Dragonwyck was an altogether different experience. Not only was the setting completely different--Devil Water takes place during the early 18th century, with the Jacobite rebellion of 1715 as a main historical showpiece, while Dragonwyck is set mostly in mid-1800's New York--but also in mood, style, and character development, the two books were entirely unique of each other. This versatility impressed me, as did Seton's wonderful knack for vivid description, and I found myself enjoying the book. But I must add that, once I had finished, I could not shake the feeling that Dragonwyck was bit like a very fattening desert which you eat, enjoy, and then are promptly disgusted with yourself afterwards. I had not had this feeling with Devil Water.As other reviews have pointed out, Dragonwyck centers around farm girl Miranda Wells, who is at once a sympathetic and irksome character. Throughout the book, I was not sure whether I liked or disliked her, and apart from a natural desire to root for her, which I suppose is a good thing for a character to inspire, I felt that she was lackluster and unmoving. Had this novel been simply a Cinderella story with Miranda in place of the princess, I would certainly not have liked it as much as I did. I'm happy to say that it wasn't. When Miranda is sent to Dragonwyck, home of her distant Cousin Nicholas Van Ryn, it soon becomes apparent that there is something sinister in the air. Nicholas, rich and handsome with disconcertingly cold blue eyes, quickly becomes everything Miranda though she ever wanted, but there is a dark side to him, and it is the portrayal of this dark side that makes Dragonwyck a compelling and haunting read. Everything else aside--and frankly, it is not very hard to put everything else aside, since all other plot lines and characters in the novel seemed contrived--the character study of Nicholas Van Ryn and the helpless Miranda he entraps would have been enough to drive this story and make it an excellent novel.It is the other things in the novel which make me liken it to an unhealthy desert. For one thing, it's background love story (without spoiling anything, I will say I'm NOT talking about Nicholas here) seemed to be more of an afterthought than anything else, and yet it seemed that Seton was trying to have it take center stage towards the end of the novel. I wasn't particularly moved by it because I didn't feel that the characters' love had been sufficiently developed to a point where the audience actually cared. Also, the historical elements, which had seemed to be of such importance to the story at first, seemed to taper and gradually die off as the story progressed. The down-renters had captured my attention, and I was primed for something like a full rebellion akin to Philippa Gregory's Wideacre (not exactly like that, obviously, but that was the feeling I got while reading the first few chapters of Dragonwyck). Perhaps that was my own fault, but I was still left a little disappointed.For all its faults, Dragonwyck was written by an immensely talented author and has an immensely intriguing character at its heart. It's gloomy aura is captivating, and despite a few dull moments, the overall story is enthralling to the point where you will hardly be able to close the book. A recommended read, though I suggest trying Devil Water first if you are new to Seton."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I agree with pretty much everything already written in the 5-star reviews. I took this book from my Grandmother's house a while ago, and it sat on my shelf until just a couple days ago. I am kicking myself for waiting so long.I couldn't put the book down, I finished it last night. And still today I feel a sadness for Nicholas. You love him, yet hate him right along with Miranda. If you are a fan of Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte, I daresay this may surpass them both. Eerily intriguing!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"My grandmother read Dragonwyck when it came out in 1946. She passed it on to my mother who was 15 at the time, and my mother passed it on to me when I was around 15. I recommend the generations of women in your family do the same. This may not make anybody's list of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century, but it's a fascinating and highly entertaining read. Dragonwyck has aged well, and the new edition is attractively presented with an afterword by Philippa Gregory.Miranda Wells, a lovely, delicate girl of 18, lives on her sternly religious father's farm in early 19th century Connecticut. Inclined to idleness and romantic daydreams, the only future a girl in her station in life can look forward to is the drudgery of marriage to a dull neighboring farmer accompanied by endless chores and babies. Deliverance arrives in the form of a letter from Miranda's mother's cousin, Nicholas Van Ryn. Nicholas's letter invites the Wells family to choose one of their daughters to come to the Van Ryn estate on the Hudson River in New York and act as a companion to his daughter. Miranda and her sympathetic mother prevail on her father to let her go. Miranda and her father meet the dark, handsome, brilliant, talented, charming Nicholas in New York City, from whence Miranda travels upriver with Nicholas to Dragonwyck. In the Gothic tradition, the Dragonwyck into which Miranda enters is a vast, brooding estate where the dashing hero is trapped in a loveless marriage, nothing is as it seems, and the spectre of evil lurks in every corner. To give away more would spoil the fun.Anya Seton's novels are known for their meticulous historical research. Dragonwyck takes place as the tenant farmers on the Hudson river estates begin to rebel against the feudal Dutch manor system that has been in place since the 17th century. Seton skillfully brings time and place to life. She weaves details about the politics and literature of the period into the story without being pedantic, and sets out the attitudes of the estate owners, who see themselves as aristocrats paternally meeting their tenant farmers' needs, and the tenant farmers who, filled with the fervor of democracy in the still-young republic, want to end the system, own their own land, and take control of their own destinies. Her descriptions are evocative, she creates a magnetically attractive but complex character in Nicholas and a sympathetic protagonist in Miranda, and she tells a very compelling story.Do bear in mind, this is a Gothic, a genre of over-the-top conventions, particularly the convention that the heroine does impulsive, stupid things to get herself into perilous situations. Don't come looking for realism or you will be scratching your head wondering why anybody would read this silly stuff. An amusement park ride is not supposed to be like real life. Let go and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I remembered this book from reading it many years ago. It is asexciting as I remember.

When I checked my localbookstore, they claimed her books were no longer in print!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"Dragonwyck has all the ingredients of a stereotypical Gothic story -- a beautiful, innocent young girl, a handsome, brooding aristocrat, a haunting ghostly presence connected to some past evil, and a huge castle-like mansion. Even the name of this mansion \\"Dragonwyck\\" adds to the melodrama, suggesting the abode of a dragon. In the hands of a less skillful writer these ingredients could easily add up to a hackneyed cliche of a book. However, Anya Seton weaves her story in such a way that it is never boring, never contrived, and though the plot is pretty predictable without any real surprises, she manages to keep the story interesting. Even though you know what's going to happen, you want to keep reading, anyway.Admittedly, I am a fan of well-written Gothics; Jane Eyre and Rebecca are two of my all-time favorites. And after reading Dragonwyck I consider it of almost that same caliber. It was only Seton's second published work and, like her other earlier books, it shows a subtlety and constraint that, I think, make it a finer work than if Seton had spelled out every detail. In this, too, it compares to Jane Eyre and Rebecca. For instance, the violence which led to the haunting of the Red Room at Dragonwyck, the evil in the Van Ryn men which has been passed down to Nicholas, and the psychological damage to Nicholas somehow connected to the loss of his mother, are all only vaguely described by Seton. Although she could have explained them in detail she instead leaves it for the reader to fill in the gaps of the past history themselves. And of course, the sexual relations between Miranda and Nicholas are only vaguely referred to. This is due more to the cultural constraints of the times during which Seton wrote than to a particular choice of style, as evidenced by her later works written when such constraints had become much more relaxed. Green Darkness in particular, and to a lesser degree Avalon, are much coarser in their treatment of sex. This is why I prefer Seton's earlier works, and older books in general. I do not need a writer to spell it out in graphic detail for me to understand what goes on behind the closed doors. And in fact, I find such graphic sex a poor substitute for the truly fine writing of earlier authors who knew how to tell a good story without titillating their readers.Ok, enough of that.....What makes Dragonwyck particularly engaging is the setting. Perhaps it's just the romantic or Gothic-lover in me, but I found the setting of 19th century New York along the Hudson river something that I wanted to return to; a perfect escape from the 21st century! Although Seton's works are typically considered \\"historicals\\", the historical element of Dragonwyck is secondary; it is first and foremost a romance. Although Seton does weave in some actual historical events that took place during the time of the story, the history doesn't really impact Miranda's and Nicholas' story all that much. The true driving force was Nicholas, and what happened to him, and to Miranda because of him, was inevitable regardless of what took place in the world around them.There are a couple of little teasing tidbits that I wish Seton had followed up on. The first is in her Author's Note, where says that the idea for this story came from a news item she read in a New York newspaper from 1849. I do wish she had related just what was in that article ....... The second is in the early part of the book, when Nicholas orders a whole new wardrobe for Miranda shortly after her arrival at Dragonwyck. The modiste hired to make the clothes is not surprised, because Nicholas had done the same thing for \\"an orphan from New Orleans\\" not long before. Nicholas, being the misanthropist that he was, would not have taken in an orphan and ordered her a new, expensive wardrobe just to be generous. Just who was this orphan? I really thought this was going to be a significant point later in the book, but unfortunately it was never mentioned again......So if you're looking for an enjoyable book to escape into for a time, this is it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This is a beautifully written work of historical fiction, set in 1840s New York. It focuses on a young Connecticut woman, Miranda Wells, who sees a change in her station in life through a chance invitation by a wealthy distant cousin. Handsome, gallant, and a renaissance man in terms of his interests, Nicholas Van Ryn invites his young cousin to visit and stay at his lavish home in upstate Hudson, New York and act as a companion for his young daughter.When she meets him for the first time, Miranda is smitten, as Nicholas is the embodiment of all her romantic yearnings. Moreover, her stay at his luxurious, palatial home on the Hudson River, a mansion with the fanciful name of Dragonwyck, is an answer to her prayers and a chance to escape the hard work and tedium that has been her lot on her family's Connecticut farm. Dragonwyck, however, has its share of secrets and a miasma of evil that lurks in its halls and grand rooms.The only thorn in Miranda's side is her cousin's wife, Johanna, who does not care for having a younger, more attractive woman, bustling about the house and preening before her husband. Johanna finds ways to make her feelings understood by Miranda, but Miranda, reckless in her admiration for her cousin Nicholas and relatively naive, is somewhat obtuse. Moreover, there is a pre-existing undercurrent of tension between husband and wife in the Dragonwyck household of which Miranda is seemingly oblivious.Miranda's presence exacerbates the tension in the household that, ultimately, ends in tragedy for all concerned. It is that tragedy that will, for Miranda, mark the beginning of a life journey that will provide some painful and unsettling lessons. It is a journey that will ensure a measure of painful self-discovery and remove the rose colored glasses through which she had viewed her world.The book is well researched and redolent with information about the Dutch influence in New York and its aristocracy. It details many of the issues and traditions that were germane to the period and is richly descriptive of a way of life in New York, both downstate and upstate, that has since gone by the wayside. It intertwines a number of historical events and personages with the lives of those characters who are at the heart of this wonderful and vastly entertaining book. It is a book that will keep the reader turning the pages until the very last."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 11 years old. (I started reading avidly at the age of seven, Heidi was my first book). I remember feeling at the time that Nicholas Van Ryn was a frightening, evil man and that the heroine, Miranda Wells was a brave girl caught up in circumstances beyond her control. Reading the book as an adult I can see that Nicholas is still an evil man, however, Miranda is, from an adult stand point, a silly, blind, vain teenager who runs headlong into to a situation where she has absolutely no control, believes what she wants to believe and completely ignores the cautioning of her parents. Sound familiar parents? Where at 11 I sympathized with Miranda, as an adult I can only feel she got what she deserved.Aside from this one observation the book is worth a read, although not as enthralling as I once thought. This is a book I would take on vacation to the beach, enjoyable, but not thought provoking."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"Book arrived in great time, and is in perfect condition at a very good price, cover and pages much better than described. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"There are some excellent stylistic creativity meant to be studied by aspiring writers. However, to determine what type of book this is really difficult.The lead protagonist is Miranda Wells &quot;Ranny&quot;, an 18-yr romantic who is stuck on her family farm. She, of course, is someone you eagerly sympathize with because she is the oldest of the family. Her father Ephraim is a stern, strict Christian man who dislikes how Miranda loves her romantic fancies. Then comes opportunity when Johanna Van Ryn, Miranda's aunt, writes to invite either Miranda or her sister Tibby to live in her grand mansion Dragonwyck, to learn the customs of the gentry.The mansion Dragonwyck is similar to the mansion in Jane Eyre or Manderley of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca: there's something mysterious about it. In fact, there are a lot of parallels. However, there is an element of horror or suspense in it, however, the author fails to keep this theme consistent: in fact, this part is brushed off carelessly.Like the Rochester in Jane Eyre, there is the tall, dark, and handsome man in Dragonwyck, who is the Nicholas Van Ryn, a powerful man who is a great believer in the tenant system, however, he is perturbed by the socialist uprisings. He's a gifted pianist, an avid Edgar Allen Poe reader, and loves boat races.But is this a historical novel? There are instances of socialism in American history, however, this is all told in the perspective of aristocrats, who really don't know much.Is this a romance? It could have been. It could have been similar to Edith Wharton's Age of Innocence, a racy tale of passions. But again, this theme is also thrown carelessly by the author and the few sexual tensions raised are left cold.I should mention another key recurring character, Doctor Jeff. He's handsome and you will fall in love with him. He's pretty aggressive, among other things. The only thing I hate about him is that his character believes that women needs to just settle down on a farm and have babies. In this day and age, would you fall for a guy like that?Why did I read this in the first place? I will honest, it was mentioned in Rosemary Daniell's memoir Fatal Flowers, and mentioned that it had some racy scene. Well, you can judge for yourself about that. However, the author can write sensually and use exotic imageries, all great techniques. So, if you are curious in anyway, read."},{"Title":"Dragonwyck","review":"This is a mediocre work.

Unfortunately Feldman placed the book into a mooshy catagory between the two. If a reader wants an interesting read this is one. If a reader wants to know facts about the Lost Adams Diggings the goal is more likely to be achieved by reading Four Days From Fort Wingate by Richard French.Feldman's shakey premise that the Adams Diggings is where he says (and that it's been found) is based on an even shakier bibliography taken mostly out of Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver by Frank Dobie, then misquoted. The fact that he's presented it somewhat as fact by giving a bibliography distracts somewhat from what would otherwise be a pleasant and interesting read. If you find yourself tempted to believe anything in this book check the footnote references he uses to support his premises and follow them back to the original document text.

The letter and the spirit of Gulliver's Travels are one of the most divulgated to students from primary till high school. That's why I particulartly liked the account of Laputa, which is one of the lesser known episodes (and I looked forward to it, since Italo Calvino had done a remarkable publicity for it once). Especially the Academy of Sciences of that noble country had an interesting Sadian feeling (Swift is one of those philosophic minds which delight in fustigating philosophers); plus, you could witness the explosion of a dog.There's rather a disquieting feeling hanging around these pages. From neurotic midgets who receive rains of urine on their heads, giants with a deformed and stinking skin (not different from our own, if we could magnify it adequately, the author says), to people who after they've come home from a long voyage, prefer talking to two horses and have to hold a handkerchief in front of their nose when they're with their wives and children. Vanitas vanitatum, memento mori. No wonder Swift was an Irish clergymen. But this exposes also a difficulty in his social criticism; generally, we point towards him as a spur to reform. But, how can a work with such a deeply rooted convinction in the decline of humanity stimulate to politicalaction. rather, ity is an invitation to a stoic ideal of life, not unlike Voltaire's in \\"Candide\\"."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This book has been on my Kindle for a year or so now.

The only part tht I actually liked was the setting and the new lands, such as unknown places like Luggnagg, the flying island of Laputa, Liliput, Brobdingnag, and the land of the Yahoo's. There were also discovered places such as Holland, Japan, and the UK. I think that the reason that I liked the lands was because it was interesting to see how Swift conveyed the images of these lands and their many inhabitants. There were many different characters, like the main one, Gulliver, the kings of all the lands, Gulliver's maid in Brobdingnag, the Yahoos on Houhynymns, and various other characters distributed eithin the lands. The characters were only okay, but i think that Jonothan Swift didn't describe Gulliver and the new characters very well, as Gulliver and their interactions together. The main plot of Gulliver's Travels was Gulliver going on many long, assiduous journeys with completely new types of people. However the plot isn't rigid at all , and often meandered a lot, with no real point. The plot was allright, but it was often dysfunctional and boring. Also, the plot was slow to develop, and although the idea was promising, Jonothan Swift didn't do a very good job at all of developing it."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I liked Gullivers Travle's because he took a trip to the land of Talking Horses and Hunyums.

The reasons I gave this book three stars as, most people give it four, was that the chapter title were not titles, but complete summaries. A chapter title should be about one to five words. Instead the chapters in this book were regularly about two sentences long. Also I believe that there should be words on the front cover describing the book's content and word usage.Another is that in the back of the book there should be a word dictionary or at least something that gives a substitution for some of the confusing Old English words. If the author moved each adventure into several different small books he could have more room to write and enough room to place a small dictionary.In each adventure I felt that Swift did agood job expressing how whether you are tall or short, ugly or good looking, you have something to offer the world wherever you are. In the land where Gulliver \\"became\\" a giant he helped steal another islands' ships andand he also helped by urinating on the emperor'scastle to put out the fire that was burning the castle up. Also in the land where Gulliver wastiny he had something to offer At first he was considered \\"worthless\\", but then most people discovered that he was agood source of entetainment. Gulliver could ride around on alittle boa t to every lady's delight. Gulliver was even taken to the palace of giants he was so entertaining. Gullive hastwo more voyages that I hope you read about.I would recommend The Invisible Man and The Time Machine both by H.G. Wells.

On Gulliver's first voyage, he gets shipwrecked on the land of Lilliput, where he meets people only six inches tall. These people are very curious at first, but then get used to Gulliver being around and helping where needed. On his second voyage, Gulliver lands on an island where people are sixty feet tall. Gulliver then gets treated like a circus animal when a man shows him off for money without feeding him well. Gulliver then finds a way home, back to England and sets off for more adventures that bring him to an island that floats in the sky and also to a land where beasts look like men.One of the most emotional situations in Gulliver's Travels was when Gulliver was in Brobdingnag (his second voyage) and was used as a way to get money by being showed to many people who were curious. I felt bad that Gulliver had to live like a circus animal and on top of that, he was not being fed well. He was traveling with his owner to many places a day getting no respect what so ever by his owner who happened to be a farmer. A quote that I liked that shows how Gulliver felt was, &quot;I was so tired with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word.&quot; This quote clearly states that the farmer was over working Gulliver and how Gulliver felt about being showed to people. That is why this is a good quote that explains the main characters feelings.Jonathan Swift is a very good writer because he gives good details in this novel about the lands in which Gulliver landed on. He also gives detailed descriptions on the government of each land. Jonathan Swift has a very creative mind that shows as you read through Gulliver's many voyages that are like fairy tales.I would recommend Gulliver's Travels because it has a lot of creativity with all of the voyages that Gulliver goes on. It also gives detailed descriptions on the lands visited. The type of audience that I think would really enjoy this novel are the people who are interested in government and also culture.

But I won't read it again. It's basically a set of satirical stories penned by the hand of a bitter, misanthropic old man.I'm sure that the people of the 18th century (when the book was written), found the satire amusing and poignant, but I found much of it to be simplistic, and not particularly insightful. Moreover, the satirical lessons (such as they are) are buried within lengthy and laborious descriptions of things like the etymology of various imaginary words in imaginary languages.From my perspective, The most interesting thing about reading this book was discovering that the most famous stories within it - those of Lilliput and Brobdingnag - are only two of a bunch of stories that comprise the whole. I suspect that those two stories are the most famous because they're the most fun to think about. After all, it's kind of fun to imagine a world in which everything is scaled up or down by some size-constant (in this case Lilliput is a world with a scaling factor of 1/12th, while the inhabitants of Brobdingnag scale by 12x). But even those stories are a bit dry, and the rest of the book is just a curmudgeonly take on life and society, and human beings in general.

Perjury was amongst the most excusable arts.'- the prostitution of his own profession: 'how the world has been misled by prostitute writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards, the wisest counsel to fools, sincerity to flatterers, Roman virtue to betrayers, piety to atheists, chastity to sodomites, truth to informers.'Swift lost his confidence in man, ruled by 'the great power of habit and prejudice' and whose 'understanding (was) below the capacity of a common hound, who hath judgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack, without being ever mistaken.'Swift's masterstroke (under censorship) was to lift by satire the current affairs of his own lifetime on a general and universal human level.His lasting modernity lays in his profound understanding of the power of the media, the male/female struggle, the hypocritical use of religion for social oppression and warmongering, and ultimately the all importance of POWER.His insight into the basics of human nature is worth a Schopenhauer."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This book is written as a satire, but it is also a well-known children's book. Both children and adults alike can enjoy this story and the lessons that it teaches. It is important to read edited and abridged versions to children since these versions take out the wicked satire that runs through this book, and make it more of an adventure story. In it we see our hero, Gulliver, on four different voyages and his surprise landings in four different places. But, don't be misled - this book is a savage one, and Swift takes aim at the British people in general and the Whigs in particular. He pokes fun at various political, academic and social institutions. In it we meet the Lilliputians, and the giants in Brobdingnag. We also meet the sorcerers on Glubdubdrib and the immortals on Luggnagg. The stories are quite violent and Gulliver is exposed to some fairly rough and scary treatment, but it creates a wanderlust in him that he can't assuage.

Horses do not have those things. I think what Swift was trying to say was thatif humans had the minds of horses then life would be a whole lot better.

It is about the travels of an Englishman named Gulliver and the lands that he visits during his travels. Most books could not hold together without some underlying plot or scheme, but the way that Jonathan Swift wrote Gulliver's Travels, it isn't totally necessary. Throughout the entire book, Gulliver goes about describing in detail how eight different societies work and function as he observed them during his travels.The true beauty of the book is not completely appreciated until a little more is known about the author, Jonathan Swift, and the time period he wrote in. The events and people in this book do not follow the famous clause: &quot;The following story and characters are completely fictional. Any resemblance to real-life people and events is purely coincidental.&quot; Swift, as a matter of fact, takes great pride in using real-life people to base his characters on.

I wanted to relax before starting a more serious book so I semi-arbitrarily chose Gulliver's Travels, since I knew it was a classic and I hadn't read it before. It was a good read, but the book also made me think some about some of the political points Swift makes in the book.I wasn't really prepared for all the satire that is in his book though I did know it's one of the first political satires on the government at that time. The book was great to read though. It was interesting and usually funny and the different races the traveler meets are creative twists on re-thought things.Throughout the book, the author makes fun of opulent lifestyles and courts (at Lilliput), of people who are always looking for the next 'big thing' (at Laputa) and then reflects on how awful the human race is by comparing it to a fictional race of horses on an island (called Huoyhnmhnms). All in all it's interesting to read his take on human vices such as greed and also how he presents the other races and how they deal with these problems.But the book doesn't just talk about how awful humans are. It's also actually a good read that relates the adventures of Jonathan Swift, an adventurer from England, who, from many upsets and an insatiable thirst for adventure, discovers many new lands and spends years in each one.One of the things I thought was most unrealistic about the book was how quickly the traveler learned each language. Phrases like 'within four months I was able to understand almost everything, and speak tolerably well' don't strike me as what happens from someone who is learning language (And I've learned one foreign language and I'm in the process of learning another). Anyways, it's not a big part of the story, but I thought the author could have given more information about the language of each race that Gulliver discovers.But for a fun fiction read, the book is very good, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I can see why it has become a classic and I would like to read it again in the future (When I've worked through my massive reading list.More reviews at Into the Book .net"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Still a good story even after so many years, plus it's free!! Some parts may be a little hard to read, but that's why the Kindle's dictionary feature is great! Overall, and enjoyable tale that I think would appeal to a pretty large age group."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Lemuel Gulliver, the protagonist is more of an amusement and wonder to these pint-sized captors. It is an comprehendingly, and creative account of a man's journey into the unknown after a shipwreck. It describes in detail all of his exploits and contengencies. It takes place in the late 1600's to the early 1700's in an unapprehended land with many unconventional names of the towns and countries. He befriends these commonality in the uncharted land of these miniatures, and later, giants in other lands he explores."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Having read A Modest Proposal in high school I thought I was prepared for anything Jonathan Swift had in store. After all, who hadn't heard of the story of Gulliver and the Lilliputians? Boy was I wrong! The novel of Gulliver's Travels is one of the most shocking and vicious satires I have ever read. I am sure that I missed a lot of the venom which was aimed at the society and government at that time but I was able to certainly see how furious Swift was towards his intended biting satire. True, the novel has a lot of material that children would enjoy but it also possesses a lot of adult themes and a cruel streak which I found funny and a bit alarming. That said I have to say that Gulliver's Travels was extremely enjoyable and certainly deserves reading especially in these times of uncertainty."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"It is difficult to review a &#34;classic&#34; novel given the weight of history and the number of reviews already written. However, this is an enjoyable adventure with very imaginative settings.I agree with earlier reviews that the first 2 voyages are the more interesting, or at least not so laden with political messages. The later two are more interesting ideas for alternative fantasy settings but are bogged down by too much preaching.There is a gem in here for Studio Ghibli fans, the third voyage was inspiration for a popular Ghibli movie."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Its actual title is \\"Travels Into Several Remote Nations Of The World\\" as if by Lemuel Gulliver, but most people know it as \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and the actual author is Jonathan Swift. The book works on numerous levels, it could be viewed as an adventure story for children, an early example of fantasy/science fiction, a general satire of humanity, or a more specific satire of events, society, and politics in which Swift lived. The latter was undoubtedly the way it was taken when first publish ed in 1726 and amended in 1735, but that is the most difficult way for the reader to view the book today. The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is of great assistance in helping the reader appreciate that aspect of the book, with a fine introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr., and detailed notes throughout the text to help explain many of the references.Part I, \\"A Voyage to Lilliput\\" is the best known part of the book. This section has often been used in isolation of the other three parts of the book. This is the story where Gulliver is shipwrecked and washed up on a distant shore, only to find himself a captive of the Lilliputians, who are 1/12th the size of Gulliver. Swift is very detailed in discussing the minutia of Gulliver's experience, from how much he has to eat, to how he relieves himself. Swift satirizes the court of King George I, and of course travel books where the authors stretch the truth. Gulliver starts as a captive, becomes a loyal subject, but then is forced by his own morals to refuse the requests of the King of Lilliput which allows his enemies to work against him. As a result, Gulliver is forced to flee and as fortune would have it he makes it back to home.In Part II, \\"A Voyage to Brobdingnag\\", Gulliver once again goes to sea, and is this time abandoned when he goes to look for fresh water. This time Gulliver finds himself in a somewhat reversed position, still captive, but this time by people who are 12 times his height. The notoriety of Gulliver's existence results in his again being a favorite of the court. Gulliver tries to impress the King with stories of Europe, but his stories of the use of guns and cannons has the opposite affect. This time Gulliver is rescued by luck when a giant bird drops him in the sea where he is found and returned again to England.Part III, \\"A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan again has Gulliver at sea, and his fortunes are worse yet, as his ship is taken by Pirates and he is marooned on an island. Here he is rescued by a flying island (Laputa) which is a kingdom where math and the arts are of paramount importance but they have no interest at all in Gulliver's information regarding other lands. Gulliver then travels to Balnurabi where he visits their Academy which is a satire of the Royal Society at the time. Gulliver decides to go to Japan to make his way on a Dutch ship back to England, but since he has time he first goes to Glubbdubdrib. Here he discusses history with the ghosts, and learns of the immortal Struldbruggs who spend most of their existence old and infirmed. Gulliver then makes his way back to Balnurabi and on to Japan, where he manages to avoid a ceremony where he would have to trample on the crucifix before returning to England. This is the last of the sections which Swift wrote, and is the most unusual.Part IV, \\"A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms\\" starts with Gulliver breaking his promise to remain at home and returning to the Sea. Once again misfortune sets in and his crew mutinies and eventually leaves him on an unknown shore. Here Gulliver meets the dominant species, the Houyhnhns who are like horses. The humans of this land are called Yahoos, and their behavior and actions convince Gulliver that the Houyhnhms are preferable to his own species. In the end Gulliver much prefers life among the Houyhnhms to that among humans (Yahoos), even those in England. The Houyhnhms decide that Gulliver is a danger to their society, and so they exile him. Gulliver is rescued, no thanks to his own efforts, and finds himself once again among humans. Despite being treated wonderfully by the Portuguese captain, Gulliver cannot stand being among humans, and even when he makes it back to his home in England, he prefers to spend his time in the stables with the horses. This section contains my favorite part of the book, where Gulliver tries to defend European \\"Civilization\\" to the Houyhnhms by discussing European wars.If one is looking to read \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" as a Children's book, then there are better editions than this one to choose. If you are looking to read the complete book as an adventure story or a general satire, then there are several editions which contain the complete novel, though this one will work for that as well. If you are looking to read it to understand the more specific and detailed satire that it offers, then the Penguin Classics publication is a very good choice of editions. In addition to the introduction and the notes mentioned before, there are also some textual notes discussing the differences in the 1726 and 1735 editions. For the most part, this book sticks with the 1726 edition, but there are several places where Robert Demaria, Jr. opts to use the 1735 text. This is also discussed in the notes and in \\"A Note on the Text\\" which precedes the novel."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by Gulliver's Travels, a book that I expected to be a tediously difficult read. Instead, I found it to be fast-paced and interesting, though filled with references to various bodily excretions almost to the point of obsession. Having been introduced to some of the book's cool words that have been dictionary-ized (like \\"Lilliputian\\" and \\"Brobdingnagian\\") in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, I enjoyed learning a bit about how they came to be, though was most intrigued by two countries, Laputa and Luggnagg, that I'd never heard of before.In Part I, Gulliver sets out on his first voyage and lands in Lilliput, were the natives are only one-twelfth his size. After freeing himself from bondage, he ingratiates himself with the Lilliputians in various ways, including, in a moment of quick thinking, putting out a fire through peeing, in one of the many bodily-excretion-related incidents Swift shares with the reader. Another, on the same island, involves his dismay at having to...ahem...rid his body of fecal matter, including the lengths (involving wheelbarrows) that the locals must go to to facilitate the situation. Typical throughout his travels, Gulliver is able to learn the language and get on good terms with the native people. As happens after each major stop, he heads home to hang with the wife and kids, then and goes off on his next adventure. In Part II, readers learn about his second destination, Brobdingnag, basically, the land of the giants. Field laborers track him down and his caregivers end up showing him off to others at times as a sort of freak due to his diminutive size. Due to bad feelings about him on the part of a dwarf, he's involved in several \\"accidents\\" involving things like apples, a dog, etc. Again, he heads home. In Part III, where he visits several destinations, he gains passage as a ship's surgeon. Unfortunately, the captain takes on some bad guys, which leads to Gulliver being left adrift. He finds his way to Laputa, the land of math and music, where, among other things, the island is a perfect circle and its residents eat things formed into perfect geometric shapes. From there he moves on to Balnibarbi; Lagado, where they employ some backwards-seeming practices for plowing and constructing houses; Glubbdubdrib, where persons from the world over may be called up from the dead and questioned for a period not to exceed 24 hours; and Luggnagg, land of the extremely intriguing Struldbruggs, whose status as immortals turns out not to be as appealing as one might expect. In Part IV, he journeys to the \\"Country of the Houyhnhnms,\\" where, in Planet of the Apes-like fashion, the beasts (horses) rule, and the Yahoos, more primitive versions of humans, are ruled.Within the story of his various adventures, even a semi-oblivious (in terms of history and politics) person like me will find interesting discussions about and references to social, religious, political, and philosophical issues that still exist today, almost 300 years after Swift wrote Gulliver's Travels. Also good: Silence by Shusaku Endo, Shogun by James Clavell, and Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is near-unique in world literature in that it can truly be enjoyed and appreciated by all. It has over the years been seen an adventure, a children's story, a travelogue parody, a political allegory, one of the first novels, and a satirical masterpiece. The book is all this and more, making it one of literature's ten or so truly immortal works, a towering monument as significant and important nearly three hundred years on as ever. It is one of the few books that absolutely everyone should read, and its peculiar greatness is that, perhaps alone among them, nearly everyone will love it.On the most obvious level it is a rollicking adventure. Swift's imagination is one of the most astounding ever; he invents an incredible diversity of unforgettable places and people, and millions have been enthralled by this alone. The book has even often worked as a children's story - sans crude and heavy elements of course. Those approaching it for the first time are in for a real joy. They simply will not know what comes next and will keep wondrously reading to find out.Those who really appreciate the novel, though, see that Swift was merely using the adventure frame as a vehicle for his philosophical and political views. Often called misanthropic, a deep distrust of humanity affected everything he did; he was sickened by brutality, avarice, pride, and other vices, which comes across clearly here in many ways. Gulliver unflinchingly depicts many of humanity's shortcomings without excuse or even sympathy; our irrationality, stupidity, ignorance, hypocrisy, and perhaps above all, arrogance are on merciless display. The true mockery is often not so much the horror of our actions as the pettiness of our motives. Despite the light-hearted device, a more fundamentally misanthropic and savagely satirical work has perhaps never been written. Anyone wanting shame-inducing proof of what fools human beings are need look no further.Yet it is possible to take this too far. As misanthropic as Swift was, he was also one of the era's great liberals - a fierce liberty champion and advocate for the repressed. Those who read closely can see that his hatred lay not with the downtrodden but with those who make them so - monarchs, politicians, judges, lawyers, and other unsavory types. He was sickened by humanity's inhumanity. The almost unbearably dark ending seems to have no hope for meliorism, and the book generally shows human life as an unbroken misery series. Stern Christianity kept Swift from the existential despair that haunted writers and intellectuals about a century and a half later, but one would be very hard-pressed to find a more despairing portrait of the human condition prior to the late nineteenth century.Again, though, this can be exaggerated. Some parts of the novel are truly light-hearted; there is a wealth of humor, not all of it satirical. There is also a great deal of charming whimsy. Most notable of all, though, is that Swift manages to convey his bitter pill through satire; this is worlds away from the gloomy realist works of the last century plus. Swift is universally known as the greatest English satirist and is one of the greatest ever; he knew how to convey harsh truths in palatable form. The satire ranges from thinly-veiled to subtle. Swift thus lets the real message arise naturally rather than overwhelming the story - a fine line that few can walk straight and that perhaps no one can do as well.The satire's sophistication has been fully recognized only relatively recently; Gulliver was indeed so far ahead of its time that it was perhaps not even possible for all its nuances to have been appreciated earlier. Careful readers will notice that Gulliver, as his name implies, is very gullible - at least at first, often not seeming to see the full import of what he says. However, he becomes ever more cynical and wizened, and the satirical frame gradually lessens to the point where most of part four is simply outright lashing - almost an essay in dramatic monologue form. Some have criticized this on artistic grounds, saying Swift got carried away or even that he began to lose sanity. However, it is clearly deliberate; the artistic control is stunningly precise. Swift knows how to draw us in, introducing his message gradually until we are so taken that we will keep reading even when hit hard. Such finely-wrought mastery has rarely been shown anywhere, much less in satire. This is also important in character development terms; Gulliver is a very complex - perhaps even unreliable - narrator of the type who did not really reappear until the twentieth century. Obvious as Swift's points are, the novel is thus ripe for deconstruction; the book can be interpreted in a near-endless variety of ways with widely different ramifications despite the clear core. This is a large part of the reason for its continuing popularity with critics as well as the public.Gulliver is a landmark in many other ways, not least in the novel's history. It was published in 1726, only seven years after Robinson Crusoe, which is generally called the first real Western novel. There is even good reason to think Swift began as early as 1720. Robinson is one of the few books even more popular than Gulliver, but the latter is far superior by any standard; it has virtually everything Robinson has plus far more. Novels of its depth and complexity were not normal for nearly another two centuries; that such a work came practically on the first novel's heels is truly incredible. Also highly noteworthy is how Swift manages to keep a realistic tone despite so many fanciful events - a task far harder than Defoe's with Robinson. This is of course part of the joke and also Swift's jab at the highly apocryphal travelogues then immensely popular; Gulliver is indeed in large part a parody of them, yet another interesting angle and one now nearly forgotten.The book is also of great historical value. The satire in many ways gives a more realistic glimpse into the important Enlightenment era than a realist work, or even a history, could ever hope to do. We get a good idea of the issues that dominated English, Irish, and European politics as well as other important social matters. Perhaps more importantly, we get a stark glimpse of the thoughts and customs that lead to the atrocities Swift condemns - an invaluable lesson from which we clearly still have much to learn.Last but not least, Gulliver is an English prose watershed. Swift defined good style as \\"proper words in proper places\\" - a seemingly simple, even asinine, definition but one that very few have successfully followed. His prose is plain and straight-forward, as Gulliver himself constantly reiterates, but in the best possible way; few works are so clear and concise. Thus, despite archaic spelling and punctuation, the book reads almost as well as ever; even casual readers who have almost no experience with classics, much less ones of this vintage, can pick it up with practically no trouble. Unlike nearly all classics, it need not be drastically edited, footnoted, and introduced for comprehension. This is hardly true of even many twentieth century works, to say nothing of ones nearly three centuries old. Gulliver is a major part of the reason Swift remains a model for anyone wanting unadorned but transcendently lucid English prose.Surely nothing more need be said. If one could read only five or ten books, this should be among them. Anyone who has not experienced its wonders should do so without delay."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"It staggers me that a man could see this much of human nature, admit he saw it, write it down, publish it, and be allowed to die of old age. How did he ever get away with it? Our 21st century satirists seem cowardly in comparison. Who would dare suggest now, as Swift does, that we solve the bickering of Congressmen by sawing their brains apart and swapping halves with brains across the aisle? Attractive idea!For Swift, fantasy is a scalpel disguised as a diversion. Constructing elaborate fantasies allows him to confront the human truths we hide in plain sight. He seldom allows us to forget that our bodies, like our institutions, are a filthy stinking mess. Would a popular writer of the 21st century be allowed to be so scatalogical? How many readers today, who proudly consider themselves tolerant and open-minded, would put up with descriptions like that of the dog's death on page 170?The introduction and notes, by Robert Demaria Jr, are unusually helpful and graceful. There are often beautiful definitions from Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of 1755 and thus one's reading is littered with small satisfactions, like discovering that \\"new fangled\\" is a very old word.It's bizarre that we somehow managed to turn the first part of this book into a charming children's story.

Yes, the Lilliputians are enchanting, however, there are numerous crudities in the book. What you must understand is that this book is satire, not play. Read \\"A Modest Proposal\\" if you are unsure about what I am saying. Never take Swift from the surface, he requires a mighty dig into the historical background if you are to gain full measure of his genius.After seeing the movie, my daughter was telling her 8 year-old son that she would get the book for him to read.

I picked up an old dusty copy of this title at a book fair just so I could have this classic on my shelf. I was just out of college and not too interested in reading anything too boring and heavy. I figured I would scan through it just so I would be able to to say I read it and talk about it a little. What a surprise when I started reading- I couldn't put it down!It was the original version with the addition of footnotes that explained the political climate and other relevant facts of the day. I strongly suggest that you obtain a version with this information as without it you are missing 3/4 of the reading experience. I actually read the whole book twice just to try and pick up the funny, quirky things I might have missed. There are just so many levels to this book. On the surface it is a book about a man and his travels to strange faraway places. Underneath it is a scathing, comical, statement on the state of society and the movers and shakers of the day. I did not know that Jonathan Swift was a comic genius, but this is a fact you cannot miss if you read this book understanding the social satire weaved throught its chapters.

Swift brilliantly deployed (even invented) many great satirical devices such as messing about with scale, using exaggeration to hold a mirror to ugly human foibles and making the mores of his contemporary society look rediculous. Packed with quirky travellers tales, notes from 17th century sea travel, games, playfullness and proto sci-fi worlds, Gulliver's travels is a compendium of literary genius to last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is one of the most famous works of satire ever written and since it is still popular after 279 years of captivating audiences, it ages like fine wine (like Mogan David).If you have been a victim by seeing the crappy 30's cartoon and believe that the great Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) has played you for chumps, fear not, for this book is grand. It is a satire like I said before but it is geniusly discuised as a children's book.Part 1: Voyage to Lilliput-the most popular segment of the classic and the part that the cartoon is based on. Lemuel Gulliver ends up on an island with small people and wakes up after the Lilliputians have tied him down. Satire of monarchy and rivalry between England and France (Lilliput and Blefuscu)Funniest part- Gulliver estinguishes Empress' palace by pissing on it!Part 2 Voyage to Brobdingnag- Gulliver ends up in land where people are 60 feet tall. Don't really know what Swift was satirizing here but the funniest part is where Gulliver is taken hostage by a giant monkey! HA HA!Oh no, I ain't going to reveal too much but I'll say that further voyages bring Gulliver to a floating island and a land where horses (Houyhnyms) are endowed with reason and beasts (Yahoos)are shaped like men. Gulliver ends up hating men and reflects Swift's own misanthropic thoughts near the end of his life when madness destroyed the greatest writer in all of English History.This was the best book I've read since On the Road by Jack Kerouac and since that great work was by the King of the Beatniks, that's saying something!"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, probably the greatest novel, Hell, the greatest literary work from 18th century English Literature is read by children as an adventure story and by adults as a tongue in cheek satire of society which still is a perfect bullseye today.

Obviously that part of the story shows how much Swift hated monarchies.The best satire in the book is when Gulliver goes to an island which floats in the sky and meets very ignorant people there who always have to be slapped by people with a ball on a stick, which is a further satire on monarchy and since the island floats over the land it rules, it is genius satire saying that the rulers are always so far away from the people that they rule.The last part of the book is when Gulliver goes to a land where beasts are shaped like men and horses are endowed with reason. This shows that Swift was close to being a misanthropist, further proven by a letter written by him to fellow satirist Alexander Pope in which Swift said, \\"I hate and detest the animal called man...\\"Well, I've rambled on too much but this book is such a great read and a pure joy that it will make a raving fan out of you just like it made me. This book was so entertaining and funny packed with action and and genius satire, proving that Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was the greatest satirist who ever lived."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift, is an adventurous story with deeper political meaning than many realize. Written to appear historical and realistic, by directly enforcing the reader as the audience, these fanciful stories become believable. Currently becoming more apparent as a children's story, this story holds a much deeper meaning. The political satire that this author portrays is evident throughout the story. I could relate events in Swift's novel very easily to outside events, which proves that he purposefully set his story up as a political satire, full of social commentary. He wanted to accent on the political confusion and corruption that occurs, and successfully delivers this through an interesting, twisted plot. Overall, I feel that this book can be appreciated by many age groups because it can be taken on several different levels. I think there is still more I can learn about this book, but truly took it to heart to understand the majority of political satire that the author developed, and I appreciate Swift's attention to the audience and presenting the book through the perspective of Dr. Gulliver."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Parts were excellent and parts were boring. I definitely had favorite \\"countries\\" that he traveled to and loved when I could hear the sarcasm and biting wit. There were times when I'd wonder, \\"this was written 300 years ago??\\" I found that the word 'pimp' (and many other words) has been around that long at least. Another thing that I wondered at was how open the discourse was. The author, whether you mean Jonathan Swift or Mr. Gulliver, the traveler, had no problem discussing bodily functions. Fifty to 100 years later in Austen's time an author wouldn't THINK of doing such a thing.So I found it to be interesting in three ways. First as a work of fiction since Mr. Gulliver travels so widely and sees so many unaccountable things. His descriptions of the natives of these lands is really interesting. Second, as a political satirist Jonathan Swift was acutely poking fun of his countrymen and occasionally I could even discern who he would be making the jest of. More often I couldn't but it was enough to know that he was putting down his contemporaries. Thirdly, as a gauge of humanity / human nature. The same vices, virtues and pastimes Jonathan Swift describes are just as much a part of our society today as it appears they were three hundred years ago. I distinctly remember one line where Mr. Gulliver muses on how the generation before his thought that his generation was the most degenerate and lazy and how they would be the ruin of the society etc. etc. Isn't that what our \\"parents\\" say of us? That there is no faith among our generation. We are impatient, lazy and not willing to create or make long-term goals? I found the whole thing interesting."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Anyone who wishes to discover what the neoclassical period was all about need only read this novel and you will get it! Along with \\"A Modest Proposal\\", Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels demonstrates satire to its ultimate purpose. Which is to take what many people see as sacred and take it to its logical extreme. The book is really easy and really functions as a children's story through the first two books. This is the part most often spoken of in public. In fact most film adaptations only give these two books and leave out the rest.The latter two books is where we discover Swift's unbridled cynicism. While many people think this cynicism is a downfall of the book, I look at it as a shining light of Swift's time. Indeed, I think Swift's wit and biting satire are needed today. Just think about all the fodder a man like Swift would have? We have so many interest groups in America that think they are holier than thou, I only wish a satirist of Swift's stature to make fun of these ne'er do wells of today.I highly prize this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see good satire in action."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"The book was good and the author writing style was quite independent. Gave the book 4 stars because the book had good storyline and was interesting but at times it dragged."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" was the next stop on my quest to read classics written in English. I recently read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and frankly wasn't that impressed. For the record, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" exceeded my expectations and has me perplexed why I was never assigned the book in all my years of schooling.I am familiar with the many re-tellings of choice parts of the book but had never heard the one about extinguishing the palace fire with the power of piss. There are other sections dealing with the bodily functions that are left out of the children's versions of the stories.But lets start with the imagination involved. Swift created four distinct and compelling worlds that turn the role human's play upside down. Not one but four. He used relatively plain language with workmanlike prose to create worlds that showed us in unflattering light but with a purpose.Next there is the satire. Clearly, Swift is talking about his own age but also about human beings that we recognize as full of the pride, avarice, violence not to mention the bottomless pit of human stupidity. He parcels out the satire carefully and slowly so that we begin to believe the exaggerations are reality and by the time Gulliver doesn't want to return to human society and instead live with horses or houyhnhnm, I was completely with him.What about that fourth voyage? While I relished the brilliance of the first three voyages, it is the fourth one when he ends up with the houyhnhnm that I felt the nobility of man's potential and how sad it is that we surrender so quickly to our shortcomings. There is something about Gulliver's affection for the noble horses that conveys this notion with tremendous effectiveness on a feeling level."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Upon receiving this book, I was pleasantly surprised. It is well put together and is small enough to carry around without even thinking about it.

Got it for my children.They are enjoying it thoroughly on my Kindle (Keyboard).Recommended."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This book is probably the best known full-length satire of society. In it, Swift mocks what he feels to be the all the iniquities of the 18th century. And of course, it's far from being a children's book.There are four voyages and only the first two are known in the popular imagination. In each voyage, Gulliver goes to a country/countries that are radically different from those known and stays with the court/government learning about the country and sometimes helping out.Part 1 is a voyage to Lilliput. Here, the people are very very small. This is the most well-known part, containing famous satires such as that of the Big-Endians and Little-Endians. The small characters generally satirise the characteristic of pettiness.Part 2 is a voyage to Brobdingnag. Here, the people are very large. As such, they satirise the opposite quality - that of being overbearing. Here, Gulliver is paraded as a pet.Part 3 is a voyage to Laputa (and other islands including Japan). Here, Swift mocks scholarship and science. Each of the several islands has a peculiar trait to do with science. Here, you'll find such classics as the novel-writing machine and the country where the linguists decided that words are too indirect to communicate being signs of signs so everyone carries a large sack of objects to point to in direct communication - which sounds like something from a modern academic, except this is interesting.Part 4 is a voyage to the country of the Huyhnhnms. Here, Swift departs from tongue-and-cheek and becomes biting. The country is a utopia populated by benevolent horses and the humanoids are wild and uncivilised so they're &quot;looked after&quot;. As a result of the horses' brilliance, Gulliver becomes disgusted with the human race after seeing the difference. Obviously like all parts of the satire this is not to be taken literally - that Swift despised people.That's the basic content but nothing can describe the joy, humour, wit and imagination used in the book. It has everything and is an absolute must for anyone who's ever saw something funny/wrong with society (ie. all)."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Swift is by far the most effective satirist I have ever read. Voltaire restrains himself with logic, Rableais occupies too long a space, H.L. Mencken and Bierce wallow in bitterness. But it is Swift that has woven a wonderful tapestry that fully diagrams the human condition and his takes on it. The book is very contradictory because of the fact that he pairs one vice with one virtue in every chapter. His overall theme is that moderation is the only way that we can avoid being so ridiculous as these people.This book has been berated by some as despondent or dated, but Swift was not thinking four hundred years into the future. However, it still packs a punch if you are willing to inform yourself on the times. Part one is a superlative criticism of George I, II, and Anne Stuart of England. All of these leaders were naive and at the disposal of their advisers (like Walpole). Brobdignag is an attack on the pursuit of vanity by people. TO read the description of the mother suckling her baby, will make any person cringe. Laputa, the highlight of the book, is an adequate criticism of science. He charges that they are pure theorists and not pragmatists. I think that this chapter is heavily dedicated to Isaac Newton, who was involved in political committees left and right and was known for being a bitter, ponderous person. After criticizing history, the novel ends with &quot;Hyounhymns&quot; and &quot;Yahoos&quot;. I guess that &quot;Yahoo&quot; derives from the biblical &quot;Jehu&quot;. The end of this one is devoted to mocking the absolute extremes of the human condition-- dystopia and utopia. He comes to the conclusion that both are ridiculous and divorces himself from his family.The key is to read between the lines of his tone and his facts.To end, the book has been berated by scholars as simplistic, but that is the trap, to convince the reader of being absurd and playful, when there are really layers of thought behind them.Finally, he does criticize religion; notice the passages that say &quot;we {debate} whether bread be flesh, flesh bread, blood grape juice, and grape juice blood&quot; Nothing was too sacred for Swift, and that is why I recommend the most penetrating analysis of the human condition to come out of Europe, or most of literature."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Time may not have been on my side with this book, as summer was closing and I was frantically reading this book as well as two others. I feel as though this novel caught me in a way that none other has yet. It seemed to teach more about myself than any novel ever could. It showed me more about foolish pride than any person could ever advise me. I own the Cliffs notes, however I did not need them. This is an easily-read novel, and the Penguin Classics version shows the two-fold meaning of the political and fantasy novel. Because of the footnotes, I learned more about the novel than any teacher could ever even attempt to achieve. If you are required to read this novel, or would just like to give it a try, I strongly recommend it, and I also recommend that the reader tries to purchase a copy of the Penguin Classics version."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I have trouble reading classic literature. I am an avid reader and I want to enjoy the classics, but just find it difficult to understand the meaning in some of the writing.This, however, was a pleasant surprise. Although written in the early 1700s, the story itself was fairly easy to follow. Even towards the end, I began to see the underlying theme of the satire that Swift has been praised for in this work.Being someone who reads primarily science fiction and fantasy novels, I thought this might be an opportunity to culture myself while also enjoying a good story. I was correct in my thinking. Even if you can't pick up on the satire, there is still a good classic fantasy story.Essentially, the book details the travels of Lemuel Gulliver, who by several misfortunes, visits remote and unheard of lands. In each, Gulliver spends enough time to understand the language and culture of each of these land's inhabitants. He also details the difference in culture of his native England to the highest rulers of the visted nations. In his writing of these differences, he is able to show his dislike with the system of government of England. He does this by simply stating how things are in England and then uses the reaction of the strangers as outsiders looking in, showing their lack of respect for what Gulliver describes.I found it very interesting to see that even as early as the 1700s there was a general dislike of government as well as lawyers.I would recommend this book to anyone who reads the fantasy genre. Obviously, it's not an epic saga like so many most fantasy readers enjoy, but it's a nice break. I would also recommend this to high school students who are asked to pick a classic piece for a book report. It reads relatively quick and isn't as difficult to read as some of the others that I've tried to read."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"If you feel that the modern era is the worst that man has experienced....if you think that the physical and moral crises we face today are unique and know no parallel in human history....then you must read &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;. Written in 1726, this is much more than the story of some clod who falls into the hands of big people and little people. It is a savage social satire, and it takes on just about every aspect of contemporary society, including the decline of physical and moral character from the earlier &quot;good&quot; eras; the malice and intransigence of bureaucracy and government; the obfuscation of law and justice by lawyers and the legal clique; the rampant advance of science and the resulting misery and pollution and general future shock, man's love of war and cruelty, etc., etc. This may sound strange, but it makes me feel better to know that the intellectuals of every age have perceived their cultures as being in decline and inferior to the grand works of those who came before.Jonathan Swift was a man of great passion and great frustation, and this comes through in his works. The epitaph he wrote for himself reads as follows: &quot;He has gone where savage indignation can lacerate his heart no more.&quot;&quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; is very readable; however an edition with a few footnotes is helpful."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is a great book with many adventures. Gulliver, the main character, takes many trips to different islands, where he learns the viewpoints of other people, on him and his country. He goes to a country of people that are only six inches tall. He begins to think that they can do no wrong. He soon learns that they are very corrupt individuals. He tells them about how his government works and they compare each other's. Gulliver thinks that his is the ideal government after this. The next stop for him is on an island of giants where he finds a better government than his. He is actually kind of embarrassed of his government. This occurs in book two. In book three Gulliver is brought to a floating island. He does not really interact with people like he did in the other books. He is really just Swift's mouthpiece. In book four Gulliver meets the horse like Houyhnhms. He starts to want to be a Houyhnhm. All in all this is a pretty good book and everyone should read it sometime."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This is of course one of the great classics of Western Literature.However it is one whose unrelenting satire and ridicule of Humanity are for some of us, difficult to bear.Swift not simply puts Humanity through the microscope and reduces us to Liliputans, he also allows us to achieve our foremost aim and go on living forever, but at the price of continuing to age. In this he might be said to be the ' prophet' of our present nursing home industry.It is said that with twentieth century writers,like Beckett and Ionesco, Mankind at last came to feel the truth about our own fragmented, pathetic, pitiful and often disgusting nature.Yet Swift did all this before in the form of a highly entertaining narrative that to this day fascinates young and old alike."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I really enjoyed reading through Gulliver's Travels, I recommend it to anybody who's trying to get a good grasp on the classics and learn to enjoy some literature, but for those of you who just want to sit down at the beach and relax, this might not be the book for you. Despite the numerous versions of Gulliver's Travels flying around billed as Adventure Stories, you must remember that Swift was a satirist and Gulliver's travels is really just a large allegory. Keep in mind it's a satire from a few hundred years ago. You may find yourself lost in names and connections that would have been obvious (and perhaps very clever) to the original audience but keeps the modern day reader flipping through to the foot and end notes. The most interesting parts are the first, second and fourth parts, while the third gets a little dry. When he gets into the narrative of the story, it is very interesting and again a very important piece in literature."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This book is a treasure, both for its expressive (if often archaic) language and for the forward-thinking observations of the author on human nature. I had always thought of this story as primarily Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput, but it is so much more as he travels to a land of giants, a sky city where people are so lost in thought they can barely communicate, a land where scientists devote themselves to useless pursuits, a kingdom of magicians where Gulliver talks to the dead, and an island where humans and horses switch roles. In spite of what you might expect from this description, this is not just (or even mostly) a book for kids. It's chock-full of powerful insights into how humans worked then (in the 1700's) and how we still operate, and is sometimes quite saucy and crude, often to hilarious ends. A true classic, which deserves to be read again and again.The Kindle version had just a few minor typos, and no real formatting problems. I loved being able to look up unfamiliar words in the built-in dictionary."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"My first experience of Gulliver's Travels was when I was about 7 or 8. My father had been a part of this subscription service from some publisher (I think it's the Franklin Library) called the \\"100 Greatest Books of All Time.\\" The edition he had was heavy with gilded pages and was something that seemed like one of those medieval illuminated manuscripts. Each few pages had a beautiful, colored illustration of Gulliver struggling.Before I'd go to bed, he'd sit by my dresser on his wooden chair with a glass of water--at least that's what I thought it was--on his knee, and I'd be wrapped in a blanket with my back to the head of my bed frame. When he started reading, his posture would straighten out and he'd hold the gold hardback up to his eyes with one hand, the glass of \\"water\\" held in the other. Every few page turns, he'd sip at the glass and inhale sharply as if he were washing down what he had read. I remember hearing his voice bellow above the reading lamp in a kind of dark monotone. It wasn't like when he read My Father's Dragon or Wonderland. He would describe Gulliver trapped and tied down, and I remember feeling guilty for laughing. The most he would do is invisibly smile in the shadow of the lamplight and snicker.My father died this past summer. About a month after the funeral, I was walking through Border's trying to figure out what books I wanted my students to read (I just started a teaching apprenticeship at a local high school), and I ended up finding this edition. The good thing about it is that the price is so cheap.Upon rereading it this past summer, I suddenly realized what Swift and my Father saw in the text. This was by no means simply a children's book or even a \\"misanthropic\\" novel, but instead, Gulliver's Travels maps perfectly the lifespan of a human being. This novel is clearly a bildungsroman. This occurred to me when I realized that the reader's concept of the author \\"Gulliver\\" is a result of his travels. Each world he visits, he is at first considered an outsider and then becomes, somewhat, a part of the society. Gulliver is an amorphous narrator; he exists only through these worlds and therefore, grows with the text. He is not just a passive observer to these magical places, but the context of his visits shapes him, the narrator, as much as it does change the reader.How he is seen is through the context in which he is put. The Lilliputians are, obviously, a symbol for childhood. Brobbindang is pubescence as in this section, Gulliver sees the ugliness of the human form. The things that were cute in childhood now are these frightening forms. The last world Gulliver visits is a reference to the cynicism of old age. He sees humanity for what it is, a bunch of Yahoos. With this key in mind, you can clearly see how Gulliver's Travels is not misanthropic but an acceptance and analysis of the \\"human life cycle.\\" We all go through these stages during our life, just like how we go through them while reading the text. My father helped me realize this. When he read this novel to me as a child, he was teaching me what to expect from this world.However, this edition is worth \\"four stars\\" because the book is fairly cheap and feels like it will fall apart at any second. It feels as if there is no weight to it and is poorly constructed. Pages would be ripped out as they were turned. My father's stable, gold hardback edition was sold in a garage sale for a few cents four years ago. It's sad to say i don't think you can read it like that hardback tomb anymore."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I am certain that nearly every person in the Western world (and some beyond it) is familiar with the quintessential scene of \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" that of a man tied down to the ground and surrounded by tiny humans. I am equally certain however, that only a very small percentage of these people have actually read Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, first published in 1726. If you consider yourself a serious reader, then \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is essential reading, one of the many classic novels that you simply *have* to read before you die.Divided into four parts, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is presented as the historical memoirs of Lemuel Gulliver who narrates his strange adventures in undiscovered countries. In doing so, Swift explores and satirises almost every conceivable issue important in both his time and in ours: politics, religion, gender, science, progress, government, family and our basic ideas of defining humanity. As well as this, the novel is full of wonder and humour (some of it bordering on the vulgar!) and Swift's exploration of imaginary societies and countries is satire at its peak - no one before or since has reached Swift's mastery of this style.Some of the more direct parodies concern people and events that have long since passed away, and as such an index or extensive background is required in order to fully understand the allusions that Swift is making. However, a far larger portion of the text discusses issues that are still relevant to today's readers, especially in the responsibilities of power and the limits to technological/scientific progression.Part One: \\"A Voyage to Lilliput\\" is the most famous segment of the novel, and the context of the afore-mentioned \\"hostage episode\\". After taking leave of his family and country, Gulliver is washed up on the shores of an island inhabited by humanoid beings not more than six inches tall. Though at first suspicious, Gulliver soon earns the trust of the Lilliputian people who enlist their newfound giant in defending them from their enemies on the bordering island of Blefufeu - who likewise are desperate to use the giant in their war against Lilliput. Hmm, a squabble over what is considered a weapon capable of mass destruction. Sound familiar? This ability to place modern day references over older texts and their meanings is what separates literature from books - universal themes and concerns that do not age with time.In Part Two, Gulliver reaches the polar opposite of Lilliput in \\"A Voyage to Brobdingnag\\", a country of giants where he becomes the helpless victim of a greedy farmer who exploits his diminutive stature to his own advantage. Displayed as a freak of nature, the tiny Gulliver is forced to perform circus tricks till he finally comes into the care of the royal court. Despite being cared for by the gentle farmer's daughter Grildrig, Gulliver has to survive wasp-attacks, hungry cats and a malicious dwarf before he is finally seized by a hunting bird and set adrift at sea.One of the most appealing things about Gulliver's travels in both Lilliput and Brobdingnag is the disorientation he feels on re-entering the company of humans of a normal stature - each time they seem either too small or too big and Gulliver is constantly slouching or tip-toeing in an attempt to reconcile his body to what his mind tells him he should see. The best part is that we share this confusion with him, as we ourselves become accustomed to life in the tiny and giant worlds.Part Three is the least known of the four parts, and for those who have read the novel, the least popular. I consider this unfortunate as it is more full of variety and wonderment than the other segments, contains some of his sharpest parodies and is my personal favourite \`voyage' in the novel. Titled \\"A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Gluggdubdrib and Japan\\", it is easy to see that it this episode is filled with Swift's most creative inventions. It is here that Gulliver discovers a floating island, a race of immortals, a university in which they attempt to discover the answers to all things and an island of spirits who summon historical figures up out of the past. With everything from inward-eyed people to Alexander the Great to exploding dogs, Part Three has it all.Finally, in Part Four, the novel reaches its most critical and thought-provoking statement on humankind in \\"A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms\\". Gulliver reaches a country inhabited by a remarkable race of horses with the intelligence of humans - perhaps with even *more* intelligence than humans. Also living here is a disgusting race of beings known as \\"Yahoos\\" - filthy, greedy, slothful, lecherous creatures who embody every vice known to mankind - and who are suspiciously humanoid in shape and form. Gulliver is faced with a crisis of the soul: does he really come from the race of Yahoos? Will the Houyhnhnms accept him as one of their own or as a Yahoo? And how can he ever return home with the devastating wisdom he has gained? Swift presents a fascinating study on the dark side of humanity and the nobility of animals in the climax of the novel that is the most controversial, the most studied and the most memorable.\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is not an easy book to read; like all older literary novels it requires the attention and patience of the reader, has complicated and contemporary issues to discuss and a tendency to be a bit long-winded at times. But regardless of this, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is a fascinating and enjoyable read and one of those books that just *has* to be read during your lifetime - if not for any other reason but to say that you *have* read it. Though the scanty amount of reviews on this page is disheartening, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is a must-read, pure and simple.I also recommend the Hallmark adaptation of Swift's novel - NOT to be watched instead of reading the book, but as a surprisingly faithful and intelligent miniseries that accompanies the novel well."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"It's amazing how our perspective changes as we age. What we thought was important as children may now seem completely insignificant, replaced by entirely new priorities, priorities children wouldn't even understand. At the same time, things we used to take for granted, like having dinner on the table, being taken care of when we're ill, or getting toys fixed when they are broken, have become items on adult worry lists.Your perspective on literature can change, too. Reading a story for a second time can give you a completely different view of it. &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; by Mark Twain, which I enjoyed as a sort of an adventure story when I was a kid, now reads as a harsh criticism of society in general and the institution of slavery in particular.The same thing is true of &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift. The first thing I realized upon opening the cover of this book as a college student was that I probably had never really read it before.I knew the basic plot of Lemuel Gulliver's first two voyages to Lilliput and Brobdingnag, home of the tiny and giant people, respectively, but he had two other voyages of which I was not even aware: to a land of philosophers who are so lost in thought they can't see the simplest practical details, Laputa, and to a land ruled by wise and gentle horses or Houyhnhnms and peopled by wild, beastly human-like creatures called Yahoos.While this book has become famous and even beloved by children, Jonathan Swift was certainly not trying to write a children's book.Swift was well known for his sharp, biting wit, and his bitter criticism of 18th century England and all her ills. This is the man who, to point out how ridiculous English prejudices had become, wrote &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; which suggested that the Irish raise their children as cattle, to be eaten as meat, and thereby solve the problems of poverty and starvation faced in that country. As horrible as that proposal is, it was only an extension of the kinds of solutions being proposed at the time.So, although &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; is entertaining, entertainment was not Swift's primary purpose. Swift used this tale of a guillable traveler exploring strange lands to point out some of the inane and ridiculous elements of his own society.For example, in describing the government of Lilliput, Swift explains that officials are selected based on how well they can play two games, Rope-Dancing and Leaping and Creeping. These two games required great skill in balance, entertained the watching public, and placed the politicians in rather ridiculous positions, perhaps not so differently from elections of leaders in the 18th century and even in modern times.Give this book a look again, or for the first time. Even in cases in which the exact object of Swift's satire has been forgotten, his sweeping social commentary still rings true. Sometimes it really does seem that we are all a bunch of Yahoos."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift is classic work of satire and adventure that hardly needs my recommendation. Instead, let me comment on this edition published by Sterling. It's a nice hardcover with dustjacket and placeholder ribbon. There are a number of illustrations by Scott McKowen and an afterword by Arthur Pober. If you're looking for a inexpensive, but nice edition of Gulliver's Travels, this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"All I remembered about Gulliver's Travels was the Golden Book or other children's versions of the story that I read when I was still a wee young thing. The real story is much more thought provoking, and the style is quite interesting. Swift writes about his travels to various countries where he encounters people and customs far different from what he is used to. Nevertheless, he writes from an objective viewpoint without discussing what is wrong or right about any of the cultures he visits.The last place he visits is a country that is populated by extremely intelligent horses, who after hearing Gulliver's explanation of his own country and government, give their impressions of what is wrong with the English government and monarchy. Very tactful, but it makes the points he wants readers to understand. Many similar ideas to Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" come out in the horses' discussions.A bit long. I thought it might be a bit childish at first. But it was well worth reading from cultural, political and historical points of view."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is an excellent book. In it Swift satirizes what he thought were the foibles of his time, in politics, religion, science, and society. In Part One Lemuel Gulliver is shipwrecked on Lilliput where the inhabitants are only 6 inches tall. The rivalry between Britain and France is there satirized. In Part Two he is marooned on the subcontinent of Brobdingnag where the inhabitants are giants. The insignificance of many of mankind's achievements are there satirized. Next in Part Three Gulliver is taken aboard the floating island of Laputa, where Swift takes the opportunity to satirize medicine and science altogether - incredibly Swift did not make up the crazy experiments he describes; all were sponsored at one time or another by the Royal Society. Finally in Part Four Gulliver is marooned by mutineers on the island of the Houyhnhynms, in which Swift takes his parting shot at human society - presenting them in degraded form as the Yahoos. Most people read no further in the book than Brobdingnag - I urge you to read the rest."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Swift's classic satire of English and European governments, societies, and cultures should be required reading of every college student. (Except for those who appear to be in law school as is the earlier reviewer who referred to Swift as being an &quot;18th century Unabomber.&quot; Swift may have been conservative in his beliefs and not cared much for individuals such as Robert Boyle, who is satirized in the book, but he was not violent. Perhaps our &quot;law student/reviewer&quot; is offended by Swift's biting satire of lawyers and politicians in part four.) The version I read was an annotated edition by Isaac Asimov and contained many passages that had been deleted by previous publishers. Asimov's comments enable the reader to more fully appreciate Swift's satire. In part one of the novel, a ship's surgeon, Lemuel Gulliver, is shipwreaked and finds himself on the island of Lilliput, the inhabitants all being only six inches high. This section is great satire of English politics and wars. Royal ponp, feuds amongst the populace, and wars are made to look rediculous. In the second part, Gulliver finds himself in Brobdingnag in which he is only six &quot;inches&quot; tall (relatively speaking). This part forms another satire of European governments. In part three, Gulliver visits the flying island of Laputa where shades of ancient scholars can be called up. This section is a satire on philosophers and scientists. Scientists are portrayed as men so wrapped up intheir speculations as to be totally useless in practical affairs. Absurd experiments are described (for example, extracting sunlight from cucumbers (but, extracting energy from cucumbers and other plants is no longer so absurd Jonathan)). Also described in this third part are the Struldbergs, men and women who are immortal but who turn out to be miserable and pitiable. In part four, Gulliver travels to the Land of the Houyhnhnms, horses with intelligence but who have no passion or emotion. The word &quot;Yahoo&quot; originates in this part. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels: my first book ever on the Kindle(tm). Well, first about the mechanics of it all. I know, based on some reviews I have read, some versions of stories are poorly formatted or the font is bad or unadjustable or what have you--thankfully none of those issues was present here. It was a joy to be able to glide through the pages, looking words up at the speed of thought, never losing my place, and not having to stare at a backlit display for a change.None of this concerning Mr. Swift, though, who wrote this novel without even knowing of a typewriter or electricity. The book begins with Gulliver, an English gentleman of the early eighteenth century, talking of his love for travel at sea; I was beginning to feel as though I were reading Robinson Crusoe again. Things change quickly though as Gulliver lands on the land of Lilliput where the inhabitants are a mere half of a foot in height.Here begins Swift's parody of human culture that continues throughout Mr. Gulliver's three other tours of duty in the novel. Swift takes a characteristic or two of human nature and satirizes it with each civilization Gulliver encounters. The Lilliputians allow him to poke fun at politics and underhandedness, with every cutting each other's throat to win the king's favor. The Brobdingnagians give note to mankind's frailty, with poor Gulliver fearing for his life at every turn while the giants around him tiptoe to assure his safety.The third voyage lands Gulliver on an island in the middle of nowhere. He is rescued by the flying island of the Laputians, who are stuck with their heads in the clouds. I should say that Swift has a disdain for those who live lives in the stratosphere of philosophy and mathematics; the Laputians seem to be unable to function at all since their thoughts are always elsewhere.The forth, final, and most important voyage made by the narrator is to the land of the Houyhnhnms. The Houyhnhnms are hyperevolved horses who live their lives and run their society by rational means only. In that land there, there is a race of humans called Yahoos who live like wild animals. Swift's uses these two species to dichotomize our conflicting natures: the Houyhnhnms are our cognitive, rational faculties--our divinity--, while the Yahoos are the basal, animal-like natural side of us. Neither of these two polar opposites can be reproved for being what it is. However, it is our rational and refined halves that we wish to see have the upper hand. Unable to reconcile these two, the narrator goes a bit mad, and when he returns to England, becomes reclusive.I was thrilled with this book. Though I found some parts to be a bit slow-moving, the narrator dwelling in picayune details at times, the book truly is a work of art. This definitely opens the doors for Swift as an author to me.Matt Finizio[...]Box off, Life on."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Who would have expected that I would come away from this book liking it so very much? Trying to read it on my own, I failed, but reading it in class helped me to see it in context, and appreciate it as a funny, thoughtful, and sometimes cruel work, a satire that can be real fun and thought-provoking once you get into the right mood for reading it.Jonathan Swift was an Irish-born Tory who possessive of a famous aversion to humantiy in general. (Or so I am apt to classify him. There is something charming about misanthropes, one can really sympathize with them when one is cranky.) His Captain Lemuel Gulliver ends up stranded in various wondrous and edifying lands. I needn't tell you about Lilliput (six inch high people) and Brobdingnag (giants), but you might have forgotten Laputa, the floating island, and the land of the H----'s (don't bother me with the bloody spelling), those uber-intelligent horses. It's that last part, with the H----'s that is pretty shocking even today. You and me are both Yahoos of a kind, and Gulliver sails back to his people in raft with a sail made from Yahoo-skins. With Yahoo meat as provisions.But there are lots of disturbing, warped things in this book. I remember passages in Brobdingnag with the most fondness. There Gulliver, reduced to the status of a plaything, is quite helpless, and delightfully so. He is dropped into a bowl of cream by a dwarf and embarrasingly discommoded by a pet monkey. The ladies at the court take a perverse delight in bouncing him up and down on their breasts. Gulliver, being tiny, is able to note the physical human imperfections of his captors magnified--cancerous lumps, blemishes of the skin, moles and wrinkles appear in all their sordidness. And what interesting things these are to read about, in retrospect. I think that we as modern human beings--I mean as Westerners, swamped in our materialism and complacency--need to sample the muck in our \\"entertainment\\" sometimes, just to get in touch with reality. Tear yourself away from MTV, from the supermodels and the actors, from semi-kiddie porn anime, and admit that the physicality of our human bodies can be pretty disgusting.And also the psychology of Us, when we don't study ourselves and our values--Gulliver himself is a little man, a contemptible nincompoop most of the time. I didn't notice it while I was reading the book, but afterwards, I thought about it, and decided so. When he recommends gunpowder to the King of Brobdingnag, he even comes across as significantly--stupid. (Is there logic in presenting a country of giants with the ability to make gunpowder, when you and the rest of your kind are 1/100th of their size? Derr. Not really. Even if you want to suck up to said king.)But it's Swift on whom I can't quite place my finger... The more I think about him alongside his book, the more ambiguous he seems. Does he really mean to present the values of the H----'s as Good with a capital G in all particulars? (I was struck with their arrogant bitchiness, myself. Perhaps Swift would dislike me.) How about the Lilliuputian way of raising children, is that meant to be construed as desirable? (I do like it better than the cruel Puritanical strain of childraising, all that honor your mother & father ad nauseum beyond the bounds of compassion kind of crap--but the Lilliputian way doesn't seem to allow for that thing called love, either...)I dunno. You tell me.Ahh, but don't tell me Gulliver's Travels is outdated, or boring, 'cause I won't believe you."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"There have been many reviews regarding this classic so I will focus my review on the Kindle version stating: \`with illustrations and maps.'The illustrations did come through but were a little on the small side.

I think readers would love to see Milo Winter's work a little clearer.~ Jenna"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"GULLIVER'S TRAVELS can be looked at in at least two different ways. On a stand alone basis, it is a satire written by a misanthrope, but if taken within the context of his overall body of work, it can also be perceived as a satire written by a man with a deep concern for mankind.Part I and Part II satirize Englishmen, their religion, politics, and their government. Parts III and IV satirize humanity on a much broader scale.In Part I, we find Lemuel Gulliver shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the average inhabitant is about six inches tall. They are actually small in both body and mind. English religion and politics are satirized by descriptions of those who wear high heels and those who wear low heels, and by the dispute between those who feel their eggs should be broken at the big end and those whose preference is the small end. Like England, through much of history, the Lilliputians are constantly at war with their traditional enemies from across the chanel.In Part II, Gulliver is again stranded, this time on Brobdingnag, where the size proportions are just the opposite as in Part I. Here, Gulliver is tiny in relation to the inhabitants. Here, too, England, and to some extent all of humankind, are taken to task. After Gulliver has described European manners, customs, and behaviour to the king, the king comments that &quot;I cannot but conclude (that) the bulk of your natives (are) the most pernicious race of odious vermin . . . . to crawl on the face of the earth.&quot;Part III takes on the world of scientists, philosophers, historians, and &quot;projectors.&quot; On the flying Island of Laputa, the continent of Lagado, and the Islands of the Sorcerers and Immortals, He meets wise men who spend their lives in speculation but can't handle the practical necessities of life, professors who dedicate their lives to extracting sunlight from cucumbers, and immortals who reveal history to be nothing more than a series of deceptions.Finally, in Part IV, he finds himself in the country of the Houyhnhnms, who are horses with the power to reason. These horses lead clean and simple lives in contrast to the humans, known as Yahoos, who are filthy, brutal, and uncouth. In the Yahoos, Gulliver recognizes the human race, and after finally returning home, he can never again be comfortable in the company of other humans.Read by itself, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satire on the foibles, weaknesses, and petty corruptions of the human race in general, and English politicians in specific, as written by a rather bitter misanthrope. That is a correct reading, but not necessarily the only one. Read in the context of many of Swift's other works, particularly his many political pamphlets, I think that it can be perceived as a satirically inventive work written by a man who really cares about the future of the human race.As an aside, Gulliver's visit to Lilliput has, through the years, enchanted countless numbers of children. It is in this section that we get a peek at Swift's humorous side."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Great notes and text!

The price is good, but the book doesn't look cheap at all. Not to mention this book is really worth reading..."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"With the \\"bowlderized\\" film version my only exposure to Gulliver's Travels, I was under the horribly mistaken impression it was a \\"kids' book.\\" Ha! Nothing could be further on from the truth. To put it simply, Gulliver's Travels is the most succinctly profound piece of literature I've ever read... And being that I'm not an 18th century European, many of the allegories and allusions went right over my head. This is no concern, however, as the book's themes and messages are positively timeless.This book is its own sort of DaVinci Code. The meanings are multiple and layered, with twists of irony and hyperbole, allusion and metaphor at every turn. Then, once you take into account Swift's own biography, the mystery of each passage's meaning becomes all the more profound. But, at the same time, Gulliver's Travels is enjoyable as a straight-forward narrative. At a concise 250 or so pages, it is The Perfect Book.Other reviews go into detail concerning the plot and themes, so I'll avoid rehashing the storyline or offering my own interpretation of each of the four voyages. But suffice it to say, I viewed Gulliver's Travels as a championing of classical-liberal political philosophy (even as Swift was an Anglican priest), and as a skewering of the petty differences upon which governments make war. By the end, the protagonist finds that living under any human government is intolerable, having had his eyes open to the \\"perfection of nature\\" in the Houyhnhnms. I viewed this also as a major advancement in free thought (even as Swift opposed religious dissent!), that a Christian author could write such non-dogmatic fiction (i.e., if man was made in God's image, than what of the various superior races Gulliver encounters?) to be so eagerly consumed by a Christian audience. The vivid imagery, imagination, and multi-layered meaning of Gulliver's Travels is the perfect antidote to those who've recently suffered throughThe Pilgrim's Progress, as they make their way through the classics fromThe Well-Educated Mind."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This is a highly intriguing story about a man who goes on many adventures to multiple different islands, each inhabited by a certian form of creature.

This island is know as Lilliput. he escapes from Lilliput on a boat that washed up on the shore. The second island that he arrives on is populated by gigantic everything, trees,animals, people, and so forth. on this island he is captured and originnaly displayed for money and entertainment until he is bought by the queen. he escapes from this island in a miniture house that was made for him out of wood. this island was known as Brobdingnag. Once again, he journey to a distant island. this one is populated by people who are obsessed with music, math, and astromany. He leaves this island by way of a ship which takes him to Japan. His final voyage is to the land of the Houyhnhnms. This land is populated only by fully intelligent horses and creatures called Yahoos, which have many human aspects but have sharp claws and are somewhat violent. he takes his leave from this country with the help of the Houyhnhms, who aid him in making a canoe with a sail and paddle.

It seems that every time he plops down on the sofa with his better-half and children, Gulliver gets restless and needs to go have another adventure. (Did they have sofas back then? If not, how did people crash out in front of their TV sets?) And he lives in idyllic old England, go figure!Each time he does this (gets the traveling jones) he hops aboard some ship, tantamount to suicide in those days, eats salted meat and spoiled porridge for a few weeks, months or years, (unless there is a Chili's or Olive Garden nearby along the way--but he always seems to forget his coupons,) generally shipwrecks and sooner or later encounters some bizarre form of intelligent life in whatever fairyland he has found for himself this time, in whatever chapter of the book he happens to be sojourning in at this particular intersection of the time-space continuum.Usually he is held captive, and then embosomed or exploited by whoever the freaks of nature are this time around, invariably escapes and by a series of miracles eventually finds his way home again, only to discover the same boring wife and children at the hearth waiting patiently despite the years that have passed without so much as a text message.Along the way we are treated to Swift's amazing writing, great humor, wit and stellar imagination.

This novel consists of four books, which tell of Gulliver's adventures he go on. In the first book, he goes to the town of the little people. Gulliver is the \\"big man\\" in this town, which gives him a lot of pride. He soon finds out that no matter how small the Liliputians are they can commit human sized vices.

He is picked on and looses all his pride, which he tries his hardest to regain, but fails. In book three, he finds himself on the \\"floating\\" island of Laputa.

Swift leads the reader on numerous journeys with the protagonist, Gulliver. The way in which he changes our perspective of our lives causes the reader to ask the question, \\"What is my nature?\\" Swift is a satirist whose strong points are made apparent through his excellent writing style. This novel was very enjoyable and caused me to think about what we, as humans, are capable of, whether it be good or bad. This novel takes the reader to four completely different worlds where we begin an investigation into human nature, and all its capabilities. However, Swift does tend to mull over human nature and its weaknesses more than it's strong points. We begin to see a pattern in Swift's tale that leads us to believe that he does not put too much trust in us. Swift makes apparent the corruption that is strong within our government and every day lives. Although we do begin to see our flaws, we realize at the end of the tale that we are also given the precious gift of free will that allows us to make the right decisions. It is a very pleasurable reading experience that allows room to think and analyze the book. I would recommend this book to anyone age fifteen or above.

Jonathan Swift is a very talented writer who knows how to connect with the reader like no other writer does. He, in a way, resembles Andy Kaufman with his humorous criticism and sarcasm. Swift, in many ways, is a comic himself. He uses satire and sarcasm at the right times and always has a quick solution to everything. He is also a ventriloquist by using Gulliver as a puppet to talk through. Swift writes and talks about political immorality and satirization of all governmental aspects of mostly England and the United States. Swift calls on the governmental members to look upon him or her self and review him or her self to think whether he or she got their job as a result not concerning ability. I think Swift makes a great point in including this in his novel. Overall, I believe this book calls for great respect and a slap to the face of any individual who doesn't appreciate it's core memorandum.

GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is certainly among these immortal works, and I was delighted to return to Swift's masterpiece after more than forty years. Lacking the time to re-read the work in its entirety, I was content merely to listen to an eloquent delivery by David Hyde Pierce -- one that definitely did justice to the text.I must confess that this marked my first exposure (ever) to an audiobook (in whatever format), and I still miss the tactile sensation of turning pages. However, I might submit the same reservation about the books I read on my Kindle, as opposed to those I take off the shelf. That much said, the initial experience has proven most satisfactory. While it took me a short while to get accustomed to Pierce's voice, I soon made adjustment and found myself both enthralled and entranced as Gulliver worked his way through the four voyages. The process ran several weeks, in short installments, yet each left me anxious to hear the next.I suspect most of those reading this review have had much more experience than I with audiobooks, so I'll address concluding thoughts specifically to those unfamiliar with the medium.

It's a major classic and felt that I was missing out on something but having never read it. I love audiobooks and when I saw that this one was only 10 hours long I was thrilled. (It's quite short for an audiobook). Plus, I have read some of Swift's other works and am a fan of his satire.I was delighted to find out that a lot of modern pop culture references have ties to Gulliver's Travels. I think the most recent I've seen was a car commercial.While I did like the book overall, I couldn't help thinking \\"Dude! STOP GOING TO SEA!!!\\" Seriously, nothing good comes of him going to sea. He kept saying that he couldn't wait to get home to his wife and children, but a day or so after finally returning to them he'd leave again. I understand wanderlust, but what the what?I really liked the middle section (or his second trip to sea) where he finds himself on an Island with giants and is taken care of by a little girl. That section was so endearing. And I loved how adaptable he was. He could learn languages like woah. I'm jealous of that particular skill.I can see why this is a children's classic. There's a lot of adventure and far away lands. There's even a royal family. While there were some moments that I enjoyed poking a little fun at, it was an enjoyable book.

I really can'tget over how similar it is to Robinson Crusoe at times, especially when he's on the shipto Lilliput. Though his interaction with the Lilliputians wasn't the strongest section,you would be hard pressed to find equally clever interplay of parody and originality.

The irony is striking.Humanity is personified in the Lilliputians who are small, weak, corrupt, cruel and proud even in the presence of the giant, Gulliver. Here Swift also draws parallels to political strife in England and he is especially scathing of PM Walpole who is embodied in the character Flimnap.In the second book, Swift, reverses the role of Gulliver who is now diminutive. This sudden shift is a literary tactic which enables us to understand just how frail humanity is and the gulf between what we are ( Lilliputian ) and what we aspire to be ( Brobdignagian ).Swift uses the opportunity to show that with great power there is great responsibility which must be distributed justly. These qualities are what truly elevate humanity and are exemplified in the Brobdignagian King. We see that in the land of giants, a people free of pride, there is unity and peace free from corruption.The third books is a collection of tales poorly conceived yet powerful enough to yet again empasize man's pride as his downfall. This time it is in the form of Laputians who represent a parody on the notion that rationality alone is the means to our salvation.In the final book we see man compared to the idealized Houyhynhynms and the bestial and odious Yahoo's. This literary chiaroscuro shows what humanity is and will become when completely devoid of rationality and civility, a brute, juxtaposed with what potential humanity has to become.Of course we are not on either extreme but somewhere in the middle. Gulliver's fails to realize this and sits as a judge on humanity thereby becoming what he despises the most."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels Grosset & Dunlap Publishers, 1947,306pp.,$5.99Jonathan Swift ISBN number is 0-671-00174-4Gulliver's Travels is a wonderful adventure by Jonathan Swift. At first I didn't want to read it, but once I reading, I just had to keep going! In the beginning, we find a young man named Lemuel Gulliver. Mr. Gulliver was sent to Emanuel to be an apprenticeship to Mr. Bates. By being an apprentice, Mr. Gulliver becomes a surgeon on a ship called the Swallow. But when Mr. Gulliver marries and settles down in London, Mr. Bates dies and his business begins to fail, so Gulliver goes back out to sea. On the Antelope, they leave Bristol with the voyage bound toward the South Sea. Due to a miscalculation by the crew, they are already tired and ill when a storm brews. The captain, crew and Gulliver are forced to abandon the ship. Because Gulliver knows how to swim, he reaches land. That's when the half a pint of brandy from the ship forces Gulliver to fall asleep. When he wakes up, he can't move and he finds strings on his upper body. When Gulliver breaks the strings he's showered with tiny arrows and spears from an army of small people. When Gulliver doesn't fight back, most of the miscommunication has ended with this \\"Man Mountain\\". Gulliver finds himself in a city, a country of little people that speak an odd language. When he knows enough, he asks the emperor for his freedom back every day. All the while, Gulliver mainly wonders how he will get back home once he gets his freedom, that is, if he ever gets his freedom.Jonathan Swift, the author of this wonderful tale, was born on November 30,1667 in Dublin, Ireland. He died at the age of 78, and was known as a writer, satirist, and political writer. For 40 years, he had a political career and many were afraid of his political reviews. A political position which he was trying for was blocked by a Bishop and he was soon exiled from England to Ireland. The disillusioned Swift soon began writing Gulliver's Travels, which is a satire on the corrupt English government.I would recommend Gulliver's Travels to anyone. I would give this book * * * *.

However, Swift's satire really is focused on the idea that all people are Yahoos, just brutes covered with a veneer of civilization that simply makes them more destructive en masse yet less personally able to deal with the world. It's a hard message to stomach, especially when the self-righteous Houhnhynms are so dull; Gulliver believes they are free of the vice of pride, but they seem to me to have endless pride in their society, which, at least from a modern perspective, seems as deeply flawed as human society. These Houhnhnyms keep other Houhnyms as servants simply because the latter are of certain coat patterns. Since there is no money in this society, and since these beings are given no choice in the matter, this servitude is just glorified slavery, which makes Houhnhnym society all the worse for masquerading as something better. I am not sure if Swift intended this flaw as, perhaps, an indication that even the most utopian society has its weaknesses or if it is, instead, just a product of Swift's times. Either way, it made me entirely dislike the Houhnhnyms and their self-righteous attitude towards the Yahoos. Furthermore, the Houhnhnyms decide to castrate the Yahoos in the way humans might geld a horse; this, in itself is perhaps reasonable, but they decide this only after they object to Gulliver's description of the human practice of gelding. Again, I don't know what Swift intended here, but, in any case, I became thoroughly annoyed with Gulliver's respect for the Houhnhnyms. Of the earlier societies, I found the third the most interesting. Worlds of a different scale than our own have some interest, but there were far too many descriptions of the disparity of size. As the daughter of academics, I was much more compelled by the society in which novel methods were being constantly explored, with complete dismissal of what is practical and real. I wish Gulliver had not become so easily bored with the university there because I certainly wanted to hear more about it. However, what I took away most from Gulliver's travels is that Swift was inordinately fond of talking about excrement."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I have to read this book this year for senior year would this book follow the text book that they have for any school?"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"A book that you can take on two levels, the straightforward adventure story, and Swift's social and political commentary.

When they get Gulliver into the city they tie him up by his ankle to a old temple. The temple is no longer in use because there was a murder in the temple and they say that there is a curse in it. At first the liliaputions are nice to Gulliver but they begin to start doing cruel things to him. They started to demand task that Gulliver was not up to doing.

Throughout the book he uses parodies, analogies, or satire to demonstrate his beliefs making for a wonderful novel that is difficult to stop reading. Gulliver's Travels is without a doubt a book not intended to be a children's story, but since Swift wrote the story with a child-like plot, people miss Swift's intent to satirize the time in which he lived. Only once one reads this novel as an adult does one realize the scornful satire on man. The unfortunate protagonist of the story is named Gulliver whom goes on four adventures to uncharted and mystical lands. The first story starts out in a place called Lilliput, a country of people one-twelfth the size of Gulliver. These people resemble the British, and his enemies there are his enemies in real life. Also, there is an empire called Blefuscu that is the French, the mortal enemies of the British. One of the best parts of this book is his analogy to the history of religious controversy in England that made Catholicism illegal. This is shown with the Big Endian and Little Endian controversy of which a former emperor (Henry VIII) cut his finger while cutting an egg on the big end, therefore making cutting the big end of the egg illegal. Part one is filed with classic satire and is immensely entertaining to read, all the while Swift added pieces that were anti-nobility. In part two, one of the major themes is avarice, and people are willing to become affluent at the expense of someone else's life. Swift implies that Gulliver is shown around as if he were part of a freak show. This is because the giants at Brobdingnag are twelve times the size of Gulliver, enabling Swift to continue the child-like appearance of the book. After the monarchs buy him, he tells them of England and the king is horrified by the boorish behavior of Europeans, and especially the nobility constantly promoting killing to further their own ends. Evidently, Swift is insulting the vulgar nature of man in seventeenth century Europe. Part three is basically a general insult to Europeans, whom at this time were only concerned with music and math. He was attempting to point out the blindness of Europe, and to show them there are other interesting things in life. When there was a mathematical mistake in the making of his clothes by the Laputians, this may have been aimed at Newton, because Swift was severely disenchanted with Newton for making a positive report on William Wood's coinage in Ireland of halfpence. (The halfpence had been constructed of poor quality copper). Obviously, Swift maintains the hilarious, vitriolic satire making the novel an instant classic. Lastly, Swift writes about the Houyhnhnms, horses, which act as people do, but are far superior. Here he insults humanity in general through the superior Houyhnhnms, calling Yahoos (humans) boorish, vile, despicable, and cruel, especially lawyers. Part four is probably the most caustic attack upon humans and the nobility, therefore making it the most entertaining piece of the book. However, the book throughout is entertaining and will keep anyone's attention, regardless if they see through the satire or not. Even though Gulliver's Travels is a magnificent novel, it can be hard to read, due to Swift having used his colossal vocabulary to a maximum. However, Swift also has context clues in the sentences allowing the reader to understand what he means some of the time, but on occasion a dictionary is incredibly useful. For example, Gulliver stated, &quot;I lay in a profound sleep, by the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.&quot; The words, &quot;into my liquor,&quot; help the reader understand infused means to pour into. On the plus side, reading the novel enhanced my vocabulary astronomically with words such as declivity, draught, intrepidity, victuals, infused, and many more. Another potential problem is that Swift's satire can be obscure, and the audience may not understand what the characters are truly speaking about. However, those of us who know the history of Great Britain unequivocally will have no problem reading the novel. Fortunately, to counteract this difficulty, most copies of Gulliver's Travels have notes on specific parts of the novel because the publishers felt obliged to make it more readable. Another realistic problem is the reader may become infuriated by the repeated insults on human nature. Although Swift was correct, some people might stop reading, and this would be a disastrous mistake. One must realize that he is attempting to help civilization through caustic satire, because the whole point of satire is to expose, attack, or deride vices. If the reader can get past these three problems, it will be clear sailing, and the reading will be enjoyable and insightful. Jonathan Swift was remarkable in his ability to see the misgivings of human nature and offer insights on how to correct these definitive problems. Swift also made the novel amazingly readable and enthusiastically interesting to read. Plus, while keeping the reader enthused, he broadened the horizons of the reader's vocabulary. That is important not only for everyday life, but for national exams also. While Swift gave an important message that there are things wrong with the world in the eighteenth century, these problems still exist today. He informs the reader that war is evil and only brings about the deaths of many of our own kind for very few, if any important reasons. Also, he explained the malicious, avarice type nature of yahoos (humans) which inevitably bring about the demise of great civilizations. Finally, a problem that is very rare today, is the existence of monarchies. An absolute monarchy will have a propensity to be corrupt bringing evil and harm to all. Everything he says is true, and Swift deserves the utmost respect for writing this wonderful novel. Anyone who reads this book will surely be amazed at Swift's insight, and it should be required reading for years to come."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"**This review pertains to this specific Kindle edition**Well, this version is at least properly formatted, as opposed to one of the others, however it lacks a TOC and illustrations.

Though the voyages to Lilliput and Brobdingnag are the best known, it is in the voyage to the land of the Houynhnhms that Swift's \\"savage indignation\\" is most evident (too much so for many critics who have dismissed this part of the novel). Does Swift mean the reader to admire the Houyhnhms as the paragons of reason Gulliver thinks they are? Or are we to see in their society the effects of rationalism run amok--a picture of Enlightenment excess in which reason is divorced from compassion and humanity?"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Jonathan Swift, - satirist, churchman, reformer, - is perhaps one of the greatest satirists of all time. &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, his masterpiece, demonstrates the full breadth of his ingenious and far-sighted critique of almost the entire social order of his time, which included the Enlightenment belief in progress, reason and science, as well as the system of government. Critics have gone so far as to interpret him as a libertarian, an anarchist, even a nihilist, as he tended to see how even the highest ideals of civilisation, its most august institutions, were actually the products of barabarism. Like many men of his generation, including Alexander Pope, Swift believed in the &quot;retournons du nature&quot;, though nature was not seen as equivalent to the unchaining of passion and the blind gratification of appetite, but as something that was achieved through effort and discipline. The humour is bawdy and sometimes coarse, no less than that of Rabelais, such as the scene in Lilliput in which the giant Gulliver puts out the fire in the queen's tiny palace by urinating on it. Altogether, the book is an amusing and marvellous satire. Religion, however, is the one topic that Swift, being an ecclesiastic, refrains from subjecting to criticism."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"GULLIVER'S TRAVELS can be looked at from at least two different viewpoints. Traditionally, it is critiqued on a stand alone basis as a satire written by a misanthrope. If taken within his overall body of work, however, it can still be perceived as a satire, but one written by a man with a deep concern for mankind.Parts I and II take a look at the foolish side of Englishmen, their religion, their politics, and their government. Parts III and IV satirize humanity on a much broader scale.In Part I, we find Lemuel Gulliver shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the average inhabitant is about six inches tall. The Lilliputians are actually small in both body and mind. English politics and religion are here taken to task by descriptions of the doctrinal differences between those who wear high heels and those who wear low heels and by the dispute between those who break their eggs at the large end and those who prefer the small end. Like England, through much of history, the Lilliputians are constantly at war with their traditional enemies from across the chanel.In Part II, Gulliver is again stranded, this time in Brobdingnag, where the size proportions are just the opposite as in Lilliput. Here, Gulliver is tiny in comparison to the inhabitants. Here, too, Swift takes England and, for that matter, most of mankind, to task for being petty and contentious. After Gulliver has described European manners, customs, and behaviour to the king, the king observes that, &quot;I cannot but conclude (that) the bulk of your natives (are) the most pernicious race of odious vermin . . . . to crawl on the face of the earth.&quot;Part III takes on the world of scientists, philosophers, and all of their ilk. On the flying Island of Laputa, the Continent of Lagado, and the Islands of Sorcerors and Immortals, Gulliver meets wise men who spend their lives in speculation but are incapable of dealing with the simplest practical problem, professors who spend their lives attempting to extract sunlight from cucumbers, and immortals who reveal history to be nothing more than a series of deceptions.Finally, in Part IV, he finds himself in the country of the Houyhnhnms, who are horses with the power to reason. These reasoning horses lead clean and simple lives in contrast to the beastlike humans, known as Yahoos, who are filthy, brutal, and uncouth. In the Yahoos, Gulliver recognizes the human race, and, after finally returning home, he can never again be comfortable in the company of other humans.Read by itself, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satire on the foibles, weaknesses, and petty corruptions of the human species in general, and Englishmen in specific, as written by a rather embittered misanthrope. That is a correct reading, but not the only one. Read in the context of many of Swift's other works, particularly his many political pamphlets, I think that a case can be made that GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satirically inventive work written by a man who really cares about the future of humankind, and, using Gulliver as his example, that it is never too late to see the light.As an aside, Gulliver's visit to Lilliput has, through the years, enchanted countless numbers of children. It is in this section that we get a peek at Swift's humorous side."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"As a result of an astounding run of bad luck, Lemuel Gulliver, first a ship's surgeon and later a ship's captain, is washed ashore in one strange place after another.First he meets the Lilliputians, tiny people about six inches tall. Next he visits the Brobdingnaggians, giants as large compared to Gulliver as he was to the Lilliputians. His third voyage takes him to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan.His last voyage is to the country of the Houyhnhnms. On his first three voyages, he sees the foibles and pettiness of humanity by observing the strange humans he meets. But he observes them from his own human perspective. In the country of the Houyhnhnms, he meets the degenerate and repulsive human-like Yahoos and the almost perfect horse-like Houyhnhnms. Viewing humanity (as represented by the Yahoos) from the Houyhnhnm perspective so sickens Gulliver that upon his return to England, he is loathe to associate himself with his fellow humans and requires a lenghty period of adjustment before he can look at himself in the mirror or even eat with his wife and children.Gulliver's Travels is satire. Almost nothing in 18th century England is safe from attack by Swift's pen. Although much of the book is dated, the same sort of humans that Swift wrote about are still around today."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels are broken up into four parts. The first two parts are the most famous, where Gulliver visits a land in which he is a giant and another in which it is filled with giants. Although they are very good, I found them somewhat boring. This is probably due tot he fact that I had heard these stories in so many variations already, they no longer had that originality to them. The next two parts however I found to be excellent. Several authors have expounded upon these stories or have continued them in one form of another of them. It is good to finally find the source of such great insight. For example the world in the clouds is quite humorous, and Douglas Adams makes a similar use of this satire in one of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe series. The island of wizard's where you can call up any of the dead to have them tell their part in history can be seen in &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; by Philip Jose Farmer (a Hugo award winner.) The final part about humans being nothing but Yahoos, and inferior to Horses is brilliant. A reversal of roles with other animals to give us a new perspective of ourselves is imitated in other such classics as &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells, &quot;The Island of Dr. Monreau&quot; also by H.G. Wells, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, plus several Star Trek and Twilight Zone episodes."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"The author's observations on human behavior and politics are as relevant today, as they were when he wrote this book. \\"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" Did the creators of \\"Yahoo\\" ever read the depiction of Yahoos in this book before they named their company? Hmmm."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels was a very well written book, complicated, but sewn with an interesting plot. The story is told first person in the view of an adventurer named Lemuel Gulliver. He goes on an adventure and visits all sorts of strange imaginary places, and learns about the cultures, while relating it to his home in England.The book is written by Jonathan Swift, an author of the mid 1700's. This book was written a long time ago, and that effected the diction used. First, some of the words were complicated Old English and were difficult to understand. He was very careful about his word choice, and used it to express satire. Swift uses a large vocabulary especially when describing people, places, or events. Also, some of the words used were slang and made me stop reading to find the meaning. The book structure was organized chronologically, with the chapters separating important events. This book is filled with symbolism since it's a satire on English society.An interesting theme in this book was the battle between physical strength and things morally right. One battle involves Gulliver with his strength verses the Blefuscudian miniature army. Another example of this is the Brobdingnag's strength verses Gulliver's enslavement. He also observes this confilict when the Houyhnhnms chain up the Yahoos.I recommend this classic to a person 15 years old and up with a strong vocabulary, and a good understanding of English literature and culture around the 18th century. I would suggest reading this book if you are interested in fantasy adventures. I had some difficulty reading this book and couldn't enjoy it for the symbolism at first. After some thought I understand the symbolism and how Swift satires England's society. After studying the symbolism, I have a whole new perspective on the book, and now I can relate symbols in the book to English society around that time period."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver is portrayed by Swift as an average man of average courage, honesty, compassion, and intellect, a typical Englishmen. But there is nothing typical about Gulliver's travels. What Swift has accomplished by making Gulliver the embodiment of common English values and beliefs and then having him visist far away lands that are really the mirrors of English society is an interesting satirical device. He forces the English reader to unknowingly judge English society, not according to some higher law or pristine observer, but through the lens of their own cherished values. This effectively turns English beliefs and values in on themselves as a test of their merit. Swift echoes this structure by first having Gulliver visit a land of little people, which causes one to ovserve them with scrutiny of Gulliver, who is now the little one. After a series of defferent looks at society throug the first three voyages, Gulliver travels to Houyhnhnmland where the narure of people themselves are given the strongest censure, by being directly paralleled with the loathsome Yahoos. Here Swift bluntly attacks almost every aspect of society, which is then compared to the Yahoos point by point by the Grey Mare. Gulliver and the reader finally identify themselves completely with the Yahoos, and Gulliver decides to abandon Yahooism forever. But, he is then immediately banished brom the island by the Houyhnhnm assembly. This poses an interesting question: What is Swift's final message then about man or his future? The fact that Gulliver is unable to stay with the Houyhnhnms or adher to their principles after leaving the island, does not mean to me that man is doomed. I think Swift is saying man will always be Yahoo, but at the same time I think he is advocating an awareness of our Yahoo nature. And, if we can see ourselves through unmuddied reflecting glass and be honest about our Yahoo nature then we can strive honestly for Houyhnhnm values and abandon saying, or believing in ourselves, &quot;the thing which is not.&quot;"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This is an excellent book for all. The satire in this novel still rings true. Its cross-section of what it means to be human is hard to swallow at times. Not because it seems unreal but because it is extremely clear. We journey to the worlds of the simple-minded and ignorant, to the more sentient, and to the compassionate and intelligent. Which of these worlds are present to Swift all but one. Where do we Stand today?"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is a good book, even if you just read it as an adventure story, but when you can understand the wit and satire of Jonathan Swift, the book is great. It is a fictional narrative, written anonymously by Swift under the pen name Lemuel Gulliver. It is about the voyages and mishaps of Gulliver as he travels to uncharted islands, which are slightly different then a normal trip. He meets six inch tall people, visits a flying island, entertains some sixty foot tall royalty, encounters people that never die, and lives with horses that talk, reason, and have men-like animals for slaves. Along with this imaginative epic, Swift adds ironic humor and lays out his ideas of politics, religion, and humanity. Even though it was written in the eighteenth century, it is easily understood and fun to read for all ages. Some of the more subtle references and satires are hard to connect with, but if your book has footnotes explaining certain things, it will make it more enjoyable. I really like this book and I think you will, too."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This book has been assigned reading in classes from middleschool through college, and it is not an easy read. For starters, it's a satire. Also, it was written over 200 years ago, so the writing style will be uncomfortable to read at first. That said, it is worth the read. After reading the text, or in the middle of reading it, read the introduction that the Penguin edition has. This helps place the book into the time it was written and explains some of the satire as well.I personally think Gulliver's Travels is best suited for students who are seniors in high school and older. Anyone younger and the satire will probably be completely lost and it will just be an adventure story...And there are plenty of those to read that would be easier to digest. That said, Gulliver's Travels is a great read and once read, you will realize how many writers have used bits and pieces of it in recent work, both in books and in movies. And so far, there has not been a movie that did the book justice."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver\`s Travels is esentially a book about human nature , its capacities and its limitations . The first voyage to Liliput is the most charming as it is used the play of proportions .Gulliver is a giant among the people so small that they look like&quot;tiny animals &quot;. The liliputans represent the weak creature who yet has much courage , inventedness and curiosity in the face of the danger . Their moral smalness suggest that nomatter the size , man is a political animal and at the same time the emptiness of public grandour of which swift laughs ironically.As an examle , the qualities required for officers in the state to obtain a social position:ballancing on the rope ; the desire of getting as many titles as possible . Gulliver became an embarassment because of his good consumption of food . His enemies wanted to put him to death . His punishment is changed to blinding . Their thinking is selfish . His carcasses will be smaller at his death and less likely to produce infections in the country ; by starving him he will be smaller . the idea is that where political action is in question , morality has nothing to do with the matter . - Lilliput shows the smallness in man , his pride in money , his political uselessness .THE SECOND VOYAGE -Gulliver himself makes in his comments some links between the first and the second voyage . They are linked on the very device they are based: the relative size . The device is a satiric one . - the brobdingnags are large men and as a result of this we see clearly our phisical graceness . - Gulliver has to face different degrating physical adventures . - He is put in a cage like an animal . - Swift let us understand that physical size means moral largeness . Giants are generous , warm and human . The Brobningnag will remanin an ideal in this respect , as they are reffered to in the last chapter of the book . - B. is not a perfect state ; it has beggars and men who exploit others . The B. visited by Gulliver is fortunate in its monarch , who unlike the emperor in Liliput , is very good with his subjects . He refuses to accept Gulliver\`s offer of the secret of the gunpowder ; he is an enlighted king who loves his people and wants to do his best for his subjects moral and physical state .THE 3RD BOOK - it was in fact the last book to be written by swift . It is not so closely connected with the other two and thus it is less satisfactory . - presents the flying island of Laputa . - the island has a politcal reference . what is satirized is the abstract thinking . People are normal in size , but distorted in physical appearance . - they have no eye for the outworld ,for reality . - their human shape is distorted by their loss of human quality ; they live in a world of phantasy . - the capital prooduce a certain atmosphere in which man\`s activity is replaced by the chance of a machine . - the excessive intellectualism of the flying island led to separation from the real world .THE 4TH BOOK- Guliver is in relation with the Yakoo\`s bodies on one side and horses rational mind on the other side . The 4th voyage with its theme differing creatures is a synthesis of both reason and passion . Gulliver stresses strongly on the physical unpleasantness of the Yahoos and their habits , which are a version of all passion for jewel and gold . They are the corrupt passion entirely divorced from the reason . -"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Although not enrolled in the satire class at my high school, I had become fascinated by Gulliver's Travells when I heard some of my friends discuss it. I was not disappointed. It is animated and easy to read, with some moments hysterically funny. Engaging and thought-provoking, I often found myself reconsidering my notions of our society in the light of Swift's portrayal of man as absurd, irrational, &amp; cruel. Nevertheless, I don't believe Swift had an intense distaste for the idea or ideals of humanity per se, rather a repulsion at what state humanity had let itself regress into.

This brilliant 18th century satire endures to our times. Swift, in turns, attacks (in his subversive way) makind's vanities, follies, cruelties, and morals. The floating island crushing the lower island is still, to my mind, the best attack on England's merciless domination of Ireland.Some readers think: \\"I've heard so much about this book, but I didn't think it was so great.\\" Certainly, our expectations about something that is considered a classic may outweigh the book itself.

At first, you think of Gulliver's Travels as a kid's book due to the cartoons that were put out. But as you read it, you discover it is full of satire for adults.Jonathan swift writes about how people act or fail to act. Such as in the case where Gulliver finds himself in the land of Giants. Many people there are huge, larger than life- sports stars, models, movie stars, politicians of today- but they fail to see their own faults, acme, blemeishes as Gulliver describes them. Then you have the land of Lilliputians, who represent small people in society trying to be something there not, and always trying to push others around. Their election for mayor is funny in that the official who jumps the highest wins! Sorta like our elections today, the canidate who puts the biggest show wins.Jonathan then writes about the way he feels society should be in the land of the horses, noble, honorable, loving.HHMMM And he takes a shot at humans calling them &quot;Yahoo's&quot;, stating they are dirty, filthy, self-centered and how they throw their dung around like monkeys.Some say Jonthan Swift was an eccentric and crazy, others say he was a genius.

There were sections (particularly in Brobdingnag) where I could almost recite word-for-word what was going to happen next.Happily, like Alice in Wonderland, this is a book that ages very well. There was still the element of being just a plain old good travel story with strong images (particularly in the Lilliput and Brobdingnag sections) but there was also a wicked sense of satire that continues to be relevant and funny now more than three hundred years after the book was originally written.The latter two sections of the book-- Laputa and the land of the Houyhnhnms-- are perhaps a little less vivid for being more pointed in their satirical content (interestingly I have no memory of these sections from my childhood reading) but that in no way detracts from the value of the book.A must-read."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift is a wonderful book full of extraordinary adventure.This book is about a very well mannered and wise ship surgeon named Lemuel Gulliver, who gets washed ashore to wonderful and unbelievable lands.

As a result, those with opinions to voice often do so by writing tales of fiction that parallel events and characters in the real world. Some of these tales have gone on to become great works in Western Literature. One example is this children's classic by Jonathan Swift; Gulliver's Travels. Set in fictional places and filled with fictional characters, this book tells the story of Gulliver, a ship's surgeon who experiences adventures beyond anyone's belief. By chance and accident, he is transported from one place to another, and at each point, he encounters a society that at first, is utterly different from his own. But upon closer inspection, the characteristics of each place are exaggerations of actual circumstances found in actual societies. In each place, he also describes his own world to the locals, who in turn are amazed, astounded, and sometimes disgusted by what they hear.One example is when Gulliver arrives on the land of the Houyhnhnms, and the Yahoos they tolerate in their midst. The Yahoos are dirty, greedy, sedentary, and spend their time squabbling amongst themselves and digging along riverbanks for shiny stones. The Houyhnhnms on the other hand, are clean, upright, and roam free through the countryside. Such a story reminds one of the dichotomy between white settlers and Native Americans in North America. The latter roamed free throughout the countryside, and were known to bath themselves quite often. The former, however, rarely bathed, often fought amongst themselves, and spent a lot of time and effort digging for shiny stones that many of the natives found useless.Another example is the war between the Lilliputs and the Blefuscu. This war, as the King of Lilliput tells Gulliver, has been going on so long that nobody remembers how it started, who started it, or what they are fighting for. This sounds quite similar to the never-ending wars between France and England throughout the 2nd millenia AD. And so the parallels and allusions go.All told, this is one of the great works of English literature. The book combines sharp wit, irony, adventure, high drama, and some action into a great story of learning new things, meeeting new people, and coming to understand yourself better in the process."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is not a children's fantasy written by an avuncular Englishman. This book, instead, is a searing indictment of the human race written by a brilliant satirist and misanthrope. The Lilliput episode is most clearly inscribed in the public consciousness, perhaps because it is the least overtly damning of the human species. By the end of the book, however, when Gulliver is forced to leave the equine utopia of the Houyhnhnms, the utter perfidy of humanity is laid bare without compunction. (And it is still as true and applicable to today's societies as it was three-hundred years ago.) No one likes being criticized, especially when guilty of the offense, and Swift is unsparing in his condemnation of our collective culpability. (He makes provision for the goodness of the individual, though, such as the Portuguese ship's captain.) One of the ten best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Considering the topic of this book, I feel it necessary to discuss some of the stated perceptions regarding it:--Apparently some people believe this a children's book, sort of like the cutesy, toned down puppet shows that have passed for adaptations. A question of no doubt: This book was intended as an attack.I see in Swift something like an anarchistic mind--a man so revolted by every tribal persuation that passes for religion or for politics (often equally consumed, the two supposedly seperate ideas fused and bunched together, every contradiction in tact--!) and yet so disillusioned with every so-called 'independent movement', (be they political, social, or that stale haven of the two of them: Someone's brand new church--)that really all the poor man could see left was No hope--Whether this is a lesson for children, whether it's appropriate to allow them to see all of the horrors and the insanity of our secualarized community filled with warring faiths and the greed and the snivelling of a competitive open party system, this is for the parent(s) to judge. If nothing else Gulliver's travels is a shattering portrait of a wide-ranging variety of communities all against both each other and themselves, all living together in a community defined by dicisiveness.Other comments I saw were purely academic: the charts and the lists, the textbook schemata of some condescending mind seeming to boast that they 'get it', when all that they really come across as having gotten is someone else's rather passionless point of view. The quoting of others, the application of philosophies that have today become so common place towards human understanding that these cyrpto-psycholo-intellectualticians undermine Mr. Swift (not to meant pre-date themselves in guess of who represents whom) in their praise, giving the man no credit for intuitive insight. Certain people rank this book as the 'best ever', or--worse yet!--as the compartmentilized 'best SATIRE ever'. Now surely this book is a work of the satiric art. To put it a better way: the whole present concept of satiric intent would not exist without the pulsing heart of Jonathan Swift's works. But to apply a ranking to something that can only be taken subjectively is meaningless.Swift was a man truly without fear. In an age when people could be excommunicated and possibly executed for making fun of those in power, this angry monk scribbled out bitter complaints about the self-serving absurdity of nearly everyone in power. Then, to judge in all fairness, he turns the blame on the victims, telling them that they don't have to take it, that after a while there is no one left to blame for their suffering but themselves. This satire is all-inclusive and can therefore not be conceived with an agenda. It is poking fun. It is the narrative of progressive exaggeration. It is a masterpiece--Now of course we all need to justify our opinions by naming and accepting who or what we represent, but Swift acknowledges that this is just opinion, the one sacred thing to all of mankind. We create our own reality by applying our beliefs to our surroundings And if the whole world is out to get you, ultimately, you must be doing something terribly wrong to be so hated.I urge you--all of you, even those who much prefer an outlook able to provide for happy endings--read Gulliver's Travels. Take your time. And see who you are, taken to the logical extremes relating to your religious, political and community affiliations. And then laugh at the folly of the individual trapped in this world."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I never read this book before although I saw the film in several occasions.

Whoever criticizes it for the lack of character development, does not fully understand the nature of the book.

His purpose was to compare the creatures he met on each of his voyages to the English government and politicians. Even though he was pretty accurate about the politics of the time, he was too negative. Yes, it is the human nature to be corrupt, greedy, selfish and all the other things he mentioned in his book.

Swift moved from satire to moaning and griping about everything human. Wasn't he a priest? I would've expected a man of God to at least have run across one or two worhty persons who might have uplifted him a little.The starry-eyed gushing over the Utopian horses and unrelentingly negative portrayals of mankind gets very old, very fast.

Lilliput is just another image of monarchy, but in no way different from what Swift knew. The criticism comes from the scale of the people who are extremely small. Brogdingnag does not change this approach, only the scale of the people who are extremely big, though in this case there is a direct criticism of the exploitation the grotesque Gulliver is the object of. Laputa, Balnibarbi and Luggnagg show a strange floating saucer in a kingdom dominated by unpractical scientists who try to do everything upside down. It is a satire of scientists in general who are so little concerned by the welfare of the community that they can ruin just for the sake of implementing their hypotheses. Glubbdubdrib is funnier because it enables Gulliver to meet all kinds of people from the past and this leads to remarks about philosophers or politicians or generals that show how small and little and even tiny they were. Japan only shows the extreme anti-christian policy that can be reached there and the extreme self-centeredness of the Dutch, which is probably a criticism of the crown in England. But the last voyage to the country of the Houyhnhnms is by far the best because here we reach both a severe criticism of the human race reduced to its animal instincts and behaviors, and a utopian society in which evil does not exist because it cannot even be conceived, because it is totally out of reach for these kind reasoning and reasonable horses. And yet Gulliver is expelled because he is a Yahoo, no matter what, and the natural reason of these dominant horses leads to rejection, after having found in Gulliver&#65533;s explanations a solution to get rid of the Yahoo by sterilizing them into extinction, just the way men do with horses in European countries, just a little bit more systematically. This leads to the idea that genocide and ethnic cleansing is a natural attitude, an attitude that goes along with natural reason that says that the species standing in the way of reason have to be exterminated. But the book never reaches that level of thinking, since Swift could not know about such policies that will flourish in later centuries, and yet the Irish occupation should lead him to some idea of what such a principle can lead to. Thus at a second level of reading we find a criticism of natural reason though it is not fully expressed and developed. After all it is that natural reason that led, already in Swift&#65533;s times, to the genocide of Indians in America : they were not human, they were attributed all kinds of shortcomings like aggressivity, the love of war, the lack of cleanliness, a strong stench, and many other elements of the type. We can even note that beyond the genocide, the sterilisation policy will be implemented, but not on males, rather on females, and this in some US states up to the 1950s and maybe the 1960s. And this policy initiated by the Scandinavians in the early 20th century (and it was to last at least fifty or sixty decades) was to be systematically used against physically or psychologically impaired people. Hitler will follow that model, pushing it one bit further. In a way the book becomes then some vision of the future. This book hence is a prefiguration of many other books on the subject, such as The time Machine , Brave New World , Animal Farm , etc. This book seems to be the archetype of a literary genre in English literature, and of course the archetype of many films dealing with the same subject, particularly extraterrestrials.To conclude I will say that such a book is definitely not for children even if it is often assigned to young children in some schools.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This book is definitely not the fuzzy, adorable story of big people, little people, and talking horses that currently rests in the popular perception. Sure, it has some interesting scenes and sharp satire. But the Houyhnhnm section of the book (roughly the last fourth) is an unending, unrelenting, anti-human, anti-technology diatribe worthy of Hobbes, Rosseau or Nietzsche. Swift's philosophy apparently is that we should all know our place in the world and never try to improve it; we should live close to the land and shun technology; we should live in simple huts and contemplate good, pure thoughts while communing with nature. If Swift were alive today he'd be living in Montana, sending mailbombs to college professors.Swift's manner of exposition on human shortcomings is also particularly blunt, cheap, and crude. It's a formula repeated by many authors: first, create mythological creatures (talking horses in this case). Second, bestow them with superhuman qualities. Third, compare human beings to the creatures. Fourth, rant on and on about how humans come up short. The technique is boring, unsatisfying, underhanded, unilluminating, unrealistic, unhelpful, and obnoxious.So if you do decide to read this book, my recommendation is to read the first two voyages only, and leave the rest in your bathroom in case you run out of toilet paper."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"There will be two parts to this review.

The second, a review of the book.First, this edition: I cannot easily express how impressed I am with the Sterling Unabridged Classics that I have received thus far. The books are all hardbound, a must for any serious reader. Additionally, the print is large enough for easy reading without being overly large. Perhaps the nicest feature of these books is that each comes with a satin bookmark ribbon bound into the volume. The high quality of the paper and hard covers along with the above mentioned features makes each of the volumes published by Sterling a required addition to the library of any serious reader of classic literature. My only criticism is that the books could use more illustrations. The illustrations that are there are amazing but they are too few. All-in-all I would recommend any serious reader add these attractive and modestly priced editions to their own library.Second the book: I had never read Gulliver's Travels before. While I found all four of the stories that make up his travels to be enjoyable reads I must say that in writing these stories Swift simply recycles the same story over again with different supporting characters. Even the order in which events occur really does not change from story to story. In effect, each story follows the format 1. Gulliver is tired of being at home so he sets off on an adventure. 2. Gulliver is shipwrecked and stranded in a previously undiscovered land. 3. Gulliver is at first suspect among the inhabitants. 4. Gulliver wins over the inhabitants. 5. Gulliver becomes a hero to the inhabitants. 6. Gulliver is forced to leave because of some rule or law he inadvertently broke. 7. Gulliver reluctantly leaves. 8. Gulliver is rescued and returned home. Once you read the first story there is really little new to uncover in the remaining stories. Additionally, I was not aware that the book is actually a thinly veiled commentary on politics and life in Swift's era. If you are not aware of what was going on in the world and in politics during Swift's lifetime much of the symbolism will be lost on you. Overall, while an enjoyable read overall I found the repetition tedious and near the end I found myself anxious for the end. I would recommend that each story be read with a break in between where other titles are read to relieve the stale feeling one gets by reading the same story repeatedly."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is such a great classic that it is difficult to write any sort of regular review. So instead I have compiled a list of observations.Isaac Asimov, the distinguished writer, scientist, and Sci-fi buff, speculates that the made-up languages in Gulliver's Travels are basically nonsense; then he turns around and speculates that Lilliput is a corruption of \\"little bit\\". Good guess! - but maybe it's \\"little part\\" or \\"little pint\\"? Asimov also gives a other cases where highly plausible decipherments can be made.Interestingly, Swift's made-up languages often have a definite Italian ring. Swift himself says so much when commenting on the language of Laputa. Did Swift have a particularly admiration for Italian? Did he study it?It is usually assumed that most events and characters in Gulliver are veiled satires on England, and its misrule of Ireland. Perhaps. But maybe Swift was also poking fun at the Italian states. The \\"good old days\\" for which Swift pined may then be those of the Roman empire.It is often claimed that the fourth book is the best, and the third book the weakest. I disagree! Possibly from a purely stylistic standpoint the fourth book, on the horse-people, IS the best. But this is not enough to make it the most interesting. The Houyhnhnms represent Swift's idea of purely rational, benign beings. They don't lie, and have virtually no crime. But frankly, they are boring! They appear to have neither dreams nor aspirations, and little imagination. They spend much of their time in busy-work - apparently so as to stay out of trouble, in the manner of certain monastic orders. Perhaps the real trouble is that humans have a limited capacity for imagining perfect goodness. Look at the divine comedy triptych painted by Bosch. Which is the most interesting panel? The one on heaven? I don't think so!The third book (the one about the flying island of Laputa) contains a wealth of ideas - even if hastily written. Asimov points out that, unlike the other books, in the third book Swift takes considerable pains to explain \\"the marvelous\\" in scientific terms -- at least to the extent such explanations are possible. This is a hallmark of science fiction, as opposed to fantasy. A strong case can be made for Swift as the first true sci-fi writer. Consider, for example, his amazingly prophetic description of the two moons of Mars.Here is another example of Swifts amazing prescience. It is from Laputa, and illustrates the major concerns of Laputa's scientists:\\"These people are under continual Disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes Peace of Mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little effect the rest of Mortals. ... That, the Earth very narrowly escaped a Brush from the last Comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to Ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for One and Thirty years hence, will probably destroy us.\\"Don't we incessantly hear about the grave dangers comets and asteroids pose to us?"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is definetely an interesting read. The changes pace frequently because the book is divided into four books according to his different adventures. Each book(adventure)gives you a differnt view of people and questions about humans and humanity. The last book was my personal favorite-it's a very differnet spin on humanity from the other ones. Overall, it's a very good book and I would recommend it if you need a book to read or have only ever read the children's version."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Like many, my exposure to \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" has been in children's adaptations of the first section, the voyage to Lilliput. I had seen cartoons and live action adaptations, but I had never read the actual book. Well, I figured it was time.\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is so much more than a story of a big man amongst little people. An allegory for the inane struggles of the Catholics and Protestants, the citizens of Lilliput are in a continual war against Blefuscu, a conflict originating over which side of an egg should be opened first, the small or the big. Gulliver, a powerful giant amongst these people, cannot help but see their struggles as amusing and pointless. In a reversal, his next journey finds him a tiny person amongst giants, and as he explains the politics and society of his home country of England, he is forced to consider them also quaint and insignificant.Next he encounters the flying island of Laputa, and a culture entirely devoted to useless science, studies that advance nothing more than information and do not involve the lives of the citizens. This was an allusion to the Royal Academy of Science, and its pursuits far from the lives of ordinary people.Finally, and most impactfully, are the Yahoos and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent horses and bestial humans. In a story that clearly inspired \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" Gulliver is forced to confront the baser nature of his own humanity, and is forever shaken by the encounter.Gulliver becomes increasingly dismayed with humanity as the book continues, until he can no longer tolerate the touch of his own wife, so disgusted he is by what it means to be human. The story is bleak, and offers no hope of redemption. It is a dense work as well, with long political diatribes and ruminations on society.A far cry from the pleasant children's story that I was expecting, and a very good book overall. I can see why it is considered a classic."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels details a sailor's journey to four very different fantastical societies. The first, Lilliput, is populated by miniature people who fight wars over the proper way to break an egg. The second, Brobdingnag, is inhabited by giants who put Gulliver on display as a curiosity. The third consists of a kingdom governed by a king who lives on a floating island; the kingdom also contains an academy of scientists performing ineffective experiments, such as trying to extract sunbeams from cucumbers. The fourth is a society in which human-like creatures are made to serve their horse-like superiors, the Houyhnhnms."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Recently, in my 11th grade english class, we studied the novel Gulliver's Travels. A brilliant writer named Jonathan swift, who knew how to satirize exceptionally well, wrote Gulliver's Travels. When he wrote the novel his intent was not to vex the world, but to train the mind. Gulliver's Travels trains your mind through the knowledge of human sin. The number one sin is pride, and swift defines pride as a failure to realize your own limitations. Pride and the training of the mind are pointed out through all four books of this novel....I enjoyed this book because it points out that pride is good, yet you have got to be careful because too much pride can send you down the wrong path. The book also shows our complex, human vices. Through pointing out our complex vices swift is trying to alert us about the direction that we are headed in. By doing so, he is trying to show correct direction to take, which would help to improve our lives."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"If one could accurately characterize Swift as similar to Hobbes, Rousseau, and Nietzsche, they would ultimately be incoherent; the three have about as much in common as, well, Lilliputians and Brobdingnabians. Jokes aside, however, I would not necessarily take such a comparison negatively. After all, human nature may be fairly base, as Hobbes would posit, and his discussion is sound if his premises hold- whether or not they do, however, is difficult to ascertain, and another issue. As far as Swift is concerned, the same holds for him: his arguments about human ability and understanding seem to me to be valid. If the goal of philosophy is truth, well, then that truth may not always be comforting... but it maintains its value. I am not saying that Swift is correct, so much as coherent... and that alone, is reason to consider his ideas. As far as eighteenth century history goes: I don't think it is necessary to understand the specifics of Swift's criticisms so much as understand the types of things he is criticizing. Someone, and I think aptly, once compared his references to Monica Lewinsky jokes. You can understand this book without fully comprehending the references, so DON'T let this put you off to a wonderfully pessimistic view of human nature."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"As though things went on you did not see Gulliver give up.

However, the greatest satirist of the English language is not to be found in hilarious monologues on television. His name is Jonathan Swift. Swift was an Irish born bishop from Dublin who lived from 1667 to 1775. In his greatest piece of fiction \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" we see him as he punctures human prejudice, hatred, warfare and petty political bloviating!The story is told through the pen of Dr. Lemuel Gulliver who is a ship's surgeon. Gulliver is gullible! Like Voltaire's Candide he learns through his outlandish travels the fraility of the human species.Gulliver is shipwrecked on the island of Lilliput where the people are no more than six inches tall. He is a sense of wonder to the little people having never seen a person who is so tall. The islanders call himQuinbus Flestrin or Great Man Mountain. Gulliver puts out a fire in the palace of the Queen by urinating on the burning building! He defeats the fleet of an enemy nation and is charged by treason by a faction at court.Swiftian satire grills modern political faction by discussing the conflicts between the High Heels and Low Heels and the Big Egg Endians and the Little Egg Endians. He is poking fun at the London government.Gulliver flees the island for England being reunited with his long suffering wife and family. The Lilliputians are as small minded as are people in our own society.His next trip takes him to a land the exact opposite of Lilliput. Thegood Gulliver is shipwrecked and lands on an island. He is in a corn field forty feet high being threshed by giants. He is picked up by a farmer who takes him home in his pocket. Gulliver is given as a boy toy to the farmer's kind daughter Glumdalditch. He is in the land of giants known as Brobdingnag. He is later adpoted as a pet by the Queen. He is terrorized by mice, a vicious monkey and always fears falling out of the little box house which has been built for him. He learns the language of the kingdom but longs for home. After a terrible two years he is rescued when a bird picks up his box home with him in it and carries him out to sea where he is rescued. He returns home to England a wiser man.Gulliver's third voyage account is the last of the four sections of the book written by Swift.It takes the gullible seadog from Nottinghamshire to the floating island of Laputa. The Laputans care only for music and mathematics. They are normal sized individuals who care nothing for the gentle emotions but are only interested in science and intellect. Servants hit them with huge bladders to keep them from their abstract musings. They have no practical abilities. They rule over their colonyBalnibarbi. They are quick to suppress any revolt against their powerThe Laputans hurl huge rocks on their colony if any word is heard of revolt.In this third part of the novel Gulliver finds time to visit Glubbdugdrib an island of sorcerers. Gulliver asks them to call up from the realm of the dead such luminaries as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar. Hannibal and Pompey the Great. Gulliver discovers that the history is the books is often not the real history which was lived. History is a pack of lies.Gulliver also encounters a race of immortals with the odd name of theStrulbrugs. Gulliver learns to his dismay that though they live for all time they grow weaker, uglier and more cynical with the passing years. One wonders what he would think of our culture which glorifies youth?The fourth and final voyage of Gulliver occurs as he sails from England in 1710. Gulliver has become a captain but his crew mutinies and puts him in a small boat on the big ocean. He struggles to another weird island where he is captured by Yahoos who are ape-like inhabitants of this filthy land. He is rescued by the horse creatures who rule the land. They are called Houyhnhnms. They are an outstanding race of rational and kindhorses whom Gulliver comes to love. They view Gulliver as a Yahoo and he is banished from their paradise. Gulliver had earlier related to their king how cruelty and power politics is the norm in European civilization. He is set adrift in the sea where he is rescued by a ship from Portugal commanded by the kind captain Pedro de Mendez.After this fourth and final voyage Gulliver has become a misanthrope who prefers the company of horses to humans. He is upset at the cruelty of humankind to animals and one another. Gulliver began as an innocent optimist but the book ends with its view of a very disillusioned man.Gulliver's Travels can be read at many levels but at its core is a savage indictment of man's cruelty to man. Jonathan Swift was a pacifist and a kindly churchman. One shudders to think what this prophetic sage would think of our world today!"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This is an excellent book, no doubt about it. However, the edition is not so good. My copy, which is several years old, has yellowed considerably, and the print is small, so it does not make a very comfortable read."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"As one of those students across the country required to read this novel, I remain another who has found in it rather impressionable and powerful qualities, rather than just another old and redundant \\"classic\\". It's calling the kettle black, I know, but sometimes you have to say \\"well, there's a reason it's a classic\\".Sure, the beginning sections are a bit tedious what with Swift giving us impeccable detail of ships and wood and rope, etc... It actually took me about a week to get to the middle of the book because it wasn't grabbing me in the way I expected it to. I also have mild case of ADD, meaning I'm not likely to stick with a book - any book - for longer than 45 minutes at a time.It's amazing, the amount of degrees I reversed by Part 3. I read most of the reviews here and to my surprise, found that Parts 1 & 2 are among the more popular in Gulliver's Travels. In contrast, while I found Parts 1 & 2 certainly action-packed, the image left in my mind is one less vivid, less clear, and less meaningful than the latter parts.I honestly wasn't looking forward to this read. For some reason a satiric account of human nature and society as told by some sort of pirate did not appeal to me, which is completely outlandish seeing as I'm a huge fan of satire and non-fiction. In fact, I'm finding Pride & Prejudice much more grueling than any \\"part\\" of Gulliver.I must say this has been one of the very few novels the school has required us to read that left an actual impact on me, and I miss the feeling it gave and the warmth that resonated."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"A common misconception about this famous book is that it is just a kid's story about some guy's adventures with tiny people in Lilliput. I guess you can blame that on popular movies and TV (although a recent telemovie with Ted Danson was not so far off the mark).The reality is much richer. This is one of the greatest pieces of satire and social commentary ever written. Lilliput is just one of the places visited by Gulliver. Other societies visited by Gulliver help illustrate the failings perceived by Swift in his own culture of the early 1700s.Cruelty to animals, bureaucracy, government and human injustices are just a few of the issues targeted.Don't let the social commentary I've outlined put you off. Although this book was published in 1726, &quot;to vex the world rather than divert it&quot;, Swift is very readable today. The book is full of humor, and can be read as a simple adventure fantasy.Even without footnotes the book is very accessible, but an edition with footnotes will make some of the more obscure references and humor easier to appreciate.As for the social commentary, sadly much of it is as relevant today as it was when the book was written."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I like that this edition preserves the original 18th Century spelling, punctuation and grammar. Too many editions modernize or Americanize the text. The notes at the back are helpful but not intrusive. And it has an overall feel of quality, even though a paperback.I own upwards of 30 editions of Gulliver and this is the one I refer to most often when I need to check a citation or another point of information. I also recommend it immediately to anyone asking for an informative edition. It helps that it is inexpensive and in-print, but it would be my recommendation even if it was harder to come by."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Many would bring some escapist fiction like Robinson Crusoeor Swiss Family Robinson which tell of ways to deal withsuch a situation. I choose Gulliver's Travels. Gulliver,thanks to the inventiveness and satire of Swift, manages toescape numerous times from many uncharted locales. While Imay never run into Lilliputians or the like, at least I'llhave optimism and the knowledge that I leave my impressionwherever I go."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels has some amusing and even a few insightful bits, but Swift was no Voltaire. A satire not so much on some particular human follies as on man as such, this book is basically a monument to misanthropy---as is made painfully clear in the heavy-handed fourth part. Not that satire has to be subtle, but it should at least be accurate, at most an exaggeration of the truth rather than a projection of one's own bitter prejudices. Swift's portrayal of human society, even as imperfect as it was (and even more so in his time than now), is at best one-sided. It ends with the narrator repulsed by the smell of his wife, and disgusted with himself for ever having coupled with her and brought children into the world. If you can sympathize with that sentiment, then you might find Swift's satire to be penetrating and clever. If, on the other hand, you see any value in human life and hold it to be more important than the vice and suffering that necessarily characterize some part of it, then you might be better off reading something else."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"It took me a while to get to this book - it kept being recommendedby friends, but I was a bit put off by the effort I thought I would have toput into reading a book written 300 years ago. Well, I was really suprised -\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is easier to reads, and is certainly writtenmuch better, than most modern novels. Swift certainly didn'thave too high an opinion about humanity, but rarely washe heavy handed. Thus he is entertaining even when he ispreachy.I agree that the book was so popular because it succeeded onso many different levels. It must have been outstanding politicalsatire in its time (the full effect has, not surprisingly, diminishedover time). However, it also reads well as a parody of travelliterature, a fairy tale, or speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I'm not going to get into the whole &quot;Is this great literature&quot; debate with this novel. If you don't think already this novel is a masterpiece, nothing I say is going to convince you otherwise. This edition, though, is well worth picking up. It preserves the orthography and other quirks of Swift's prose and includes an intriguing, though a bit abrupt (as though written on deadline) &quot;introduction&quot; by Jeanette Winterson, who puzzlingly preoccupies herself with the Houyhnhnms at the expense of the other parts of the novel."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I recently read Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. It is an interesting and different kind of novel. Gulliver is a ship's surgeon who journeys to several different places around the world. Gulliver first adventures to Lilliput, which is inhabited with six-inch humans who are characterized as \\"odious vermin\\". In Book two, he is in Brobdingnag, the land of the physical and moral giants. Thirdly, he lands on Laputa where science and reason live. Gulliver's final voyage leads him to the land of the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos. Here he discovers the use of perfect reasoning from the horse-like Houyhnhnms and the crude and undesired manner of the human-like Yahoos. Gulliver is a simple, objective character that we can easily trust. As his name would reveal, he is very gullible. Through each of his travels Gulliver reports to us as if we were as gullible as he is. He is incapable of reasoning unlike the Houyhnhnms whom he admires greatly. Swift uses satire a great deal in order to point out human weaknesses. Swift wrote this book during the Age of Reason in which science and technology were used to solve all problems. Throughout much of this book, especially while Gulliver is in Laputa, Swift uses satire to point out that scientific pursuits can not morally save us."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This is supposedly an annotated edition, with critical commentary. You may want something like that, as I did -- an annotated text where you could read the editor's notes as you go through the novel, learning historical and literary background to the text as you read it. Great -- except the Kindle edition doesn't let you read the notes! You see the tantalizing asterisks -- so you know, for certain, that a commentator has appended some information on philosophical, political, or literary background -- but you can't see it! If you want the notes and commentary, you need to buy the hard-copy print edition. There is no reason whatsoever to buy this Kindle edition (an un-annotated one is available for much, much less money)."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Swift's Gulliver's Travels is one of the smartest British novels ever written. It is a funny, sharp, poignant, and startling look at human nature.

This novel is a wonderful reflection of human society that really makes the reader question his or her methods or discourse."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"There is no need for me to go into what a marvelous and timeless classic &quot;Guliver's Travels&quot; is. The satire, while nearly 300 hundred years old, is as fresh today as it was in the 1720s.What I will say about this particular edition is that it is very beautifully done. (If you can get the hardcover edition instead of the softcover, all the better.) The typeset, color engravings and supplemental material in the appendices add up to an excellent edition of this classic. I highly recommend it either as a gift or as a copy for your own library."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is perhaps the best known of a classical satires, following the adventures of Lemuel Gulliver on multiple journeys all of which serve his objective of profiling the moral (and physical) fragility of mankind, with special care taken to point out problems associated with hubris and war (Swift was an extreme pacifist.) This edition of the book features commentary and notes by Robert DeMaria which are helpful putting the book in context, especially for those deficient in knowledge of English political history. As an aside, the textual notes are so numerous, that footnotes would have been vastly more functional to the reader than endnotes, nevertheless, the commentary is largely on the mark and helpful.The book is written in four parts, of which most students are only exposed to part one, as I was previously. In part one, Gulliver ventures to Lilliput, where he is a giant among men, the Lilliputians being very small. He is in fact referred to as \\"Quinbus Flestrin,\\" or, the \\"Man-Mountain.\\" Part one is essentially about political strife in England, and directly skewers the Walpole government with the character of Flimnap. One of the issues for readers will be keeping a running account of all the over-the-top names Swift uses throughout the book (Houyhnhnms, Traldragdubb, Balnibarbi, Brobdingnag, etc.) The notes explain how these are clever, playful words satirizing specific people or things in Europe as it then was, but I must admit to finding them a bit wearisome to wade through after a few hundred pages. Perhaps the most recognizable of the satirized states is Blefuscu, a dead ringer for France. These are minor inconveniences to endure to read one of the greatest works of satire (and allegory) ever written, though I think Swift tops this in the pure satire department with \\"A Modest Proposal.\\"Part two has Gulliver in a role-reversal as he ventures to Brobdingnag where he is now small relative to the population. He is exploited and used as entertainment, but is cared for by the young Glumdalclitch, who becomes his tutor as well. Throughout the book Swift uses extremely expressive language (\\"She would craunch the Wing of a Lark, Bones and all, between her Teeth...\\") and displays an unfortunate predilection for describing human waste production (I actually considered titling the review \\"Obsession With Excrement\\" but decided to leave that to a future student's dissertation in psychology.) This section highlights the parallels between Swift and the equally brilliant, though much less known work, \\"The Monikins\\" by James Fenimore Cooper from 1835. I believe that part two is the most pointed towards government with passages like \\"You have clearly proved that Ignorance, Idleness, and Vice are the proper Ingredients for qualifying a Legislator\\" (pages 122-123.) Later he similarly skewers lawyers (most notably on page 229, and in the information provided in the \\"Textual Notes\\" on page 303,) a feature of the book I enjoyed immensely.Section three is the weakest of the four, and also the last written. It concerns Gulliver's adventures with the flying island, Laputa, and while comparatively weak, is delightfully whimsical. A favorite example is on page 150 where the serving methods of foods are discussed (\\"...a Shoulder of Mutton, cut into an Equilateral Triangle...,\\" etc.) One other note I will make about the book is the very unconventional (by modern standards) capitalization, italic usage, and spelling. DeMaria explains his process for cleaning up the text which is admirable in its purity, though I would have been more pleased if he had applied contemporary conventions of font use at least. Also of note is the fact that Swift himself is irritating in his very irregular and inconsistent spelling and punctuation.Part four is my personally least favorite, as it quickly devolves into what could today be seen as a socialist fantasy world of the Houyhnhnms, horses who rule wisely and justly over the savage and detestable Yahoos (humans.) This part drags, and turns to human self-loathing very rapidly (Gulliver can't even stand the smell of his wife when he returns to England, preferring the odor of his stable, for one example of many.) While I grasp the satirical points that Swift was attempting to make in this part, it falls short for me, although it does make his pacifist bent quite clear. Part four makes the points that Swift sets out to make, and on that level it is successful, I just don't think all the points he seeks to make are valid.Overall this in combination with \\"A Modest Proposal\\" (an essay from 1729 which suggests that the Irish eat their own children) are the most famous works of satire ever written, and should be read by any serious student of English literature or history."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Even though the Lilliputians part of the book is the most popular, I enjoyed part 4 the most. I liked how Swift placed another animal higher than humans, showing that we end up at the bottom in the end. I also like how he had Gulliver change due to his stay with the Houyhnhnms."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This is, along with &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, one of Jonathan Swift's infamous understated, biting satires. At the very least edgy, and often outright misanthropic, Swift's writing is not for the optimist. However, his writing here is both brutally honest and imaginative, always delivered with a straight face. It's a clever book, and his adventures are always interesting. As simply fantasy, the book also succeeds - it raises many points about the situations Gulliver gets himself into that a lesser writer would never have thought of.The only real disadvantage of &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; (and the reason it only gets four stars) is the occasionally excessive prose. One section in particular during Gulliver's stay at the Floating Island is almost a sedative, and these parts show up often enough to make the reading an occasional chore. Nevertheless, this is still one of the best satirical novels around, and the story is entertaining on its own. It could have used some editing, but it's very good regardless."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Lemuel Gulliver is a surgeon/ships captain who embarks on several intriguing adventures. His first endeavor takes him to Lilliput, where all inhabitants are six inches tall, but resemble normal humans in every other respect. His next voyage lands him on Brobdingnag, where a grown man is sixty feet tall, and even the shortest dwarf stands thirty feet tall. On his third trip, he travels to several locations, including a floating island. During Gullivers final voyage, he is abandoned by his mutinous crew on the island of the Houyhnhnms, which are extremely intelligent horses. No evil or concept of lying exists among these creatures. The island is also inhabited by Yahoos, savage, irrational human-like creatures who are kept as pets by the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver wishes to spend the rest of his life on this peaceful island, but he is banished and forced to return to England.I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to people 14 or older. Since the novel was written in the 1700&iexcl;s, the words, grammar and usage are a little confusing. The reader also must have prior knowledge of 18th-century politics to get a full image of what Swift is trying to convey. At some points, the author goes into detail about nautical terms and happenings, and that tends to drag. Overall, the book is well-written, slightly humorous, if not a little confusing."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Jonathan Swift&#65533;s 18th century satire, Gulliver&#65533;s Travels, is an extraordinary tale of the adventures of an English ship surgeon. The ship surgeon, Gulliver, by a series of unfortunate events on each of his four voyages at sea, receives the chance to explore the cultures of the countries of Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, Balnibarbi, Glubbdubdrib, Luggnagg and the land of the Houyhnhnms. Each land is considerably different from the others, and creates quite an entertaining read.While the story itself is particularly unusual, the satirical element which Swift applied to it adds another level of comprehension. If understood, one could have a nice chuckle at the way Swift mockingly portrays ideas and people through the various cultures which Gulliver encounters. Some similes, however, are intended to get a more serious meaning across. For example, in his first journey of the book, Gulliver finds himself in the country of Lilliput where the people are only six inches tall, save the king who is seven. In this land there are two groups which were distinguished by which side a person breaks their eggs on. One king published an edict commanding all his subjects to break their eggs on the small side, but many would&#65533;ve picked death over breaking their eggs on the &#65533;wrong&#65533; side, so many did. By this, Swift meant to throw contempt on the exaggerated importance that people place on their differences, as on which side one breaks an egg is a very trivial thing. The two groups mentioned represent the Catholic and Protestant religions, between which were many wars and massacres during the 1500&#65533;s when the Protestants first appeared.Gulliver&#65533;s Travels takes the reader to many lands, all different and unique &#65533; each adding another perspective on traditional beliefs and ways of thinking. Gulliver changes as much as the scenery around him, and after each voyage he has changed dramatically. At the end he has transformed so much that I feel really sorry for his family &#65533; although it&#65533;s only love that could allow them to put up with his strange behaviors.I would recommend this book to anyone with an appetite for literature, as Gulliver&#65533;s Travels is an excellent satire of the ways of the thinking in the early 1700&#65533;s. Also, the author does a good job in describing the lands which Gulliver visits in great detail. Although Swift may not have written this book with intense action scenes and steamy romance, it is definitely a work worthy of the people of today."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"The Oxford World Classics version of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels is excellent. There are copious notes explaining the political and social backgrounds to this masterpiece of satire, and Professor Rawson's introduction presents the details of Swift's life in clear and succinct language. In his examination of Swift's method and direction, Rawson discusses the ambiguities of Swift's \\"travel book\\" and his changeable, unreliable character,Gulliver, as he encounters and is affected by the different societies. There is a useful bibliography for further study."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"In this story, Lemuel Guilliver, a career ship surgeon, writes a travel journal about his fantastic voyages on the high seas. His commercial ventures never worked out as planned, either a storm or mutiny ending them before returning to England, but each time he had the good fortune of landing on an island unexplored by Europeans. On these islands he runs into a variety of natives--giants, 6&quot; tall people, people who reside on a flying island, and horses that take human-like Yahoos as pets. Each is an interesting and entertaining story in its own right and without reading any deeper into the story, but that is not why this book is a classic.The author, Jonathan Swift, was a master of satire. As an Irishman he despised British rule and resisted it through his writing. Because criticism of the crown and Parliament was a punishable offense, Swift projected the personalities and social events of the day into fictional characters in imaginary circumstances with wonderful effect. While telling a terrific fictional story, he was able to rail against the system and really make a name for himself as a satirist.The one problem with reading a satire that is dated, is that many of the characters and social events about which the author wrote are obscured by the passage of time. I consider myself to be fairly well acquainted with British history and its major players, but without the assistance for excellent footnotes, I would have missed a tremendous amount in this story. It still would have been great without the footnotes, but would not have provided the same historical lesson, which is why I would recommend a version with a good introduction and footnotes regardless of why you are reading the story and how well you feel you know the history of Swift's era.I liked this book quite a bit, though I agree with many other reviewers who think it might by a little much for younger readers. In cartoons, picture books, or movies, it can be dumbed down to a cutesy fairy tale, which is fine and will hopefully encourage children to read the real story later in life, but an unabridged version will be boring and go right over their heads. I think it is an excellent book for adults who like fantasy fiction or readers who usually like historical or political non-fiction, as it is an excellent review of Swift's times."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver's Travels is fantastic, but the fact that the myriad of footnotes have no hyperlinks to them (so you have to search the location number every time) is quite aggravating.

I suppose that this is because some of the topical and local humor is lost on readers, who, reading 300 years later, do not always understand some of the subtler jabs and double meanings.I also found the book to be surprisingly risqu&eacute; (e.g., a 16-year-old giant using Captain Gulliver as her sex toy), not exactly the image the book has in the current public perception. But that does not diminish the book in any way; it is still an outstanding adventure that can be read on at least two levels, and can be enjoyed by all. In this respect it is similar to the Chronicles of Narnia."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Although Swift's novel is often read by children, its rough handling of social topics has gained him a reputation for cynicism. In some circles, the book is considered to represent the frustrations of a twisted misanthrope. However, The way Swift paints his angry sattire into a child's fantasy shows his dexterity as a writer. This amusing little fairytale is not to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"In addition to being a marvelous fantasy, this book has much to say about government and human beings."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Wow, the title really explains everything. My definition of a great book is one that has a thrilling storyline and still carries great symbolism. This book hits a home-run on each one of these. At the beginning of the book, Swift really lays out the story and there is little symbolism, but he picks up very quickly and just keeps on running.In the beginning, Swift focuses on the story of Gulliver and his travels, while interjecting little tidbits of \\"truth\\" through the text. However, as the story progresses, Swift drops the storyline more and more to interject his own philosophical thoughts. By the end of the book, he has basically droped the entire plot and the last 50 pages are a full on rant against the British, civilization, and humanity in general. As I was reading my face was probably contorted into some hideous mixture that compiled hilarity and serious contemplation, but that is what Swift brings to the table.On one side, you really want to laugh as he questions our political system and the corruption that it breeds. He says that lawyers are born into corruption and their only ability is in deceiving the public. Then he points out that our judges, (those who deal justice), are just lawyers who have lasted thirty years in their horrific system. The prose of this entire transaction is excellent, and by the end you find yourself laughing and nodding along at the same time.On the other side, he challenges the very technological advancements that we consider to be humanities crowing achievements, and as he points out the death and catastrophe that was produced by this \\"progress\\", there is a feeling of sadness that is overwhelming. It is really indescribable, but probably one of the most truthful passages ever to be written.If you consider yourself any type of classical literate, this should be one of the top on your list."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Swift's masterwork has lost none of its bite. His acerbic misanthropy is on full display here.As the book progresses, Swift's contempt for humanity grows. This is partly what made the book so compelling for me. Gulliver is only truly happy when he is among the Houyhnhnms, the horse people in the final part of the book. He develops such a dislike for humans that he finds it hard to re-acclimate upon returning to his family in England. What is compelling is that Swift was so obviously misanthropic, yet was able to get away with it. It really speaks to his skill as a novelist. In the hands of a lesser writer, this book would have come out horribly wrong.Swift's descriptions of the different worlds are something to behold. As the reader, I could clearly picture each place in my mind. Swift gives the reader just enough to vividly imagine the world Gulliver is in at that time. Swift has the idea that the reader can do some of the work on his own, which is sadly not something authors ascribe to these days. This is partly the reason why this book is such a classic.A wonderful commentary on the follies and shortcomings of humanity."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"It's a good read and probably every bit the masterpiece its reputation claims. The problem with satire, however, is that it doesn't stand alone. Parody, on the other hand, ought to make sense in itself, but obviously more sense if the object of the parody is understood and familiar. Satire only seems to make sense if you know the original.The section in Lilliput describing the bloke with different sized heels on his shoes, for instance, is very funny, but only when the footnote has provided the context. He is described as having to negotiate a political line between the faction that likes high heels and the other that likes low ones. He makes awkward progress with both groups, since he can barely walk or stand up straight in a pair of shoes made up so he can have a foot in each camp. The reference is beautiful. It refers to High Church and Low Church in the Anglican tradition, and therefore to Whig and Tory, the opposing political parties of the time. To stay sweet with both, certain royals kept a foot in both camps, making their progress as ridiculous as the rough-shod Lilliputian.In the books three sections, Gulliver is too big, then too small, then everyone is a horse except for the noxious Yahoos, of course. It was still a lot of fun and, probably, hard witting. The trouble, again, was knowing the targets. If today's Yahoos are considered... perhaps Swift might have googled his yahoos if he had been writing today.One last observation is about well-known classics in general. The most famous scene from Gulliver's Travels, at least the one most depicted, is of Gulliver strapped to the ground by Lilliputian string and twine, while the little blighters run all over him. In Don Quixote, an equally quintessential scene is the tilting at windmills, mistaken by the knight for giants. It is interesting that both of these much quoted scenes appear very early in their respective books. I wonder if that might have something to do with certain people never getting very far through them!"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I really appreciated your review, as it helped me get the gist of sections I had not yet read. I would only like to say, however, that while Gulliver may have had some progressive ideas about human psychology, his intention with the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos could not possibly have been Freudian, as Freud's work did not exist until over a century and a half after Swift wrote his book. I do like your interpretation, though, since as 21st century readers we can apply Freud's theories backwards to Swift's writing, and look at what marvelous results we get!"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"A common misconception about this famous book is that it is just a kid's story about some guy's adventures with tiny people in Lilliput. I guess you can blame that on popular movies and TV (although a recent telemovie with Ted Danson was not so far off the mark).The reality is much richer. This is one of the greatest pieces of satire and social commentary ever written. Lilliput is just one of the places visited by Gulliver. Other societies visited by Gulliver help illustrate the failings perceived by Swift in his own culture of the early 1700s.Cruelty to animals, bureaucracy, government and human injustices are just a few of the issues targeted.Don't let the social commentary I've outlined put you off. Although this book was published in 1726, &quot;to vex the world rather than divert it&quot;, Swift is very readable today. The book is full of humor, and can be read as a simple adventure fantasy.Even without footnotes the book is very accessible, but an edition with footnotes will make some of the more obscure references and humor easier to appreciate.As for the social commentary, sadly much of it is as relevant today as it was when the book was written."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"This novel is one of the few that I have ever read, but it is so far the best I ever read. This is not just for young adults but also for kids. I liked Jonathan Swift use of his imagenation to come with all the great stuff that came up with for this novel. I also like his usage of satire to mock the politics, religion, and society of his time. I always like to read thing that is making fun or moking some thing, and novel does just that. The one thing that I did't like was that it was tough to read, I had to use Masterplots to help me understand it. But it is still a good novel to read, I think it is so good that someone should make it into a cartoon, and also make a sequeal."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Gulliver is a surgeon whose adventures begin when he decides to go out to sea.

The Land of Lilliput represents a paranoid military society. Brobdingnag represents a pompous culture. The island of Laputa where everyone has high intelligence and no common sense reflects politicians. The Houyhnhnms represent the most educated class who are the closest to an ideal society. Now Swift certainly deserves credit for putting this concept together and this book does deserve a place in the classic museum of literature. Unfortunately this book has a sluggish pace. It also lacks the captivating qualities that Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dickens had down to a science. Now if someone were doing a study of literature throughout the ages, I would say this book is an important study. On the other hand, this is not a book I would buy someone as a gift."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"I am rather disappointed by the book that definitely is a classic. Lilliput is just another image of monarchy, but in no way different from what Swift knew. The criticism comes from the scale of the people who are extremely small. Brogdingnag does not change this approach, only the scale of the people who are extremely big, though in this case there is a direct criticism of the exploitation the grotesque Gulliver is the object of. Laputa, Balnibarbi and Luggnagg show a strange floating saucer in a kingdom dominated by unpractical scientists who try to do everything upside down. It is a satire of scientists in general who are so little concerned by the welfare of the community that they can ruin just for the sake of implementing their hypotheses. Glubbdubdrib is funnier because it enables Gulliver to meet all kinds of people from the past and this leads to remarks about philosophers or politicians or generals that show how small and little and even tiny they were. Japan only shows the extreme anti-christian policy that can be reached there and the extreme self-centeredness of the Dutch, which is probably a criticism of the crown in England. But the last voyage to the country of the Houyhnhnms is by far the best because here we reach both a severe criticism of the human race reduced to its animal instincts and behaviors, and a utopian society in which evil does not exist because it cannot even be conceived, because it is totally out of reach for these kind reasoning and reasonable horses. And yet Gulliver is expelled because he is a Yahoo, no matter what, and the natural reason of these dominant horses leads to rejection, after having found in Gulliver's explanations a solution to get rid of the Yahoo by sterilizing them into extinction, just the way men do with horses in European countries, just a little bit more systematically. This leads to the idea that genocide and ethnic cleansing is a natural attitude, an attitude that goes along with natural reason that says that the species standing in the way of reason have to be exterminated. But the book never reaches that level of thinking, since Swift could not know about such policies that will flourish in later centuries, and yet the Irish occupation should lead him to some idea of what such a principle can lead to. Thus at a second level of reading we find a criticism of natural reason though it is not fully expressed and developed. After all it is that natural reason that led, already in Swift's times, to the genocide of Indians in America : they were not human, they were attributed all kinds of shortcomings like aggressivity, the love of war, the lack of cleanliness, a strong stench, and many other elements of the type. We can even note that beyond the genocide, the sterilisation policy will be implemented, but not on males, rather on females, and this in some US states up to the 1950s and maybe the 1960s. And this policy initiated by the Scandinavians in the early 20th century (and it was to last at least fifty or sixty decades) was to be systematically used against physically or psychologically impaired people. Hitler will follow that model, pushing it one bit further. In a way the book becomes then some vision of the future. This book hence is a prefiguration of many other books on the subject, such as The time Machine , Brave New World , Animal Farm , etc. This book seems to be the archetype of a literary genre in English literature, and of course the archetype of many films dealing with the same subject, particularly extraterrestrials.To conclude I will say that such a book is definitely not for children even if it is often assigned to young children in some schools.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"For starters, ignore the ignorant diatribe of the Dec. 31 reviewer. The whole concept of historical context must be way too complicated for some readers to understand. What kind of person comes up with an anacronistic oxymoron like &quot;18th century Unabomber&quot;? What kind finds fault with Swift for using a literary &quot;formula&quot; he perfected, simply because some later writers, like Orwell in &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; imitated the technique to the point that it has become a modern cliche? (Swift didn't invent the technique, but he certainly was one of the first to use it so effectively) What kind of human being is capable of such questionable judgment? One who is an obnoxious, dense, unrealistic, dimwitted, pretentious, shallow bore--exactly the kind of person Swift scathingly satirizes in Gulliver's Travels.Swift plays with perspective throughout this book, and the mirror he holds up for us cuts through such arrogant pretentions, showing all of our blemishes rather than flattering our egos. Some egos today are so frail that Swift easily infuriates them, just as he did his own contemporaries. Such vehement responses are a tribute to Swift's powers as a writer and they show that his satire is still every bit as relevant today.This is a book that appeals to children, but it is not at all a children's book. Some adults who think like children might possibly be offended by Gulliver's Travels. Nevertheless, its status as a classic is well deserved."},{"Title":"Guilliver's Travels.","review":"Swift's novel is a timeless classic that resonates as clearly with contemporary readers as those in his own time.

Please note that this is not a UNHCR publication, but is published under the auspices of the U.S. Committee for Refugees.Every year for the past ten or fifteen years, there have been somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen million refugees worldwide, plus or minus two or three million. The events of the past year in Afghanistan might be expected to have produced a giant increase in this total, but in fact it produced what was merely a blip on the statistical radar. This excellent publication helps the reader to understand the diverse range of refugees, and refugee-related issues, worldwide.The book is divided into four main parts. First, there is a collection of statistical tables and charts, to provide a graphic sense of the figures involved. All the tables and charts are in color, and are both user-friendly and well designed. No complex statistical mathematics are involved. There is also a map of worldwide refugee situations tucked into this section. In an improvement upon earlier editions, the map is folded in such a manner that it is not possible to miss it. The tables are as follows:1.)Major Displacement and Returns During 2001, by Country2.)Refugees and Asylum Seekers During 2001, by Country3.)Refugees and Asylum Seekers Worldwide, from 1993 to 20014.)Principal Sources of Refugees5.)Principal Sources of Internally Displaced Persons6.)Top Twenty Donor Countries to Refugee Aid Agencies, in Terms of U.S. Dollars Per Capita Population7.)Top Twenty Donor Countries to Refugee Aid Agencies, in Terms of Millions of U.S. Dollars8.)Ratio of Refugees to Selected Host-Country Populations9.)People in Refugee-Like Situations10.)Asylum Applicants in Selected Countries, 1992 to 200111.)Significant Voluntary Repatriations12.)Involuntary Returns and ExpulsionsThe second part of the book is comprised of a collection of articles. Make sure to read the &quot;The Year in Review&quot; article. It will greatly aid you in making sense of the book as a whole. Other article include the inspiring &quot;A Survivor Speaks for Those Who Fell by the Roadside;&quot; &quot;Everything Has Changed,&quot; which title refers to the post September 11 world refugee paradigms; &quot;Rethinking U.S. Refugee Admissions Quantity and Quality;&quot; &quot;Refugee Law is Not Immigration Law;&quot; and &quot;Refugee Law in South Africa: Making the Road of the Refugee Longer?&quot; As you can see, some articles are broad-ranging, dealing with overarching issues in international law. Others pertain to particular geographical crisis areas.The third section of this volume is comprised of &quot;Country Reports,&quot; which are pithy, well-organized, carefully broken-down discussions of some of the outstanding refugee issues faced by various sovereign nations. The Country Reports are broken up by continent, or sometimes by region (Oceania, Middle East). The Reports include commentary on many issues. Some examples of these issues include 1.)legal procedures for processing asylum applicants in various host countries; 2.)interal displacement of peoples, within national borders, famously including the Kurds, but also including Afghanistan, the Congo, etc.; 3.)attitudes of local taxpayers and voters, toward asylum-seekers. There are many other issues discussed in these reports. Each Country Report is &quot;personalized,&quot; so to speak. There is no set, standardized formula for the presenattion of all the countries discussed. Each report is tailored, and written in such a way as to emphasize the preeminent concerns of the region in question.The fourth and final section of this book is the Directory. This may be the most helpful part of the book, for many readers, if they wish to become proactive about their interest in refugee issues. The Directory includes single paragraph entries on several dozen international, governmental, and private refugee relief organizations. There are also entries for various organizations which provide or package information about refugees worldwide.For further research, there is a small, somewhat cursorily compiled bibliography on page 290. This bibliography sometimes has preety incomplete information about sources, for some reason, but it's better than nothing! I have wondered if there was kind of editorial oversight involved with this bibliography, because it is not only incomplete, but not even mentioned in the table of contents. So if you're interested, I'm just mentioning it here, so you'll know it exists. Incidentally, if editorial error took place in this case, that error was highly unusual, possibly unique, in this excellent reference work.This book is very useful. I would recommend this for any library, or for private citizens who would like to be citizens of the world. I would also like to mention here that, whoever you are, if you use a search engine to find the website of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, (UNHCR), you will find a lot of helpful information there as well.A terrific reference work.

It covers all aspects of guiding the flock and caring for yourself with spiritual integrity and service. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Leading the Congregation: Caring for Yourself While Serving the People","review":"This has to be a polar opposite to Oswald & Kroeger's book Personality Type and Religious Leadership. The revised material opens Pandora's Box to the life of a religious leader with danger and delight. My first observation is the opening illustration everyone on deck \`C' and no one at the helm. It sets the tone for the rest of Part One. Although I can appreciate the two observations noted under the \`danger of leading' the third hit home. Leading others through change has a cost and consequence that I have come to appreciate greatly. Through the eight years of planting and developing City Church the cost in finance and people has been great - but worth everything. I would enjoy the shared experience of the class in stories that have cost each class member as they challenge what others value. It may even cost some of us during the discussion!I remember bringing change through a process to our church governance. The people who were in positions of leadership had little difficulty. But what it did was expose who was pulling the strings of these leaders - their wives and other strong families in the church. Ultimately, most of them left the church along with their financial support. This did not prevent anything from moving forward as a whole, but the cost was personal in morale and money. Thankfully, God has given us over the years good men and women who can serve the Lord by serving others and not themselves.A second observation would be that the interior attitudes of a leader, characterized in childlikeness, humility, desire to serve and self-examination, did not seem to fit with the flow of text before or after it. Although each point was described very well, especially childlikeness, I became distracted. I would also disagree that we should take ourselves seriously in the context of who we are in Christ. It left it too open to be silly instead of serious. I can remember many occasions behind the pulpit of saying the word \`breast' instead of \`blessed' and tearing the seat of my pants in full view of the congregation. This does not mean I am silly but able to laugh at myself.The surprise came for me in the third chapter concerning a spiritual life of a leader. Although I understand it all comes from \`who we are' and not \`what we do' I found a new and refreshing dialogue for my own soul. This came particularly with the concentration in the three elements of Jesus' spirituality. I've read it many times but never seen it within this context. It left me wanting to sharpen my personal disciplines in prayer, fasting, scripture, spiritual conversation and worship. I regularly lead our own congregation to celebrate Holy Communion most weeks therefore this was not so new.A third observation would be the central theme of my own life found in chapter four concerning the call of God. From Scripture to Ignatius the wonderful and maddening call of God is described. I found the five points of God's call to spiritual leadership clarifying to my own call. Most of all, the testing of a leader's call cannot be ignored but must be discussed at great length in the class. Too many of my own colleagues have quit serving as a pastor because of pressure. If there was an open dialogue between leading men, perhaps these leaders would not have thrown in the towel. It reminds me of a man who attends my own church who became frustrated by the lack of faith and slowness of his small congregation. In his early 40's he decided that serving as a pastor was not fulfilling enough for him so he founded his own financial consultancy. To this day he has found a measure of success, but is often drawn back to the pulpit of churches without a pastor. The call cannot escape him - although I believe he is blissfully unaware of this.A fourth observation threw me a complete curve ball. Chapter six is an exploration into light and shadows cast by the leader. I could grasp the concept immediately but the way it is worked out became confusing and frustrating. The \`spirit' is described as casting a shadow or light. This did not refer to the Holy Spirit but the context of the inner life of the leader. Here is where I am confused. Scripture talks about the inner life of the Christian having died with Christ, buried with him and then raised with him. The way Shawchuck and Heuser describe this leans more to a new age approach. My spirit is one with God's Spirit. I am not suggesting I am always obedient and submissive but Ephesians clearly tells me that my own spirit was dead but made alive in Christ. The concept is that a leader will project light or a shadow in his or her leadership. But is this not the attitude of our hearts? Further still, when we bring \`light' into a situation is this not defined as Christ in us?This is something I would be eager to discuss with the class in their own ministry context. To throw a little humor on this, I feel much better, confident, aware and insightful after a good night's sleep and a loving start to the day with my wife and children. I can guarantee that my colleagues in the office will feel a sense of \`light' that I bring into the day. This is not my spirit but the attitude of my own heart. Also, the discerning of spirits that Shawchuck and Heuser explain is out of Biblical context. (1 Corinthians 12:8-10) explains that \`all this is from the one and same Spirit' meaning the Holy Spirit. The distinguishing or discerning of spirits is entirely spiritual and never \`mood' or \`attitude' related.Overall this was a good read that provoked and challenged. If it has not gone to publication yet, I would suggest looking again at the flow of Part One: Leading from within. It does not say who is saying what, Shawchuck or Heuser, but it appears these two men have differing ideas thrown into a single text.By Andrew Fox author of Change Through Challenge"},{"Title":"Leading the Congregation: Caring for Yourself While Serving the People","review":"As a senior, at Vanguard University, heading into the ministry full time I find this book helpful, it is the best book on leadership I have ever read. Professor Roger Heuser and Norman Shawchuck out did themselves.

Provides a good introduction to changes which are spreading rapidly in the global airport industry. Although dated, it is still relevant. My only criticism is that it does not give sufficient consideration to airports as part of a multi-modal transportation infrastructure, which is likely to be the future of the airport industry."},{"Title":"The Airport Business","review":"\\"The Airport Business\\" is a good book on the economics of airport business written by a well known writer on airline economics. This is a welcome addition to the limited books on this rather specialized area of the air transport industry.The air transport industry has been undergoing rapid and profound transformation in the past few decades. The transformations have resulted in some major changes in the airline business model. Since airports are an important part of the aviation industry, the author shows how they have been coping with these revolutionary developments in the air transport industry.Airports have also undergone some rapid changes and Doganis discusses the major transformations including control and ownership of the world's largest airports, commercialization and privatization, capacity constraints, financing airports development, competition, pricing models and revenue and cost structures of airport businesses. The book is an important addition to economic theory pertaining to airports which should make the book very useful to the stakeholders of airport business.The main drawback is that the book is now dated. Doganis needs to update the book in view of the major developments that have taken place since its publication."},{"Title":"Afrocentricity","review":"Hotep to those who want to recognize truth and bring enlightenment to our future leaders.Dr. Molefi K. Asante has never been a favorite of anyone who wants African Americans to not gain victory over their plight in America(especially in the academy. As a teacher and a student, I've witnessed hundreds of students become more encouraged and realistic about their future and their history.Afrocentricty is not for the timid or the meek. It was written for those persons who recognize the atrocities of our educational system and realize African Americans must view themselves as competent, creative, sensitive, and humane people, who have contributed much to humankind. A white American scholar named Ulrich C.Reitzug (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee)wrote a a chapter in Theodore Kowalski's Public Relations in Educational Organizations (1996), entitled Changing Social and Institutional Conditions, stating that: &quot;Prior to becoming a university professor I worked in K-12 schools for eleven years as a teacher and principal. The schools in which I worked wre attended by primarily white students from upper middle class, two-parent families. Nonetheless, there was sufficient diversity in these schools that there were also children in attendance from economically disadvantaged families and single parent families. As I reflect back on those days I realize that while overall I was well respected as an educator, i also know that education in the schools in which I worked was like a cheap tube sock-one size fit all...I believed in euity and justice. I cared for my students and their families; I wanted a top quality education for all students. However, I viewed these concepts through the narrow lens of a white middle class male living in a period of time when white maleness so dominated education that our focus was seldom challenged. Thus I was insensitive to cultural differences in learning style; I was unaware of certain aspects of student diversity; i did not now enough to question the Eurocentric content of the textbooks we used. I thought equality of educational opportunity meant providing the best &quot;white&quot; education for all children. If nonwhite children or other children who were culturally different from the mainstream &quot;didn't get it,&quot; we would team them in a group with other children who also &quot;didn't get it.&quot; There we would help them by providing white education in finer, more discrete increments. I was never sensitive enough to realize that the Eurocentric focus of the education we provided delegitimized the culture of children of color and ensure inequalitiy of educational opportunity for most of these children. This educator references in his bibliography, Molefi Kete Asante's Afrocentricity, as a book used in his research. For those of us who grew up under a system of Jim Crow and segregation, and now the eradication of Affirmative Action (thanks to African Americans like Ward Connelly), it is major that scholars like Asante, Patricia Liggins-Hill (author of the anthology Call and Response), Clenora Hudson-Weems (author of Africana Womanism and Emmett Till: The Sacrificial Lamb of the Civil Rights Movement),Tony Martin (volumes of books of the life and contributions of Marcus Garvey) and so many other African American scholars, continue to be Afrocentric in their research, writing, and actions. It doesn't mean they are against anyone. Afrocentricity means we as Africana scholars (some of these scholars have been white who have gained their scholarship the Temple University, thanks to Dr. Asante and others), want to correct the miseducation of all students from preschool to college; What will our future leaders think and say, if we do not make our voices heard and our writings sound to wipe the onslaught of racism and incorrect books about first world peoples? Afrocentricity is a spirit movement and a paradigm which Molefi K. Asante challenged the system and was victorious. For those who do not or cannot understand Afrocentricity, try praying for understanding and wisdom. Dr. Asante, on behalf of our children of the world, thank you. Oh, by the way. One year ago, the first Chinese student to earn his doctorate under Dr. Asante returned to China, to teach in the Afrocentric way. Need I say more.Asante Sana! Thank you."},{"Title":"Afrocentricity","review":"Afrocentricity remains as one of the newest and least understood of philosophical branches. Originating in the late 19th Century through the work of W.E.B. DuBois and his contemporaries, Asante provides a brilliant stepping-stone, just scraping the surface for the uninitiated beginner, into this compelling branch of thought. Particularly interesting are his arguements on human nature and of universality. Afrocentricity is NOT Black nationalist propaganda, it is a legitimate point-of-view and a basis of serious scholarship. Essential reading for any philosophy student."},{"Title":"Afrocentricity","review":"Molefi Kete Asante (born 1942) is an African-American scholar, historian, and philosopher, who is currently Professor in the Department of African American Studies at Temple University, where he founded the first Ph.D. program in African American Studies.

He has also written books such asAfrocentric Idea Revised,Kemet, Afrocentricity and Knowledge, andClassical Africa.He begins the first chapter of this 1988 book by saying, \\"This book offers a philosophical inquiry into the future of the Afrocentric perspective and a testament of Nija, the ideology of victorious thought.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"Understand this point, a nationalist is not necessarily a racist; indeed, the true nationalist is never a racist.\\" (Pg. 5)\\"Afrocentricity is the belief in the centrality of Africans in post modern history.

It's a series of short statements, without rhythm or flow. This author went on to publish several more poetry books, none of which I've read. Based on this one, there's nothing that would make me want to read them. The first reviewer of this book cherishes it, says it essentially saved her life. That's really, really wonderful, but poetry---I don't think so!

On the second page of the book we are met with the piercing gaze of a man wearing not only a tweed jacket, but also a grin which conveys a mix of provocative mischief, tender understanding and a most stubbourn joy. The words found in the book, that is the poems themselves, lead to reader to feel an admiration for the writer as well as a form of sympathy. We are left with the impression that this is a man of bravery, but tender. A man of vallour, yet humanly flawed. A man no stranger to heartbreak, but determined to overcome everything which heartbreak and heartache leave in their aftermath. It is the vision of a man who seems to have grown up long before he was meant to, and your heart weeps for his loss, but at the same time is overcome with joy at the conclusion that he is a match for anything! To make it plain: Charles A. Coulombe has captured ruthlessly what goes on in the heart of a young man, and it is my humble opinion that every man should be given this work at the age of 18.

The fundamental idea is that reasoning has three roots -- empathy/intuition, analogy, and analysis -- which he aligns with three laws of logic, three instinctual human questions, and three types of politics.Readers who are familiar with the history of philosophy will probably consider the overview too superficial, while someone who is unfamiliar may be dazzled by the number of names dropped in a single paragraph that summarizes a specific idea they all share.All three lectures cover the same points and so the last half of the book is little more than a restatement of the first 43-page lecture. The text may also seem overly dramatic in some places because the editor(s) preserved some of Ichazo's bold speaking style: in reference to the three \\"living questions,\\" he says, \\"If we fail to answer positively, we are dead.\\"However, the biggest problem is that the theory presented herein was revised several times during the ensuing two decades. For example, on page 96, Ichazo asserts, \\"There are only four planes and that's that.\\" But three years later, he modified the theory to embrace five planes (or realms). In effect, this book's function has been reduced from \\"introductory\\" to \\"archival.\\" Therefore, I feel compelled to voice my opinion that the prices being requested by sellers are outrageously high."},{"Title":"Between metaphysics and protoanalysis: A theory for analyzing the human psyche","review":"DEFINITELY do not buy \\"new\\" here as it is much cheaper via the Arica website. However I concur that the material is radically out of date. Its sole usefulness is following the trail of what Oscar USED to think about realms, instincts, etc. You can borrow it from any decent public library system, read it and note the points you care about, which are anyway buried pretty deeply in a text that was clearly taken straight from the lectures and NOT edited for readability.The presentation style and word usage are extremely dated so be prepared to wince a lot."},{"Title":"Between metaphysics and protoanalysis: A theory for analyzing the human psyche","review":"Much of the written material from the Arica System of Oscar Ichazo requires taking some kind of training to get. This is one of the few that does not. It is a series of three lectures, more philosophical in orientation, that introduces Trialectics. It is a logic of unity that replaces either/or logic on one side and dialectics on the other side. The former being limited and the latter still having unresolved tensions. Trialectics is similar to the \\"third force\\" of the 4th Way, another Sufi system revealed by Gurdjieff mainly through his brilliant student Ouspensky. The lectures are fairly simple and clear. I am not sure, though, if Oscar really conveys the importance of his trialectics and may have been too ambitious in trying to give a western philosophical overview of what has arisen before. I think he succeeds more with the practical \\"protoanalysis\\" that students are required to do in the training program. Although Ouspensky does not give the names of trialectics and protoanalysis, some of this work is implied in the 4th way, though the Arican version is simpler and easier to understand, and probably more practical. Unfortunately, the kind of analysis that is involved is not touched upon in these lectures, only its philosophical basis and this only barely. It seems that Oscar is limiting what he needs to say to one basic introductory focus. The book is interesting historically and reflects the origins of some key elements of the protoanalysis and of the Arica system as a whole."},{"Title":"The Sword is Drawn","review":"This is the first book in a trilogy which includes Sword in Sheath and At Sword's Points. The protagonist is Lorens Van Norreys, descendent of Dutch merchant adventurers. The story opens as the Netherlands is about to fall to the Germans and Lorens is told by his dying grandfather that he must keep the secret of a historic piece of jewelry, significant in Dutch history. The Nazis descend, and Lorens escapes with the help of his grandfathers Malay servant and some smugglers.Eventually Lorens makes his way to Dutch Indonesia, where the story picks up some weeks before Pearl Harbor. After the Japanese attack the East Indies, we follow the retreat of the Dutch. Lorens makes it to Australia, and then realizes he needs to get back to where he left the jewels in Holland. He makes his way to the U.S., gets some on-the-side commando training (he has suffered some serious injuries in a plane crash and is not rated for combat), and then back to Holland. He must deal with apparent traitors, Nazis, and heroic comrades.The defeat of the Allies in the East Indies is very grim reading, but Norton does not dwell too much on it. While this is an adventure, Norton does not view the war as romantic. Death can come quickly and the picture of a folk being beaten back on two fronts is well done.The book was written in 1944, and while it is apparent the war will end in allied victory, the future of individuals, especially fools, is uncertain.Lorens is pretty well drawn. Impetuous and a little foolish in the beginning, but he clearly learns from his experiences.A trick Norton uses is to introduce sections with parts of letters that Lorens writes to his friend Lawrence in Cleveland, Ohio (Norton's home). There is an introduction by a lady who was involved, as was Norton, in a pen-pal youth group. Some of the correspondents were Dutch and some of their material was useful to Norton in writing the book."},{"Title":"The Sword is Drawn","review":"An early work in espionage by the woman who would become a Grandmaster of Science Fiction & Fantasy, this was the first in a sword trilogy based on events of World War II and shortly after.A fast paced story with insight into the oppression of the Netherlands by the occuppying German forces."},{"Title":"Let Us Have Music for Christmas 39 Famous Songs for Piano with Words, Ten of Which are Also Arranged as Piano Duets","review":"Condition of book was not very good, but music is still able to be read.

However, overall I felt the contrast was well done for he also does not always paint a perfect picture of the white settlers.

At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear.

A Narrative of 1757","review":"The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper is a narrative told in the thirdperson. It has many action, fighting scenes, and times when the characters do nothing.The story follows a group of English around the wilderness while encountering manyobstacles.The story is set during the French and Indian War in northern America. Thesetting is important because the frontier gives a sense of danger to the story. Also, thewar brings an atmosphere of kill or be killed. The characters have to be careful who theytrust.The characters in the novel are not very believable. The characters are eithertotally good or totally evil, there are none in between. Cooper provides a stereotype whenportraying the Indians. The only good Indians in this story are the Mohicans which aredying out. The rest of the Indians are portrayed as savages.Cooper's characterization is indirect. The Characters are developed throughactions, not background. When a new character is being introduced, they are describedwith out a name. Then, after they have been left out for a while, the characters arereferred to by name. This along with the fact that many characters have more than onname often causes confusion.The language of The Last of the Mohicans is very out dated. The book waswritten in the 1500s. This makes the language very difficult. Also, this time period usedmore words to explain a scene than it would today. This makes the slower scenes dragon. The action scenes move faster but still are slow going due to language.The Last of the Mohicans is a good book, although it is difficult to read.Language and Cooper's style of writing make the book difficult to read, and at timesboring.

A Narrative of 1757","review":"Cooper's Prose at times seems designed to hide his meaning from the reader. It is florid, overblown, and full of circumlocution.Some of the plot twists can only be described as bone-headed. Two examples: The protagonists engage in a song fest while trying to hide in woods crawling with hostile Indians. They search for a fort by following the rut plowed by a cannonball.Notwithstanding its flaws, &quot;Mohicans&quot; is an engaging tale about remarkable people whom the reader comes to care about.In the Leatherstocking Saga, Cooper anticipates Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan stories. Both Tarzan and Hawk-eye are noble men from &quot;civilized&quot; stock thriving in a wilderness among &quot;savages.&quot; Cooper and Burroughs both do violence to the English language, both write contrived plots with improbable twists, but both nevertheless spin tales of wondrous adventure.One scarcely noted aspect of the story is the undercurrent of racism and tribalism that permeates the tale. Every Indian tribe seems to hate every other tribe; whites hate Indians; Indians hate whites; and so on ad nauseum.Magua tells Cora he hates her because she is white like the man who sold him whiskey and caused him to disgrace himself. Cora defends herself: &quot;And am I answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose shade of countenance may resemble mine?&quot; Ironically, Cora, on her mother's side, is &quot;descended ... from that unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved to administer the wants of a luxurious people.&quot;When Munro accuses Heyward of preferring his (Munro's) daughter Alice to her half-sister Cora because of Cora's Black ancestry, Heyward replies: &quot;Heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!&quot; No sooner does he express this noble sentiment than he shows great relief to learn that Alice's mother is Scottish on both sides of her family.Then there is the trans-racial partnership between Hawk-eye and Chingachgook, in which some critics see the prototype for the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover partnership in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series. And finally there is the trans-racial love between Cora and Uncas.The story, although a swashbuckling adventure, has a distinct subplot of racial prejudice. We see the characters nobly overcoming it at times but basely succumbing to it at others."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I thought the Last of the Mohicans was a good book and a bad book. I thought it was agood book because of all the suspense throughtout the book. I also liked the book because of how James Cooper described the characters and there surroundings.I didn't like the book because of how James Cooper phrased things. If you don't read well it would be hard to understand. If you were going to read the Last of the Mohicans you would want to have a old dictionary with you to understand some of the words. One more good thing is that he uses no profanity in this book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I'm a junior in high school and recently read lotm for an advanced english 3 class. I found it some what wordy and very drawn out. Some where buried underneath a mound of words that I struggled to understand was an interesting and historical plot. I really liked the plot and time setting, but I don't think Cooper's style of writing was intended for my generation. I would definately mention the reading of this book to an adult who appreciates american classics, but I wouldn't even admitt reading it to a younger person."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"James Fenimore Cooper's novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Narrative of 1757&quot;), is a remarkable book for many reasons. First published in 1826, the book represents an early attempt to create substantial literary art from the material of North American history and geography. Although the book has its flaws, it is for the most part a success.In the novel, the white woodsman Hawk-eye and his Mohican Indian comrade Chingachgook join forces to help the daughters of a white military officer through hostile territory. The story takes place in a colonial American setting marked by conflict between French and English forces -- a conflict that also involves various Indian nations.There are a number of exciting (and often graphically violent) scenes of battle and chase. Hawk-eye, a white man who, to a large degree, rejects European-American values, is a fascinating figure -- indeed, he is one of the most enduring fictional creations in all of United States literature. Through the mouths of Hawk-eye and the various Indian characters, Cooper offers some intriguing criticisms of white culture.As I said, the book is not without flaws. The momentum of the book lags for a brief stretch, and some of Cooper's characters (in particular, his women) at times sound a bit stereotypical. But the overall power and intelligence of Cooper's work is undeniable. Particularly impressive is his re-creation of a multilingual world of complex cultural and personal conflict. Also noteworthy is his evocation of the American landscape. A tale of death and survival, of betrayal and loyalty, and, above all, of the extraordinary bond between a white man and an Indian, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is one classic that deserves to be read and reevaluated by each generation."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],M={key:0},j={key:1};function G(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(t(!0),o(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",M,"See more"))],8,q)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(x,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-84a0b72d"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/60.md","filePath":"drive/60.md"}'),Y={name:"drive/60.md"},L=Object.assign(Y,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{D as __pageData,L as default};
