This novel will make you look at today's changes and wonder how much of it is truly science fiction.

For a cheap Kindle version it was rally very good quality"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It may be said that great books comment on their times, and on the human experience, but masterpieces actually shape history. We may look at George Orwell's 1984 in two ways: first, his description of the terror of totalitarianism, which his generation witnessed firsthand in the form of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Orwell does a masterful job of presenting such a world in its day-to-day reality, the unspoken weight of oppression found in police states, the everpresent fear that becomes natural after a while, the ease with which that fear eventually makes you just go along with it all.But history has also shown us that totalitarianism eventually burns itself out, that it cannot be sustained in the long run. This is scant reassurance for its millions of victims, true, but maybe a bit of hope for the rest of us. The second point about 1984, and the thing that makes it a masterpiece, is the way that it has shaped our culture today, not through its description of totalitarianism itself but the way it describes the very real methods used by governments and ideologies to control us. Terms like \\"doublethink\\" are now a part of our daily discourse, describing not the subjects of totalitarian states like North Korea but the modern, wealthy democracies that claim to be free. And this is the most chilling message of Orwell's novel: you don't need to be in a totalitarian regime to be controlled by clever propaganda. You don't need to have the police cameras in your home. You only need the fear of them, or the belief that war is peace or that torture is justice or that history is a thing that the powerful are entitled to rewrite for their own ends. Because self-censorship is every bit as complete as the regular kind, and is actually preferred by those who would control us, since it's far cheaper and easier than putting an actual gun to your head."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Well written and still holds up today.

It raises questions and it paints a nightmarish picture of goverment control. While this stuff never happened verbatim, many goverment attempted and still attempt to control spoken and written word much more than it is reasonable. People still disappear (vaporize) without anybody knowing if they are alive or not (courtesy of local or far-away governments including so called \\"democracies.\\")Anyway, the book is very interesting read. Saying more may spoil it for a future reader.

Either by its prophetic themes or by the influential vocabulary itself this book has penetrated post-modern humanity. Beyond recommending it I would say it is part of a secular literature which represents human thought in the 20th century to present day.This is also the swan song literary gem of a great writer at his peak. He died shortly after finishing as he neglected his health in the fury of writing, feeling that, after some lesser literature, he was finally on to something. And so he was.This book has a unique style of prose, self-invented perhaps and represents a deep look, a chilling picture of our world. I have read that it may be considered part of a small collection of contemporary dystopian classics from the mid 20-th century. To me this one stands out alone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Everyone's heard of 1984, and yet I hadn't read it yet. In fact I really had no intention of reading it until a friend bought me a copy and told me to read it. So here I am today, not quite a fan, but impressed none the less.Right from the beginning I enjoyed how Orwell wrote. Not necessarily the actual story, just how he writing flowed from one sentence to the next. It was very concise and clear, fluidly moving from page to page. You can immediately draw parallels to the ideas in 1984 to many countries throughout the world, which is amazing considering it was originally published in 1949. This made the beginning third of the book at least bearable. The concept was definitely mind opening to start with, but then Orwell didn't go into enough explanation and instead kept repeating the same sequence of events over and over again. Big Brother watching, telescreen this, telescreen that. This person won't make it, that one won't. Change the history, rewrite events so on and so on. We understood the world they lived in without actually knowing the why and the how.It wasn't until we get to The Book that 1984 begins to bloom and sprout into a lovely flower, or if Big Brother had a say it would be a weed. As excerpts from The Book are read we finally get to see the how and the why, to understand how our world became what it was. The constant struggle, if not physically than the mental head games, between the 3 all powerful superstate in Oceania, Eurasia and Eastaisa. It all clicked in to place and shake your head at the clarity of it. But after that it didn't quite follow through with the ending as torture and psychological head games are used to bludgeon a party member in to accepting Big Brother's way fo thinking, or ingsoc.Certainly on the depressive side this book is, but the ideas that it expresses are well worth the read. Orwell conveys the message so clearly that you can't help but shake your head as you count off the countries that seem like they are today, 61 years later, falling into the governmental control over its citizens that is represented in 1984. Although not the best book, 1984's ideas are important. A tentative recommend so long as one knows why type of book they are getting in to.4 stars."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Am amazing glimpse into the future by Orwell.It is eerie how the world is evolving into what Orwell predicted.A must read for anybody interested in the evolution of a world fascist government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"An absolutely phenomenal book written half a century ago depicting what life could become by the year 1984.

I had heard my,&quot;Big Brother,&quot; speak of this book in my younger days and decided to explore the novel myself. Complete enjoyment is what I experienced while reading this wonderful piece of literature. Experience it for yourself whenever you can because it's well worth the time.

A few, however, I have been unable to put down and one of those is 1984. This book compelles the reader to think, something so few people do today. It is incredibly frightening to think about living in such a tightly controlled society where one cannot even hold one's own opinions! To live without love and sex and opinions or emotion of any kind is truly terrifying. The book is so enthralling, I could not finish it the first 2 times I read it. Imagining the depths of the Ministry of Love and thinking about what would await me in my own personal Room 101 gave me nightmares. No other book has produced such an effect on me. It doesn't matter how accurate he was about communism or whether or not communism is really bad.

When I finished it for the first time, I was simply amazed, and have read it four times since. One thing I'd like to say about this novel: stop regarding it as 'political'! People make alot of references to it when talking politics (ie the relations between PC and Newspeak, etc) but this isn't the book's main purpose. This is a book about a man struggling to find freedom, happiness and truth under an oppressive government of power freaks. It also asks philosophical and psychological questions, such as 'what is truth?', and 'what does it take to break the human spirit?' , which are masterly integrated into the plot. The aesthetics and reality of this novel are also great. It really adds to the suspense and mood of the novel. That's all I have to say. When you're done and feel like something a little more uplifting, read its 1994 sequel, &quot;Orwell's Revenge&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is an excellent book but it has been misinterpreted.

Especially, in the end, when he losses all hope of rebillon and begins to love Big Brother, and tyurns his back on his love Julia.

Then, I thought: &quot;no, I want to live&quot; to live in order for this world never to become reality. I have read many reviews of this books, and some have dimissed it by giving it one or two stars. Saying that this book is either unrealistic or too depressing. Too depressing? One must take into consideration the fact that this was written a year when everything was seen pessimistically, people were not sure of their future, and a myriad people thought the future not to be a brighter place, but even darker. Under such circumstances the result is not going to be Cadbury's roses. For the so-called unrealism, when you say that the rat scene is highly improbable for a governement to implement, you must not be aware of what is going on in the world, not only is it very likely to happen, but has already happened. Torture does exist, by the way, and if you think that what goes on in the protagonists head is &quot;unrealistic&quot; then the book's words: IGNORANCE IS FORCE is probably true. All in all, one of the best books of this century, that I advise all to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book, which should be canonized, in definitly the best book ever. I carry a copy of it with me everywhere. But the thing no one seems to understand is that the book has absolutly NOTHING to do with Winston Smith, but is rather about a self sustaining dictatorship and how it functions. Smith is merely a vessle, a exsample. People who say &quot;I hate this book&quot; simply don't understand it. The Government should hand out copys and make every one read it(also known as school), but those of us intelegent enough to appreciate, enjoy, and understand this book already have. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While the future of what O'Brian said the Party was trying to achieve is ridiculous, what it has already achieved is sadistic and depressing enough. This novel takes you up to thinking the Party will one day be overthrown and then crushes all ambitions of it, best novel i've ever read"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a true classic. There's a lot more to this novel than what is on the surface level. It's not that it's a true outlook on what 1984 was actually like but it's a look at humanity and what civilization could be (is) like. It's best put as a &quot;negative utopia -- not dramas of what life could be ... but nightmares of what it is becoming.&quot; I reccomend reading Imagining Argentina by Lawrence Thornton after reading this novel. That will truely show you that this nightmare that Orwell has envisioned is a reality in parts of our world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Brilliant, simply brilliant. I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I disagree entirely with the review from &quot;Chinaman&quot;--not only is this a great story, but it IS happening in his country--and has been since 1949--that's the whole point! Substitute &quot;The Great Helmsman&quot; for &quot;Big Brother&quot;, and you have a picture perfect portrait of Red China."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The entire book was good up until the last chapter, at least in my opinion. Without giving out the ending, I didn't feel that Orwell used the characteristics of his character well. Maybe I'll need to re-read the book to understand the true meaning of the book because I didn't get it in my first try. However, the book was well put together overall with very strong characters and a strong plot. It's scary if &quot;Oceania&quot; ever became the world of today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is truly a spectacular composition, possibly the best work of George Orwell. The setting and the characters are so vivid and believable that you will not be able to put the book down until you finish. Full of suspense and surprise, it serves as a parody within an infinite moralic story. Readers who have enjoyed &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Coming up for Air&quot; should not miss reading this classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I first read this novel, the first four words were just amazing! 1984 is a book that has to be read, it is just simply amazing! Pure and simple. Some of the things in this book is just frighting! George Orwell did a great job creating a story that is just VERY REALISTIC! Sure it does start off slow, George Orwell does into a lot of detail in the book about how things COULD OF BEEN if Communism did take over the world. No one has the right to privacy, the people in this book are always being watched by the Party, and it is just outright amazing.The story evolves around Winston, he works for the Ministry of Truth, deep inside he hates the Party, but he does not reveal it because of the Thought Police! So he goes to work everyday eating the nasty food the Party gives the people, he then thinks that he is being watched by the Thought Police, which turns out to be a girl who is MUCH MORE YOUNGER than he is! He is 39, and the girl is in her mid-twenties. Her name is Julie, he wanted to kill her because he thought she was spying on him, sound real huh?1984 is a HARD novel to read, and going through the novel is HARD, but it is worth reading. The novel brings hatred toward one's government, and how one of could of lived if Communism did spread throughout the world. Very scary, but yet very interesting because George knows how to write a very good book.Read it, and you wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is not a book for entertainment for sure. You just want to forget about the whole thing once you finish reading it. There is something in human in the book, something that turns your stomach, almost like \\"devil\\" and you want to get away from it. May be Orwell did this on purpose, to make you feel what one feels under that sort of an oppressive government.Some of his predictions in the book are \\"eerie\\" to say the least. Some people might want to specify this government or other for the subject of the book, but I think at different degrees, one can find dark forces that want to control and oppress others for their interest everywhere and every country even in the West.It is not a long book, which is a plus. You can finish it while the whole story is still in your mind.PS: In War and Peace Tolstoy writes about Pierre's Masonic initiation ceremony. In there Pierre is asked what he is afraid of, the most. Now, \\"1984\\" gives a possible answer why this question had to be asked in the first place."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was one of the many people who had to read 1984 as a high school student. However a few weeks ago, I decided to read it again. And I was amazed about how much I enjoyed it when I didn't have to worry about writing an essay on it. George Orwell did a fantastic job creating a world where there is no love, no warmth or anything that resembles humanity. Winston Smith, the main character, feels trapped in Oceania, a dire place where words are cut from the language to limit the thoughts of citizens, cameras and microphones are everywhere to monitor your actions, and where children will call their parents traitors and turn them in to authorities. Winston manages to find joy in trinkets he buys from a prole's shop and from a woman he falls in love with. And he finds hope in the form of O'Brien, the one man who he thinks understands him. However, in Oceania nothing good lasts for long.The thought that Orwell put into the plot, characters, and the setting is considerable. He explains different facets of Oceanic history and society (especially through &quot;Goldstein's book&quot;,) and even includes an appendix explaining &quot;newspeak,&quot; the language of Oceania (which I recommend reading after the first few chapters). The scary thing about the book is that many elements of the Inner Party and Ingsoc are real and are relevant today. Read this book to see one view of how life can be like if we forget ourselves and put our futures completely in the hands of others."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are few books that I reference as much as this one. Almost every aspect of the homogenization of culture and individualism is realized in this book. You can not discuss world politics without reading this book. Just read the darn book!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nineteen Eighty-Four is not and never has been just a year. Nor is the world portrayed by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four a place or even merely a set of political or social circumstances. Rather, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a state of mind, a way of being, an atmosphere in which the dark side of our nature lives and turns all around it darker still. It is a time or place which we create when we turn away from the light that is within us, within each individual self, to the empty darkness of group will and psychology; of \\"massmindedness\\". Thus do we create for ourselves to live in the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four.Orwell's \\"fiction\\" of a world in which, but for a lingering echo, individuality had all but passed into extinction, could have been set in any time or place where \\"massmindedness\\" is paramount and where the individual exists merely to serve the group. Throughout history, most religions have preached, most governments have practiced and most societies have been organized around such \\"massmindedness\\". It is only the calendar which might confuse and comfort us, which might convince us that Nineteen Eighty-Four was merely a gruesome story about a time and place that never was nor could ever be. But nothing is further from the truth. And the simple truth is that Nineteen Eighty-Four is NOW.In Nineteen Eighty-Four, there are no heroes, except as an idea, an ideal may be said to be a hero. All of its characters are exceedingly human, and this is what makes Nineteen Eighty-Four both timely and timeless, both powerful and profoundly pathetic. Nineteen Eighty-Four is often upsetting, sometimes disheartening, but, when its main lesson is learned, never depressing. It is fundamentally a story of hope, of a truth which can be discovered (although too late for all concerned); a truth which can be seen by us and taken as not only our ideal, but as the practical guide by which, to a greater or lesser extent, we can avoid the very pitfalls which consumed Winston and Julia and O'Brien and Big Brother, and liberate ourselves from the tyrany and ultimate destructiveness of the group and its massminded stranglehold on our minds, our hearts and our souls.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a simple story of faith wrongly placed. Winston Smith, its main character, searches to escape the suffocating and oppressive world manipulated by and for a ruling group, The Party. He believes that he is seeking a political, a social solution with which he can combat, can destroy the evil of group-think and the \\"massmindedness\\" in which he lives. Instead, he finds the most exquisitely human, individual \\"weapon\\" with which to pursue his salvation: love. But, as we humans are too often prone to do, Winston overlooks what is simple and obvious, what is at hand, and, even as do those he disdains, he puts his faith in another group, The Brotherhood. (It is not for Winston to realize that his answer lies in the idea and practice of \\"brotherhood\\", rather than in the imaginary purity of \\"The Brotherhood\\".) In the end, Winston is betrayed not by his enemies, but, in a real sense, by himself, by his failure to see the worth in the object of his own worship; the individual and the emotional life with which he or she can find their own peace and presence, even in a world gone apparently mad.Winston, with his male oriented solution, seeks one group to combat another group, while Julia, a woman, brings the possibility of true salvation to him (and them) in the idea and practice of individual love. Julia knows the truth, and what is worthwhile, but Winston (the very name of the great male war leader of Orwell's recent past) plunges on ahead, seeking a \\"political\\", \\"social\\" solution (not unlike the many male \\"leaders\\" of all time past). This may be a small (or maybe the greatest) point of the book.It is an instructive book; there is a good deal of What Every Young Person Ought to Know - not in 1984, but 1949. Mr Orwell's analysis of the lust for power is one of the less satisfactory contributions to our enlightenment, and he also leaves us in doubt as to how much he means by poor Smith's \\"faith\\" in the people (or \\"proles\\"). Smith is rather let down by the 1984 Common Man, and yet there is some insinuation that common humanity remains to be extinguished."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I just read this book for the firdt time (May 2003). Although it was written in the 1950's, one should not underestimate its relevance. This is a powerful work that shows what could have happened in Western Europe if WWIII actually happened. You become Winston (the main character) and you can identify with his life, which consists of a horribly boring job at the \\"Ministry of Truth\\" and who is, along with every other human being on Earth, is constantly watched by the Thought Police, which also bans all resistance tools. You become aware of the struggle that is Winston's (main character) desire to get away (with Julia) from the all-oppresssive Total Government Control of all aspects of human life. I would suggest this book as required reading for everyone... Big Brother is Watching You... The imagery and horror say it all."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 shows us what he believed the future would be like if mankind did not change and socialism increased. This dark tale tells of a world where Big Brother is constantly watching you, and any act that could come even close to disobeying the Party, meant you were eliminated--which meant, not only were you never heard from again, but you were actually being erased from all records and memories, so that you never even existed.The Party has absolute control over all types of media and print, and in effect, the lives of everyone. Their slogan is &quot;Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&quot; Anything historically that shows that the Party is wrong, is changed in every history book and record and eventually the minds of the people and thus, never happened.This book is in three main sections. It was a bit slow at first, but I forced my way through it. Further through, the book dramatically picks up in excitement. By the time I got to the third part, I could barely put the book down.I am rating this book 5-stars because it has become a modern classic that captivates the reader's attention, not only in the story, but also on the philisophical level above it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a novel about a futuristic society in London where every one and every thing is totally controlled by the government. An entity known as \\"Big Brother\\" embodies the state and commands absoloute obedience and religious devotion from the populace; he is considered to be all-powerful and all-knowing. This represents the worst possible outcome for future, technocratic, materialistic and relativistic society: whatever benefits the masses and keeps the ruling Party in power is acceptable and there must be no deviation from the Party line. Population control is maintained through rationing, propaganda, mind-control, executions of POWS, unpleasant sensory distractions, total repression of sexuality and familial bonds, 24-7 work loads, pointless wars against forign enemies, destroying words so people cannot express themselves and erasing any knowledge people have of the past before the Party's \\"Revoloution.\\"No privacy for individuals is allowed. TV \\"telescreen\\" cameras are everywhere, watching everyone around the clock. Their motive is not to deter crime in the general sense but to deter \\"thought crime,\\" cases where individuals seem to be manifesting symptoms of political dissent or nervousness about their existance. This is especially scary, given that 1984 was published in 1949 after the fall of Nazi Germany and the ascendancy of the Soviet Union over Eastern Europe. Today telvision cameras are everywhere watching people's movements, and some new ones can even identify facial features and match them to a name and personal history on a computer database. 1984's \\"telescreens\\" are double trouble--not only can they monitor citizens but they constantly barrage them with government propaganda. Today everyone who has electricity can now voluntarily turn on their TV and inject their minds full of whatever the government and the corperate media conglomerates want you to hear. If someone watching you through your TV screen bothers you, think about what it would be like if you were never allowed to turn your MTV or the FACTOR with Bill O'Reilly off!The government also uses torture on specific \\"thought-criminals\\" in order to destroy their resistance to Party dogmatics. The objective is to cause so much physical, mental and emotional stress that the subject is unable to reason for themselves and accepts whatever the Party says is true. In the novel this is justified by the notion that \\"Perception is reality.\\" Whatever a human brain thinks is true is true. The stars are not flaming balls of hydrogen fusion millions of light years away, no, we can stretch out our hands and touch them if we want. We are not bound by the law of gravity--we can float into the air if we want to. Even 2+2=5 if we so desire. The only problem is making everyone think exactly the same as everyone else. According to this there is no truth except what the person in charge says is truth and whatever they can do to make you believe it, then it is true. This is happening all around our world today--the rule of relativism. If there are no concepts of right and wrong, then Anarchy and/or Totalitarianism take over and the world is ruled by Might Makes Right. It nearly happened in the 1940's, and could happen (and is happening) again. The American people may not be controlled by the use of brute force and sexual repression now, but they are directed by government and media propaganda in the same way as described in Orwell's 1884."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"My city, Bloomington, Indiana, chose \\"1984\\" to read this year for its One City One Book event this spring. In 2002 we read \\"A Lesson Before Dying,\\" also a wonderful book, but this year, the organizing committee let the citizens vote from a list of nominees. We selected \\"1984.\\" As part of the National Library Week celebration last week the Indiana University librarians sponsored a discussion \\"1984\\" at our Lilly Library, which houses our rare books and special collections, including some Orwell material. The discussion was led by an emeritus English professor; he introduced the discussion with three themes/questions he found to be interesting. The discussion took off from his excellent introduction. I urge other communities to select this book to read and discuss. It is a darkly compelling novel that lends itself to many approaches and interpretations. Thus, it is a fabulous book to read and discuss with others. In fact, as I read, I couldn't wait to hear what other people thought about the book. It's a love story and a thriller. It's a political treatise and a rumination on totalitarianism. As other reviewers have said, against the backdrop of the war with Iraq, it is timely. But it is also timeless. The themes and issues explored in \\"1984\\" will be relevant every year. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"..............cause its happening!For the people how haven't read the book or are unsure if they should read it please take my recommendation and READ IT NOW. I promise you that you will be stunned how frightning and amazing this book really is."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"WOW! The images in this book will stay with you for a long time. Depressing and Uplifting at the same time, this book is a must read, especially if you want to avoid our own future turning into the picture that Orwell paints here. This book is read in high schools all over the nation for a reason: it speaks about the human heart - both the darkness there and the and the longing for freedom."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In this gripping, horrifying novel, Winston Smith (a citizen of totalitarian Oceania) dares to be defiant in private, against Big Brother, against the Upper Class, against everything. Along side his forbidden love Julia Winston works toward his goal of destroying Big Brother. He doesn't realize no one can end the reign of Big Brother. A terrifying gaze into the life of citizens in a totalitarian communist government, 1984 deserves all the hype and praise it gets. In the words of Winston Smith, &quot;DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While George Orwell felt that the time of totalitarian rule and the state as unanswerable monolith would be the latter twentieth century, the twenty-first century actually represents a better time for a slightly different version of the timeline he would suggest.The technological capability of monitoring almost every single household within a given area is here now, although most people voluntarily share themselves with the world via WebCam. It is not a far-fetched idea, in terms of cost or engineering, to monitor the civilian population of an entire country for illegal behavior. For a small fee, you can purchase your credit history and address from online companies who have no reason to have such information, and nothing bars them from sharing it with anyone who pays that fee.Regardless of advances in fiber-optic communications, _1984_ is first and foremost a story about government that acts solely to perpetuate its own dominance, and this century offers as many opportunities for that as past centuries. Given enough pretext by a state of war or economic collapse, the individual has no real chance against an organized enemy with the power to oversee every aspect of his life. If print journalism and its less scrupulous cousin in television fails to call for an accounting of government actions outside the vision of the individual, then the government can move with impunity against the individual.Is this paranoia? The modern and well-educated American society that won the Second World War allowed a alcoholic senator named Joseph McCarthy to destroy private lives with unsupported accusations, ending only with his accusation of Secretary of State and former Chief of Staff of the Army George Marshall, entirely too respected for the accusation to pass unanswered. It would not happen in this current political climate, but I suggest that it takes a lot less than you might believe to push government prerogative closer to totalitarian authority.With all that said about its cautionary value, _1984_ is one of the most clearly written novels in the English language, and a model for anyone who wants to write with economy and power. It and its companion piece by Huxley, _Brave New World_, should be read by everyone interested in protecting themselves against the worst that social organization and technological progress can offer."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I adore George Orwell's works! He is a master of the satire, and can convey humanity's greatest fears in his masterful storytelling. 1984 was no exception. it could be called a &quot;what if&quot; book, to show the state of the world had such and such occurred, a world where freedom is lost and hope, and love, and all that is left is power, for power's sake. In this desperate setting, Winston falls in love with Julia, both of them members of the party which occupies itself with total control. surrounded by posters, telescreens, all reminding that Big Brother is wathing, the two hold onto their love. When they are captured, however, Winston is victim to terrible tortures, ending in his renouncing his love, having been forever altered in mind and body, a pure minion of the party without emotion for the remainder of his life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The author has come very close to predicting the future, but we still have a long way to go.A very interesting story built around the future. Although 1984 has come and gone, the future of cameras watching our every move is very possible.As the war in Kosovo proved, some tactics are not just fiction."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I recall the flurry of TV and print documentaries that appeared in 1984, all striving to answer the question &quot;How close are we?&quot; I thought that generally they missed the point.Yes, Orwell's classic was ostensibly about Totalitarianism, but on a deeper level, it is all about control. 'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled. And, to this day, it still sounds a prescient warning."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book had a profound effect on me.

Orwell's allegorical vision of the ultimate totalitarian government and the twisted utopia that it creates is amazing in its unapologetic realism. Dark and absorbing, it's a simply beautiful piece and a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Yes, this book is, indeed, prophetical, but I beleive Orwell was also trying to show us that we are already blinded by our society and government. He chose to have Winston have the same way of thinking that your average, modern American Joe Blow would have, and then show you at the end how the rest of society thinks.Look deep within yourself and you will see that you are caught up in the materialistic madness. Orwell isn't a pessimist; he is a realist.Beautifully poetic, classical, and polital read. If you have not read this book, then buy it. Now. It is ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY a must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I don't read many books, but the second I read the first sentence of 1984, I knew I was teleported to a new world. &quot;The clock struck 13&quot;, &quot;National Hate Day&quot;, these are words strong in their own that aren't in any normal novel. Even though it was written so long ago, this piece of work has a true effect on anyone who reads it. There is no doubt at all that Orwell himself was scared of a communist society, but he put that fear to good use when he wrote this World renown masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I, along with (probably) a few million other high-school students read this recently, and I must say, this is one of the best books I have laid my eyes on. This will be a book that I'll remember. Although it may not be very realistic in the present-day free world, It was a very good vision. I would be VERY interested to see what changes and additions would be there, had Orwell known how powerful computers and surveillance equipment has become, although, according to the beleifs of the culture portrayed, development of the computer would have halted by the 70's at the latest. Oh well. Read it if you haven't yet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is the most profound book I have read. At its core is control of the masses. In a free, democratic society this occurs to a more ahorrant extent than in socialist or communist countries as the public is unaware it is happening, whilst a &quot;clean&quot; facade is maintained. The ominous image of 1984 is facilitated by our modern day, technological society, and as such its warning is even more general and relevant than it may intially seem. You can know only what you're told and believe only what you're lead to believe (directly or indirectly). I'll get off my soapbox now and let you wipe the blood from your ears. 1984 is a magnificent book and will change the way you think, indicating the genius of Orwell."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is one of the most book now, but as ficition it's also fantastic. If you liked it, and if you're open minded, than you should read other great books, like The Trial. Both of them are very important and clever, read it only if you want to think, it's not some kind of trash like The Alchemist."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is indescriptable. It does not fall into any categories except for that describing an inhumane society. Winston Smith needs the girl and I think it's beautiful when he discovers that she loves him. That's beside the point of the Thought Police and O'Brien. A very sad book with a sad end. Smith comes to love Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read it in a day. It was a great story, but where people come up with &quot;must read&quot; and comments on how true it is is confusing to me. Orwell has some interesting ideas, esp. the vocabulary thing. However, it is fiction. If it is regarded as such, enjoy it. If a philosophetic novel is expected, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a truly amazing look at a world of the future. A world where no one has a mind of their own, where a power-seeking Party controls everything. No one escapes the control of Big Brother, not even those with rock-hard beliefs against it.From the first page to the last sentence, this book draws the reader in, and the reader comes out with a new awareness, a new vantage point from which to view our modern world.Capturing Orwell's convictions about Communism and Socialism, the book is more than good suspense, it is a lesson."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Possibly my favorite book. It truly makes you think about human nature. The setting is a dystopia that is unthinkable, yet not implausible. There is a section on Newspeak, the language of this world, that is extremely interesting. Not a light read, but one that must be read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"You may think this is about Stalin and his Purges... it may be... but it's much more. The date is irrelavant, except that it's in the future of the author (Orwell). Our hero, Winston Smith (no accident that Winston Churchill and the most comon name, Smith, were used by Orwell), has all the right qualities: a questioning mind, a distrust of authority, and an oddball fascination with the truth...to get himself &quot;cleansed&quot; by the Thought Police, who torture and kill, out of &quot;love&quot; for Big Brother's lot of Outer Party Members. Smith has the temerity to question the nature of this power exuded by the Inner Party - for it's own sake, which seems fragile. Built on embracing &quot;DoubleThink,&quot; where any two diametrically opposed statements are both valid, and where citizens are told which version is the truth - for that moment. Smith asks, &quot;Does Big Brother exist?&quot; while Inner Party member O'Brien tortures what's left of him into believing 2 +! 2 = 4 or 5, depending what the very same Big Brother decides is Truth, for today, now. Why is &quot;1984&quot; important? Keeping an alert eye on any government that exudes power by control and manipulating information, where the individual is sacrificed to the needs of the many, where the press is owned by the church, and where the state is unapproachable and abstract, is not only the province of the American CIA, but of any individual professing adherence to democracy. The enemy may just be our own complacency. Orwell's anti-utopia novel is a warning: we must engage in our democracy or be prepared to believe 2 + 2 = 5...and all else will follow...!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone. Not because of how entertaining it is but because of how well Orwell gets his point across. The past exists only in written records and people's memories, and can therefore be manipulated.

There was something that I found incredibly interesting this time around. \\"The Book\\". \\"The Book\\" was a book that the main character reads from at some time during the story. What made Orwell write that?

But rarely have the successors been nearly as well told. Written in 1948, but still timeless and a great read. There is a reason this is a modern classic, while still a favorite among everything from the sci-fi crowd to the acolytes of horror, thrillers, and anyone into an intense vision of the future. One that is proving all too real."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell wrote this classic in 1948. He set it 36 years into the future. He was a visionary with facts in hand. The dark world he portrayed came to pass much sooner than he had predicted. Big Brother became a catch-word for all of the invasive technology that now monitors our lives. Orwell died before his fictional world became reality. He was lucky. The book is a classic. Every human being should read it and realize its' implications."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book is very well written. Although there're some wrong concatenation of words in the book, it doesn't matter much."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"My daughter was reading for school, and I picked it up again to assist her with writing about it. I remember reading this in high school, but it didn't make an impression on me at the time. Now I am 30 years older, and I REALLY enjoyed this book. Having seen the world a bit and watched the advent of the information explosion and how it has affected the way governments interact with their citizens, I find that we need to think about the themes that this classic brings up. Read it again. You will like it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's landmark book 1984 is one of the most important books of the twentieth century. Orwell was deeply distressed at the totalitarian experiments of Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. He thought that government surveillance and control of the press were trends that could make life an unliveable distopian nightmare.Orwell was a keen observer who saw trends developing in the future. He saw that as technology got more advanced, the repressive governments could gain greater controls of the populace. Orwell saw the rise of China as a reality in the future. He believed that the governments would foster a climate of perpetual war to provide a clear and present danger and a justification for empowering a military-industrial complex and giving justification for the strict controls of communication and the dissemination of information.Orwell shows that the egalitarian rhetoric of the corrupt regimes would never lead to better quailty of life for the peoples of the world. There would be perpetual shortages of consumer goods similar to those of Stalinist Russia. Orwell saw the secret police and show trials of the Soviet Union and the need for occasional purges as especially frightening trends.Orwell did not have a positive outlook about the future. His story of the travails of Winston Smith at the hands of \\"Big Brother\\" serves as a warning of what could be the result when people fail to be vigilant about protecting fundamental human rights. Orwell was a socialist with anarchist tendencies. However, his warnings can be valuable for people of any ideological persuasion. The book reminds people of the need to protect the right of open communication in the society. Orwell was a critic of the stifling censorship he witnessed in that era. 1984 is an essential book to read. It teaches some valuable lessons about the fact that freedom is fragile and people need to be watchdogs to protect basic civil liberties."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Still a most perceptive and amazing book. I first read this in about 1959 as part of ENGLISH 101 requirement. It moved me then and continues to worry me even more now with the advent of CCTV cameras and rising militancy everywhere."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\\"Under Big Brother's omniscient eyes, Winston Smith tried to ignite his only freedom, the freedom to believe in \\"obvious\\" truths, but by the novel's end, at the caf&eacute; Winston was unsure what two plus two would make, a sign that O'Brien had successfully reintegrated a \\"lost soul\\" and Winston had become like his friends and neighbors, unable to question and thus unable to revolt. What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O'Brien performed, but after these tortures, Winston's total capitulation&#61630;mind, body, and soul&#61630;to Big Brother. When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question, then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine.Winston, by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana's present position, such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe, had helped the regime's guardians, who like O'Brien believed \\"who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,\\" mold the citizens' minds. But Oceana, like other totalitarian regimes, also turned to the indispensable tool, fear, to chisel its citizens' minds and hearts to its agenda's shape and form. To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause, it would when necessary create fathom enemies, either Eurasia or Eastasia, even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies, or rather, like Oceana, no ideologies.Under 1984's dystopian sky, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother's overwhelming power and presence, but also because of Winston's inability to form any ideologies. Even though he wanted to think freely, he lacked the training and thus the analytical mind to counter O'Brien's offenses. In the end, his mind followed the path of least resistance.Orwell's 1984 is a dark apocalypse of sub-human society where homo-sapiens had replaced machines to operate an efficient hierarchy, an apocalypse which any people would usher wherever and whenever they ceased to question \\"intuitively obvious truths.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a great read, but is also quite disheartening. The society described in the book is inconceivable to some, but it's hard to argue that we aren't moving in that direction. I challenge anyone to disagree after reading this with an open mind.The highlight of the book is a manifesto that the main character, Winston Smith, must read. It shows Orwell's ingenious insight to mankind's role in it's own oppression. I couldn't help but agree with so much of what was said, at the same time realizing how much it seemed to trivialize the work of all civil rights activists.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoyed stories such as \\"V for Vendetta\\" or movies like &quot;American History X&quot; and \\"The Matrix\\"."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984, written in the late 1940's, is a shocking look at a possible future. This future is one where independant thought is outlawed and &quot;Big Brother&quot; rules over the people of Oceania with an iron fist. One man stands up against this totalitarian government. Can he topple Big Brother, or will he be one who falls? This book really makes the reader THINK while they read. Today, with our ever-expanding government, this future is not a far-fetched possibility. Do not take this book so much as an entertaining novel, but rather as a warning of events to come."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book, first published in 1949, revolves on a couple of lovers, caught with their independent and suspicious brains and memories in the grip of a ruthless totalitarian r&eacute;gime that claims complete control over bodies and minds of its subjects, and considers as a criminal and a crime whomever and whatever does not toe its line. Not only had its author already written about imperialism and totalitarianism, but he had also fought for freedom (Spanish civil war, on the republican side) when he published it. WW2 had recently finished, the cold war was at its beginning and the world had been fully informed about the horrors of Nazi Germany and of the communist Soviet Union. Orwell was one of those Western writers who, though communists, had grown disgruntled with the massive crimes of &quot;real socialism&quot; in the USSR, such as the killing of dozens million people: a feat, against which even the shoah pales. Another one of these writers was Arthur Koestler (&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;), who however kept to the events in the Soviet Union. Orwell's perspective extends to the whole world in a dismaying prevision; his lucid political and historical analyses, as well as his prophecies on future technological developments from major to minor ones (many of which have been realized), were terrifying. The world was lucky that, eventually, its 1984 did not have to see the forecast of the book, while, indeed, it saw the prelude to the failure and downfall of several of its totalitarian r&eacute;gimes. However, we only have to look around ourselves to realize that the danger still exists, and that the number of people wishful, though not yet powerful enough, to enact it is growing FAST. This book actually is one of the masterpieces of XX century English literature, and should be saved for the future. Whoever calls it &quot;a piece of garbage&quot; can only be either too young and inexperienced, or too ignorant of history and politics."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"See? One-line reviews are easy! I think everyone's entitled to offer their opinion of this book without some idiot chiming in condescendingly to enlighten us. And thanks for making the assumption that no one but you knows the difference between totalitarianism and communism -- Such an assumption reveals an over-inflated ego coupled with actual ignorance: Two things that go together quite often!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was weird. It was somewhat clever. I especially enjoyed the real-life aspects of the story. (eg. Winston and Julia) N E how, I was slightly disturbed by the communism/socialism factor of Big Bro - Jewish ppl rule in various ways - and this was not one of em. I can't get a mental note of Winston, but I'm sure he was a handsome fella - too bad the lifestyle was so darn crass."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I thought that 1984 was a pretty good book, except that I think it would have been better if I would have read it before 1984. The begining was dull and kind of boring, but I thought that ending was pretty good. I recomend it because it shows what could happen in the future if the government ever got a lot of power."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Do not make the mistake of thinking that Orwell was predicting what might come. He was already aware that Big Brother was here and not so well. Since the publishing of this fine book, BB has perfected his techniques. We are about to relinquish with little fight the last remnants of freedom and privacy our parents once had.I read front page articles of people saying that they don't mind the government opening and reading their mail! &quot;I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.&quot; This is the mentality that leads straight to the gulug or in our case privately owned and operated prisons (the next big franchise business!)In the name of NATIONAL SECURITY we bend over and spread them with trembling fingers. americans no longer should be allowed to refer to themselves as the land of the free and the home of the brave. We are neither!If you want to read a book that is even easier to understand, that connects the dots for you, read How to Save America and the World by Joseph Francione. Or do nothing and wait for your your chains."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of those books that I had always meant to read, but never got around to. Finally, one of my college classes required it, so I was happy to pick it up, though not without some reserved skepticism beforehand. I knew it was one of those books that is constantly referred to by people who are paranoid about government and distrust everything the government does, which wouldn't really describe me, in general. But, I have to admit that Orwell's writing is masterful. Right from the start, the world he presents is mesmerizing. I think I am safe in saying that in the first third of the book, almost nothing happens. Yet, I can also say that the first third of the book was just as interesting as any of the action that comes later. Every detail, every description, every movement is analyzed in the most fascinating way. Orwell is no idiot. He has that very rare ability of few great authors to show the workings of the inner mind of man in such a true and believable way that you very well believe that he could look at you and know what you are thinking. After the first third of the book, when the story actually progresses, it gets exciting almost in the way that a thriller does. You keep on wondering what move will be next and how the character is going to strategize the demise of the enemy. Then the last third of the book is a devastating, but still masterful analysis of the human mind, free will, and reality. At almost every stage, Orwell presents his ideas with a written clarity that is a language all in its own. In spite of this whole experience and my recognition at how skillful the writing and analysis was, I cannot say that I liked the book, or even if I would recommend it. The main reason for this is that I believe Orwell cheated at the end. The protagonist was putting up a fight against the machine, and in spite of its all-powerful, seemingly omnipotent status, he held off. Now, Orwell had two options. The protagonist either would capitulate under the increasingly intelligent pressure put on by the oppressor, or he would outlast and maintain his own free will to the end. I think that the ending Orwell chose was contrived, and what he did to get the protagonist there was unbelievable. Maybe it's my own principles or feelings, but I suspect that if Orwell had done it well enough, I would have at least respected his approach. But as it is now, I had to shake my head and say to myself: No. That's not true to human nature. I don't buy that. And what's worse, I felt that Orwell must have known that himself. His writing was too brilliant before, too logical, too well-reasoned. The person who wrote all of that can't possibly believe in this moment either. So, I suspect, that in order to get the ending that he wanted, he contrived the tipping point and then returned to his brilliant form to bring the story to its conclusion. One misstep is a harsh way to judge a truly exemplar book, but I believe that it was a key moment and it unravels all the true elements Orwell had so carefully set up before. Overall, however, it would be difficult to say to not read the book, because this type of writing and insight is difficult to come by. So if you are looking for a meaty intellectual treat, read it. But don't let him cheat you in the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book becomes even more topical in light of the events over the past year (those elusive WMDs, your great nation kept in fear with constant terrorist alerts, the latest airport fingerprinting of visitors 'security' measure) and it seems strange to me that people think this book should makes us wary of the evils of communism.I'm totally the opposite, I feel the book gives us a warning of what can happen if you are made to feel fear to the extent that you are prepared to lose that 'freedom' you are rightly so proud of. With the introduction of the Patriot Act (couldn't fail with a name like that, could it?) totally blasting that freedom out of the water, this book has never been more relevant or more scarily real. Yes, it's fiction but considering it was written more than 50 years ago, so many things are actually happening now and we are accepting them because we are 'told' we are in danger and it's for our own protection - the book even has it's very own Bin Laden.It makes it extremely convenient for anyone voicing their disagreement with policy to be silenced under the Patriot Act and not receive any rights whatsoever. Because it's dressed up with a cool name and there's the constant fear of terrorist attack, all of a sudden it's acceptable and what's more, welcome with open arms.If you haven't read this book yet, please read it. It's an eye-opener as to what freedom really is, or was, and far from being depressing, it shows the strength of the human spirit to desparately try to protect what's good and search for the truth."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What's scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn't so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us &quot;We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!&quot; they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. &quot;We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears.&quot; Orwell would've been so proud."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I don't consider this book to be science-fiction. I consider this to be science-future.Leaving aside any criticism of current political parties, lets just say that 1984 is a warning about allowing the individual to be ruled by the state, about allowing the individual to fall into the collective.It can be a difficult book to read, because the concept itself is difficult in this day and age...the struggle to retain an individual mind. The book is about Winston Smith, living in a future world (1984 WAS the future in 1949 when the book was written) which is dominated by an all-present and all-powerful government which is partly based on Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, and (gasp!) England and America. But the government which is symbolized by 'big brother' not only dominates the professional and personal world of Winston Smith, it also controls his thoughts, using constant brainwashing through media and imagery.Smith begins to assert his individualism, starts a love affair with a similar thinking woman and joins the resistance, which may only exist in his own mind. But Smith is doomed, there is no happy ending...only a warning to us all about trends in society. 1984 may have come and gone on the calendar, but IngSoc and Big Brother live on and continues to gain.This book has become the classic metaphor for the evils and failures of collectivist societies, and will haunt your ideas of political solutions to society's problems."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I truly believe this book was sent as a precautionary tale to future generations. If not, Orwell damn sure used a prohet's brain to pen this masterpeice. In a world that cares more about war, profit, and restricting civil liberties, we should be so bold as to read this and take notice. Our time as a free people is almost gone, and we will never, ever get it back.War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have decided to rewrite this review entirely, because it was not really a guide of the literary work, but rather an opinion on how totalitarism is taking over my country.If you are new to this singular book, in a way you are very fortunate. Its best to learn from the source itself the expressions such as: \\"big brother\\" and \\"Thought police\\".The book was written in 1948 and I onced heard that G.O. switched the last 2 digits to make the title for the book. Remember, WWII was ending but the totalitarian forces of the world were still operating and expanding (Stalinism and the communist revolution in China, etc).The narrative takes us to a somber future, England is part of an allied conglomarate always at war with other totalitarian conglomerates. We are told the story of a middle aged nobody (Winston) who has the courage to \\"rebell\\" in his mind and beging recording his thoughts and critisisims hiding it from the ever observing presence of the tv that controls all individuals. It is then that we learn that totalitarism is the suppression of the critical mind in favor of the collective mind that depends on the guidance of the \\"Great Leader\\", from where all truth emmanates. To explain the extent of the blindness of the masses, there is a scene occuring in the middle of a political rally as a speaker who is fiercely attacking one enemy suddenly receives the news that such enemy has now becomed an ally and that the former ally is now the enemy, and there, without loosing continuity in his speech, he decries a sabotage of thought and inmmediatly all masses start destroying all support banners they had, without questioning for a second the logic! .Our heroe here is has the rare chance to find a \\"liberation cell\\" that pretends to (what else?) finish with the status quo and let truth be known, the ideals are noble and Winston can even see the contradictions he has been living in all his life, yet he (sorry if this spoils it) pacts with the devil (the establishment) by accepting \\"all means necessary\\" to outs them.. and what amazes more, the devil is the creator of this recursive plot as a part of its research into the human mind and how to control it. It took me some time to really appreciatte the complexity of the reasoning behind the book.If you analyze the book from the perspective of the study of the control of the masses to justify a totalitarian state, then, I believe you will learn much. You can also insult me like other reviewers have, but please, take a look around, are we not seeing everywhere the same methods used on us?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I cannot count the number of times I was asked, \\"What's so special about the year 1984?\\" while I was reading the book the title of which randomly forsees that particular year. That question scared me, because this novel is so important. Beyond that, I was floored that some people had not at least heard of \\"1984\\" (which was first published in 1949). That is not a criticism of those who are guilty of this, but rather an indication of my incredulity, because the impact had on our culture by Orwell's genius, manifested in \\"1984\\", cannot be overstated. As another reviewer here noted, it is indeed true that many people reference George Orwell's prescient masterpiece, oftentimes without realizing what it is that influenced their thought or even having actually read the book.\\"1984\\" animates the collective paranoia that stems from our well-founded wariness of contemporary society's ever-encroaching governmental systems, as well as the potential dangers introduced to them by the evolution of modern technology.Furthermore, it reminds those paying attention that we must guard our psyches and intellects against the mad intentions of those who forget, or disregard, the truth that to conform for conformity's sake alone is to surrender rights to humanity's defining gift.I would suggest that you don't pick \\"1984\\" as a casual beach-read. It is riveting, but heavy and thick with relevance to current events. Don't read it after having a few drinks either, especially when you come to the book-within-a-book portion."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"First of all, a clarification is in order. George Orwell did not write this fortelling evil Republics or corrupt Democrats, as both parties would wish us to believe. It does not \\"apply\\" to today in the sense that events translate directly from the story to modern events. People too often make this mistake, and have turned this book from a chilling future into propoganda and lies. The messages, the themes, the lies-all of them can and do apply to our modern world. But Orwell wasn't saying \\"President Bush\\" or \\"John Kerry\\", or any other leader. He was saying \\"us\\"-this is where WE, the race of mankind, is headed. Read with that in mind.1984 is a misleading title, because it limits the book to that date. Rather, extend it to the future, as 1984 was when this was originally published. 1984 is a vision of a future where the government, Big Brother, rules everything. Literally. Individuals have no life save to aid Big Brother, truth is only what Big Brother says, regardless of history or facts. There is no past that cannot be changed, no event that cannot be made to disappear. This is not an uplifting book. This is not a book which will leave you thinking \\"We will rise above this\\", but instead, \\"We MUST rise above this\\", and that, I believe, was the author's intention. 1984 does not tell of one man's rise above his surroundings, but his falling into them. Too many people distort this for petty politics, and in doing so, fall into the pattern that 1984 warns us against. We twist words, create meanings, dice the novel into a form to fit our needs, but if you read 1984, that is not what this story is about. 1984 may well prove to be the strongest warning of a future that this world could so easily fall into, and its message must not be forgotten or lost. I beg you to ignore the popular trend of taking this book to support a political cause. It supports none but the cause of freedom and truth through telling of slavery and lies. The future that Orwell saw is nearer than we think, and it is only by understanding this story that it will diminish in threat. Read this book openly, without trying to pin parts of it to the modern world or to support your political party, but trying to apply the broad scope of this novel to our future. A powerful warning for all people to read and understand."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To those 37 people who rated this book with a One star, and to those 22 people who rated this book with two stars:Im the kindest and simplist words I can muster up, I am dreadfully sorry you did not approve of the book. Truely I am sorry.Orwellian's 1984 is simply a masterpiece that, while being frequently challanged for its content and it's ungraphic, unerotic sex scene, everyone should read. It tells of the protagonist, Winston, within his daily life in Oceania (the future London, England).Winston, is not unlike most people living in Oceania, he has a large television screen in his room which constantly spouts information spoon fed (and presumably processed) by the Ministry of Truth, which not only presents information, but creates the future, and changes the past to fit the glorification of their leader: Big Brother. The enormous screen is two-way, as much as you can see the man and/or woman in the broadcasting room, they can see Winston (or any other man or woman) in his daily life.Winston, is not unlike most Oceanians. He speaks English. But not the English of Shakespeare or Woolf, or of today's standards. His form of English has been chopped down to remove all possible loopholes, or Doublespeak. For instance, one may think of something as good, or ungood. Fast, or unfast. Big, or Unbig.Never: bad, slow, or small.Winston is not unlike most Oceanians, he has a job at the Ministry of Truth, (or Minitruth, just to remove loopholes once again), where he rewrites history. He receives information, such as the leader of England... I mean Oceania... being Winston Churchill... I mean Big Brother... and his sole succesful victory over the leader of the other two country-states.However, (to speed things up a bit) Winston falls in love. Love, is a forbidden thing in Oceania; people mate solely for bringing in more children. (These children are then whisked away for a sort of Secret Police/Gestapo-eske training so Big Brother can have another pair of eyes within each household. Oceania's next big attempt: to make the sexual impulse regulated)Winston and his lover soon meet for their sexual escepades away from the cameras, that are everywhere, and soon contact a small antique-shop owner who lives in the slums of Oceania for a room.The two rent the room, and unfortunately, the falling action of the story takes place there, where Winston and his lover are captured by the Thoughtpolice (The grown-up Gestapo) and are sent for brainwashing.To those who say the future would never become like this...In a local newspaper, the sewage pipeline owners were tossing around an idea of placing cameras in the septic pipes to see who, \\"Was pouring grease down their toilets.\\"Another Orwellian Innovation, while seemingly less \\"potent\\" is that of the Red Light Cameras. You do the logic.Big Brother is also invading Wal*Mart with his RF-ID chips that are used to \\"Track Inventory.\\"What happens if the Cashier coincidently \\"forgets\\" to take the chip off?Legislature has been considered that mandates a national ID card which can track where any citizen of the U.S. is at any time.Two other words: Patriot Act.However, I must say two, final things: First, I may sound like a shrill pessimist, however with the right mind, orchestrating the right, belligerant, and malignant agenda, a national catostrophy can fuel Orwellian invasions of privacy simply and unconditionally (see the reason above this paragraph.)And lastly, I take another reviewer, Mr. WiseToolz in which he reviews,\\"This book just didn't grab my attention. I simply couldn't \\"connect\\" with the characters (Winston, Julia, Syme, O'Brien and Big Brother). To me, they were all just a bunch of names and not \\"real\\" people. \\"Take away enough freedoms and instill enough mundanity, and people become, \\"just a bunch of names...\\".In closing, the book is an excellent piece of work that should be read with an open mind."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is definitely one of those classics that should be required reading for everyone. Even if you're not interested in politics, this book gets under your skin to the very fears we have about the government controlling our lives. The message Orwell is conveying is indeed relevant to modern times with the war on terror, the Patriot Act, and media biases that are a part of the national conscience. The characters come alive through the vivid language and you grow to feel sympathetic to Winston and his psychological downspiral. This book is one that keeps you interested the whole time because of the suspense and wise foresight it contains. You will end the book feeling pensive and open to discuss what you agreed or disagreed with this novel. Bottom line: read the book!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"nineteen eighty-four was definitely a book with a storyline that fit my interests. Politics, psychology, love, sex, and unexpected twists of plot make it an interesting read. As one is reading, it's almost as if the reader is stuck in the same kind of darkness and ignorance that is imposed upon the characters. Will the next page be another mundane day in the live of Winston or will there be exciting happenings as the characters defy the absolute authority of the party? The reader must feel around in the dark so to speak, and the chronological jumps only make it more unpredictable.The predominating theme of the novel is the organization known as Ingsoc, or the english socialism movement-usually referred to as \\"the party.\\" The party rules over one of the three superstates-Oceania. Oceania is constantly at war with one of the other two superstates, which are Eastasia and Eurasia. This war becomes significant later in the book as a vital contributing factor to the success of the party's absolute rule. In Oceania there are three classes. The inner party (approx. 1% of the population) is at the topmost rung of society-afforded all the luxuries one could ask for to live comfortably. They also have the privilege of being allowed to turn off the hated telescreens, through which the \\"thought police\\" constantly watch the activities of every party member. The outer party (of which Winston Smith is a member-approx. 18% of the population) are the group of people who are the most psychologically controlled. Most are assigned jobs which involve the changing of historical records and falsifying the media. They are poorly provided for and closely controlled. Anyone smart or ambitious enough to be a danger to the power of the party is eliminated, and through psychological control, even their closest friends (or more appropriately \\"comrades,\\" as the party has abolished the concept of friendship) can be made to forget that the eliminated person ever existed. The party throughout the book is even hard at work creating a new language that will drastically narrow the ability of its speakers to think. All concepts which might be considered \\"thoughcrime\\" (i.e. ideas that might threaten the party) are destroyed by means of their removal from language-no words to describe them exist, and therefore the concepts cannot be grasped. The outer party is the cornerstone of Ingsoc. Third, there are the \\"proles,\\" or proletariats. They make up the other 81% of the population. The proles are more or less free to do as they please, considered to be harmless, and happy enough to live very simple lives in blissful ignorance.Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth, which ironically is in the business of fabricating intricate lies. Through the haze and stupor created by the psychological vice imposed upon him by the party, Winston occasionally has memories that the past was somehow better before the revolution that brought the party to power. Very early on in the book he has thoughts of escaping the watchful eyes of the thought police and living more freely. This eventually leads him to create a hiding place, and to fall in love with the secretly rebellious Julia. From here, Winston's adventure as a member of the secret \\"brotherhood\\" begins.For the most part, I had a wonderful time reading this book. I had a lot of trouble putting it down at times. The detailed descriptions, deep ideological explanations and very powerful overall moods that Orwell creates not only make the story realistic, but makes you feel as if you are part of the story-you can feel the misery and quiet outrage under the party's oppression. You can taste the freshness and novelty of the freedom when Winston and Julia hide in their apartment in the prole neighborhood. The ending is rather depressing and disappointing, but getting there is definitely a fun head trip. One final word of advice-don't pick this book up with the intention of only reading for a little while...it's quite impossible to do so."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Doesn't everybody have a list in their mind of the books they would like to read during their lifetime?

When I read the slogans of Big Brother, I felt sick:War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is StrengthIn some ways, I feel like George Orwell from his 1948 perspective 'called it.' So many of the scenarios that he described are right on. He wrote this book after Stalin took power in Russia. Orwell had rejoiced at the Bolshevik Revolutions but when the reports of Stalin's brutality came out, he was upset.The first half of the book was great, but I have to warn you that the second half was extremely disturbing and depressing. I had a hard time listening (audiobook) to the last two cassettes. I did finish the book, but it was difficult.Even more than fifty years later, Orwell's words still have the power to affect the reader. '1984' is a valuable work that rings true."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Those last four words will make you CRINGE! Of course, they mean NOTHING to you if you haven't read the book. This is by far the most depressing book I've read. Stephen King's Stand can eat its heart out. A very frightening portrayal of life without privacy. Microphones in parks, surveillance mechanisms in all restaurants. Betrayal, love, hate, etc. I've read this book once, but I don't think I need to read it again, its effect was that powerful. A friend of mine also found this book depressing. Orwell does an outstanding narrative towards the end which contributes to the cringing part at the very end. I've read this book quite a while ago but its fascinating how much I remember it. This book shouldn't be ignored. Read it once, at once."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.\\" A statement in 1949 intended for 1984, and reality for us today. Reality can be your own interpretation. In reality who really controls your life? According to George Orwell's classic novel 1984 the thought police and big brother were the ones to control our lives. Big brother is a power structure that regulates not only information, but individual thought and memory.Big brother is not watching. He is singing and dancing. He is pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big brother is busy holding your attention every moment you are awake. He is making sure you are always distracted. He is making sure you are fully absorbed. He is making sure your imagination withers until it is as useful as your appendix. With everyone's imagination useless no one can be a possible threat to your world.The book speaks about control and being a unitary party instead of individuals. It speaks out about the ways of people and their hunger for world domination. I believe that this is his best book written, although his topics are all about human nature and where it takes us in life. Everyone should read this book in order to open your eyes and think for yourself rather then think like the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is often disputed as to what Eric Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, was trying to communicate through his now legendary masterpeice, 1984. Some say he was warning the world to the dangers of the Soviet Union and it's totalitarian policies. Some say he was warning governments from allowing power to be shifted over to obscure, bureaucratic oligarchies. Ultimately, I would not enforce any of the above or any other theories an anybody. It's a subjective matter, as is all. But, by the time you emerge from the world Mr. Blair creates around you, you will be certain of the worst a government is capable of. You will have cold shivers, your jaw will drop and you will sit in awe of the appauling, yet frightenly plausible, deeds the \\"Party\\" will go to in order to control the thoughts and memories of it's populace.From simply a literary standpoint, Blair proves himself a writer of the highest caliber. His artful use of syntax draws a graphic image, as well as the ambiance of the book itself. His words flow together perfectly, each one complementing the last. The poignancy of his work does not lie in fast paced action, or \\"edge-of-your-seat\\" thrills, but in total immersion into his world and a glimpse of what could be.Ultimately, this book is worth all the time in the dictionary you will have to spend in order to understand this book fully. It will change the way you look at the world and the way populations allow themselves to be governed. A vital book for anyone in our modern world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is eerie, almost prophetic. It will take more than one read though to understand it; since each time you read it, you will THINK you understand the point; however, trust me, you dont. This book is by far deeper than other dystopias such as Brave New World, The Chrysallids, and even Animal Farm. Another book i would recommend would be the Picture of Dorian Gray. All who read this have an obligation to set themselves apart from the lost and ignorant and to change the present system we have today, a system where you can only get so rich but those at the top have unlmited access to the world's wealth. This is a system which breeds human to live on the streets, daughters to dishonour thier fathers, and sons to beat their mothers. This system is wrong and cannot sustain itself. Orwel, Marx, Huxley, these are the ones who have seen the future in dreams and are afraid. They know what may come should we remain silent; so shout, scream, let yourself be heard!

I am a big fan of utopian literature, I found that this book had some deeper, darker elements that more recent novels lacked. It left the reader feeling violated and angry. Angry that today over twenty years after the looming threat of BIG BROTHER has passed we still may be heading down the wrong road. Many people say what is the point of reading a book written in the 1940's and not to mention the infamous 1984 has passed. The date is of little relevence, Orwell meant to warn his readers of a time not to soon to be discarded and not to late to be forgotten. All those individuals who say that 1984 is a waste of time either did not finish the book or are missing some basic human traits. I never am startled by books, I expect rape, murder etc. but 1984 so disturbed me that I begin to look around and see that Orwell's fiction may not be a work of fiction but in a few decades another piece of paper destroyed in the erasing of our pasts. The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I so very much detested the end. The ending is suiting its just too damn suiting. I leave with this haunting refrain that sums up the book...\\"Under the Spreading chestnut tree,I sold you and you sold me.Here lie they and here lie we,Under the spreading chestnut tree.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston lives in a world of constant survelence and secret police. Truth is what the government says, not what actually happened. According to the \\"facts\\" produced by the government, the country is getting better, but according to memory, the country is getting worse. Society has been brainwashed by fear of its own government and also by incited anger at its enemy country.1984 yields the (very) far extreme of a society that many fear some current societies are headed. Although fiction, it is fascinating to look at certain similar aspects to current societies (again, nowhere near as extreme as the book's society), and is a good book in terms of where we should keep our society from heading. Truly a great read in terms of perspective.The only downside that I took from the book was that I was so bothered by what Winston endured and especially the last 50 pages of the book. Never a regret reading it, but definitely not a \\"happy book.\\" I like my eyes wide open."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I just finished 1984 and was blown away by the final chapter and the book's conclusion. Orwell's brilliant ideas, especially those told through the object of the book (which, in 1984, is in itallics, but I can't write in italics here) The growth of The Party, from the creation of the super nations to the ideas behind the purpose of the war, all are completely and frighteningly believable. The Party, incarnated and personified in the end of the book, is one of the most horrific villains ever, especially durring the scenes between it and Orwell's personification of humanity. Although it took Orwell about a third of the book to set up the whole idea of society under the party, once he has gotten his world set up, he procedes to propel the reader through it with frightening realism and a sad sense of hopelessness.The thing that frightens me most, though, is the question of how correct Orwell might be. Is this where we are heading? While I don't think anything now could be similar to what is in the book: war continues to be an ends to achieve peace (for the most part), not an ends to keep down society, you can't be arrested for a look or thought, and you still can choose to love who you wish, sometimes I see in our society traces of a path to 1984. Perhaps you'll agree with me if you read the book, perhaps not, but I am convinced that, although 1984 has come and gone, it is the end of the path society treds."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Before I had a chance to read this book I read \\"The Giver\\" twice and watched the movie \\"Equilibrium,\\" I'm readily convinced that these ideas were spawned off the book \\"1984.\\" I started hearing about this book from numerous friends as a book they read in high school. I was amazed by the fact that I had never read the book but I think people having sex is something they would want to filter out of people's minds at such a young age.The book started off with a feeling that made you miserable which is a great way to start a book because you have a notion of curiosity that makes you eager to see if the situation gets better. Over the course of the story you delve into the horrific society that kills people for having an independant thought. A downgrade in society if you think about it. I would have never thought evolution could go backwards; however the situations in \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Equilibrium\\" seem more plausible since technology gets better as they go along.The middle of the novel you get even more fascinated by the fact that so much good starts happening and you just cheer on the characters. There is so much tension and you wonder what good will come next and you can't sleep until you finish the next page. Then you finish the book with a mouth dropped open and having strong emotions.I personally hated the ending but that is exactly what the author wants you to feel, hatred like everyone else in this book feels. Some people will applaud at the ending saying it's clever and others might be in deep awe about what just happened. I'll just say that it's one book that I'll gladly display on my shelf which is a lot considering my strict selection of books."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read this book three or four times and it never gets old, IT STILL APPLIES TODAY.

Orwell set up a lot of groundwork for the last hundred or so pages. I had to force myself to read the first two sections, but toward the end of the second section and all throughout the third, I could not put it down. Orwell had so many twists at the end of the book that made the it worth reading. He flawlessly used foreshadowing to literally make this book. All the twists, if you could pick up on the foreshadowing, wouldn't have come to you as a surprise. But since I took the foreshadowing for something different, what really occured was thrilling!I would suggest suffering through the first many pages to get to the last hundred. Set aside about an hour or two and read the last pages straight through, because it will be too hard to put it down once the plot twists occur. Overall, I truely enjoyed the book.

It illustrates the danger, alluded to by Dwight David Eisenhower, of the military industrial complex of a paranoid state running out of control. It seems ludicrous to think of the Ministry of Peace as concerning itself with matters of war until we reflect that in the US the Department of Defense (DoD) was formerly the Department of War (maybe soon the Department of Peace?). Ignorance is strength? Silly? Just look at our public school systems. Peace is War? Impossible??? Afghanistan is the longest war in US history intended to protect the homeland and give us peace and you can tell the current right wing \\"Oceania\\" is chomping at the bit to get us embroiled in Syria, Iran, or North Africa (preferably all of the above simultaneously). Slavery is freedom? No way??? Just watch the masses enthralled by the words of the right wing media not so un-remeniscent of the old news reels from Hitler's Germany. All we need to finish it off right is to have a daily two minute Hate and a Hate Week like in 1984 and we'll be good to go! Yes, Orwell saw it all coming back in 1948. He got one thing wrong though when the protagonist Winston claims the only place you can't be seen is in the dark (he never thought of infra-red cameras and satelites that can read a pack of cigarettes from earth orbit). 1984 is like reading tomorrow's newspaper today. Great piece of literature! The only fault I see is that it was advertised by Amazon as a novel when, in fact, it is a documentary."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and I'm still \\"trying\\" to read it. It's depressing and the theme is kind of old, so I'm not that enthusiast with it. I was born abroad and this was not a required reading material while I was in school. I'm just very happy that I've never lived in a place like that. Hope it gets better towards the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was excited about reading \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\". One of Orwell's two best known fictional works (the other being \\"Animal Farm\\"), this is by far more well-known and influential. However, I found \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" to be less engaging as a novel.I guess it's hard not to start off talking about the themes, which at this point are almost inseparable from its cultural influence. It's one of the defining dystopian novels, and is more or less an extension of totalitarianism that existed while Orwell was alive. I think the best way of describing this book is that it's an extension of \\"Animal Farm\\", except from the perspective of someone within the Party. In this world totalitarianism has progressed further.The world-building is, for the better part, believable. Telescreens, Newspeak, doublethink, the Ministries, the Junior Spies, etc, are all well-conceived and realistic within the context of the underlying history. And above all else, the all-encompassing nature of Big Brother looms. (Although there is an exception to this, in the proles.)This comprises a significant portion of the first part of the book. (\\"Nineteen Eighty-Four is divided into three parts.) In combination to this, there's alot of foreshadowing and set-up for later. We get exposed to the protagonist's life, his thoughts about this world, and how he tries to reconcile this with all else he knows. Basically, it's a combination of a character study and a world study. Orwell also takes the time to examine why this society is the way it is.The second part, I feel, is where the real story is. Some of the set-up in the previous part begins to be used, and we're taken through a rather compelling relationship. Looking back, I have some slight issues with believability, but I don't think these hold. At the end we get a big slab of infodumping via the protagonist reading several chapters of a book. This takes up 25-30 pages; the entire part is 100 pages. While this gives background into the history of the world, and I suppose also some of Orwell's personal thoughts, and was also informative, I don't think the length of it was warranted. For me, it detracted from the story at hand.The third and final part was great in some places and flat in others. At times it runs into what is almost a polemic, often with large chunks of flat dialogue. Think of the metaphorical head and sledgehammer. And while other parts were quite engaging and powerful, they were less so because of these large divergences. As with the reading of the book in part II, it's far too long and blunt for my taste. It takes what's already implied, or what would better be expressed through implication, and brings it out into the open. I can't help but compare it to \\"Animal Farm\\", and the restraint Orwell showed there; \\"Animal Farm\\" comes out on top.Orwell's writing is superb, as ever. As in everything else he's done, the writing is clear and precise, and his thoughts are deep, complex and detailed. He describes things in a plain, understated way. However, I still feel that the large sections where Orwell brings everything into the open diminish the rest of the story. The continuous critique of totalitarianism is overwhelming, and as such, in my opinion, undermines the remaining story. Alot of the moments in the book, particularly the last chapter, had the potential to be really powerful, but because this story wasn't the focus of the narrative they end up being far less moving.Basically, if you want to read a treatise against totalitarianism, this book is for you. Personally, I wanted a greater focus on the story that was set-up and then begun in part II. The story being told isn't bad, but it gets lost in the long, unsubtle diversions. If you disagree, I would love to discuss the book in the comments section.3/5"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think this book is probably one of the most important social commentaries that one can read to this day.To one degree or another, any and all forms of government make use of the kind of tools of cohersion and disinformation described in the gloomiest parts of the book. The book however, centers around the description of what the writer perceives to be the ultimate destiny for any nation that embraces communism. Orwell himself, believed in the ideals that even in its infancy -Socialism- \\"seem\\" so sublime in theory, but ultimately and inevitably end in the total control of information, and abolition of the personal rights of the people, as well as the distruction of individuality in all of its forms. After having fought and bled in battlefields for the said \\"ideals\\", he had a rude awakening from his dream, and had to face the terrible reality of living in such a system, in the soviet union.It is after this crude realization of his blunder, that Orwell pens down this 'must read', devastating slap of the mind.I believe this book is particularly appropriate for the times we live in, when many inAmerica, including some of the most popular politicians, are beginning to flirt with socialism.Weather you take this piece of literarure as a cautionary tale, or simply a deep and engaging piece of reality based fiction, this will surely be one of the most memorable books you ever read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are spoilers in my review.Orwell's 1984 is essential reading for any educated American citizen. The brilliance of this work, and the reason that it remains relevant to this day, is that the depictions of the dystopian London seem ridiculous at first, but are actually rehashings of many government practices found State-controlled countries. These depictions contain enough truth in them for us to reflect upon the practices found in our own governments with a cynical eye. In the twenty-first century, the issue of the state asserting its power into personal facets of our lives is more relevant than perhaps thirty years ago. This book has not become dated in the last sixty years, and because its depictions of oppressive state practices have become literary tropes in of themselves, this book will not become dated for quite some time.However, the brilliance of this book lies in the first two chapters. The detailed deceptions of the inner working of the government and the rebellion via love and human interaction end there. The third and last chapter is the weakest. The third chapter acts as a logical extension to the first two. Big Brother first enters your home, and then your love. The last thing left is for him to enter your mind. The problem is that the first two chapters have counterparts (at least in influence) to real life. When you push something to its logical extreme, you always run the risk of losing the feeling of relevancy that comes with sticking to real world analogies. I can't help but feel that the third chapter had somehow left planet earth and was more concerned about the logical extremes that Big Brother would force, rather than exploring life under Big Brother's regime. The first two chapters had just enough truth for us to question the practices of our own government. The last chapter seems to have lost that brilliance and was more focused on giving us an old science-fiction-inspired view of the government controlling our minds."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"C,mon, why do you think it's a classic?I will say this, I was glad to have finally read it.

Granted, it's very important that they SHOULD read it, especially at such a young age when there is a chance they can actually grow up to change the world. But let's face it: kids don't care. And they especially don't care about the subject matter when the school cirriculum FORCES them to care. No, no, making kids study this book is a disservice to the book. They simply do not have the life experience behind them to relate to the profundity or symbolism of it.I read this book in the '90s, when I was in high school, and hated it. HATED it. I thought it was sci-fi crap. And had it not been for 9/11 several years later, I likely would never have touched this book again. But in a post-9/11 world, reading this book was literally like reading the newspaper, with Bin Laden personifying O'Brien and Afghanistan and Iraq taking on the roles of Eastasia and Eurasia. 1984 is not a prophecy on the future; it is a report on the past. History simply repeated itself, and will again.9/11 was my generation's Kennedy Assassination in that it was the event that instilled generation-wide doubt in its government. We were idealistic before then. And because of that idealism, 1984 remained just another book amidst a pile of books in my locker I \\"had\\" to read so that I could get my credits, graduate and get the hell out of school.

A smidgen of doubt about things like the whitish dust on Smith's diary.Now that I am older and have experienced the world, traveled a bit, and have a wider perspective, I can see certain parallels in our own nation that match certain things in the book.How certain recent things done in the last decade can eventually make our nation into something similar to what is described in the book.I envy the teens of today because they see things in their youth that my peers and I could not fathom at that age.But growing up in an impoverished ghetto does not leave much room for thinking. sort of like the 'proles' in the story.I'd recommend this book to anyone.Cheers."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Bought this book as a replacement.

In this world, freedom of expression is a moot point, since freedom of thought has already been eliminated -- officials in a mysterious government organization known only as \\"The Party\\" have reduced the language of society to an abbreviated dialogue called Newspeak, which decimates the vocabulary of the people, and makes the communication, expression, or formation of many ideas impossible. Using tactics of artificial wars and group hate sessions to keep the public united, the Party has perfected this complete censorship of society to an art -- even the news is processed by the Party, allowing them to change the past, present, and future as needed with a few taps on the keyboard. Records are meaningless unless they come from Party hands, and Party members are free to revise records as needed.The nightmare that Orwell presents is a world in which there is no truth to be found, because there is no subjective view allowed to the individual.His vision is strengthened in impact by his particularly strong writing and descriptive style -- one particular scene focusing on mental torture (using rats!), and the use of fear as a persuasive mechanism, is among the most disturbing I have ever read, and will ever read. If I enjoyed this novel, it was only in the most morbid, shivering, appreciative sense, but I wouldn't have missed it for the world, all the same.This book, in my mind, far surpasses the supposedly comparable Brave New World."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Please don't think me arrogant, but I've always thought of myself as a rather capable reviewer of the modern novel. I've read just about every kind of book I can think of(Orwell to Hemingway-London to Stevenson-King to Koontz- and yes, even those trashy little pulp novels with stories of witches and heroes)and have enjoyed in some manner or another almost every one. But, fellow readers, if I was forced to choose a single book, just one to promote to those people eager to turn pages, it would be George Orwell's classic story of Oceania. &quot;1984&quot; From its first paragraphs to the final four words, this book grabs the reader's attention and just refuses to let go. Orwell's story deals with a man named Winston, an employee at Oceania's Ministry of Truth, who is responsible for the almost daily altering and destruction of historical documents and photographs in an effort to serve the political interests of a group known simply as &quot;the Party.&quot; With such activities as &quot;Hate Week&quot; and public slogans like &quot;War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength&quot; the forementioned party keeps to its philosophy of Totalitarianism with a firm and painful grip. And I won't forget to mention the leader of it all, a pseudo-religious figure named Big Brother who never fails to rid Oceania of its more troublesome citizens with the help of the infamous &quot;Thought Police,&quot; an elite and cruel gestapo-like police force charged with the task of making those citizens of Oceania brave or foolish enough to speak ill of &quot;the Party's&quot; policies or even look unsatisfied at home(their is human as well as mechanical surveillance everywhere)disappear in a discrete and timely manner. &quot;1984&quot; seems more like a hint, a prediction if you will, of a future disturbingly possible(it was written in 1949). The book moves at a quick pace and even the most casual reader would have little trouble with the language. Don't miss this one folks. It's definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two is four.\\"To say 1984 is an amazing and powerful novel is the understatement of the century. Never have I ever read a book so powerful and meaningful. 1984 is a book that transcends time because 1984 will always be pertinent. Orwell created a timeless tale about power, freedom, and social classes. No review I could ever write could do 1984 justice but I shall try.1984 is a dystopian novel complete with action, romance, and politics. I'll be honest here. Normally I don't read serious literature and I hate politics. Reading 1984 was me metaphorically \\"putting on my big boy pants\\" , it showed how my reading taste matured. Enough about me, this is a review not the Scott show!The plot moves at such a brisk pace and you'll be glued to your seat. Even if you hate politics like my teenage self you will love 1984. Orwell creates political situations that will allure even the most unwilling readers. There are few dull moments in 1984, the majority of whom take place in \\"the book\\".No 1984 review could ever be complete without mentioning Oceania. Oceania is the totalitarian society in which 1984 takes place and I know where I'm not going on vacation. Oceania makes Panem look like a walk in the park and it is far more horrible than I expected. No sane person could go live there without going insane because it's a living hell. Orwell really created the perfect hell-hole for his masterpiece and it's mindblowing.I really loved how Orwell created his own language \\"Newspeak\\" for 1984. Newspeak added an interesting feel to the novel because it further the novel's themes and motifs. I really wonder if aficionados of 1984 speak Newspeak like trekkies speak Klingon and LOTR fans speak Elvish. Orwell definitely spent a lot of time coming up with Newspeak and I do appreciate his efforts.1984 is a haunting novel that once you read it, it will stay with you forever. I won't ever be able to forget the horrifying Part III because how powerful and moving it was. 1984 is a novel that will make you question yourself and society. The best kind of books make you think even after you finish and such is the case with Orwell's masterpiece. The 3rd person narration instead of hindering the pacing, it enhances it by adding more emotional depth to the book.1984 is a novel that will give you new perspectives on people, society, and law. Is Ignorance really bliss? Is lying okay if it's for the greater good? Is the needs of the many more important than the needs of the few? I can tell why 1984 is considered classic literature and I hope it continues to be read for it's important messages. Even if 1984 doesn't seem like your thing, I'd still recommend giving it a shot. 1984 has given me a reason to pick up Animal Farm and I hope I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle.

I will underline that this is one of the most important books I have ever read. It taught me the value of freedom, its pricelessness in fact.The book is written very well, fluent prose and gripping plot, but that is not its main value. The value is its moral about democracy, which we may take for granted now but is to be nourished all the time. The book, of course, was written in the late forties, at the height of Stalinism, so it is obvious it refers to that scenario, at the peak of the Cold War. But too many people seem to forget the value of democracy today, in the information age.One could argue that Orwell was wrong about the state controlling people through technology, in fact internet has provided all of us with tremendous power of horizontal communication that governments have a hard time controlling. But the game is an ongoing one... not yet over! I think this book should be taught in schools."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith, the main character in \\"1984,\\" says that \\"the best books are the ones that tell you what you already know.\\" I had this very sensation as I read George Orwell's classic novel. Orwell speaks with a prophetic tone from the year 1949, with many of his comments on totalitarianism proving true during the Cold War and popping up under new guises in recent years.\\"1984\\" tells the story of Winston Smith, a man employed by Big Brother. His job is to correct and effectively erase bits of history that don't line up with Big Brother, the Thought Police, and \\"doublespeak.\\" Through this regime, the masses are controlled on all fronts, emotionally, intellectually, physically, even spiritually and sexually. Orwell takes us into this colorless world a step at a time, leading up to the horrifying realities of what happens to those who oppose Big Brother. Along the way, he lets Winston find love with Julia, but even they recognize that their love cannot be pure. He lets the two of them expand their revolutionary wings. And he lets them face the consequences.Orwell doesn't tell a tight, fast-paced story, at least not by modern standards. He is more interested in communicating ideas. But he does allow us to care for his characters. He gives us just enough time to connect with them, even though they themselves are already disconnected on many levels. They join the Brotherhood, a resistance movement, and in doing so get their hands on a book detailing the realities of Big Brother. Although \\"1984\\" is a rambling, sometimes loosely cobbled story, it is a fascinating manifesto on the dangers of governmental control and the age-old struggle of the High, the Middle, and the Low. It's amazing of accurate some of Orwell's observations still prove to be, but as Big Brother's slogan goes: Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\" And: \\"The heresy of heresies was common sense.\\" Or how about this? \\"Stupidity was as important as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.\\"Personally, I am more frightened by the less totalitarian, more consumerism-driven ideas of Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" but \\"1984\\" is a classic for good reason, and it casts its shadow over many stories to come, including \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"Minority Report.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is depressing. Very depressing. It is also a breathtakingly awesome work, and just as spellbinding some 60 years after it was first published. Despite the heavy subject matter, it's suprisingly easy to read. It is one of the truly essential classics of modern literature.Winston Smith, Orwell's protagonist, was probably the first \\"conspiracy theorist.\\" He knows Big Brother and the system are wrong, but is powerless to fight alone. When he breaks the taboo against writing, and states in his forbidden journal, \\"I know who, I know how, but I don't know why,\\" he is speaking for generations of whistleblowers and conspiracy theorists to come.So many common expressions were derived from \\"1984\\": Big Brother, the Thought Police, newspeak, doublethink, pidgeon holed, thought crime, among others. To those on the extremes of both the left and right wings of the political spectrum, Orwell's bleak and miserable forecast of the future was all too accurate. Doublethink, for instance, is an essential feature of modern establishment thinking. Reagan's deadly missile is named the \\"Peace Keeper.\\" Born again fundamentalists simultaneously hold that all non-born againers (including Jews) are doomed to Hell, but blindly support everything Israel does. Most polls suggest a large majority of people disbelieve the official version of the JFK assassination, but the same numbers are also against a new investigation. Maddening examples of doublethink are everywhere.If Orwell was alive today, he'd undoubtedly be on the outer fringes of political thought, alongside the \\"nut jobs\\" and \\"tin foilers\\" that the mainstream media and politicians love to disparage. He would probably be astounded at the continuing popularity of his nightmarish novel. He'd be even more baffled at how readers have consistently enjoyed it, recognized it for the brilliant work it is, and yet have appeared not to notice how similar to Oceania our present day society is."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell was prescient. \\"1984\\" might not have happened totally by 1984, but it crept up on us over time. And it's still happening."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is truly amazing to look at the fantastic writing minds of our grandparents' time. Post-WWII fever hung over the population and many were clueless, or even fearful for not knowing what lie before them. And, unlike many, George Orwell was a man who was not afraid to show what he interpreted as a possible future for not only our country, but the entire world.In his novel, 1984, Orwell crafted a post-apocalyptic world in which the planet's powers had been divided into three portions; Oceania, which consisted of the Americas, Eurasia, comprised continental Europe and northern Asia, and Eastasia, which, as its title implies, covered most of the eastern Asian continent.The story follows the life of a middle aged man named Winston Smith, another Drone of Eurasia's Main power, The conspicuous Party, whose god-like leader and people-worshiped Big Brother, control everyday life.Except for the homes the proles, who are sort of like peasants, every room is garmented with a Telescreen, a sort of T.V. which can never be turned off or muted. Unfortunately, it can also see and hear everything going on in the room.Most standard crime has been wiped out due to massive military force, and so the party, in its never ending search for power, falls upon people with psychic powers to detect felonous thoughts in people. These psychics are known as the thought police, and constantly track down and \\"delete\\" people who are convicted of crimethink (a word from Eurasia's new national language, called Newspeak).Our \\"hero\\", Winston's job is to help the party erase any evidence of their saying or doing anything wrong, to control their people's minds andopinions of the party. Ultimately, they are \\"Censoring the past\\". One day the country could be at war with Eastasia, the next, Eurasia, and the entire populace would accept that they had always been at war with Eurasia, and any thoughts otherwise was crimethink.Winston, unhappy with this life and detesting the party, secretly purchases a pen and diary, the use of both have been outlawed for some time. This is simply the beginning in a long string of rebellion, love, and unanswered questions that keep this book in your mind whenever you are not reading it.This is one of the most fantastic sci-fi novel experiences I have ever had, and while particular sections of the book can drag on for far too long, the character depth and plot more than makes up for it. Anyone who wishes to deny this book as a classic great has not the brains to understand it, and therefore cannot accurately judge its prowess."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Mindlessly mechanical, very few things move her emotionally. \\"Things will be all right for future generations,\\" she tells my father. She has no need for family history, her own or mine. She fears creativity until recently. My mother, a misanthrope who grew up under communist China's educational system, even after residing in the States for more than twenty-five years, cannot seem to snap out of her past \\"education\\" by the communists. In my memory, she seems to hold little joy in her life. What a novel 1984 is; it sheds light on my questions: \\"Who is my mother?\\" and \\"What is my mother?\\" In a sense, \\"Chapter One\\" of the Book rings a personal truth to my upbringing, so many things that my mother said to me about the world, during my childhood, puzzled me. Whatever psychological lessons my mother went through during her \\"education,\\" I doubt she'd ever share it with me. Nonetheless, I would not be surprised if she received training in doubletalk, doublethink and the indoctrination \\"freedom is slavery.\\" It was very easy, almost too easy, for me to project myself into the novel, because it felt so personal and real.So it was easy for me to imagine myself living in a Totalitarian society, but it would be too much of a nightmare, for I already have a slight taste of it in my childhood. Unknowingly, in the past few years, I have worked in my small ways to strengthen my knowledge and belief in a democratic society, may it be researching history, studying the structure of mainstream media, or becoming more aware and decoding the means of deception and misinformation, which is so pertinent to understand the actions of current Bush administration.Even though the main character, Winston Smith, in 1984 eventually learned to love the Big Brother after forty years, I am still optimistic about meeting my responsibility as a US citizen, participating in quasi-democracy and reading once more 1984 as a novel, not a history book. But, if it ever becomes truly historical in content, by then, 1984 would have been either re-written or George Orwell vaporized out of existence."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book really gets you thinking. People should not call this book a fear of communism, it is based in fear of fascism. Orwell also wrote Animal Farm which was more a critique of communism. Anyway, the book is about a guy named Winston Smith who is in 1984. There are only 3 world super powers who are continuously at war with each other. The government rules the people and controls their minds by creating extreme hatred and fear. Any thoughts differing from the party is a crime and even facial expressions that are too suspicious could mean you disappear. I think everyone knows the basis of the book but the story line was not all what I thought it would be. There was a love-story. The love-story struck me as somewhat reminiscent of classic romanticism - a perfect private love which its test is to survive the outside world and in this case Big Brother. You'll have to see how the love-story turns out. A sign of a good book for me is one that is still bothering me days later and this one will probably bother me for years to come. The book doesn't have too much action but rather is written for each piece and idea presented to be thought-provoking. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is \\"correcting\\" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary. He is a drone in the machine that is the Party, the ruling power of Oceania. Every thought, movement, and gesture is watched through telescreens by a policing force called the Thought Police. Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library. Orwell's satire has withstood the test of time, and has inspired a countless number of books and films. A classic in every sense."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Simply put, 1984 is a masterpiece of satire. It's philosophical, well-written, layered and its message resonates long after reading it. The plot you probably know already but just in case, the modern day world has descended into a totalitarian state, ruled by a near-deified leader named Big Brother. The citizens of this nation live in complete submission to this dictatorship, where even an errant thought can mean torture and death.The issues explored in this text range from love and companionship to more far-reaching questions such as the true needs and desires of humanity. What do we crave more: equality, justice and the pursuit of happiness or just unbridled power and security? The world of 1984 is unveiled through Winston Smith in his attempt to uncover not just the hows of his existence, but the whys. Allusions to Stalin and the U.S.S.R. abound, some more subtle than others. There is enough material present to keep one pondering the ultimate meaning of this book long after you put it down. It is truly one of the ultimate literary accomplishments of the 20th Century.Sadly, perhaps the most widespread contribution of 1984 comes in the form of cliched, sophomoric analogies to the in-power political party of America. I'll say this: civilization comes with advantages and disadvantages. It's a matter of degree, and political correctness is the closest we have to thought crime. If all you can take from this book is ammunition to rip Bush, you've missed one great debate on human desire and the nature of reality."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is great- but it's not like today- thank god- and maybe because it was read, accepted and things were altered around that kind of future- I have to say to grasp such inventive thought for the 1940's this book is worth the marvel of that alone- it deserves the term classic- I have to mention the book Utopian Reality- now that's a story where I would want at least half of it to come true- Reading 1984 and seeing how it must have been far fetched for it's time- it has given me some faith that maybe Utopian Reality is onto something- Read this and Utopian Reality- if you haven't read it yet.-It'll leave you amazed--"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 is one of the true masterpieces of the 20th century. It presents a dark world where all individuality suffers under the reign of Big Brother. Orwell had a prophetic gift for seeing how the truth suffers from power, and how everything, including language, is cynically manipulated to suit an agenda. In an age of brutal tyrants, ceaseless propaganda, shameless spin control, revisionary legacy tours, and mass media news cycles, this novel deserves new review. A profound book, and a must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Step into a time not too far into the future-a time of hatred, lies, pain, conformity, and secrets. Let this new and horrifying reality encompass and draw in your imagination. This is no ordinary story. There are no heroes, no friends, or family. Only power, enemies, and fading hope exist. War is a continuous part of life. It never ends and never changes. The past can, even, be changed or erased. They call it a perfect world. \\"It's never been this good,\\" they say. No one objects. No one ever rebels, or at least, those that do are never heard of again. They just disappear. They are wiped out of existence and forgotten. Don't dare think of rebellion, for eyes and ears are always watching and listening. They are waiting for you to make a mistake and give yourself away. The smallest blink of an eye or twitch of a muscle could make you a suspect of a thought crime. Yet, there are rumors of a group of rebels that still fight back. Is it only false hope, or do they really exist? There is no way of knowing. No one can be certain of anything here. Just do and believe what you are told. It is the only way to stay alive.This depiction of the future is revealed in George Orwell's shocking novel, 1984. The book is about an ordinary man named Winston Smith who is lost in the twisted world in which he lives. Nothing is extraordinary about him. He follows the rules and never questions his instructions. Yet, something inside him begins to stir. Deep within the hollows of his mind, it awakes. It haunts his every move, thought, and dream. The yearnings become too much for him, and he can no longer ignore them. Determination, soon, overcomes fear, and he decides to pursue the insane desires. However, one cannot forget that there are always sacrifices to be made in return for decisions. The question is whether or not you are willing to make them. This is what Winston must face. Will he discover what is calling him, or will he turn away in fear? Will he return to the conformity, hatred, and lies of the world? Well, that is for you to discover.Orwell's amazing novel is thought-provoking and terrifying. This book is definitely worth your time. From the very first word to the very last words of the book, your imagination is captured and inspired. Powerful imagery and symbols give unmistakable meaning to the story.

Nobody really knows what is going on in Oceania, except those in the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;, but do they even know?Winston Smith is living in this time. He vaguely remembers a time before this, but goes on with the present world just the same. His monotonous life of work for &quot;the Party&quot; is changed when two unlikely events occur. He buys a forbidden diary, and he falls in love. His life soon spirals out of his control at the hands of Big Brother, and he soon discovers what it is all about.This book was required reading for English class. I started it with slight optimism based on what I heard it was about. I also was anticipating a less than pleasing novel, since we previously read Lord of the Flies and Catcher in the Rye, both of which I was very displeased. My doubts soon disappeared, as I became mesmerized with George Orwell's novel. It was so wonderfully written that I could barely take my eyes off of it (much to the annoyance of several of my teachers). Even though I had to reread the last page a few times, the message therein was powerful. This book is definitely one of my favorites that I have read in school, and maybe my life.

It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm.

(Of course thank goodness 1984 wasnt really like that)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was not a book, it was an experience. Possibly one of the most thought provoking and intriguing books I have ever read, 1984 tells a tale of a &quot;future&quot; as Orwell envisioned it in 1949. Although 1984 is long gone, Orwell's tale is still as haunting as ever. It tells of a totalitarian society, where Big Brother is constantly watching every single move Party members make through a device called a telescreen, and it is a crime to even THINK a thought that is anti-party. The party controls everything. If a person were to so much as LOOK discontented with a party decision, they would be tortured until they loved big brother.Which brings us to Winston, the main character in the book. He is quite obviously discontented with the party. He takes many risks, such as getting involved in a love affair, writing a diary where he recorded &quot;Down with big brother&quot;, and getting involved with an underground brotherhood. However, he does this in such a blatant way, that he is almost setting himself up to be caught. He yearns to be killed for his political heresy. Which makes the ending all the more ironic.This book is truly one of the most interesting reads. Orwell's novel is very rightly called a classic. This timeless masterpiece will always serve as a warning to the dangers of a totalitarian state, and if not that, just to the upholding of the importance of free thought and speech."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The 'big brother' world of 1984 as imagined by George Orwell has only become more frightening with the passage of time. The Patriot Act, Guantanamo Bay, and the erosion of privacy in the last 10 years have all smacked of totalitarianism of the ilk presented in this science fiction classic. It's not very hard to foresee the logical conclusions of sacrificing freedom for safety. Benjamin Franklin said it best:\\"Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.\\"Politics aside, this is a book that has aged gracefully thanks to its excellent prose and themes that are as salient today as they were post WWII. This is a novel that still stands as one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. Should be required reading in High Schools everywhere."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The views expressed in the book 1984 are very unique and yet still relate to today. The story shown in the book accurately portrays the needs of the people and how they will never be met in the face of an oppressive government. It paints a clear yet disturbing picture that must be experienced. Very good read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Often cited by many as a central text in the fashion of twentieth-century dystopias, 1984 remains a classic in spite of its inextricable connection to Soviet-style communism. While the work does not have the sociological poignancy of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, 1984 does remain a telling oracle of the psychological tendencies which could destroy the human soul even in the post-Soviet world. While the text only cursorily treats the rise of the zeitgeist, one can easily glean several dangers which are oracularly pronounced by the narrative.First of all (and most obviously), there is the danger of a lack of human questioning which, given enough coaxing and time, can render man nearly impervious to the spirit of questioning which is necessary to prevent the enslavement of man. While this condition is basically taken a priori by Orwell as a setting for his work, this is the closest point of contact between 1984 Bradbury's aforementioned work. Additionally, the psychological ramifications of breaking free from such thralldom take two distinct paths, that of hope for change (even if that becomes somewhat mitigated into the hope for change in an indistinct future) and one of self-indulgence in the midst of an unchangeable zeitgeist. These, coupled with the final realization of hope which is found (albeit meekly) in the lower, ignored (and therefore free) class, are the true content of 1984.While the text is markedly tied to the state of affairs found in a state of established Soviet-style communism, it also narrates the psychological situations (and outer-methods of psychological suppression and control) which still remain poignant to a Western society which is on the brink of destroying its own notion of liberty. For this reason, I can easily overcome the misgivings which I have for the text's nearly direct connection to already-dead Soviet Union. The message does indeed exist beyond that historical fact and therefore comes with my personal recommendation."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Not too long ago, I read an author's account of his trip to North Korea. While there he gave a copy of 1984 to a citizen he was temporarily working with. This North Korean worker took it home to read and then hurriedly returned it the next day. A book like that could get him killed, just like 'the book' in 1984 could do the same to the main character, Winston.It doesn't take much time for a society to fall into a dictatorship or a communist regime. We've seen this happen throughout history, even to once democratic societies. 1984 is a fitting read for our time. It is a warning to all free societies; this could happen to you! It is very easy and disconcerting, to see the similarities in Winston's 'Big Brother' and our own governments. Big Brother has 'Newspeak'. We have 'Political Correctness'. Big Brother has 'Doublethink' and we have conflicting thoughts that are upheld as well; Racism is bad: we cannot discriminate in hiring employees on the basis of their skin color. Racism is good: we should discriminate in hiring employees on the basis of their skin color (racial hiring quotas active in the USA now: Hiring dark-skinned folks is good. Hiring light skinned-folks is bad). There are too many examples of current Newspeak and Doublethink to list in this review. Also there's 'Big Brother'. In the UK there are surveillance cameras popping up everywhere. On these cameras are speakers that the observer can blast orders through 'Stop riding your bike on the sidewalk!' is just one camera-rebuke that I heard about from a UK paper. This parallels with the telescreens in Winston's world which blast rebukes at the slightest offenses 'Sit on the bench! Hands in your lap! No talking!' and etc... Is this really a better world to live in? What gives the man or lady behind the camera the right to bark orders at the man minding his own business on the street? These questions and much more will surface as you read this intellectually stimulating book.In conclusion, I believe '1984' is a must-read for everyone. However, there are some sleazy moments in this book which I found unnecessary to the book's message. Because of this I believe this book wouldn't be appropriate for anyone under the age of 16 (this also depends on the maturity level of the 16 year old). Also, the message of '1984' would probably fly right over the head of a child; one must have a decent understanding of history before reading it. Therefore, I do not recommend this classic for children, but instead for mature teens and up."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Although 1984 has come and gone, this book is still just as plausible and important as ever, if not more so. Orwell writes about a future British police state in which Big Brother (the government) is always watching your every move. Winston, the main character, innocently tries to learn the truth behind his government's lies only to find that he might have been better off remaining ignorant. What's particularly disquieting about this book is that we still see aspects of this dystopian society appearing in our world today. As technology improves, government and businesses have more and more opportunities to monitor what people are thinking and doing. After reading this book, you can't help but question anything said by the government. This is absolutely my favorite book, the best of science fiction and a classic as well."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book in high school in 1974.

That's how much I hated this book. Never has a story angered me so much. Never have I felt so livid towards a set of characters. Never have I felt so utterly depressed, hopeless, and betrayed. All of this, of course, can only mean one thing. It's the greatest book I have ever read in my life. The truths are so beautifully structured that it brings one to tears. There's no doubt that Mr. Orwell could have been the most miserably, bitter, and lonely SOB to ever walk the face of the Earth. No, much of this book did in fact turn out to be fiction, but I take little comfort in that. There's still just enough truth in it about the human condition to make me want to step into the bathroom and slit my wrists.Yes ... oh yes! EVERYBODY NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK. This is what we are folks. This is human nature. It may not have happened yet, but the race is young. How much time do we have? Another hundred ... two hundred years? Our only hope, I think, is that maybe a huge asteroid will hit the earth and destroy the entire planet before the year 2050.

If they say that 2+2=5 then he must believe it even knowing it is not true, this action of forced acceptance is called doublethink- the idea that you can hold two seemingly apposing concepts and accept both as true.Winston does not truly believe The Party and begins to work against it under the radar even while knowing he is bound to fail. As the story progresses he befriends a young woman named Julia and together they attempt to do the party harm through their own mini rebellion.Winston and Julia are believable though not lovable. I don't think Orwell wanted them to be lovable so he could emphasize how The Party sucked the humanness and lovability out of its subjects.The story was incredibly well written. It was simple to understand, even though Winston and Julia's situation was far from simple.This would be a good book for anyone from fourteen up. This was a great book that deserves it many awards.*This review is written by my son- 14 years old"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is the greatest political novel of the Twentieth Century. Period.No other political novel in the last one hundred years has come close to having the impact and insights of this novel. The book introduced terms into the language that are still current usage, primarily the term \\"Big Brother\\" and the phrase \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\"Orwell's description of the deliberate corruption of language by the Inner Party in his nightmare world, the concept that the shrinkage of language could be deliberately used to narrow the range of human thought, is reflected in today's stunted and idiotic American political discourse.The use of language by an all-powerful government to hide the truth and create a false reality in the world of 1984 resonates today in the use of terms designed not to illuminate, but obscure. Atomic bombs are \\"special weapons,\\" civilians killed in air strikes are \\"collateral damage,\\" and illegal invasions of other nations are \\"preventive interventions.\\"But it is not just the insights Orwell had on the misuse of language, the abuse of surveillance technology (technology available today which he would have been scarcely able to imagine), and the power games of the great Twentieth Century superpowers (e.g., the \\"China card\\" played by the United States as between the Soviets and the Chinese), it is the sheer personalized terror of the dystopian world he created which gives his book power.As a personal note, I first read this novel when I was seventeen years old, a senior in high school, and I was shaken to my core by Orwell's frightenting vision. I have reread the book every three years, because I can always find another insight in it that applies to the current world.There are other great political novels of the Twentieth Century, for example, I would rank Arthur Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon\\" as very close to (and in some ways similiar to) Orwell's great work. But no other political novel of the Twentieth Century has come anywhere near the insight, the impact, and the influence of the novel which Orwell first titled \\"The Last Man in Europe.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \\"Ministry of Love\\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston SmithNineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston Smith"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you haven't read this superb novel you should, if you already have, you should read it again. There is much prescience in this book and in many ways it's more poignant today, than it was when it's first edition was immediately censored upon publication in 1949. Orwell writes with nourishing intensity rarely ever seen in other writers and his sentences are pregnant with meaning and depth. Orwell creates a believable dystopian world with pervasive micro video cameras and giant flat screen tv's that reminds us of the post 9-11 world we live in today, where there is little privacy and extensive spying on the citizenry by the government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Along withAnimal Farm, 1984 is probably George Orwell's best known work (although his essays deserve a wide readership and in my view represent some of his best writing) and, both being satires of totalitarianism, said much about the state of the world and intellectual climate of the 1940's. If the testimony of readers subject to totalitarian regimes (in particular Eastern European communist regimes) is any guide, 1984 does a superlative job of illustrating the mental atmosphere of daily life in such a state. Perhaps a far greater insight, however, is Orwell's description of an Inner Party that is obsessed by enforcing orthodoxy in not only word and deed, but thought - to the extent that the individuals' ability for critical, independent thought (even if never openly expressed) is extinguished. Not only is this the tendency of most modern-day despotism (whether theological, ideological or an even less sophisticated ethnic/racial nationalism), but the tendency to declare unpalatable opinions 'thoughtcrime' is one that even those of us with more benign worldviews must be on guard against.In itself, the story of '1984' isn't particularly remarkable, but the oppressive atmosphere it creates together with the warning it provides for modern day readers who may occasionally fail to recognise just how important freedom of thought really is makes it absolutely invaluable in understanding the history and politics of the last hundred years. Recommended in the strongest possible terms."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Overall, the book was pretty good. It got a little slow when the main character was reading the rebel's book (went on and on about Big Brother's \\"why\\"). Either way, it is worth reading once."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book was prophetic in many ways.

Theseare the three slogans that Winston Smith hears every day. When I first read this book 35 years ago, the threat of such a freedomless world seemed impossible to me. After all...we are not Russia. Today, the words of the book are dangerously true. WAR IS PEACE. Have we not started a preemptive war against another country for the ostensible purpose of peace? IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. Don't some of our public schools and libraries censor books or resist the teaching of contemporary biology? What about the THOUGHT POLICE. Today in America, an individual can be convicted by introducting into evidence information that he or she reviewed from his computer in the privacy of his home. The books we read, the videos we rent, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive are all easily accessible by lw enforcement agencies.

It holds many parallels to the real world. And for some of the other reviewers who said it was boring, Orwell is a terrible writer, and its not at all realistic... Its not supposed to be realistic, its supposed to be an insight into the human mind. Its not boring if you understand it, if you are too ignorant to get it, then of course its boring, I'm sorry your teacher MADE you read it, I'm sure youll be quite content with Dr. Seuss. And as for the comment about Orwells ability to write, you aren't allowed to talk, I had a hard time making out your review it was so badly written.If you are insterested in the government as well as psychology, I advise you to read this."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I decided to re-read this book, since I can't really remember reading it in High School. I'd seen the move years ago, and barely remember it. However, the notion of \\"1984\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" are such colloquialisms, it feels like this book has been engrained in our culture somehow (which is ironically weird). Anyway, I enjoyed the book to a degree, but it now seems way over done for this day and age. I can see how this book would have helped spurn on 50's era McCarthy-ism anti-socialism. The writing style is excellent, and the main character, Winston, is very well done. He is completely believable, even if the setting and the premise of the book are way out there. Beyond that, everything in the book is just so over the top, it's hard to take seriously. The author does make a good point, which is something I didn't expect from this book. The idea that powerful people would occupy power, and construct a societal system which would allow them to stay in power, strictly for the purpose of power, is very profound. I remember thinking long ago how ridiculous it was that we could have video cameras and microphones all over the world, and some kind of network to allow monitoring of everything. Today we purchase devices from Google, Samsung, Motorola, and Apple with just such a capability, all of which are hooked into a world wide network where Google, Amazon, and others electronically analyze every bit of internet data they can get. I'm not into conspiracy theory, but I find it ironic that private industry seems to be moving in a similar direction that the INSOC government went in 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As a read, it rates quite well, until you come to the stodgy pages of the Goldstein book, supposed to reveal so much (more on this later). But now let's consider the reader who thinks as well.I find that a lot of people simply don't read this book properly. 'Chilling exposure of totalitarian future'? 'Takes you to a nightmare world of totalitarian domination'? Yes, that's what I had heard too when I opened this book as an adolescent. But my overwhelming impression was of the sheer seediness of the world depicted. Winston and Julia's rebellion is directed at least as much against their degraded lives as against the Party's control of them. Years later, I noticed my students didn't see this. And of the first ten reviews I read, only one had as much as half a sentence on it.There's a lot of grimy, gritty realism in this book. But it isn't, finally, a realistic novel. First, it depends on huge silences. Winston Smith is clearly a man of some culture. Yet how, given the circumstances of his life, did he obtain it? Also, how could the party possibly have changed from the winner of some sort of socialist revolutionary struggle before to what it is in 1984? How come Smith has some sort of amnesia about all of this?The overdetermined nature of the story is also unrealistic. O'Brien seems to be able to read Smith's dreams. The place he gets the notebook from just happens to be the place for Winston and Julia's love nest, the owner of which just happens to be a member of the thought police. In Smith's interrogation, O'Brien has the ability to read Smith's thoughts. Of course, all this enforces the doom that hangs over his rebellion, but it has the quality more of a dream, when the dreamer's fears immediately become concrete, than a book that says much about our actual world full of chance and contingency.The social structure depicted in this book is not that of Soviet communism, but of Soviet communism spliced together with the British class system. Notice that Party members do not, in that classic giveaway phrase, 'speak with accents'. The Party did not function as a class in the Soviet system; it pervaded the whole of society and was stridently and sincerely for the proletariat and proletarian values right to the end. The society of 1984 wouldn't have worked without the economy being far more permeated by the party than would have been possible in the book: it would have ticked once or twice and then stopped. Orwell's proles have no culture of their own: everything is dished out to them by the Ministries. His patronising attitude is the worst sort of contempt.Now let's say something about the great book, that is supposed to explain everything. The first lines tell us that the Middle want to replace the High, but the Low dream of universal brotherhood. Even when I read that as a fourteen-year-old I knew that was false: why shouldn't the Low want to replace the Middle? Isn't that what vast numbers have done? Then the inmost answer of answers - was there ever such a damp squib? The Party do as they do to satisfy their lust for control and dominance? Come off it. I can believe in a once revolutionary or idealistic party that has become hopelessly mired in corruption and self-seeking, and I am sure that some members of the security services take a sadistic pleasure in doing their jobs, but rulers as a whole? They've got better things to do. O'Brien's mind encompassing Smith's (it says this at one point)is a figure of Orwell's encompassing both - which makes this a very sado-masochistic book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A timeless book, especially in todays world. I had read it years ago, and enjoyed reading it again. Recommended for all."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you want to laugh, cry, and be scared at the same time, then this is the book for you. The Guardian by Nicholas Sparks is a book about love and suspense. This novel involves a young woman named Julie who is a widow because her husband Jim had recently died; he had left her a dog named Singer who acted like her guardian angel and was there to protect her. All Julie wanted to do was be in love again, so when she began dating again, she began falling for the perfect guy named Richard. Richard was truly perfect for her, but his constant demands and his bipolar attitude made Julie realize that he wasn't the one for her. So, Julie broke up with Richard and began falling for her best friend named Mike. Little did Julie know that this deeply angered Richard which made him do some things that he's not really proud of. As Julie and Mike had to get through all of the things Richard did to retaliate, they both stuck through it and made their love stronger. This book was immensely suspenseful because Richard's actions are unpredictable and keeps one on their toes.The author's viewpoint and main idea is to educate readers and young teens about the art of love and obsession.The author uses a technique of allowing there to be two different perspectives in the book: thoughts of Julie's and thoughts of Richard's. He showed evidence of the book by interpreting Richard's thoughts and the plans of attack he plotted in his head to make Julie's life miserable, which made the book that much more interesting. He also lets the reader to understand how and why Richard does the things he did to Julie. Also, Sparks uses evidence for the love between Mike and Julie by showing them sticking together and getting through all these rough plots that Richard has set up to get them to break up, but they have stuck through them all clearly showing their love for one another until the very end. The stress Richard put upon their relationship was enough stress to break them apart, but their true love for one another outgrew the threats thrown at them.The author's argument is convincing because he clearly shows and provides evidence on concluding his argument which is that love truly does conquer all. When Richard was angry at Julie for so long and did many things that I can't say or else id ruin it for you, Mike had stuck with her even when Richard sabotaged them in order to break them up, but their love conquered all and they found a way to stick with each other through it all.This book isn't like other novels written because of its suspenseful and twisted plot. Most love novels are about two people who fall in love, break up, and then get back together and live happily ever after; this is no typical love story. However, this book is different in that it provided insight on how strong their love was because of the twisted plot Sparks created. This love story also included horror, deaths, obsessions, and made the reader's heart pound intensely, not only because of the love scenes but also for the scenes in which Richard plotted his plans to make Julie miserable and showed he did what he did.I feel as if this book would be interesting to people who love Nicholas Sparks' books about love and love sorties. However, this book would also appeal to any type of aged person who wants to find a book about not only love but also suspense. Most people don't like love stories because they believe in the stereotypes said about them, but this book gives a mixture of many different genres that would appeal to any average aged person. However, this book appeals more strongly to girls and women than guys and men. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a thrilling book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"By Blake Padveen:George Orwell's novel 1984, could possibly be one of the most influential books of the 20th century. Its references to communism, capitalism and totalitarianism chill the body to the bone in an unimaginable way. The main chilling fact, is that the events in 1984 could possibly happen. Many of the reoccurring themes throughout the novel such as love, and freedom are quickly abolished almost in an instant, giving the reader insight on how important these ideas are, and how they should be cherished. Orwell also grants the reader insight into many different parts of the world where people are currently enslaved by their governments and how their lives differ from the free world. The book being written in a time where the world was consumed by fear and hatred of communism shows how a civilization can be easily manipulated by these feeling of hate and fear. It is true that in 1984 Winston's and Julia's final fates are quite possibly worse then death. They lose their hatred for the party, and the means to rebel and become lovers of big brother and of the party as well. To lose ones passion and love is a fate that could be seen as worse than death. Even though I appreciate George Orwell's writing style, it is hard for me in the modern age to enjoy a book mostly consumed by pointless dialogue even though it was essential to the story. I much more enjoyed the movie."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I didn't read this in high school, so decided I should. Not my favorite, but it was decent. The ranting in it lost me sometimes, but overall it was good. Very scary to think that our own government could be heading in the same direction. Big brother is watching!!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read Orwell's masterpiece for seventh grade summer reading in 1983 (got in right under the gun!). It remains one of the key books of my intellectual development. 1984 was the first book to get me to think about the importance of the freedom of the individual, the dangers of mob psychology and the evils of totalitarianism.Winston Smith is a member of the Party, as is everyone else who isn't a &quot;prole,&quot; and like everyone else, he lives &quot;from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police.&quot; Orwell builds up a gray and chilling world where &quot;no emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred.&quot;This is what Orwell imagined in 1949 would be the logical extension of communism. And look where we are, fully sixteen years after the year 1984, with the video camera technology that can do effectively the same thing as the Party's telescreens. Imagine life with a TV that could watch you while you watched it--a TV that could bellow at you to do your calisthenics in the morning or face arrest! That's what Big Brother is all about, the absolute lack of privacy to enforce the absolute conformity of action and thought--something to contemplate before tuning in one of those cheesy &quot;real-life&quot; TV-ratings-grabbers. In Orwell's 1984, there was nothing to laugh about.Orwell's writing style is intentionally as stark as the world he creates. The narrator does a lot of telling as well as showing, but this does not slow the pace. I heartily recommend 1984 for anyone over eleven who appreciates his or her freedom and individuality. You may appreciate it far more once you have finished this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book has changed my vision of natural human nature. I have found many events and characteristics of the Party to be preshadowings of organizations I see everyday. It also showed me how an evil administration can distroy a love that was so strong. This book is scary and too real."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As a teenager I lumped Nineteen Eighty-Four together with Animal Farm. I mistakenly thought the two books were thematically similar except that Nineteen Eighty-Four was longer and featured people instead of pigs. Frankly, I didn't like the book too much. Now, fifteen years later, I have reread Nineteen Eighty-Four and now I greatly appreciate it. It's a thought provoking book that easily deserves five stars. It is too bad that so many misconceptions regarding the book are taught to high school students. No wonder that I didn't like it; I didn't understand it. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not a satire of Soviet communism (that's Animal Farm), nor is it a cautionary tale of government power, nor a prediction of the future. Nineteen Eighty-Four belongs to the genre of speculative fiction. It is a dystopian \\"what if\\" story.Orwell had witnessed a dramatic upheaval in the fortunes of the world's empires. The greatest empire the world has ever known, the British Empire, lay in ruins. Germany had been on the brink of total dominion over Europe but was nonetheless defeated. The Japanese Empire had stretched across the Pacific but it too was dramatically defeated. In time all empires must die. Or must they? What if there was an empire that could endure all calamities, wars, internal unrest, trials, and tribulations, and exist unchanged forever?Orwell's achievement in Nineteen Eighty-Four is that he conceived just such an empire: a totalitarian state that would endure for eternity. Ask yourself: What would an eternal empire look like? What would be its philosophy and organizing principles? What goals would it set? How would it operate? What kinds of individuals would populate it? How would the rest of the world react to it? These are the questions that are explored in Nineteen Eighty-Four.Oceania, in Orwell's fantasy, is ruled by The Party. There are many superficial similarities between The Party and the regime of Soviet Russia; but, in Nineteen Eighty-Four it is the differences that are crucial. Instead of Marxism, The Party follows the teachings of Ingsoc, a governing philosophy based on hatred and the naked pursuit of power. Totalitarian leaders in the real world preach equality while they hypocritically amass wealth and privileges for themselves. In Orwell's world, however, the Party leaders preach hatred and genuinely sincerely believe in hatred, and their conviction in the power of hatred is unshakeable. The defining qualities of The Party (doublethink, mind control, incorruptibility) are not to be found in the real world.Unfortunately, many clich&eacute;s have become wrongly associated with Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, the back of my copy reads \\"Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever.\\" This blurb is entirely inaccurate. If you remember anything from my review then please remember that the world depicted in Nineteen Eighty-Four is a mad fantasy that can never be realized. It is neither a prediction of things to come nor a critique of any real-world regime. It is not a tale of revolution betrayed, nor a portrayal of exploitative leaders living in luxury on the backs of the masses. So put aside your preconceptions of the book because they are probably as wrong as mine were.In summary, Nineteen Eighty-Four is more an academic exercise than your typical plot-driven novel; but, Orwell's exploration of an eternal, unchanging, invincible empire is engrossing and even fun anyway. The subject matter is often very dark so the moments of levity found in the first parts of the book were warmly appreciated. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Did you know that one could be sentenced to up to 5 years of prison for possessing this book in the Soviet Union? The distribution of \\"1984\\" was forbidden in Soviet Russia until 1988, until then people had been distributing the book underground, copying it by hand, translating it in secret and getting turned over to the authorities by their friends and neighbors. Because that's what communism does, it brings out the worse in people.I was born and grew up in Communist Russia, and even though I was born too late to see the ugliest side of it I still know my history and am able to draw parallels.I had the strongest feeling of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu during the 2008 presidential election in the USA, the way people swallowed the \\"Distribute the wealth\\" slogan, expecting the government to solve their problems and make everybody \\"equal\\"...it made me ill.Can't people ever learn from history?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As a freshman in high school who recently finished the book 1984, I have opinions on the book that might be a little different than most others'. I had read another one of George Orwell's books, Animal Farm, and was pretty disappointed. I liked the idea of the story, but I found it hard to get through at times. Since my eighth grade English George Orwell's work, and recommended that I give 1984 a try, I decided to read that for my first choice as a high school reading assignment.I thought the book was very well written. I hadn't read many books with the same writing style that Orwell uses, which was a good change from what I usually read. Although his style was a good thing to try, I found reading it to be a very slow process. There is a lot of vocabulary that many kids and even adults don't know very well, which made it hard to understand the storyline at certain points. However, the paragraphs that follow usually helped me figure out what the author was trying to say or point out.Although the author did a very good job writing the book, I wasn't entirely pleased with the whole story. I felt the story was very hard to understand at times, in addition to not understanding a decent amount of the words. George Orwell does a great job of keeping the reader guessing about future events, and leaving them astonished at the end, but all of those twists and turns can be confusing. I often had to reread a few events in the story before I fullyunderstood what was happening. Having to do this action several times throughout the book got a bit tiring after a while, and made me a little reluctant to move on in fear that I would have to do it again.Even though the book has its ups and downs, I am undoubtedly happy about my decision to read this book. The dark and suspenseful story of a man and a woman opposing everything they have been taught about life and trying not to be suspected by their cruel government, kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. Although it was difficult reading at times, and I felt like just giving up on it, the desire for more action and suspense kept me going. This is a great book for anyone who loves to read about action and suspense, and is up for a challenge."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is the kind of book that I admire more than like. I admire Orwell for how detailed and believable the world he builds is. For his efforts to set a dark and unsettling mood and for his detailed analysis of its politics.The reasons I don't like it as much as so many other people? Well, it didn't do anything for me. I couldn't relate or feel anything for the characters. I didn't find the story haunting or particularly appealing. It didn't even make me think, when I was reading books like Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 or Camus' The Fall I had to close every few pages to think about it, because I couldn't hold my thoughts back, with 1984 this didn't happen at all.Reading it's a subjective experience, no matter how good a book is, if you don't feel anything as a result of reading it, why then give it a high rating?I wish I'd liked it better, or at least spotted any major reason for my dislike, but I didn't."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Sorry if I contribute to lowering the score for this classic, but although the main idea is good, the writing is simplistic (reads like a book for teenagers) and the story and characters lack depth and are quite boring.I guess I'm disappointed that Orwell didn't do a better job with such a brilliant idea... The only part that was really interesting to me is when his main character, Winston, is reading from the \\"prohibited\\" book. In this section, Orwell essentially details the philosophy of the party leaders, and that's a very stimulating read.

This is one very weird, very scary, and very entertaining book. Orwell is a master at setting the creepy tone of a world without freedom, where you know that everything you do is scrutinized by unseen eyes. Yes there's definitely a strong message that is coming across. Look a little closer at the story and you'll find a potent argument against Communism, Fascism, Totalinarianism, and many more political -isms. I can't promote this book enough. It is timeless.

The bottom line is that many in the governments in these free countries mean well but don't comprehend what is coming. The current Bush administration is just answering the call because of the power that technology has given our governments and global terrorist. We must either accept that we are always at risk or give up some of our freedoms. We just have to hope that when this risk dissapates, if ever, we can get them back.

In the simplest terms, I didn't like the novel; but I don't think I was supposed to. And I certainly don't regret taking the time to read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A quarter of a century late, I finally got around to reading '1984', mostly just to say I'd read it and satisfy my curiousity about whether it lives up to its reputation as 'one of the greatest novels ever'.At the risk of being 'redacted and eliminated', I have to say, 'No.'As a work of science fiction, it has all the ingredients for a good story-a 'lone voice in the wilderness' caught in a 'futuristic' dictatorship that seems equally believable and implausible(maybe another example of 'fudging the truth'?) Orwell's gradual, and muddled, revelations of how England became 'Airstrip One' would have made for a great 'alternate history' novel, if he had been that sort of author (as it was, Ray Bradbury covered some of the same ground from other directions in 'Farenheit 451'.) While some may think Winston 'useless', I found him, at times, a sympathetic character. The relatively small cast of characters, and the relentlessly 'gray area' they all occupied, kept me from really connecting to anyone.For me, '1984' let me down when Orwell subjected readers to his desire to write an article detailing the history of socialism, tailored to fit this story, and disguised as 'Emmanuel Goldstein's' infamous 'banned' text, 'The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'. Having lured us in with the 'bait' of a fascinating premise in which we were told just enough of the background to keep us interested, Orwell then 'switches' to a dry, analytical narrative voice, as if from a textbook excerpt, overwhelming chapter 9 of the novel with long, dull, stretches of several 'chapters' written a la Dr. Goldstein, and forcing me to 'skim' this exercise in egotism until Winston finally stops 'reading' and allows us to see more of the 'practice', and less of the 'theory'!As a cautionary tale of real life, I think the only 'caution' would be to anyone who unthinkingly labels any 'big government' as 'Big Brother', without having read this book for context.Four stars for science-fiction, two for literary merit; on average, not bad, but hardly deserving the 'best book EVER!', breathlessly gushing praise so many give it. However, I'm glad I read it, and saw for myself. I'm just not as taken with 'bleak and dystopian' literature as others may be.Make up your own minds...and be glad you can!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith vaguely remembers what the world was like before. Before the revolution, before the Thought Police, before Big Brother. But he can't remember if it was better.I wanted to read this book because its a classic. No bookshelf is complete without it. What I was surprised to find is that I really liked it. Sure, I knew I would like it. It's a classic for a reason but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be hard to get through and reading it would take a lot of effort on my part. I was wrong.I'm not going to get into the plot very much. It's one of those books you just have to read. It's a story about the horror of human nature. The horror of man's obsession with power. This book was written in 1949. I can understand what an impact it must have had then. With Hitler and WWII still fresh in everyone's minds. Even in the 50's it might have seemed possible that something like this could happen. In today's day and age its not even feasible but it makes you thankful for the world we live in and the privileges we take for granted.I highly recommend 1984 if you haven't read it already. Like I said no shelf is complete without it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a very well writen book that makes us see a very scay but possable future. To compleatly understand this future we must go in to the gory (literally) deatils.

It was originally intended to be a 100 year update of his novel which unintentionally led to many of the same conclusions that he reached over 60 years ago. And although the totalitarian planetary government in place in my story is much the same as Orwell described in his book, I believe I have described it's origins in greater detail. Many of the accepted practices in today's world lead to results very familiar to Orwell's readers. Such concepts as \\"Newspeak\\", \\"Doublethink\\", \\"Thought Police\\", and even \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\",are being implemented today by contemporary democratic societies, including the U.S. In addition, we now have increased security provisions caused by the war on terror that could result in a severe loss of freedom if left unchecked. I believe my story not only shows that Orwell's warnings were valid, but that given the environment in the world today and the increased apathy of its citizens, many of his prophecies have increased odds of becoming reality."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"My copy is so old it does not have an ISBN. It is the twenty-first printing of the 1949 Harcourt edition. Refer, then, to page 191: \\"In the long run a hierarchial society was only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance.\\" (This is the rant of the ficticious Goldstein.)Now read Jon Jeter's \\"Flat Broke in the Free Market,\\" \\"Armed madhouse,\\" by Palast, \\"The Man Who Sold the World...\\" by Kleinkrecht, and, of course, the ever popular blockbuster of international poverty \\"The World is Flat\\" by Friedman. So, I will leave it up to you, gentle reader, was Orwell a prophet of distinction or a paranoid socialist nutcase? Have you already visited Room 101?The book is marred by lengthy and didactic dialogue and the premise \\"They\\" would spend money to force Winston to love Big Brother before whacking him. Stalin, and rest of the politicians, dictators, and religious leaders would not have spent the dime.But, at least, as yet, our ubiquitous screens only broadcast and do not monitor, although there is some very distressing information out there about electronic surveillence.Now, one of the local teachers complained to me that he was expected to be teaching exactly the same thing the same day as all the other instructors in his field. \\"Why don't they just use a DVD?\\" he complained. Now, it just so happens that Uncle Mitch, and I will not tell you who he is if you do not know, just announced that every student could have virtual charter school education just by plugging in a computer (Thus, eliminating teachers, teachers' unions, pension plans, school building maintenance, etc. for the public from this personal taxes).You can bet the DVD would be broadcast from some third world country where the techs would work for food, while those who will rule over us, including Uncle's offspring, attended private schools, probably funded by public tax money. You can also bet a shiny new dime that \\"1984\\" would not be in the curriculum.So, the question again is: Was Orwell a prophet of distinction or a paranoid socialist nutcase?Either way, this book seems almost as fresh today as the day it was written, and, as distressing as this title is, should be on your required reading list.As an addendum: Readers may wish to revisit Orwell's earlier work \\"Animal Farm\\" to discover that \\"1984\\" is really just an enlargement of that previous publication, although the names have been changed to protect the guilty."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time. As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli.

I find that interesting that the government is always watching, I always felt like someone somewhere always knows what you are up to 24 hours a day.

It doesn't have to be the government, the popo can be watching you from far away and you think he is probably not watching and 5 minutes later after you did the dumb thing, your screwed and you will get in trouble with the law.I highly recommend this book because it will change your view on the goverment, and on the world we live in now."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"All right, I don't see there is anything new I can add to the endless list of reviews written on this thrilling, wonderful book. So, I will just make an attempt at scribbling some of my impressions.Orwell builds a world where no single detail is left to randomness. From all the constructions the reader comes across in this book, the most astonishing ones are, (of course this is a personal view):The dynamics of time: More than what the author has created as future, what impresses me most is what he has created as past. To start with, the treatment of past throughout this book is from a philosophical and logical point of view simply overwhelming. The idea underlying the novel is that the past is in your hands, you can do whatever you wish with the past, which implies that no matter what course of actions you take, you can always modify what you've done so far without the necessity of traveling in time. There is no room for history or memories here. Your personal history is what you want it to be at the very moment you are thinking of it; this is: you have as many personal histories as you choose, which also means that you have none. Orwell has shaped a time machine that doesn't presuppose any physical change in space or time for the entire process takes place in the mind. This leaves the main character in a helpless situation since his quest, is the quest of past. He craves for learning something from a world he would have liked to live in, but that he only knows by intuition. As he experiences the feeling of being cheated he grows anguished: he wants his intuition to become certain. If it happens, he will recover his past, his own existence.Newspeak or the economics of language: language is a human construction to help us naming the world we live in. Words are born to serve expressive necessities. In a similar fashion, they disappear when they no longer symbolize something we want to communicate. In Orwell's world, on the contrary, language is a means to modify reality: when a word ceases to exist, the object it used to represent ceases to exist as well. Language is the tool used to shape the world as man wishes. It is not a means to express ideas. It is the idea itself, what has to fit words and not the other way around. If something can't be named, it simply doesn't exist. As Borges says: \\"Words create past\\". Then if words are suppressed, history is simply erased and becomes nothingness, creating a space that has to be refilled by something new.The logics of doublethink or the art of canceling opposites out. The ability to justify everything in an impeccable logical way. (I wonder how many politicians today have taken hold of this \\"technique\\" to justify their actions even when they are aware of the contradictions they entail).Actually, there is a lot more to say, but I'll stop here. Just go and read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Eric Arthur Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, wrote 1984 because of his concern of the spread of communism. It is a dark, gothic look at what society could become if the spectre of communism led to totalitarianism. Essentially, it is a more graphic and adult version of his Animal Farm, with people. It is told by a nameless narrator who knows all the goings-on in the world of the future, and follows the life of a middle-aged citizen of Oceania, Winston Smith, who is an employee in the Ministry of Truth. 1984 is not plot-driven, nor is it based on character development (these aspects are still present, however). The primary focus of the book is the setting. We are given the world as it could have become in 1984. Of course, we are not in a situation like that, but the threat of such a situation is still present. This differentiates it from other books, although there is never a reason to dislike or fear something new before trying it. Orwell believed it to be the most effective way to explain the world of 1984, and I think it is effective. If the focus were on the characters or the plot, a high proportion of the messages would have to be interpreted, rather than explained in detail. Different interpretations could mean that certain events make no sense, and discussion would be difficult. Some people may have missed some meanings altogether. By explaining his 'apocalyptic' vision of the future in complete detail, Orwell is able to get the entirety of his message to his readers. Orwell is a very articulate and imaginative writer. The world he depicts is divided into three world powers - Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The Party controls Oceania, the setting of the novel. Big Brother (a parallel to Napoleon from Animal Farm, or Stalin in real life) is at the apex of the social pyramid. He is the father-figure worshipped by the citizens. The Inner Party comprises 2% of the population, and the Outer Party 15%. The remainder consists of the dumb masses, or 'proles'. Any sign of unorthodoxy is dealt with swiftly and harshly by the Thought Police (a parallel to the dogs, the American secret service or Russian KGB). The telescreens that are planted in the walls receive and transmit information simultaneously. The Thought Police use these to keep their citizens under surveillance. Children are turned against their own parents through the use of spy camps and worship of Big Brother. 1984 is partially a look at how easily children can be manipulated and what happens when it goes wrong. Ironically, the people with the least intelligence are given the highest degree of freedom. They do not pose a threat. The chances of an uprising are non-existent because the proles believe anything they are told, and do not take material facts into consideration. Three of the Party's main slogans: 'War is Peace', 'Freedom is Slavery' and 'Ignorance is Strength' are swallowed without question by the majority of the population. The reasons for this, and how the Party pulls it off, are explained in detail later on. The Party was meticulous in its planning. Any totalitarian system requires a scapegoat. In Oceania, it is Emmanuel Goldstein (John Lenin), the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. The Brotherhood is the rebel group that follows Goldstein's teachings, and undermines the Party at any opportunity. The narrator shows us the thoughts that run through Winston's mind, and how he longs for freedom of thought. He meets the book's loveinterest, Julia, whom he disgusts at first glance and lusts after, due to his own failed marriage and her beauty. She wears a chastity scarf, symbolising her (supposed) contempt for sex, part of the reason for his lust - he believes he can never have her. The message here is the desire for that which is forbidden. He later learns that Julia is a rebel, but in a different way, &quot;only from the waist down&quot;, according to Winston. They find a secret hiding place without a telescreen, and are invited to join the Brotherhood by O'Brien. As it turns out, this is when their troubles truly begin. Orwell describes in detail how the Party came into power, its motives and its true objectives. The full implication and repercussions of these revelations are unfurled in the final riveting part of the novel. However, there are flaws in the exploration of the society. We are not given a sufficient view into the eyes of the older generation that lived through the Revolution. Winston only questions one old prole in a pub, and appeared to give up his inquiry too early. 1984 is a very mature book, and I would only recommend it to people who can grasp similar concepts. If the reader is too young, they may dismiss the book as boring. It may seem so at first, but the novel will make more sense with some thought and, possibly, subsequent readings. If you enjoyed Brave New World, you will enjoy 1984, and even if you didn't, you may still like it. This is a philosopher's book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I read this story, I was amazed.

Orwell's most famous novel warns us against the power of propaganda. &quot;Big Brother&quot; has become common to our language and culture.This isn't Blair's best work, however. This and ANIMAL FARM are only really read because they warn against Communist propaganda. As mentioned in the beginning, Orwell was a social democrat (although, I would say libertarian socialist). He greatly sympathized with the anarchist movement in Spain (Homage to Catalonia). In fact, the communist attack against the anarchists is probably what inspired him to write stories like ANIMAl FARM and 1984.I was disturbed to see a previous reviewer say something like, &quot;If this book is properly read and understood, you will become a Libertarian.&quot;Blair's best stuff is actually against propaganda systems found in so-called democracies like the United States and Britian. The Soviets had an extensive system, but it wasn't very effective. They kept people in line through violence, mostly. When the ability to coerece decreases (like in relatively free societies eg The United States) the need to propagandanize increases. This has really become apart of mainstream doctrine. To take a quote from someone not so mainstream, &quot;Propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship.&quot; -- Noam ChomskyIt should come as no surprise why Orwell's most popular works are anti-communist..."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Its after you complete the book that it will begin to effect you. You will start seeing the world around you with a different set of eyes. A must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The problem with reviewing a book by that has been forced down people's throuts all through their middle school, high school, and college careers is that people hate it for exactly that reason, they were forced to read it. I read this book as a senior in high school and I liked it, but I didn't love it. I have re-read it several times along with Animal Farm and many of his essays and I can saw without reservation that Orwell is the greatest political writer of all time, and one of the greatest writers of all time.1984's plot is famous and it's particulars have been expounded on numerous times so I won't bore the reader by repeating them. This novel was written in 1949, after the fall of Totalitarianism in Europe and during the beginnings of the Cold War. Taken in historical persepective, this novel is really a satire about Stalinist Russia. Everything about Stalinist Russia's gets the back of Orwell's hand, the frequent purges where known citizens frequently just disapear, the crippling military regime where personal freedom and expression are crushed, and the overwhelming cult of personality where Stalin was worshipped ala Big Brother.Read only with this historical perspective in mind is still fruitful and interesting, but this novel still applies today to the government of the United States and other governments around the world. Though not as extreme by any stretch, the themes expressed in this novel are relevant today. Double Think is one of the best and most ingenious examples. Double Think is believing two contradictory ideas at one time. Basically it's believing your own lie. Everyone knows that we went to war in Iraq for oil, but we say that it was for weapons of mass destruction, and then they never found them so it changed to we had to find Saddam and save the poor Iraqis and give them democracy. We know the real reason, but we believe the lie perpetrated by Bush's regime for some reason. We do not want to rock the boat, or we want to support our leader or some other convuluted reasoning has lead us to believe our own lie.The Iraq example is also a good example of changing the past. The Bush administration changed the reason for going to war and most people did not bat an eyelash at it. Hell, we rewarded this blatant lie by re-electing him.Now for all the naysayers who say this could never happen and it's portrait of an oppressive regime is unrealistic. I really don't think his point was to make a completely realistic novel. But think, what good would it be if Orwell had written, \\"well, the government was kind of bad, but not that bad, and I still got along all right.\\" Pretty boring if you ask me. He uses extreme examples to get you to think, if he presented you with weak examples you would not remember them at all.And lastly, Orwell knew what he was talking about. Read his essays and you will see that he was an incredibly intellegent man who knew the in's and out's of Communism and the complex social issues discussed in 1984. Read his collected essays and you can definitely chart the genesis of this novel. There is a 1 star review that claims Orwell knew nothing about Communism. I beg to differ. Orwell had a very lucid understanding of Communism, much more so than either you or I.So students, try to pretend this hasn't been forced on you and you might enjoy it. For anyone else reading this, this novel is highly recommended for fans of classic literature and those wary of corruption."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"After you read this book, like me, you'll probably wonder if this could become non-fiction. In most cases, I'd say yes. That is why you should try and stay informed on the Orwellian things that are taking place in this country.

While I personally preffer Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" I found the stark portrayal of Orwell's \\"Oceania\\" and Winston's fractured individuality to be far more powerful. My review might seem like an overstatement-and perhaps it is. After all, I first read \\"1984\\" in October of 2001 while in grade 11 and perhaps that is why it has had such a profound effect on my outlook. \\"1984\\" is a must read for ALL people, EVERYWHERE, who value their freedom and understand that so long as strong authoritative infrastructures continue to control our lives (governments, corporations, organized religion)with a blind following, our liberty is truly fleeting."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.With these 3 contradictory statements, Orwell perfectly summarizes the inevitable end of all freedoms for mankind.I have read this masterpiece over 10 times and each time I glean some new thoughts on the pitfalls of living in what we affectionately call \\"society.\\" During my last three readings of this novel, I approached the book looking for parallels between Orwell's 1984 and our 2002.The first reading I approached it from the right wing perspective and was horrified at how large and intrusive the government has become over my short lifetime. The second reading, I approached from the leftist viewpoint and found myself frightened by the encroachments on civil liberties and personal freedoms over the past several decades. In my most recent reading, I approached it from a stateless viewpoint (read anarchist) and found myself mentally replacing Emmanuel Goldstein and the Brotherhood with Osama bin Laden and al Quaida (note: this is not an endorsement of either OBL or Al Quaida, rather it is just a means to see how a government can puff up an enemy to the point he becomes all purpose ... e.g. Those anti-drug Superbowl ads were they claimed that smoking a joint promoted terrorism).In a nutshell, I am saying that 1984 transcends political leanings and begs the question: Does trusting your wellbeing to your fellow man serve your best interests?The answer is a resounding \\"no.\\"In 1949, Orwell's three contradictory statements could have rang hallow with many readers, but in a world where the peacekeepers are those with the military power to coerce peacefulness, where people spend their freedoms for perceived security (see Patriot Act) and where a simple perusal of television's primetime lineup can prove that no premium is placed on intelligence; one can see how 1984 is more prophetic now than it was in 1949."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is George Orwell's warning of the dangers of a totalitarian society. The main character in the novel, Winston Smith, is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in the country of Oceania. Winston and his fellow citizens are monitored everywhere they go, even in their own homes. Party members spy on everyone using ever-present telescreens, and pictures of \\"Big Brother,\\" the Party's leader, are on display everywhere. The Party's main goal is to eliminate all forms of individual thought, which can lead to rebellion. In order to do that, the language of Newspeak is being integrated into society in hopes of eliminating 80% of all words and thus reducing the chances of a revolt. Sex is also another aspect of life considered taboo by the Party, and Winston eventually begins an affair with a woman named Julia with full knowledge of the fact that if they get caught, they could both be killed by the government. Winston ultimately finds himself fighting a dangerous battle with the Party, and it's a fight he cannot possibly hope to win.This novel is as powerful now as it was when it was written in the late 1940s. Orwell's commentary about the dangers of totalitarianism coupled with an analysis of the powers of psychological manipulation are truly frightening. I can't say that this book is enjoyable to read because the subject matter is very disturbing, but \\"1984\\" is a well-crafted and thought-provoking book that should be ready by everyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's \\"1984\\" is a novel that is truly frightening for those who cherish free expression and the power of individual thought. Dystopia literature owes it all to this classic of the genre. I managed to get through all my formal education without having read this text. However, picking it up now I am glad that I waited until I was a little older to read it.The first thing one must marvel at is the brilliant construction of the novel. Orwell as an artist is at the top of his form and the structure of the novel is wound so tightly that readers would be wise to annotate the text as there is an almost cyclical nature to many of the themes and ideas presented. Orwell weaves the same ideas throughout the text, and each time he revisits them he shows them through the lenses of a different ideology or character and thus emphasizes for the reader how precarious (and precious) are the mores and ideals of the individual mind.The idea of governments who yearn for power for power's sake is not so foreign to our early 21st century world, and although the text ends on a nihilistic note, the reader walks away from \\"1984\\" with the renewed impetus to revere and respect our individual thoughts, as these, and these alone, give us unique value. Read this text, not so you can fear \\"big brother\\", but rather so you can be reminded to respect yourself enough to think and form intellectual thoughts. It is Winston's loss of the self that should frighten the readers of \\"1984\\", not the dreary world that Orwell creates. We don't need totalitarian governments to become Winston Smiths. We can do it to ourselves if we are not careful!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is an Orwell classic, all about how totalitarian governments were tricking the people, destroying freedom, and ruining the world. The main character is Winston Smith, a disgruntled middle class office worker who secretly harbors a hatred of The Party. The world in which Winston lives is divided into three super states: Oceana, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Winston lives in London, the capital of Oceana, which is ruled by a totalitarian regime known as The Party, and it's leader Big Brother. The Party does not allow any dissent against it and even thinking rebellious thoughts is a crime. They change history to their liking and falsify endless documents to be in their favor. Winston does not know what is true and what is lies. The Party is constantly watching Winston and he must be careful not to give himself away. He eventually starts a love affair with a woman named Julia, who also hates The Party and all that it stands for. They get in touch with an inner party member named O'Brien who claims to be part of a rebel organization known as the Brotherhood. He is actually a party spy and Winston and Julia are eventually arrested. Winston is interrogated and tortured to try and force him to accept the party ideals. Eventually he is subjected to his worst nightmare, having his face eaten by rats. He begs that they do it to Julia instead, breaking his most important promise not to betray her. His soul destroyed, Winston is released. He no longer loves Julia and has learned to love Big Brother and The Party. This book is a very bleak view of what George Orwell saw the world becoming in 1949. Although it is quite disturbing this book makes you think a lot and is very well written. I recommend this if you like other George Orwell books as well as depressing novels."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think this is my favorite novel about a dystopia. So far, I have read \\"We\\", \\"A Handmaid's Tale\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Anthem\\", and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", and though I have thoroughly enjoyed quite a few of the novels that I've listed, 1984 is my absolute favorite. How is it different? The main character, Winston, if not entirely likable, is very relatable. What I like most about him is that he doesn't assume to be anything or know anything, but rather, he feels instinctively that something is wrong with how the world is set up. He is not especially intelligent (although he's not exactly stupid either) or strong-willed or moral or handsome. And as if to emphasize Winston's relatable mediocrity, Orwell gave him an exceedingly boring office job! In some novels about dystopias, the protagonist can be overly heroic (as in Anthem) or tragic (as in a Handmaid's Tale), and thus more admirable but also a lot less relatable.Another thing that is different . . . this book gives you different perspectives. Orwell's theme of government control over language is pretty common in this genre, but because he took his thesis a little farther than merely saying that government control is bad, the book is an interesting read. He even gets a little into metaphysics. As a reader, you also get the perspectives of different characters in the book, and thus, the perspectives of both the government and of rebels. Often, books in this genre can be very straight-foward, but 1984, with its many twists, is a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book because I was growing weary of my own ignorance. One-too-many references to Big Brother amid the post-911 proliferation of video cameras, wire-tapping, and concern about government intrusions into private life pushed me to question my own cultural literacy (thanks to author E.D. Hirsch, Jr. here). My job also sent me to southern Sudan in 2007, during which a colleague noted that I would need to visit a rather remote \\"Orwellian province\\". It turns out that province is called Unity State. After reading 1984, I get his drift.It also occurred to me that the TV phenomenon Big Brother was likely produced by staffers who found themselves in their teens or early adulthood during 1984, while the audience to whom it caters may largely have been born well after that year. Given a generation who knows Big Brother not as the incarnation of thinly veiled government despotism but as the product of CBS Prime Time, there was reason to question more than my own cultural literacy. But what, or whom, we really need to discuss is Winston Smith.Best I can tell, Winston Smith is me. Modern man; modern society but faced with the reality that government had morphed into political, economic, sociological, technological, and intellectual fiat - its greatest coup perhaps being the subtle control of free thinking. By changing content of archival media, limiting contact with others, or simply eliminating those who dare _remember_, all that matters is current perception, regardless of logical inconsistency. And if this is achieved, then Smith's government (for lack of a better term) is, and always has been, right and just. For if you never learned (or never remember learning) that 2 + 2 = 4, then 2 + 2 = 5 seems quite plausible.The problem is that Smith dares to remember - dares to become conscious that another manner of thinking exists beyond the required and ubiquitous application of Doublethink, which he describes as follows: \\"To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself - that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.\\"As the book opens, Smith fails to \\"consciously induce unconsciousness\\", the mere act of which is considered a crime - Thoughtcrime, to be precise. The sort of awareness with which he is left can culminate in nothing other than action, and action which can culminate in nothing other than death. \\"He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote, 'Thoughtcrime does not entail death: Thoughtcrime IS death.' Now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible.\\"This book is compelling because of the pains Orwell has taken to conceptualize a world in which government has conquered thought life as the last bastion of liberty. Once memory and perception is controlled, what better way to direct the mindless fervor of the masses than to create focal personifications for polarizing emotions: one to love (Big Brother) and one to hate (Emmanuel Goldstein). As such, manipulated thought can become concentrated action with the purpose of maintaining the entire regime in perpetuity.It almost seems as if Orwell is trying to answer the question, \\"How bad could it (government) get?\\" to which it is tempting to reply, \\"How realistic is his answer?\\" Because so many of us, so many Winston Smiths, have seen smatterings of Orwell's answer in recent developments, there is good reason to be guarded and better reason to be proactive in the defense of intellectual freedom. Looking at the China, Burma, North Korea, and even western democracies of our day, it is easy to see hints of Doublethink and more overt evidence of a paralyzing fear of independent thought. But there is little reason to suspect that government can achieve a more frightening end: that of transforming the essence of humankind. Yet this is precisely where Orwell takes the reader. Smith's nemesis O'Brien notes, \\"The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt.' Our command is 'Thou art.'\\" While this book is an excellent call to political and intellectual vigilance, the day government controls our essence as humans is the day government merits consideration as deity. Until then, I remain thankful for my ability to think otherwise."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read Animal Farm before this one, and enjoyed it greatly. I was not disappointed by this book, despite my expectations being high. He presents quite an intriguing idea of a 1984 deprived of basic freedoms and livestyle that was very perceivable in the depths of 1948.That being said, the Kindle edition needs to be checked for continuity errors and proofread for spelling, grammatical, and punctuational errors."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It really doesn't make much sense to review a classic. I wish we continue to maintain a critical mass of people who read this book at least once. The words \\"orwellian\\" and \\"doublespeak\\" should never leave our lexicon. We already have department of \\"defence\\", if our kids don't discover or forget this book, the ministry of love will follow."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is one of the best novels ever written in English. The dismal world of the \\"future\\" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T. Pynchon provides some insights, especially about the last chapter on newspeak, but be warned that it does provide spoilers."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Although I'll acknowledge that Shakespeare, Milton and Blake have been regarded as masters of the beautiful English language far longer, Eric Blair (aka George Orwell) is the undisputed master of twisting words into weapons of destruction, despair, and control.Much has been written and noted about \\"1984,\\" and I can't add much more insight to it other than we had a cat named Winston.I first read this novel in Grade 8, before I really could understand what it was about. Its powerful imagery captured my imagination, however. I have read it about once a year hence, marvelling at Orwell's mastery of the language. He predicted human nature very accurately, considering where things were going near the time of his death. It's a very bleak book, and has gotten even more terrifying since the advent of the internet, 24 hour cable news, ubiquitous cameras and televisions, background checks, fanciful government terminology, massive fearmongering, routine inspections, suppression of emotion, and global paranoia.The most terrifying thing of all is not that \\"1984\\" came true. It's HOW SOON it came true after Orwell penned it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The vision of the Party's rule, its inhumanity and utter ruthlessness and mendacity frighten us and we hope it will never come to pass here. But we have no clue how to prevent it, and just like the people in Orwell's fictional world, we are perpetually caught off guard when it comes to pass in our own lives. One day we wake up and realize we are living in a nightmare, and we have been for a long time. \\"It'll never happen here\\" and \\"We've taken every precaution\\" become \\"When did it happen\\" and \\"How did we get to this point?\\" This perennial sickness takes hold of a nation and we are at its mercy.Like any good novelist, Orwell tells a story and he makes it real. For that sheltered portion of humankind who have had the fortune of growing up without the threat of being arrested and tortured for daring to disagree with their inept leaders, the book provides a vicarious experience without which we are left vulnerable to a disease we know nothing about. But while the creation of a literary world can teach us many things, it cannot provide a way out. For that we need accurate knowledge.1984 is a fictionalized account of pathocracy, as defined inPolitical Ponerology, and the reason it scares us is because it is completely outside our normal frame of reference. We have the same reaction to news accounts of senseless violence. Parents murdered by their 14-year-old son because they asked him to do his chores, after which he played video games. An 18-year-old woman disappears and is later found dead, beaten to death and wrapped in plastic. A trucker and his son admit to torturing a 20-year-old man in their basement, suffocating him and wrapping wire around his neck. A young boy is kidnapped, tortured, executed, and his organs harvested by forces of occupation before his body is returned to his parents.The common theme, of course, is psychopathy. Psychopaths lack conscience and hunger for the darkness. They are sadistic in a way which, for us, is near impossible to fathom. The evil which they bring is not unintended, as when we realize only after the fact that our actions have caused another harm. Instead, their lives are spent feeding on the misery that they inflict on others. Whether the sexual sadism of serial rapist-torturer, or the subtle draining of a \\"toxic co-worker\\" who uses you, abuses you, and wears you down until you lose all grip on reality. We may even ask in desperation, \\"What are you doing this to me?\\" The psychopath simply smirks. And in a world ruled by psychopaths we ask, \\"Why are you doing this to us?\\"1984 frightens us because psychopathy frightens us. The key feature of a pathocracy is that psychopaths influence the economic, military, political, and cultural agenda of a nation. Like chameleons, they mask themselves in the features of their surroundings. Within those parameters they stage dramas, creating a new reality according to their desires. And this reality is one of deception, terror, ruthless expansion and complete heartlessness.In the corporate world a psychopath gets ahead by destroying the careers of those who stand in his way, exploiting the work of others, starting rumors, creating conflicts. He always benefits from these, of course. A competitor falls out of favor. The psychopath is credited with the work of another. The bosses take his word over another who sees that he is a snake. An \\"enemy\\" finds herself without a job, blamed for something she didn't do. All the while the psychopath stage-manages. The man behind the curtain.In politics, the pawns are the people, the chessboard is the world stage. Strategic countries are invaded because of the \\"threat\\" they pose. This threat is 0f course created by the psychopaths in charge using the vast resources of intelligence services. \\"Terrorist threats\\" are fabricated. Atrocities are committed and then pinned on imaginary \\"terrorist groups\\". Orwell had it right. Emmanuel Goldstein was a creation of the Party. The bombings blamed on him and his followers committed by the Party itself for the purpose of keeping the population afraid and compliant.Today, torture photos are \\"leaked\\" not to expose State brutality, but to show the people what happens to those who oppose the system. After all, you're either \\"with us\\" or you're \\"with the terrorists\\". That's some option. Dissent is conflated with terrorism. Terrorists are tortured and assassinated. The President of the United States even sanctions the assassination of U.S. citizens labeled \\"terrorists\\". \\"They are part of they enemy\\", after all. Some respond with shock that a country could willingly kill its own citizens, as if killing another country's citizens is any more human. Of course, the two options are equally atrocious, but to a psychopath, what's the difference? If you have a conscience, you are a threat. Your leaders hold you in as much disdain as any other \\"bleeding heart\\".So what can be done? The first step is awareness of the reality of what goes on behind the scenes of political power: the workings of intelligence agencies, counterterrorism, foreign policy groups, etc. This can only be understood by applying ponerology, which identifies the source of the problem, and the exact social and psychological processes which push along the global pathocratic agenda. Psychopaths have been running the show for a long time, and they've been doing so because we haven't known what to look for. Commies, terrorists, Nazis, anarchists... All red herrings.The true enemy hides in plain sight."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Eric Arthur Blair was an important English writer that you probably already know by the pseudonym of George Orwell. He wrote quite a few books, but many believe that his more influential ones were \\"Animal farm\\" (1944) and \\"1984\\" (1948).In those two books he conveyed, metaphorically and not always obviously, what Soviet Russia meant to him.I would like to make some comments about the second book, \\"1984\\". That book was written near his death, when he was suffering from tuberculosis, what might have had a lot to do with the gloominess that is one of the essential characteristics of \\"1984\\". The story is set in London, in a nightmarish 1984 that for Orwell might well have been a possibility, writting as he was many years before that date. Or maybe, he was just trying to warn his contemporaries of the dangers of not opposing the Soviet threat, a threat that involved a new way of life that was in conflict with all that the English held dear.Orwell tried to depict a totalitarian state, where the truth didn't exist as such, but was merely what the \\"Big Brother\\" said it was. Freedom was only total obedience to the Party, and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Party. The story is told from the point of view of Winston Smith, a functionary of the Ministry of Truth whose work involved the \\"correction\\" of all records each time the \\"Big Brother\\" decided that the truth had changed. The Party slogan said that \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\", and they applied it constantly by \\"bringing up to date\\" the past so as to make it coincide with whatever the Party wanted.From Winston Smith's point of view, many things that scare us are normal. For example, the omnipresence of the \\"Big Brother\\", always watching you, and the \\"Thought Police\\" that punishes treacherous thoughts against the Party. The reader feels the inevitability of doom that pervades the book many times, in phrases like \\"Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you\\".Little by little, Winston begins to realize that things are not right, and that they should change. We accompany him in his attempt at subversion, and are unwilling witnesses of what that attempt brings about. This book is marked by hopelessness, but at the same time it is the kind of distressing book we all NEED to read...Why do we need to read \\"1984\\"?. In my opinion, basically for two reasons. To start with, Orwell made in this book many observations that are no more merely fiction, but already things that manage to reduce our freedom. Secondly, and closelly linked to my first reason, this is a book that only gets better with the passing of time, as you can read in it more and more implications. One of Orwell's main reasons for writting this \\"negative utopia\\" might have been to warn his readers against communism, but many years after his death and the fall of communism, we can also interpret it as a caution against the excessive power of mass media, or the immoderate power of any government (even those who don't defend communism).Technological innovation should be at the service of men, and allow them to live better lives, but it can be used against them. I guess that is one of Orwell's lessons, probably the most important one. All in all, I think you can benefit from reading this book. Because of that, I highly recommend it to you :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's final novel, 1984, was written amidst the anti-communist hysteria of the cold war. But unlike Orwell's other famous political satire, Animal Farm, this novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race. When it was written, 1984 stood as a warning against the dangerous probabilities of communism. And now today, after communism has crumbled with the Berlin Wall; 1984 has come back to tell us a tale of mass media, data mining, and their harrowing consequences.It's 1984 in London, a city in the new &uuml;berstate of Oceania, which contains what was once England, Western Europe and North America. Our hero, Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth altering documents that contradict current government statements and opinions. Winston begins to remember the past that he has worked so hard to destroy, and turns against The Party. Even Winston's quiet, practically undetectable form of anarchism is dangerous in a world filled with thought police and the omnipresent two-way telescreen. He fears his inevitable capture and punishment, but feels no compulsion to change his ways.Winston's dismal observations about human nature are accompanied by the hope that good will triumph over evil; a hope that Orwell does not appear to share. The people of Oceania are in the process of stripping down the English language to its bones. Creating Newspeak, which Orwell uses only for examples and ideas which exist only in the novel. The integration of Newspeak into the conversation of the book. One of the new words created is doublethink, the act of believing that two conflicting realities exist. Such as when Winston sees a photograph of a non-person, but must reason that that person does not, nor ever has, existed.The inspiration for Winston's work ,may have come from Russia. Where Stalin's right-hand man, Trotzky was erased from all tangible records after his dissention from the party. And the fear of telescreens harks back to the days when Stasi bugs were hooked to every bedpost, phone line and light bulb in Eastern Europe.His reference to Hitler Youth, the Junior Spies, which trains children to keep an eye out for thought criminals- even if they are their parents; provides evidence for Orwell's continuing presence in pop culture. &quot;Where men can't walk, or freely talk, And sons turn their fathers in.&quot; is a line from U2's 1993 song titled &quot;The Wanderer&quot;.Orwell assumes that we will pick up on these political allusions. But the average grade 11 student will probably only have a vague understanding of these due to lack of knowledge. It is even less likely that they will pick up on the universality of these happenings, like the fact that people still &quot;disappear&quot; without a trace every day in Latin America.Overall, however, the book could not have been better written. Orwell has created characters and events that are scarily realistic. Winston's narration brings the reader inside his head, and sympathetic with the cause of the would-be-rebels. There are no clear answers in the book, and it's often the reader who has to decide what to believe. But despite a slightly unresolved plot, the book serves its purpose. Orwell wrote this book to raise questions; and the sort of questions he raised have no easy answer. This aspect can make the novel somewhat of a disappointment for someone in search of a light read. But anyone prepared to not just read, but think about a novel, will get a lot out of 1984.1984, is not a novel for the faint of heart, it is a gruesome, saddening portrait of humanity, with it's pitfalls garishly highlighted. Its historic importance has never been underestimated; and it's reemergence as a political warning for the 21st century makes it deserving of a second look. Winston's world of paranoia and inconsistent realities is an eloquently worded account of a future we thought we buried in our past; but in truth may be waiting just around the corner."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic was incredibly visionary. It is hardly fathomable that this book was written in 1948. Things that we take for granted today - cameras everywhere we go, phones being tapped, bodies being scanned for weapons remotely - all of these things were described in graphic detail in Orwell's book.Now that we have the Internet and people spying on other people w/ webcams and people purposely setting up their own webcams to let others &quot;anonymously&quot; watch them, you can see how this culture can develop into the Orwellian future described in &quot;1984.&quot;If you've heard such phrases as &quot;Big Brother,&quot; &quot;Newspeak,&quot; and &quot;thought crime&quot; and wondered where these phrases came from, they came from this incredible, vivid and disturbing book.Winston Smith, the main character of the book is a vibrant, thinking man hiding within the plain mindless behavior he has to go through each day to not be considered a thought criminal. Everything is politically correct, children defy their parents (and are encouraged by the government to do so) and everyone pays constant allegiance to &quot;Big Brother&quot; - the government that watches everyone and knows what everyone is doing at all times - watching you shower, watching you having sex, watching you eat, watching you go to the bathroom and ultimately watching you die.This is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Here is the book that first got me thinking about politics and philosophy.This is Orwell's dystopia of how he feared the world would become run by a group of cahooting despots by 1984.The main character, Winston Smith, lives in London in a dictatoeship run by \\"big brother\\". In this state there is no love but love for big brother. There is no excitment but patriotism. Chocolate is rationed and orgasms are banned. In this world smith somehow manages to fall in love.. and that's just the start of his problems.1984 warns us to be wary of those who might take our freedom whilst trying to convince us we are actually gaining extra liberty. Buy it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it's an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the \\"Kindle edition\\" of this great novel. Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences. It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Six years ago I was in a bookshop and on the shelf I saw a copy of George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. I had often heard people mention this novel on TV in political discussions and so on without really knowing what they mean't. Out of curiosity I decided to buy the book and see what it was like. I quite enjoyed it, and later that year we had to read it for Year 12 English. What I found interesting were the reactions of the other kids. Some liked it, others found it boring, uneventful or irrelevant. I remember one boy saying: &quot;But 1984 was nothing like that!&quot; The point about this novel is that it isn't supposed to be like a Nostradamus prophecy. George Orwell was writing about the social conditions that existed at the time in which he was living. Shortages, censorship, government red tape and the manipulation of popular opinion. I'm not overly concerned with the book's issues of politics or whether it's been proved inacurrate or not. I like to think of this as the story of an &quot;alternative&quot; 1984, a look at how different the world might be if history went in a different direction. Other books that explore this theme are &quot;The Man In The High Castle&quot; and &quot;Fatherland&quot; which are both set in worlds where the Nazis had won the Second World War. These books revel in historical inaccuracy. I think &quot;1984&quot; still has some relevance though. Especially the way the media alter people's view of the world by deciding what we should and shouldn't see, or the way newspapers &quot;enhance&quot; photographs. An example that comes to mind is when a newspaper altered a photo of the killer Martin Bryant by putting more shadow around his eyes to make this ordianary-looking man look psychotic. George Orwell was right about the idea of people being under constant surveillance, now that hidden cameras abound, a device more subtle and unobtrusive than the telescreen. Even though we're not all wearing blue overalls and worshipping a demi god, free will is being undermined in a more insidious way. This novel has made an impact on other writers, particularly Anthony Burgess. He wrote a novel called &quot;1985&quot;. The beginning of that novel descibes his version of how the world of Big Bother, Ingsoc and the Thought Police came about. This isn't a sequel, more of a reaction to the former book. In conclusion &quot;1984&quot; is an interesting book of a world that might have been, and might still be."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"For as long as I live I will always remember the day I finished \\"1984,\\" the first time I read it, while seated in the back of my high school trigonometry class. Inconsolable, I gazed over the last five words - completely devastated - and sobbed uncontrollably.In the ten or more times I have reread it since, I was no less shocked and shattered by the book's conclusion. Ostensibly a cautionary tale about a midlevel bureaucrat assigned to help reduce the number of words in the dictionary, \\"1984\\" is the tragic story of Winston Smith, a freethinking, middle aged man, who through glimmers of a childhood memories and clandestine visits to \\"prole\\" neighborhoods (newspeak for poor), radically tries to reconcile life in a totalitarian nanny state.With the omnipresent hum of the tele-screen always present, Winston is the perfect party patsy, saluting the authorities and seething with anger at the daily \\"two minutes hate\\" that secretly leave our hero wondering who is the Emmanuel M. Goldstein, the object of the government's loathing.When despite medical problems too gruesome to recount and enough secret spies to fill a Le Carre novel, Winston Smith conjures up enough optimism to pursue a romantic relationship with Julia, \\"1984\\" takes on a frightening turn. A devoted (or maybe not)? member of the Junior Anti-Sex League, whose signature emblem is the form-fitting sash that hugs seductively around her waistline, Julia is perhaps not the refuge Winston seeks. Or is she?Without destroying the truly devastating ending, I would wholeheartedly recommend 1984 to anyone who is interested in politics, language, romance and government.Yes, you may be left devastated by the book's last five words, but you will certainly be left with more to think about than drying your tears. - Regina McMenamin"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Most people read 1984 when in high school; it's an accessible classic, with plenty of shock interest as well as literary value. I'm reviewing 1984 here for those who may already have read it. The overall theme of oppression and the fear of totalitarianism is well known; but there are underlying themes that are interesting reading indeed.For example, the excerpts of &quot;the Book&quot;, purported to have been written by the underground resistance under Goldstein (or by the Party itself, if we are to believe O'Brian) is a mouthpiece for his social philosophy. In the fragment of three chapters, the ruling class, middle class and proletariat class (high, middle, low) are pitted in an eternal cycle where the high seek to exlude all others, the middle to achieve high status, and the low to simple create havoc and complete upheaval. Take a look if you haven't read this part of the book carefully. It's mighty interesting.Winston's relationship to O'Brian is also fascinating; the enigmatic O'Brian, Inner Party member and intellectual, has a fatal attraction for Winston--even more so than his passive affair with Julia. And when O'Brian breaks him in the Ministry of Truth, it is as much a surrender of love as it is a brainwashing. The interaction of Winston Smith and his persecutor is a uniquely written relationship.If you haven't re-read 1984 in a while, and especially if you read it when you were young, it's a great book to revisit."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of those classics that I never got around to reading while in high school (it was required, but I just didn't read it ;)... At the request of a colleague I picked this book up last year and was blown away by point of the book. In the chaotic and unclear times we live in, I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to understand what the point of the elite is and what the point of government is. Everything is about control and power ... AND KEEPING IT. We live in the novel 1984 ... and that's scary. Should be required reading for all Americans."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Reading it in high school didn't have the impact it was supposed to. Like most classics they aren't appreciated until later in life. For me that came in 1994.This classic is about government interference in our lives. It is a jab at the soviet system then, under Stalin. It was easy to draw parallels between the ever-increasing politically correct language and the language that kept evolving in \\"1984.\\" New words like \\"herstory\\" instead of history seemed absurd. I too felt that government and society were encroaching on my privacy and freedom of speech gradually.The irony is that \\"1984\\" does not have to be about the political left; it can also be about the political right. Our present government is spying on us in violation of the law. People who challenge our government are called traitors. New phrases of \\"flip-flop,\\" and \\"cut and run\\" are used by politicians to increase social and political pressure. These are new words and phrases that keep evolving just like the language evolves in \\"1984.\\" Our government repeatedly makes statements to keep its citizens in a state of fear. Americans can now be locked up as enemy combatants without due process.This is what makes this book such a classic and so timeless. The ink, paper and pen are replaced by the keyboard. The screen is replaced by the one you're are looking at right now.Are we going to end up like Winston and be tortured? May I have some victory gin please?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Having just read BRAVE NEW WORLD and some other books for school, I can honestly say that 1984 by Orwell is the scariest, deepest, most interesting, and undoubtedly the best book I've ever read, with the possible exception of BARK OF THE DOGWOOD. When I started it, I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I couldn't pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I've finally somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It's ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it's at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I've ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which utterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can't be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it's not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe. You'll never hear the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; again, without chills going down you're spine, and fear filling every corner of your being. You must also read LORD OF THE FLIES for another chilling portrait of society gone wrong."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This books is a classic! It is very visionary and rightly predicts some societal trends towards totalitarianism. It is highly pessimistic, so don't expect a happy ending!!!!I disbelieve the claims that this book is written against religion. In the book, the Ruling Party, which is viewed negatively, is against religion--as we would define it. I find it much more probable to take the simple interpretation--it is written against political totalitarianism. Sure, atheists might like to have a good book like 1984 to trump their cause, but this book can not be understood properly within its literal/historical context without realizing that it strongly eludes to Soviet-style Communism and political totalitarianism in general."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book in high school but never really appreciated it till just recently. With the passage of the Homeland Security Bill, I thought I'd better refresh my memory of this book. And this book is scarier than any Stephen King book ~~ it's scary because our future has arrived. With Big Brother watching our every move ...The book is a reflection upon past times as well as the future ~~ it's a history of mankind. It is about power. It is about control ~~ one man over another. It is about power through total submission ~~ submersion of the self. It is not about the greater good of life or mankind. It is man at its very worst. Orwell took a deep look into despair and wrote bluntly about it. The surface of it is Big Brother watching every move you make ~~ till you get into the book and realize there is much more at sake. And it's so well-written. No matter that I wanted to put the book down and ignore it, I couldn't. I had to read it to the last page. And it's the scariest book I have ever read.1-9-03"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I've recently finished reading Nineteen Eighty-Four, and it has to be one of the best books I've ever read. It's about the life of Winston Smith, who lives in a alternate future, where the world is ruled by power-hungry socialists who control every aspect of people's lives, right down to their very thoughts.Winston believes that he remembers a happier time before the revolution, when people were free, wars could be won, and laws dictated governments. He decides to rebel against the system, despite the threat of being killed, by starting a journal.This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It offers insights not only into the possibility of a horrible future, but also into a confusing present. An example of this is how the book introduces the idea of \\"doublethink,\\" a practice where a person holds two contradictory beliefs at once, and can still believe both. Orwell leads us to believe that this is but an evil communist idea, but in fact, he is satirizing the propaganda of our own \\"free world.\\"All in all, I immensely enjoyed what is undoubtedly the author's biggest masterpiece, and would instantly recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Not for the faint of heart, this book grips you and won't let go. Although written in the 40s (?), Orwell's message of the horrors of what might happen under a socialist government has not staled through the years. I had always heard the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;, but never understood all that those simple words entailed until I cracked this one open for a read. What I found was an experience very hard to forget. The description of Winston's world is surprisingly vivid, and one can almost feel the &quot;telescreens&quot; silently watching your every move. The torture scenes and mind games the O'Brien brings along about a third of the way in are nothing if not chilling. And then there's the abrupt and haunting ending... I'm not ashamed to say that when I finished I hurled this book across the room in anger, much to the surprise of my family. A classic that I hope will stay on reading lists for years to come, this book should be required reading for all those who considered themselves &quot;educated&quot;. Pick it up.

What I really want to review are the reviews of some reviewers from Wstern countries. They like the book, but their reviews are of the kind 'This is a book about a hypothetical totalitarian dictatorshp, ..., etc.' What is wrong, is the word 'hypothetical' This book could have been titled 'Bits of the History of the Communist World (albeit a little allegorical)'I don't know what people born in the West understand in this book. Not much perhaps. The very fact that Orwell is the ONLY Westerner I know of to have written an accurate description (though a bit allegorical) of communism in practice, suggests that most Westerners couldn't understand what was happening in the communist world. I suggest that they read it for what it is: History cast into an allegorical novel.Now an example or two. There was a famous picture in history textbooks in communist countries. Lenin in a podium holding a speech, his hand streched to the masses listening. On his left you could see Stalin. Everyone of my age has seen this picture. What most people haven't seen, though, is an older version of it: Lenin holding a speech, and on his left, Trotsky. (Winston's job right)Now my country (Albania) was great friends with USSR, until 1961, that is. Albania broke up with USSR (considering USSR a traitor of real socialism), to advance real socialism together with China. Not for ever of course - in 1978 China became a traitor of real socialism, too, having in fact never been really socialist. There was a famous picture in Albanian history textbooks. The Albanian B.B. (Enver Hoxha) was denouncing the betrayal of real socialism by the Soviet leadership. I have seen all three versions of this painting: In the first one, Enver Hoxha had Chou EnLai on one side and Mehmet Shehu (Albanian Prime Minister) on the other. This was valid between 1961 and 1978. When China betrayed socialism in 1978, Chou Enlai disappeared from the painting, and someone else took his stead. This second version lasted until 1981. That's because in 1981 Mehmet Shehu became a traitor, and 'was suicided'. So he disappeared from the painting, too. This is the last version of it. By the way, the painting stood in the Albanian National Art Gallery. Many people must have seen all three versions of it in original.I could wrie a book longer than 1984, describing how accurate 1984 is.Read 1984 as a history of the communist world; it is valid even for the four decades after Orwell's death.Aleksander Coho"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When reading this book, one is dragged through the emotions of love, hate, betrayal, despair, and utter, unabashed rage. This novel tells a story of negative utopia in which the government knows all and sees all. The citizens are worthless except as workers. Winston and Julia go through a secret love affair despite better judgement. The use of allegory for socialism is impressive. Many parallels, obvious and subtle, can be drawn between the two. The story is enthralling and the book is hard to put down.The reader may feel safe from the situation in this book, but it is not impossible. Of course, 1984 has come and gone, but we must realize that such situations are possible. That is why this book deserves 5 stars. 1984 uses exaggeration to prove a point. Freedom and capitalism are definately worth the drawbacks. We see that if we give the government our freedom, we will eventually become slaves to the government.Orwell was brilliant in this work. We are forewarned. Everyone should read this book (at least once) and try to take a lesson from it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book 5 years ago for an English book report. I've never been able to forget it. It's the haunting account of Winston Smith, an employee of the Ministry of Truth who hasn't forgotten the past, and who wants to change the future.However, Big Brother is watching him. Try as he might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the government.Published in 1949 during the Cold War, Orwell puts a spin on communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold. I shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Oceania, even in the slighest bit.Highly recommended book for the whole world to read. Let's hope we never come to this."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book has, quite literally, changed my life. After reading it, my outlook on life is completely different. This book opened up my mind to the importance of the individual in society and the true evils of totalitarianism (when done incorrectly). This is scarier than any &quot;horror&quot; book ever written, because almost all of it is possible (and much of it has already happened). A true masterpiece, this should be required reading for every human being on the planet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Many of us use Orwell's book for our own purposes, to forward our own ideas and political positions. Even though Orwell was speaking quite specifically about a particular socialist experiment, communism, and a particularly horrible totalitarian gulag-state - Stalin's Soviet Union - his book has such a universal scope that it can be squeezed and pushed and pulled about until it can be made to fit almost any political system anywhere. In this way great works are often de-constructed to make them useful to whomever wants to make a point.A lot of us here are likening the world of Orwell's \\"1984\\" to current life in the U.S. While there are definitely elements of this overreaching intrusion into our private lives today in the United States, be aware of how much farther down that road so many other countries have already gone (and down which we are very unlikely to go). Start with the Islamic nations where the Mullahs exort the masses to their Two Minutes Of Hate towards us every Friday in the mosques. In Britain, under a Labour Government, right now, there are not only surveillance cameras - called CCTV cameras - on virtually every corner in the cities, they are now beginning to install microphones as well (http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/global/main.jhtml?xml=/global/2005/05/04/nmic04.xml) starting in the council flats. They directly say it is to monitor \\"anti-social\\" behavior. This is the insidious beginnings of \\"1984.\\" Well past what we are enduring and in the very country from which Orwell sprang and from which our own ideas of civil liberties originated.In all the world's dictatorships, from Cuba to North Korea to virtually all the Arab states, there is one version or another of the Thought Police. They may be religious police as they are in Iran and Saudi Arabia. They may be undercover military police as they are in North Korea. They may just be your neighbors, as they were in Mao's China (and for all we know, still are to some extent, at least). But in all these places the horror of Orwell's vision is much more advanced than in the U.S. People actually are killed. In Iraq there are still 275,000 \\"disappeards,\\" people who simply ceased to exist under the brutal totalitarian regime of Saddam Hussein, himself a great admirer of Stalin. (I didn't make that number up, btw, Amnesty International did) If you want more proof, just ask a Palestinian homosexual about what constitutes \\"anti-social behavior\\" in the Territories. Actually, if you want to ask a Palestinian homosexual that question you will have to go to Tel Aviv because that is where they all live. Palestinian gays are either dead, in prison, or in Israel.We might be well advised to also be aware that in many other places in the world the true reality of 1984's dystopic vision has been in place for decades, and citizens continue to suffer real torture, imprisonment, and death for things which Americans take for granted as being protected under our Constitution. Yes, there are some egregious violations that are going on here under the guise of the Patriot Act, but they are constantly under fire from our own legal system and from private NGOs and civil liberties watchdogs. Imagine having these kinds of groups in, say, Burma: It's instant imprisonment - just ask Aung San Suu Kyi. What is going on here is nothing when compared to the terrors vistited daily upon millions of people around the world who would only love the chance to come to this country. I don't suspect any of them would think they had strayed into Room 101. ekw"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A great book a little scary with the idea... that BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING... although we always think of who wathing us in public the idea of being watched in work and in your house kinda brings an idea of the Nazi Gestapo back terrorizing you in your house and in public if they think your against the government body."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston is a party member in a government that controls the very thoughts of its citizens.

While being fiction most of the book is a political satire. The most similar book that I have read to it is actually Jihad Vs. McWorld. It is the first fiction book I have read that valued the importance of language and the &quot;Love impulse&quot;. This is seen even today in advertisements. The importance of the name Big Brother is that it is sononomus with the Christian Father and Son figure although not implicitly stated. Newspeak also culminates the impulse. In 1984 the characters follow the teachings of IngSoc, which by looking at it seems harmless but it a abreviation of English Socialism that can hold connotation's in peoples mind. The same techniques are used in modern government and consumerism. The story is also compelling, and shows both a triumph and a failure of love under certains circumstances."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I read this book at first it was very dense and a little complicated. But as I got farther into the book I realized I had actually started becoming part of the book. I realized that I knew what would happen before it happened. Oddly enough this mad the book even more interesting instead of boring. As I finished the book I tried to do what I always do; look for what the author was trying to tell me. Now it's obvious that he was warning against the effect of communism. Yet he was also exposing a human need that most of us don't recognize. Orwell was trying to tell us that all of us have a deep need for something to be under. The Party in this book was looking for someone to have them under control and to tell them what to believe in. They were looking for something material to represent to them the power they believed in. An example of this in actual life would be when people look to the priest's to tell them how to live their lives instead of looking straight to God. The reason they do this is because they cannot see, hear, touch, taste, or smell God. So they take a human being and idolize them as if they were the only link they had towards God. This is the human need that Orwell was trying to relate to us."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book 1984, is the story about a man by the name of Winston Smith.

Always switching alliances and fighting over the same territories. There is no truth in the past. Every person is taught the method of \\"doublethink\\". The method of doublethink is this, you are told something is true and has always been that way.

Where you are discontent or you have rebellious feelings. Once you commit thought crime, you are made to disappear.In conclusion, I feel you should read this book, 1984.

This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy.

The book is centered in a dystopian society. While it is a mockery of any totalitarian system (mainly the Stalinist-era Soviet Union?), it also predicted some of the horrors of capitalist countries. Not only does Orwell write some serious political philosophy in his work (e.g. how the lower class will always reamin in the same situation regardless of the current regime), he also shows a different side of human nature that is at once dark, calculating and mistrusting. But there is some hope in the book. There are few writers who can compare to Orwell, both in his writing style as well as his insightful content. This book is a true classic in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is easy to see why Orwell envisioned the world he did in 1948; the year he wrote the immortal \\"1984.\\" The world was already in fact, engulfed in a period of total warfare. (Many historians now consider WWI & WWII to be a single event - a first and second act, if you will, of the most deadly struggle in the history of the earth, with a cooling down period or intermission, in between...).Even WWII never actually resulted in any kind of resolution or conclusion, but rather, settled into an uneasy \\"truce\\" involving a new confrontation that rose out of the ashes of post-war Europe and Asia, between Soviet Russia, China, and their communist allies, and the United States, and (what remained) of western powers - namely, France & Britain.The events of Korea were looming large and the cold war was about to get very hot, played out on the stage of the Korean Penninsula. Framed as a \\"UN intervention\\" supporting South Korea against invasion from the North, the Korean war was less than a year away when \\"1984\\" was first published: an event that was nothing short of a direct military confrontation between the United States and China and the Soviet Union which nearly became WWIII.Moreover, a substantial percentage of the world's population was already under the direct control (China & USSR), or at the very least, the yoke (North Korea, Mongolia, Eastern Europe, etc.,) of oppressive, bloody supreme dictatorships led by cult-of-personality leaders in Mao and Stalin.Meanwhile, American Democracy faced its greatest crisis since the Civil War, during the Korean conflict. General MacArther - a figure beloved by the American people of an almost \\"God-like\\" status challenged President Truman by publicly advocating the use of nukes against China and escalating Korea into an all-out war with the Communists.In the ensuing showdown the American people and press sided with MacArthur, villainizing Truman. As we all know, MacArthur, dismissed by Truman, stepped down and peacefully abdicated his position. In retrospect, the wisdom of Truman's policy was obvious, but fortunatley for all the world, the maligned president, Truman - despite the frightening times - kept his sanity, stuck to his guns, and made the politically unpopular decision of keeping Korea an isolated conflict and standing up to MacArthur...If not for Truman (and MacArthur's decision to obey the Commander and Chief), it is frightening to imagaine just how close the world Orwell predicted could've come to fruition.Orwell's analysis and predictions of the fate of human nature, society, and politics contained in 1984 are absolutely piercing and frightening. This book should be required reading (where it isn't already) in U.S. high schools and universities (or for that matter, the world's educational institutions). Orwell teaches us, in shocking, disturbing prose, that the freedoms and liberties that we all take for so much granted everyday, are much more precarious than we presume. Indeed, at times, their fate hangs in the balance. The price of protecting freedom and liberty depends on nothing less than the eternal vigilance of an informed, invested, and educated populace.1984, in my opinion, stands as the most important novel written in the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell was a fascinating, sad, and powerful read. It really provoked the reader to think, realize, and become aware of certain realities present in our world today. This book was written in 1949 and was Orwell's prediction, or fantasy, of what the world would be like in 1984. Although the story was a bit far-fetched and extreme, eye-opening parallels to some situations that our modern day world has faced can be seen. Oceania was always at war and constantly switched enemies and allies. It didn't matter who they were at war with so long as they were the dominating power in the world. I thought this correlation with Orwell's prediction was very true of the way our country runs. The book followed Winston as he tried to defy the government's complete control over the public. Little did he know that the power of Big Brother ran far deeper than he could have imagined. As citizens of the United States of America, I think it is important for us to read this book. We need to be aware of how easily people can be manipulated by a great power. This book presents that matter in an intricately woven story that really invokes a connection between the reader and the characters. The reader begins with great hope that Winston will be able to resist Big Brother's control but as the story progresses and hope diminishes, the reader begins to get a sense of reality and really wakes up to realize that once a large force is in motion, it can be unstoppable. 1984 by George Orwell is a must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Somehow I missed reading this in school, but always heard good things about it, so when I saw it lying around, I decided I should read it. I thought that the concepts in the book would be pretty interesting, but I didn't expect as much from the plot and characters.The world created by Orwell is very disturbing. The way the past is changed is especially frightening, along with the idea that thoughts can be changed by limiting the vocabulary needed to express them. I also thought the character of Winston Smith was very well written along with the plot as he becomes a thought criminal.The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it seemed like the Party would have an impossible job trying to keep up with the sheer volume of things that would constantly need to be changed in order to maintain whatever \\"reality\\" is current. Also, I couldn't see why anyone would really want to be a member of the Outer Party as opposed to one of the proles, who seemed to have a little more freedom. Finally, I never really understood the \\"why\\" of the Party, even when it was explained in the story, it didn't seem very appealing to me, at least not enough that everyone would be able to be brainwashed into maintaining it. However, I suppose if crimestop and doublethink and other concepts described in the book actually worked, then no one may have thought about these things enough to care.Overall, this is an excellent book that really makes you think about some pretty scary things. I definitely think this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It's absolutely amazing how a book that's truly innovative and insightful can remain completely relevant for such a long period of time.After items like the Patriot Act and the war in Iraq, you can't help but ask yourself questions about the government's responsibility in regards to your safety vs. your personal freedom.I can't possibly recommend this book highly enough.

I found Aldous Huxley's Brave New World a far more compelling read, or if you want a real dystopean nightmare try Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegutt. 1984 starts well, but by the final chapters it seems we are reading Orwell's own anti totalitarean attitudes and the story has been left to the side. This book is worth reading, but I wouldn't accept other reviewers comments that this is the best book in the world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am going to go against the grain with this one. There are many other reviews of the exact details of the plot, so I'll just make a few comments as to why I think the book is limited in its overall social value, particularly in its assumptions about human nature. The book is set in a world of political totalitarianism that is so extreme as to become patently impossible.Whilst it may be true that the book serves as an educational warning against totalitarian thinking, and while yes it is well written and widely regarded as a classic and has numerous insights into the workings of political totalitariaism, I personally thought this book far too limited in its perspective of how human nature and society actually interact to justify its solid reputation.It is, in a nutshell, a very absorbing but deeply fatalistic analysis of political totalitarianism. The trouble is, is that this extremely fatalistic perspective is such a limited picture of how people actually think and operate, and how society actually functions, as to become self-defeating. For example: a large assumption pervades the book- human nature and society is largely fluid and 'infinitely malleable'. This so-called extreme malleability, of course can be co-opted by psychopaths/etc into various forms of totalitarianism. But this process, of course, is not inevitable, nor is it as pervasive in its most extreme versions as Mr Orwell seems to think.In a nutshell, the books assumes that human nature, and biological forces in general, do not play a large part in society and politics. Mr Orwell philosophy and activism during his life was very much of the political left, and his fatalistic analysis of totalitarianism in this book is itself, deeply biased towards the left.A curious irony in the book is that Mr Orwell creates a world that transcends the relationship between politics and human nature, in much the same way political ideology and totalitarian thinking does. It is a self-fulfilling philosophical stance, but not in accord, in my opinion, with reality. It serves little purpose, for example, in analysing totalitarianism by committing, in turn, the same mistake totalitarians make-exaggeration and over-simplification.The books general negativity is rooted in the same political ideologies it is trying to expose and warn against. It fails to appreciate the nature or influence of underlying biological forces which shape, and are co-opted by political forces. For example, the moralisitic fallacy is wrong because what \\"ought\\", to be is not necasarilly what \\"is\\", which is a strong subtext in the views of both the resistance ('brotherhood') and power brokers in this book.To gain a different perpsective, to that generally assumed by Mr Orwell, and to show why 1984 could only ever be a passing socio-political fad, I would recommend The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker. Societies do undergo revolutionary cultural transitions, and yes, these often become co-opted by psychopaths and dictators as a social system (often under the notion of 'the Blank Slate', together with the 'moralistic fallacy'), but these social systems inevitably fail and subside-primarily because of the grounding of human nature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book.

The novel is set in a dystopian world, where the government rules everything the people do. The government has placed many rules on the people and if they break these rules, they are taken by the thought police and tortured. It warns people against the thought of a fully functional totalitarian society. In the review from AudioFile, they state \\"Once considered futuristic, it now conjures fear because of how closely it fits the reality of contemporary times.\\" The government that is now in control of Cuba, is like that of the government in control in the book 1984. In Cuba, Fidel Castro controls what the people do and how much they make, by communism. He also has the secret police, to install fear into the citizens in Cuba, to keep them from revolting. Cuba may be fully functioning, but there are a lot of people opposed to Fidel's reign and others that don't want him to be in control any more.In a totalitarian society everyone works for the common good of the government, in turn working for themselves because they live under that government. In M. Alcat \\"bel 78\\"'s review, he states that \\"Freedom was only total obedience to the Party, and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Party.\\" This is something that is a huge aspect of 1984. Winston, the main character, seems to love Julia more then he loves the Party, which gets him into most of his trouble. He also doesn't follow the rules of the Party and eventually gets caught by the Thought Police. Just like Hurdle stated in a Kid's Review \\"After Winston bought the journal from the antiques store it was fairly hard to see if he would get caught and arrested because buying that item was illegal.\\" Winston almost wanted to break the rules in order to see if he would get caught or not. When he is caught his some what freedom is taken away from him and he is forced to give up all that he wanted in order to get it back.The novel 1984, although being an awesome book, against totalitarianism, is not the book for all. I found the book to be boring and I know that I am not the type of person who likes books about dystopias or imperfect worlds.-N.J.Baptiste"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In the past I've been reluctant to read 1984 because I thought it was \\"good for me,\\" like medicine. And the novel seems to have become very dear to one side of the political spectrum lately, the left, which enhanced my suspicion that 1984 was going to be a dreary exposition of an oppressed society not worth living in. I'd also seen the British movie released in the year 1984, which was good, but dreary, as I remembered it. But I sensed that there was something wrong with Michael Moore's quote of Orwell in Fahrenheit 911, which might mean that there was something wrong with our current embrace of Orwell, and that gave me the final push to read the book. To my everlasting gratitude, I found that 1984 is one of the most human novels I have ever read. It has a moving love story (which I had not remembered at all from the movie), and it has more than enough challenges to all forms of politics, left and right. The book is especially challenging if you do not read it merely as a political commentary but also as an examination of the human soul, particularly your own. It is the kind of book that delves so unflinchingly with cruelty and evil that it's hard to put down but also difficult to endure. It will leave you shattered; a truly great work.The context of the novel was helpful to me when I did examine its politics. I won't give away the plot, but I will talk about the society Orwell lays out in the beginning of the book.Orwell wrote at a time when it seemed that communism was on the march everywhere. Eastern Europe, North Korea and China, the world's most populous nation, had all recently fallen. The year after the publication of 1984, communist nations invaded both Tibet and South Korea, though the latter was not conquered; communism would not spread by full-scale invasion again until South Vietnam fell in 1975, but in the meantime, socialist and Marxist revolution would continue to threaten everywhere. Orwell saw the incipient Cold War of his time, with good reason, as the kind of perpetual warfare that is described in 1984. He felt that the democracies of the recently finished World War had not left behind their wartime command economies, and this was true in many ways; he probably believed that they would remain that way if they seriously meant to embark on an arms race or war with the communist world. The U.S. had moved toward socialism with the New Deal, and after the war with Hitler it had become a kind of New Deal big brother to a ravaged world; and Orwell wrote 1984 while living under a Labour government; so if we try to judge his thoughts from his novel, he probably felt that an ongoing state of war would lead the countries of the West into the kind of dictatorship seen in Russia, one that was socialist in name, but that really betrayed the ideals of socialism. (Orwell considered himself a socialist but was critical of communism). In that way, he saw England, the U.S. and Australia forming a society, Oceania, little different from Russia's or China's. The novel reports that atomic warfare occurred in the 1950s, and such a thing in real life might very well have produced suffering, privation, revolution and dictatorship throughout the world.So when the novel opens in the year 1984, the West has essentially gone down the road of warfare, which has destroyed all the free elements of its societies, such as private life and free markets. Orwell was essentially criticizing the left for going down the road of communism and not genuine socialism, as he saw it.Yet it's easy to find places where the novel challenges the right of today. For instance, Orwell's description of doublethink seems to explain how Saddam Hussein's government, openly built upon Stalin's model, knew that the American army was approaching Baghdad in March 2003, while describing the situation, in press conferences, as the exact opposite; yet George Bush has had a similar tendency to speak about the situation in Iraq as if things are going just fine, when clearly they are not.Orwell says that in the world of tomorrow, the war is meant to be perpetual, and this does seem to indict both the Cold War and the war on terror. Michael Moore quotes 1984 on the concept of perpetual war, but the quote comes from the movie of 1984, not the novel. The novel itself says that \\"the object of the [perpetual] war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory.\\" Fahrenheit 911, and the movie of 1984, both avoid this phrase, since American interventions in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq do look like conquests of territory.Orwell writes in 1984 that the societies of the future do not ever try to conquer distant lands, and restrict themselves to lands on their borders, because contact with the enemy by millions of their own soldiers would run the risk of genuine, human contact with people described in wartime propaganda as brutes and animals -- and all this would reveal the lies of the Party. Orwell was right about totalitarian societies; all have invaded nations on their own borders. They have killed tens of millions at home or close to home. The U.S. and Britain, by contrast, have exported both armies and peaceful civilians, and their press, to far-flung societies, often literally on the other side of the world.There is much here that the left could embrace, but much that challenges the left as well. 1984 does not seem either to challenge or support the right of today in the same degree; it seems to me largely a book about the left, by a man of the left.As a critique of Western democracies, 1984 is very powerful, but I have read that Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is even better."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book has not much to say.

He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's &quot;Newspeak&quot; should include these additions: &quot;Propaganda is Truth&quot;; &quot;Truth is Absolute&quot;; &quot;Freedom springs from Fear&quot;; &quot;Extremism is Virtue.&quot; This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction.

I hated having reasonably high expectations for a so-called classic, only to have to suffer through a drab chain of non sequitur events, thoroughly lacking any explanations at all.- Why did Julia fancy Winston, when he (per his own admission) was barely average looking? In fact, he didn't having any redeeming qualities at all. Orwell builds up some interest by strongly suggesting an ulterior motive to her purported love interest, but turns out that she really just wanted sex (how exciting!/sarcasm).- Passing a note with \\"I love you\\" scribbled on it to a total stranger. Really? What is she, 5 years old?- All the 'truths' about the world that the protagonist lives in are revealed via the long and detailed THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM. But later, O'Brien claims that the manifesto is false, written by himself. So the reader consumes those pages and pages of detail, formulating an elaborate mental picture of the novel's world...only to be told later that it is totally false. What was the point of all that detail then?- OMG! Can Winston really trust O'Brien...considering that he's, you know, a member of party whose prime modus operandi is deception? Oh so O'Brien was lying all along and it was all a trap?? Never saw that coming...shocked!!- How could O'Brien have possibly known that Winston had mentally considered not incinerating a newspaper article once? Can the thought police read minds also? Why no explanation given for this?- For a party that doesn't think twice about liquidating political enemies or dissenters, why go through the long, torturous process to brainwash Winston? Why not just get rid of him and render him another unperson?- So Julia and Winston broke down and betrayed each other. Wow, how could they..give in all that torture (described in excruciating detail, pun intended)? Winston loses, Big Brother wins. Story over! No deviation from the norm. No change to the status quo. No triumph of the underdog. Ok, I get it's a dystopian novel. How about at least a respectable struggle, perhaps just barely and tragically failing in the end after coming so close? ANYTHING that makes the reader care about the protagonists, or makes them special, or distinguishes them from the throngs of other miserable souls in said dystopia? Nope!These are just a few of the most blatant ones. There is nothing redeeming about this novel...an insipid plot, nothing endearing or even remotely interesting about any of the characters, no build-up, no unexpected twists which you couldn't see coming from a mile away. In fact, the novel has nothing going for it other than pure shock value. Which it expertly cashed in upon by being released at a time when anti-communist sentiments were at their paranoid apex. In other words, it's the cold war era literary version of a B-rated slasher flick. Really, if you do decide to read this book, scrutinize it objectively, and honestly ask yourself how you'd rate it if you DIDN'T have any prior knowledge of Orwell or this title."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member of the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania.

I just finished \\"1984\\" a few hours ago and throughout its reading I had \\"blasphemous\\" thoughts like, \\"This book is crazy.\\" And, \\"Orwell was crazy.\\" And \\"Orwell was a sadist AND crazy.\\" Blasphemous thoughts because how dare anyone criticize such a \\"classic\\" and such a genius as George Orwell! He was a \\"genius\\" alright, a genius at hoodwinking people into thinking he wrote a literary masterpiece. And readers please don't tell me I didn't understand the book. I think I did. I just thought the extreme hyperbole and incredulity was just way, way \\"over the top\\" for any serious denunciation of the \\"totalitarian\\" form of government.As stupid and mean-spirited as our species is at times, I think it was ridiculous to cast \\"mankind\\" in such a low light as did Orwell in this book. Long before anything like Orwell's \\"Big Brother\\" has attained such an unconscionable level of cruelity and sadistic power \\"it\\", I'm quite sure, will be overthrown. The human mind is far stronger, rational, and resilient I think than Orwell imagines it. It IS unfortunately quite malleable but not INFINITELY malleable, which I think it would have to be for such a nightmare as \\"1984\\" to become a reality.The most sickening part of the book in my estimation, while the graphic descriptions of Winston's many tortures are sickening enough, is when he honestly and without the slightest modicum of doubt whatsoever proclaims that he LOVES \\"Big Brother\\". Human beings are BETTER than this, and I don't think they can ever be so controlled, brainwashed and manipulated as Orwell imagines they can be.I think the genius of Orwell, if such can be said of him , is that above all he wanted to SHOCK his readers. And in this he certainly succeeded. An Abstract Expressionist painter named Jasper Johns did much the same when he painted \\"False Start\\", which essentially is nothing more than splotches of different colored paints splattered on a canvas. I think the painting is garbage, but it was sold in 2006 to an American hedgefund manager for $80 million dollars."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984: Been there, done that; Orwell has not. I have always attempted novels that do not seem to be the most appealing, however, George Orwell's classic, was in short a disappointment. The book was repetitive, slow moving, and did not hold my interest at all. After finishing it, I was left with a feeling as though I had been ripped off. The general plot was clever, but the lack of interesting characters and events left the novel fruitless and boring. I tried to read the book as though it really was a prediction of the future, however, it was hard for me to understand how anyone could ever think the future would possibly be in such disarray. 1984 has the lay out of other Science Fiction novels including conformity, a heretic, and finally the heretic coming to terms with the conformity, but throughout the story, everything appeared fantastical and this made it hard to relate to. In addiction, the contradictions throughout the novel were frustrating. After the first three chapters I could only hope that Winston would be vaporized as soon as possible, rather I would have hoped to be vaporized as soon as possible. However, Orwell manages to hold out two hundred and forty-five pages before allowing Winston to make any sense of his pointless existence. The novel, in my opinion is a waste of energy, paper and ink. I cannot honestly give this book any merit. I would definitely NOT recommend it to any person with a sane mind."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book 1984 by George Orwell was in a way funny. It was somewhat odd and mysterious, but it was funny. It was funny because of how George Orwell viewed the future. He described secret organizations. I believe that this book was very good literature, but it gave a weird outlook on the year 1984. As an example George Orwell writes,&quot;Winston feared for his life that the thought police would track him down if he dared keep writing in the diary.&quot; Even so for a person who loves reading about what could have been and the odd ways history could have happened, this George Orwell classic is all for you, and I recommend it. For those that prefer a more realistic novel, like me, aim for another author and book of your choice."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"At the risk of being tarred and feathered for disliking a \\"classic...\\"Orwell was a philosopher trying to be a novelist, and in my opinion he failed at both. The first third of the book is painfully slow and plot-less, in the middle third Orwell gave up on expressing his ideas through plot and had his main character \\"read a book\\" about the Big Brother society, and the last third is brutal and depressing. I think Orwell would have done better to simply write the philosophy book he had his character read and forget about the boring, contrived plot he attempted to create. Also, sex is such a common metaphor throughout the book that it was practically a fourth main character.The only reason I gave the book two stars is because it made me think about the influence of the Holy Spirit. Orwell was not a Christian, and as such saw the possibility of a future with no morals, no absolutes, and a useless, broken human spirit. I kept thinking, \\"Even if society was like this, SOMEONE would still know truth and stand up for it.\\" The reason I believe that is because of the Holy Spirit and God's promise of a remnant. It is comforting to know that, no matter how bad our world gets, 1) man was still created in God's image and that image cannot be completely snuffed out, and 2) as long as the Holy Spirit and the church remains, there will always be those who recognize and stand up for truth. The Bible seems to indicate that the Holy Spirit and the church will someday be removed from the world, and the world of 1984 might not be too far off from what that could look like, except that I think it will be worse.

The setting of the book is Airstrip One, formerly London, England, and is ruled by a totalitarian ruler with the title Big Brother. The book is a commentary on communism. For example, the features of Big Brother are close to those of Stalin's, and their political group is referred to as the party. The story line follows a Winston Smith, who is wary of the party's rules and is thinking of rebellion. He first starts writing a diary, which is strictly illegal of the party. He meets up with two allies who share his quest, one a beautiful women and the other a member of the inner party, or the head of the group. But other than that, I can't say. This is as far as I've gotten before this review was dueWhat I enjoy about 1984 is the suspense. You are never quite sure about what is going to happen next. The plot is a bit slow in the first few pages, but then gets faster as the book goes on. As for the characters, they are people you can relate to and you can always picture them in your head.

If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it.

I was taken back at how intense it turned out to be; socially, politically, psychologically and existentially. And it really gives one the awful nausea that Sartre spoke of and the angst of Kierkegaard, the existential despair, emptiness, loneliness, the awful outcome that leaves you with a sour pain in the pit in your stomach. But that is only if you remain too attached and subjective. On the other hand, if you can detach yourself from this book and view it objectively, it is the most meaningful and explanatory lesson in awareness to the distinct and very real possibility of a utopian world gone bad. This book is a valid warning.The book is brilliant, portraying an authoritarian government that recreates all thought, erases all history, negating it all into solipsism, that all reality is simply the creation of man - The Party of Ingsoc- and in doing so melts into a radical blind relativism. Ingsoc, the Party of Big Brother which rules, also attempts to create an entirely new form of language - Newspeak - that reduces the variations of meanings to prevent people from independent thinking. In this new language, the word called, \\"Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them . . The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.\\"It's ironic, but ultimately the fundamentalists are blind relativists in that they violently enforce their view and then change to a completely new view - new history, and then re-enforce this view in staunch, one-sided fundamentalism. This is truly blind relativism, which is different from cultural relativism and pragmatism, where there can still be a limited form of relativism that retains values, but not in the world of Big Brother. This is important because there is a huge difference between mindless relativism and the compartmentalization of absolutes in pragmatism, which maintains value retention while tolerating cultural differences. But in Big Brother, all becomes a relativistic void for the Party, which uses hate, fear and torture to achieve its end goal, the goal of power; power for the Inner Party.The government of Orwell's 1984 is different from all the previous authoritarian governments, as it does not fool itself that it trying to help the people. At the end of the current edition is a short essay of Erich Fromm, with an analogy in comparison to two other negative utopian novels with three other positive utopian novels and how society went from such positive idealism to the recognition of negative possibilities in the direction of our future and how our responsibilities and the limited amount of time humanity has as a species to make the necessary changes towards heeding this warning and directing itself towards the positive outcome.Despite the outcome and utter despair the book leaves you with, the valuable lesson speaks for itself. And I think in America, we must recognize our free-market fundamentalist mentality, our military bullying and authoritarian nature that puts the dollar and large corporate control over the proletariat. We need to value Orwell's warning and work towards repairing the great democratic dream of a equalitarian society that puts the rights of the individual ahead of monetary gain and looks towards the preservation of our environment - to restore the ideas of Emerson, Whitman and James and pragmatist values of democratic government actively engaged by the educated working classes.The year 2005 represents a major time for America (Amerika) to wake up from the partisan, unilateral decisions of the Bush Administration's lone ranger policies, which include torture (congress just re-defined this word!) and lies. And in addition to the United States Imperialism, there is another major serious global development resembling Big Brother which has already begun; the WTO (World Trade Organization), well underway with a pseudo-democratic, secretive, powerful, small elite group of plutocrats (mostly United States corporations) enforcing global limits on protective government regulations, reducing environmental protections and proletariat rights, all so under a \\"newspeak\\" (rhetorical-beneficial) language of \\"free-trade.\\" Orwell has become a superior prophet over Nostradamus.\\"Is not a matter of whether the war is not real or if it is. Victory is not possible. The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. This new version is the past. And no different past can ever have existed. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects. And its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep the very structure of society in tact.\\" George Orwell, 1984\\"In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.\\" p. 156WAR IS PEACE - and great profits are gained by large corporate military contractors and the vast oil supply (Halliburton). The economic gain is not for the working class, but for the corporate elites and their private ownerships. Thus the government remains financed and ready for further imperial maneuvers.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY - and we now have tight security measures, wire tapping, censorship and the Patriot Act. All of this enslaves us and removes many of our liberties and private rights, all so for the sake of keeping our freedom secure, slavery to protect freedom. Ultimately, censorship prevents the working class from Socratic inquiry of government policies, thus the government remains in tact. Labor parties, Poplulists-Farmers, Feminists, African Americans/Civil rights, evironmental protections, minimum wage requirements and the working man and woman themselves loose their rights and voices of active participation. They are simply \\"prols,\\" while the corporate elite, the plutocrats increase their rule, working their way towards totality. Open Democracy and human rights die, aristocracy enslavement lives, all so to protect the freedom of the country.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH - and to remain in ignorance is keep the proletariat quietly content in his mediocre existence, either in poverty or struggle, ceasing the time, strength and desire for Socratic inquiry of government policies. The result; mindless flag waving nationalism. Ignorance masked under the newspeak of \\"Free Trade\\" and radical privatization without regulatory control leads to monopolistic corporate state owned society. And the flags keep waving. The breakup of a Hollywood couple takes the headlines, while WTO is quiet in the media background. The elite in Control increase and maintain strength. Ignorance is strength."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Through out the coarse of my reading carrier I must say that I have found only a few novels that may compare with &quot;1984&quot;. The cunning realism that is embedded upon every page is something truly worth reading. Personally as a writer I feel that after reading this novel I have grown and improved my own writing technique. Not to mention the actually genius involved in contemplating the elaborate world of restricted freedom and no piece of mind. George Orwell completely shatters all walls of possibilities when he introduces many variations of mass control as well as mass acceptance of lies. The complexity of the main character Winston Smith in itself is simply astonishing. So tragic and heart felt is his predicament that sympathy is quickly given to the fictional character. This is mostly because of the fact that certain freedoms that we have are taken for granted. While in &quot;1984&quot; the lack of freedom is equally accepted and taken for granted by the people of the novel. Which reminds us to think and judge for our selves what it is right.

This book was shocking to readers in 1948, but to those of us who have seen the Soviet Union and even modern day America, it is not really shocking. Oceana, in the book, has an exagerated toletarian system similar to Nazi Germany or Soviet Communism, but with the sexual attitude of the Shakers, or some other group that twists Christianity into a miserable heavy-handed religion. Obviously the author was writing based on events in his time. What is amazing is how the goals of the regime in the book have actually been accomplished, and more easily, in American democracy without the heavy handed approach. The approach in the book is unlikely as they limit human sexuality to a level never acheived by puritanism, except for groups like the Shakers, who died out. It is more effective to break down the family the way it has been done in America, through promoting sexual immorality, divorce, abolishing parental rights, and university brainwashing against parental values. Of course this breaks down society as a whole, but passifies the subjects, and the breakdown of America is necessary to establish a world wide form of democratic facism, or, \\"the Plan\\". The futuristic telescreen, would be called an interactive flatscreen TV in our day. While it has not yet come to pass, fully, the internet does much of the same, where people's movements are being tracked and recorded, largely for market purposes at the present, but aside from entrapping people seeking presently illegal forms of sex, its full potential as a law enforcement tool has not yet been utilized. Large search engines have used it to censor speech and thought in some regions, as well as rewrite the past. New speak would be hard to acheive in a democracy, but schools and the media have attempted the separation of word and thought through programs such as the failed Evonics course in California. Words have lost meaning, such as when my son calls something \\"bad\\", it can mean good or bad. When he calls something \\"sick\\", it could also mean he likes it, or he hates it...or both. Double speak is prevaelent, and the thought police exist in the spirit of \\"politcal correctness\\". An example of double-speak is when President Clinton stated, \\"we will re-define the immutable\\". Thought crimes are labled as \\"hate crimes\\" and are being enforced in order to bring harsher justice to enemies of the state. Threats of terrorism are used to convince the populace to eagerly forfeit their freedoms, though the government is doing the same things they always did, the media is publicizing it as something new to make people consciously aware of the activity in order to accept it. The US Constitution is being reinterpreted and called a \\"living document\\" in order to change it's meaning and use doublespeak. Examples are \\"separation of church and state\\", a phrase commonly believed to be in the Constitution, but not actually there. The words that are there to prevent government interferance in church affairs, have been twisted to mean the opposite, and is commonly used to erase certain forms of religion (mainly Christianity) from the public sector. The reading of founding documents is forbidden in some state schools due to the mention of God and other ideas which are conflict with the revision of history. Students are also taught that the Pilgrims came to America because they liked to travel, or they wanted gold. The former reasons of fleeing religious persecution and freedom are no longer historical fact as it would interfere with the forthcoming persecution. Another example is the supreme court ruling which supports the confiscation of land by a government body if it can be sold to a source offering higher tax revenues, something clearly forbidden by our founding fathers. In the book there was one party. In America, it is limited to 2, but they are much the same, but appear to argue over inflamatory issues to create the illusion of difference. One example is abortion, which the balance of the Supreme Court comes close to tipping to make illegal, but never quite makes it. The next presidential election is planned to ensure that, regardless of which party wins, or is planned to win. Abortion, being a symptom of a greater cause, keeps people focused on it's own battle, thus preventing them from interfering with the root of the cause which is part of the Plan. In reality, secret agendas are co-operated on by both parties, such as de-industrialization of America for personal profit and the Plan, and the formation af an American Union. Not even the media is allowed in on such negotiations, and the lawmaking procedures are bypassed. Science is allowed, but thought in the scienific community is one of the most strictly controlled, comparable perhaps to the Catholic Church during the days of the inquisition, though penalties are limited to ruining ones career, rather than martyring them. A specific scientific theory of origin, not proposed by a scientist, but a bitter son of a clergyman, is taught as fact, not theory, and increasing scientific evidence against the theory or its obvious flaws, and equally or more viable scientific theories are forbidden for discussion, and lawsuits and severe punishment awaits any state school teacher who disobeys this order. No questioning or free thinking is allowed in this area, as it is considered almost as a blasphemy towards the unofficial state religion of Humanism. This theory is also the basis for racism and ethnic cleansing, and has been the foundation for more death in the world than any other religious dogma. While racism is not tolerted in the realm of political correctness, the concept of different races despite genetic proof of only one human race is supported by all government forms asking which race you identify with. This is because there are many in power who secretly benefit from racism and cultural divisions. While Christianity is forbidden in the state schools, Islam is tolerated and often promoted. It is unclear if this is out of fear, or part of a larger plan, when that religion will replace the vacuum created by the elimination of Christian thought and freedom. An interesting perspective is the essay \\"Will Islam Be Our Future\\" by Joel Richardson. Thought crimes today also prohibit the distribution of medical literature published by organizations such as the AMA warning agianst the consequences of practicing certain unsafe or deviant sexual behaviors. In fact, such activity is being taught and encouraged to young school children, and parents can face stiff penalties for interfering with such doctrine. While most Americans once believed the government should keep out of the bedroom, the liberal proponents of these practices will themselves be eliminated after they help to usher in the next phase in the Plan, where human sexuality and the role of women are strictly controlled by the Government. This will precede the third phase where a world leader will come into absolute power. The Mhadi, caliphate, Anti-Christ, the name varies depending on the religion. The transformation of American state run achools from among the best, to among the worse in developing nations, is largely due to the emphasis taken away from acedemics in favor of social engineering this will ensure the weekening of America in order to balance power and bring about the results of the Plan. The way things are brought about in 1984 cannot happen, as human nature will not allow it. The failure of the Soviet Union is an example. It is much easier to manipulate people theough false religion. People will get tired of a political system, but will die for religon. America is unique as it was founded on true \\"religion\\", though false notions have tainted it with evils such as slavery, but true freedom can only survive with true Judeo-Christian values, history has proved, and is proving this point before our eyes today. While history may have been colored in the past, it is being changed in today's books, just like in Oceana..."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Well, not exactly Animal Farm, but the same themes are pushed to their maximum logical end. Orwell writes of a government bent on controlling the people that obviously stems from a comunist base. his stark future is frighteningly belivable and his characters are human to a fault. they live fictiotuious lives to the best of their abilities. they are individuals in a see of conformity no matter what the goverment may say.The book makes the reader aware of any numerous ways that people can be controlled. After reading it, any action heard taken by the government becomes suspect. As good literature should, it demands the reader superimpose the book onto daily life and do all they can to prevent such a future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you have read Fahrenheit 451, then you would see the similarities between the two for the fact that they do this: THEY MAKE A POINT TO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY. And that's why 1984 is an excellent book. It's haunting, and the totalitarian world conveyed in this novel is truly convincing from beginning to end. This is not the greatest novel you will ever read, as some people have said to me, but it's truly one of the most IMPORTANT books to read. I am not going to get into the plot (i quite frankly don't appreciate it when people give away too much of the plot, let alone telling it), all i can truly say about this book is that yes, it might scare you, and yes, it's a book that is seriosu, but it's real, and it gets straight to the point that the author was trying to make. Books like these are meant to be read, and meant to be important, and should be analyzed based on the subject matter (in this case TOTALITARIANISM/DYSTOPIA), not for the fact that the main character did this and that this other character did that. 1984 should be read in all classrooms. It would truly teach the youth of our nation of how far government can literally control the human psyche, and can literally, if possibly, manipulate and desiminate the human mind and the mind's conception of being a human being."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith is an average working class single male living in a futuristic metropolitan area. He lives in a place called Oceania. It is a place where government rules over all. Winston works for the government but is a lower rank. The cultural society that the government has built is structured and made up of various parts. The inner party is the highest, which contains their deity like ruler, big brother. Big brother supposedly has his eye on everything. The party is also anti-love and pro-abstinence. Can an average man who works for the governing party ever break free and do his own will. You find out as the story unfolds.Winston starts rebelling by committing such a seemingly small crime as, writing in a diary. He knows that one day the thought crime police will catch him. Yes, they do have a police force that imprisons people based on what they are thinking or saying. In this city each home is equipped with a t.v. looking screen that is the tool that the party observes and watches all the citizens every move in the so called privacy of their houses. The party has one slogan that is most famous \\"War is peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is strength\\". The party uses all its resources to be constantly getting rid of history. For example, there is a department of the party where all they do is burn old newspapers or other paraphernalia that are written in English. They abolish words that are unnecessary to them. A new language has even been made, its called newspeak. They rewrite history according to what big brother commands. In this society they have even trained kids to turn in their parents to the police if they commit a crime. There is no hiding from the law in this tri-state.Oceania is constantly at war with one of the other tri-states. War is very prominent in this culture. The party thrives on the way that people react to the news of being a war. It makes them easier to control.One day, Winston notices a female in the room. He daydreams about being with her. Winston starts to have feelings for her. This is also an illegal action. To love and to make love are both against the law. He looks for her hoping that he will see her at lunch. She sits by him one day and they must talk very secretly because there is a screen in the room that monitors them and they are not allowed to talk. He finds that she likes him as well. Her name is Julia. They conspire about some way to be together and not get caught. Can they be together and not be caught by their government? Are all these wars legitimate or are they a device of the inner party? Read the story to ease your suspense.This book fairly moderate moving in that it really never stops with nothing going on. It is definitely an intellectuals novel. It is a hair raising book. It is one of those books that you like to relate to your present world. This book is still just as much alive as it was fifty years age. Orwell's 1984 will have you so in much suspense to know what will happen with Julia and him and the party that you may not be able to put this book down. I highly recommend this novel. It is one of the greats that will get you thinking more than usual."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Ok how many students actually enjoy reading books are assigned in English class? Usually I don't find the books that I'm required to read for school interesting, but this year there was one exception. As I read this book on my back deck I really began to take a look at society and wonder where we were headed. Nobody really knows what the future holds, but maybe the ideas from George Orwell's 1984 aren't to far from reality.The book introduces the reader to the main character, Winston Smith, and the dismal, totalitarian world in which he lives. While attempting to discover the truth Winston is constantly under the terror-filled scrutiny of the telescreens, thought police, and the omnipotent ruler, Big Brother. Winston encounters many different people, including Julia who secretly rejects society as well. Winston and Julia develop a very intimate relationship as they try to reveal the flaws and evils in the totalitarian system. Is there really a constant war going on between Eurasia and Eastasia? Why does the government claim that the economy is better than ever when Winston doesn't have decent shoes to eat or real food? And what actually happens to the people who mysteriously disappear, their named eradicated from all records in one night?All these questions kept me wrapped up in the book. I was always wondering what would happen next. I would definitely recommend this book. Orwell does an excellent. job of developing the character so you relate to and cheer on Winston and Julia and hate the rest of the totalitarian society. This novel made me realize that I would go crazy in a world that lacked individuality and privacy, and I wondered if the future would become anything like the world of 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1.Looking at so many things in nature one tends to find a Gaussian distribution curve. The majority of people stand in the center and a much smaller number are the outliers. There is nothing good or bad about either form of existence! It's just the way it is. The point is that the outliers usually have an intrinsic urge to be bidirectional thinkers whereas the middle is usually unidirectional for a large number of issues. However one must remember that such generalizations are okay for a bird's eye view and for crude statistics only but may not do justice to any given individual! The key question is regarding the fence sitters who really deserve to see from both the point of view of the outliers as well as conventional wisdom so that they can make up their mind as to how they wish to live their lives as also so very clearly portrayed in \\"Brave New World\\".2.Should politics have any thing to do with this? One would think not. As long as there are humans there will always be the right and the left and the center... and the scales of the balance will probably keep oscillating back and forth as generations go by.3.Where does the genesis of hatred lie? Could it possibly be fear or lack of understanding of another viewpoint?4.How would one define unfair justice? Well, when one fails to implicate someone on the grounds that they were tried and then searches deeper to find other issues on which one can be in a manner of speaking - be punished.5.Someone once said of someone that he or she is crazy dreaming his life away.

I highly suggest it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is very unique. The whole story is about a man named Winston Smith, who starts to have questions in his mind about the totalitarian government that he has always known and lived with. As is typical of Orwell novels, 1984 is about one man who is all alone in the world, who tries to break away from conformity.The world that Orwell has created in this novel, called Oceania, is so very different from our own, that it is almost impossible to imagine. The Party is in power, and they can \\"vaporize\\" anyone who they even suspect of \\"thoughtcrime\\" (thinking things contrary to the Party's beliefs). The main figure of the government of Oceania is Big Brother. The term \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" comes from posters that the Party put up all over in the book.This novel makes you realize just how precious the freedoms we have are. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in politcal fiction. But a word of caution, this book is not very cheerful or uplifting, so this is not a book to read if your not in the mood for something depressing."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'm amazed at the technical predictions in this book. I do think fortunately we will not produce a future society so blah and uncreative. As far as big brother, well it may happen but I'm pretty certain it wont be like this or so intrusive to our regular lives. Just look at normal everyday people in your life and you'll know we will never be like the eerie people in this book. I don't think most of the story in the book Utopian Reality will happen either, but its scientific predictions were really incredible as well. I did thoroughly enjoy the different perspective of 1984. I guess I also read dis-utopian kind of books because it makes me live my life with a smile, knowing I would never allow myself nor my children to become so bleak and cause I know many other people share the same feelings."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Not many authors have written a novel as excellent as 1984 that affected the political world as well. George Orwell set a new standard for sci-fi writing with this book, in which he writes his vision of the future if Communism had continued to rise. 1984 was not only written as a captivating novel, but as a warning. When George Orwell wrote the book in 1949, World War II had just ended and Communism was beginning to dig its roots into Europe. Orwell, having seen the effects of Communism first-hand, decided that he needed to show what the future could be if the world was not careful. The political message lies in the portrayal of life in the future in an advanced Communist society. Surrounding the message is a captivating novel that intrigues all readers even after the Communist era has passed. Orwell describes a society that lived in poverty. The citizens knew of nothing except austerity because no information could enter the country without government approval. An average citizen, Winston Smith, began to understand how corrupt the government had become. Knowing too much was a crime; Winston was in danger of being arrested for thought-crime. How could Winston possibly fight a governmental system on which he himself depended? Once a warning, 1984 has now become a reminder of what can happen in a society in which the government has too much control."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a classic not because it is a tale of beauty, in fact its the exact opposite. It is probably one of the ugliest books ever written. That doesn't stop it from also being the most necessary book ever written. This book is a reflection not only on Totalitarian society, but on our own. \\"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four.\\" That line is probably my whole philosophy on Government and the world. Even though this book really is not for the weak minded, or people that easily buy into whatever the media gives them, I think that any educated person has not truely been educated unless they have read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is undoubtedly one of the most devestating books ever written in English. When Orwell writes Big Brother into power he gives him absolute reign over the population. Now, citizens must not only mouth approval of the status quo, but also truly approve in heart and mind. The novel not only faces the realities of governmental imposition on the economy, media, and personal lives of its citizens, addressing such real-life and very current issues as censorship, control of the press, and sexual freedom, but it also speaks of the oppression of the conscious, rational mind over the creative vision of the artist. The subjugation of the masses serves as a large scale representation of the battle between the artist and society, and ultimately, the artist and himself. Winston spends much of the book working to uncover the truth. He seeks to separate the actual truth (if such does exist) from the invented while he sits at his job churning out pages of manufactured history. In his home he sits, bent and fearful, just outside of Big Brother's gaze writing his thoughts at the end of the day, trying to hold on to some hint of the world as he percieves it. Even his romance with Julia is an attempt to claim some hold on the world as he lies in bed with her and asks whether it is possible that anyone else has ever felt as he does. While Winston is the artist, Juliea is the muse. She represents the artist longing to complete himself, the male and the female joining in fruitful creation. She acts as his audience and his artistic peer. I cannot recommend this book enough, as a classic, as a terrifying view of government gone wrong, and ultimately as the struggle of an artist to find a free exchange of thoughts and ideas between himself and the world and his conscious and unconsious mind."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I lived almost whole my life in the system like this.In Czechoslovakia it was not the worst,but there was no light at the end of the tunnel.And it could hepped to all of us with a little help from our Big Brother on the East.We are lucky,but this book have to be in every school.We were so close to the hell...now we are free again.Thank you Mr.Orwell"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In order to fully appreciate this novel, the ideal mindset has to be the circa, 1949, when the book was published.

Definitively ahead of his time in a frightening way."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Whether you enjoy science fiction or not, Orwell's 1984 is a must read. Orwell writes like Monet paints, in that his description of 1984 is opaque yet colorful, mysterious, and beautiful.Throughout 1984, the reader follows Winston Smith, who lives in Airstrip One. The world is subdivided into three major super powers. Winston lives in Oceana, which is run by Big Brother. Three ministries govern Oceana: The Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Peace. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, and it is there he meets Julia.Much like Orwell's description of the scenes themselves, he creates a world in which the reader feels they are looking at Oceana through a sheet. Orwell never describes Oceana or 1984 in too much detail; though, in his descriptions of Winston's relationships to the world he lives in, Julia, and Big Brother, he writes with enough description that Orwell's vision of the future becomes more apparent with each page.The most striking scene is when a poet is thrown into prison because he refused to take out the word, \\"God\\" from a poem he transcribed because no other word fit. No matter a person's spiritual background, the critical person should find it uncanny that in 1949 Orwell imagined a world in which the name \`God' would become illegal.Though, we do not live in a world in which three empirical superpowers govern us, the critical person should wonder if we are closer to Orwell's 1984 than we realize. Or, perhaps, ideologically, we are there and realize it; though, we have become so accustomed to living in Orwell's 1984 that we willingly give up our rights and personal identity in the name of government sanctioned security and equality."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What amazes me more than anything about this book is the author's ability, when he wrote the book back in the 1940s, to predict and describe the Obama administration.So if you want to learn how the Democratic Party has fallen from the \\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country\\" days of J.F.K to the present Obama administration which preaches to just sit on your fat bu*t, let others work, and then take their stuff--then read this book.

I'm glad I did. Orwell warns about totalitarian control of the masses through revisionist history, perversion of the meaning of words, and relativism. While the urgency of his warning may have diminished with the fall of totalitarian communism, it's still relevant today in ways Orwell might not have anticipated. When I hear phrases like \\"abortion 'clinic'\\" (one goes to a \\"clinic\\" when one is sick) or see the illogic behind radical Islam in action, I see that Big Brother's means of mind control and subjugation is not necessarily dead."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was reading many of the reviews on this book ( I usually start with the lowest ratings as they often have something to say other than \\"I just loved it\\" then move to the fours stars and down ) and was amazed not by the number of poor responseses ( there are long sretches of boredom associated with this book ) but with the reasoning. Anyone who thinks this an unrealistic depiction of the possible future ( or of the present ) is living in a cute little fantasy world. Sure we don't have two way T.V. monitors in our living room ordering us to do knee bends, but at least in the book those monitoring devices weren't always monitored. The odds where, given human limits when the book was written, that the observers were observing others. Now the computer can record everything. This does change things a little. In orwells world if you were naughty you might be seen so they can stop you, now if you are suspected of having been naughty your phone records, bank transactions, hardrive, medical records, etc, can be pulled up in a day. The level of propaganda is just as bad as Orwell predicted ( notice that while a (very) few media outlets have commented on the reasons that the U.S. is a world pariah the only thing the governmnt has to say is that the bad guys are evil and hate us. I guess it is just the nature of bad guys to hate as opposed to reaacting to real greivences) and the attempt to limit free speech have become absurd ( I think some guy in the news awhile back got in trouble for using the world \\"niggerdly\\" because, with no entomological connection, it 'sounded kinda like' a disfavored word ( remember to buy your lady trinkets instead of jewelry this year)). And if you don't think our prisons are as bad as depicted in the book read any of the reports put out by any of the non-US NGO's that look in to such things. Consider all the recent restirction on civil liberties in response to the terrorist attact. The Justice department \\"needs\\" these new powers to protect us from the immediate threat but they had a hissy fit over a five year sunset cluase. Why? If the threat still existed the bill could be renewed, if it was passed it would have to be overturned. Hardly seems like they were acting in good faith.So, read 1984, read the \\"patriot act,\\" ignore what the conspiracy nuts say, ignore what the government says, and see what the staus of your rights, freedom, and privacy are now. ( you will also find that you can be hauled in to prison with no real reason or recourse so you better not complain too loudly if you don't like what you find)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think I first read &quot;1984&quot; when I was about 10, twenty-odd years ago. I still have my old copy of it, a now highly tatty and heavily-taped-up Penguin edition. I remember wondering if it would come true in four years time and being a bit worried about it.The thing about &quot;1984&quot; is that it's such a weird bouillabaisse of critical analysis, dystopian fantasy and Orwell's own personal obsessions. All of these things bounce off each other in the most tangled and confusing ways. There's no doubt that many of the features of the book, such as the Two Minutes Hate, have proved to be chillingly funny prophecies, when you compare them to contemporary media phenomena such as the preposterous reversal of Saddam Hussein's public image in the West when he made the big mistake of invading a friendly country (from stern Friend of Democracy to swarthy Satan in a matter of weeks, thanks to a lot of hard work by the American press). Newspeak, also, has a certain currency, when we think of such phrases as &quot;friendly fire&quot; and &quot;precision bombing&quot;.But it has to be said that, if you're looking for a clear and rational book about What, as Marvin Gaye would have said, is Goin' On, then you have to conclude that Orwell's genius for fantasy overrode his intelligence. This book is suffused with Orwell's own personal attitudes to a degree not often recognised. The utter inability of Winston Smith to find any real hope in the proles has been belied by the persistence into the 21st century of popular dissent. I'm talking about things like the WTO riots and the use made of the internet (a technology developed chiefly by the Pentagon, remember) as a tool for political critique and activist organisation. I'm even talking about the Romanian revolution, in which one of the most downtrodden peoples in Europe rose up and deposed - by which I mean, arrested and shot - one of the worst dictators of the century.Orwell's fatalistic sense of the _totality_ of evil is what's bad about the book, if you're looking for clear answers and good thoughts, but on the other hand, if you read the book not as a dire warning but as a satire, it's what's _good_ about it. The pompous lectures of O'Brien read more like the ramblings of a Sade character than as an authentic account of what it is to want power at the turn of these centuries. The evidence is that most of the really powerful and dangerous people in the world are not like O'Brien, in that they aren't in it for the dubious pleasure of &quot;stamping on the human face forever&quot;. They're in it for money, sex and the thrill of feeling important. This makes them vulnerable. This means they can be stopped.The other thing that we tend to notice about &quot;1984&quot; is the pervasive nostalgia of the book. Orwell was not just born in to the middle-class; one some pretty deep level, and despite his truly heroic efforts to change, he was marked by its values and attitudes to the end of his life, and while this gave him great strength, it also narrowed and sharpened his imagination. The points of value in this book are the old notebook, the half-forgotten nursery rhymes, the piece of coral in the ancient paperweight. Nothing new is good. Things fall apart as soon as bought (the Victory cigarette).This narrowness of imagination can seem to spoil the book, but _only_ as long as we expect it to be some sort of honest effort to imagine life in the future. I sometimes wonder if Orwell meant people to take &quot;1984&quot; as seriously as they do. I think it's a brilliant, very blackly comic fantasy, something Swift might have written if he'd lived to see the concentration camps (and don't forget that Orwell wrote eloquently and wittily about Swift; check out the essays and war broadcasts).I'm still glad I read it 20 years ago, and I still read it today. As a book about the importance of a life without dirt, bad cigarettes, horrible food and awful TV, it can't be beat. As a ground plan for Media Studies, it's superb. As a prophecy? Hmmm. No. It's a satire. Take it as gospel and you'll be crushed under its wheels; take it as a dark joke, and you can gain strength from it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book used to be required reading. It's the scariest book I ever read and it's becoming scarier as time goes on. Orwell was a true prophet of where we are headed; his timing was just off.

Despite the American Founders' best plans, America is heading in the direction of Orwell's 1984 world, tiny tiny bit at a time.The book is well written and reads fast.

George Orwell's 1949 novel never fails to move me, scare me, worry me, or draw me in. This reading, I listened to it on audiobook for the first time, an experience I highly recommend.As most know, 1984 is a dystopian novel - the English language dystopian novel to many (one of these days, I've got to read Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, which preceded 1984). Set in the oppressive future of 1984 in London, the major city of Airstrip One (formerly England), the novel chronicles the efforts of everyman Winston Smith to defy the omnipotent ruling Party of Oceania, the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism), and - most especially - the ever-present, omniscient gaze of Big Brother, the symbol and embodiment of the system itself.Smith begins to rebel in various ways, in particular with his lover Julia. Merely loving anyone but Big Brother is itself a crime. Winston and Julia carry on their relationship, both out of feelings for each other and to break the rules they despise. Eventually, of course, they are arrested by the Thought Police, since - after all - Big Brother Is Watching. Taken to the Ministry of Love for re-education, Winston learns what the Party is really after.Many of the elements of the novel have become concerns for modern times, especially with technological innovations that have made Orwell's science fiction science reality. Surveillance, censorship, perpetual war, manufactured patriotism, control of the language, exploitation of the middle classes. Orwell drew much of his inspiration from the Soviet Union, but it's easy to find examples of all these concerns in the front page of your local newspaper on a daily basis.As much as the technology is terrifying, the truly disturbing part of 1984 is in the mind of our hero, Winston. His struggle to remain himself while being both figuratively and literally, mentally and physically, beaten down by the apparatus of the party is gut-wrenching, as is the final result of the struggle. The last line of the book is one of - perhaps the most - powerful I've ever read.As I stated above, this was the first time I've listened to 1984 as an audiobook. I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production, narrated by Simon Prebble. Prebble is a favorite of mine, and he's at his best here. There's a certain gravity to Prebble's voice that invests his work with a power that, while enjoyable in other books, is vital here to reflect the spirit of the novel. Winston's struggles, hopes, sufferings, all are brought to vivid, grim life by Prebble's strong narration. I highly recommend Prebble's reading to anyone looking to listen to 1984. The production runs approximately 11.5 hours.1984 is a classic. I cannot recommend Orwell's masterpiece enough. Though 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's powerful warning remains timeless."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Working my way through NPR's list of the \\"Top 100 Science Fiction, Fantasy Books,\\" I eventually came to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, widely recognized as one of the best books of the last century. Although I was not a huge fan ofAnimal Farmas far as reading for entertainment, I was able to recognize the importance of the book when viewing the message, and the genius behind Orwell's story, an idea which had never been approached before. Nineteen Eighty-Four contains the same structure, although presented as dystopian fiction rather than satire.Reading the book 60 years after it was published, it is hard to fathom that Orwell could have such a prescient view on society, even well after the titular year on which his story is based. Ideas and themes surrounding an oligarchy that takes control of society through fear and compliance might sound alien to today's readers, until really examined against the political structure of several current dictatorships. Although Nineteen Eighty-Four didn't keep me on the edge of my seat like today's traditional \\"science fiction\\" novel, the concept of it and the time it was written will resonate well after the final chapter. This is one of those rare novels that engages the reader in thought not only during the story but for years afterwards as well. Although I would not recommend it to anyone as an \\"airplane read,\\" it does deserve its place atop the list of Science Fiction's Best and is required reading for any fan of dystopian fiction.Edit: Unfortunately Amazon's oligarchical reviewer guidelines and character limit prevent me from listing all 1984 reasons to read this book so I have revised my review to include the top two."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of the most chilling books I have ever read because there is no escape and even Winston's dreams of the \\"Golden Country\\" are finally lost to him as Big Brother invades the last sanctuary--his mind and his soul."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this years ago in college and today it is more topical than ever.

Pynchon's voice has been, since \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" almost the inheritance of 1984; as a dislocation of the predictiveness of the Orwellian text, it also has functioned as a panacea to this nightmare we live on, precisely because Pynchon's language doesn't allow for any concreteness.

In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party.

Unlike most books written in 1949 about 1984, it is not about people traveling by jet-packs. It explores a world controlled by the government in every aspect. Nothing, including your thoughts are your own. A world where the only love is the love of the government, and individuality does not exist. Minds are brain-washed and war is never-ending. A world where 2+2=5, a world where you can trust no one, not even yourself. 1984 changes the way you look at the world.

Lots of surprises in the most unexpected places, a very original plot, and very good quality of writing. I have never read a book that makes you realise how lucky you are to be living in a society like this. I think it would've even made people in concentration camps feel good about themselves.I think after you fight your first shock of the depression that this book brings, you will realise how nice it is to live wherever you live.

They have become a part of common knowledge, much as 1984 has become the flagship for the genre of the Dystopia.But what truly matters is how good of a read 1984 is, and how well Orwell fills the pages that you'll courageously flip through. Well, the word that best describes 1984 is: harrowing. Each sentences radiates a mood of despair: constant paranoia, unnecissary injustice, paradoxical regulations, torture, fear, etc. And of course, that mood Orwell creates will captivate you. You'll eat the pages; you'll cringe, you'll smirk at the ridiculousness of what you're reading, and you'll love it.Read this book not becuase of the political propaganda, or to understand the termanology that has become a part of our vocalbulary.

However, if you've read it and would like a piece of history to call your own, this is a worthy addition to your library.I first read 1984 when I was in the seventh grade. It earned me sneers and odd looks from my classmates, but I recognized it for what it is - a warning. This book helped shape my outlook on the world, and particularly on politics. It made me wary of false promises and doubletalk - &quot;newspeak&quot; - something that has unfortunately come true within my lifetime. War is peace, black is white, down is up.Last year I finally bought a hardcover edition of the standard edition to add to my library. This manuscript is no substitute for a standard edition, in terms of reading at leisure. It has all of the corrections, crossed-out paragraphs (and pages), and the majority of it is in Orwell's own hand (i.e. not typed). To read the story in this form for the first time would be daunting.Nevertheless I cherish it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough to devotees of Orwell. It occupies a treasured space in my bookcase."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984George Orwell's most famous novel. Written in the 1950's, during a time of post WWII cleanup and violent revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, 1984 plunges the World into a limited nuclear war, and the division of the planet into three superstates, which are constantly &quot;at war&quot; with each other. The main character and the leading lady live in the Superstate of Oceania, where Totalitarian Government controls every aspect of the lives of the citizens. Big Brother &quot;watches&quot; his citizens via the Thought Police, by means of spying on them, even in their homes, with electronic devices. Three words from this book, Thoughtcrime, Double Speak and Double Think have made their way into common English vocabulary. After reading the book, you are left with a hollow and helpless feeling.

As of last year you would have to pay me to read , but my first year of highschool seemed to be a real slap in the face. We read over14books this year. Most i would read only because i had to , but with 1984 something was differnt. I read 1984 with full intrest until the very last word. The basis of the story was all i needed , all the added details were just one of the many bonuses. These days people are so concerned with their reputations in society that no one will stand up for what they believe in .

And the concerns it raises will never be outdated. Think of how you can be traced by credit card transactions, and how every information about your habits, income, interests, etc. is stored somewhere. Then think about the telescreens in 1984 again. Privacy has become an illusion. Also consider this: The information we receive, from newspapers, tv, radio, or the net can be manipulated easliy. How do you know something you saw on tv is real? You weren't there. How haven't seen it happen. You can only trust that the information you receive is true. And if a totalitarian regime takes over, it doesn't matter whether it's Communist, Fascist, or Fundamentalist. People will suffer regardless of ideology. Consider a Christian Fundamentalist government. -Mandatory Church attendance to be conditioned with the newest propaganda (2-minutes-hate) -Sex before marriage is unlawful (as in 1984) The list could be continued, but what's the point? Now that Communism is down there are new threats to freedom. And 1984 warns us about those."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is the stuff of nightmares.

A protrait of a world that could very easily become our own unless we do everything in our power to fight it. Those who believe that Big Brother could never happen, will most likely be the first ones into Room 101. Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin both once said &quot;Those who give up Freedom for Security, will not have, niether do they deserve, either.&quot; 1984 is a perfect description of a society that gave up their freedom hoping for safety.

Told through the perspective of Winston Smith, a member of The Party, Orwell shows the struggles and consequences of a man daring to go against The System.It is a riveting tale injected with political and social philosophy. A timeless classic that will certainly be revisited by future generations and very likely passed off as &quot;incorrect predictions&quot; because the concepts Orwell covers are too frightful to entertain as reality. From Big Brother watching citizens through Telescreens to the past being rewritten from one moment to the next.I highly recommend this novel to not just science fiction fans but to all citizens of the present, as a reminder that freedom is only a reality as long as we do not take it for granted."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I suspect that most readers of these reviews have already read (&amp;/or reviewed) the book in question. I'm not going to precis 1984 for the remaining readers but simply state that the writing is understated and matter of fact but nevertheless compelling, many points are subtly made and perhaps one sentance in 10 could be used as an aphorism or commentary of 'modern life', whether it be organised sport, national events or geopolitics. Nothing else comes close to that hit-rate, except a dictionary of quotations.For the few who have not yet read the book, see what you're missing!(ps - it was lumped together with Animal Farm, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies and various JB Priestly plays as distopian visions in my long-gone schooldays - they're all worth reading too.)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Anyone who is interested in the nature of power and manipulation of the masses should read this book.

Orwell uses this interesting story to warn people about the dangers of a socialist government, and the extremes that it could go to if it went in that direction. In this extreme example of totalitarianism, the government can watch your every move, control the past, and even restrict what you think. He uses superb insight, and makes it really interesting by going deep into the psyche of the main chatacter, Winston Smith. I greatly enjoyed my reading experience with this novel. I would definately reccomend this book to anyone who wants a novel that will make them think, and who is not afraid to question their opinions about the truth. If you are looking for a quick read that wont make you look to deep, dont try this one. This is one of those books where you have to take rests and comprehend what youre reading, especially at the end. The beginning of the book was a little slow, and a bit repetitive, but towards the end it really picks up and gets very interesting. Once I got into the last 50 pages, I absolutley could not put it down. The last part of the book was packed full of suspense and action, even if the end was a little depressing. The story, about a man and the woman he loves who are trying to rebel against their oppressive government, gives you glimmers of hope throughout the novel. Sometimes you truly believe that they can overcome the oppression of a government that doesn't let them feel normal human emotions or think for themselves. However, in the end I was left with a slight feeling of despair and lonliness. Even so, I am very glad that I read this book. No other book I have ever read has made me think more about what our perception of truth really is, or a government's ability to take away mans right to think and act like an individual person. This book brings up so many interesting issues, and it makes you ask yourself questions that you usually wouldn't think about. If something happens a certain way, but there's no records of it, and noone remembers it that way, did it really happen like that? Can a government take away a persons right, or ability to think for themselves? Is it possible to change history by changing the documents?

Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader)."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the best book I have ever read!!

Rather it is a world where the dark sides of the human nature has been given the chance to rule. The book holds numerous references to the horrors of stalinism and nazism as well as describing the problems with democracy (the same argument that he brilliantly describes in his previous novels and essays). Also it shows the problem of the individual within the collektive and how easily groups and structures can hold the individul hostage.

I think this is one of the best books I have ever read. Very entertaining and well, good. The fact that I am an Anarchist and have the same dreams as Winston of overthrowing the government only increases my admiration for Orwell, who was not afraid to craft a character most people would look down upon. Great book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If for some reason you got through high school without being forced to read this book, I highly recommend that you read it now. Besides being creative and extremely thought-provoking, 1984 paints a vivid picture of a hopeless future world... a world void of privacy, friendship, love, and family. In this world, where Big Brother is god, mindless conformity is the highest virtue. Winston, the main character, serves as a powerful narrator in revealing the true nature of this society that, in the late 1940's, did not seem all that distant. The two factors of Orwell's society that struck me most were: 1) the disintegration of the family unit, where children control and betray their parents and 2) the mass brainwash of citizens and the idea of \\"doublethink,\\" where history is repeatedly rewritten within citizen's own minds. Everyone should read this book, if only to appreciate the society that we do live in."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is written in the style of the \\"negative utopia.\\" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"With the exception of \\"Animal Farm,\\" it would be hard to think of a work of satire in the English language that is as powerful as \\"1984\\" (actually \\"Nineteen Eighty Four\\"). Whereas the Whig-Tory squabbles that make up the background of \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" are mostly forgotten now, the totalitarian essence of Airstrip One still haunts the imagination of the First World. No other major novel this century has produced so many memorable terms. Not simply fantasies of universal surveillance, but also \\"Newspeak,\\" \\"Doublethink,\\" \\"the Ministry of Truth,\\" \\"Sex Crime\\" \\"Thoughtcrime,\\" \\"Two Minute Hate,\\" \\"Memory Hole,\\" \\"Room 101,\\" \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.\\" Indeed, not since Dickens has there been such a novelist so much on the popular consciousness.Since there are already several hundred reviews in praise of this book, I will devote the rest of this review to providing some reservations. It is often said that Orwell is a master analyst of totalitarianism. Dead wrong, in my view. On the Nazi side of the Molotov-Ribbentrop symbiosis, Orwell has rather little to say. There is no systematic analysis of Nazism, no evaluation of Nazi terror, and, in retrospect most damning of all, no real appreciation of the singular importance of the Holocaust. A look at \\"Revenge is Sour\\", which opens up the fourth volume of Orwell's collected journalism, reveals his limitations dramatically. However just and liberal his opposition to revenge is, Orwell's account fails because he has never had any experience which could make him understand those feelings. It is like reading a denunciation of pornography from a cardinal who has been blind from birth.What is most powerful in Orwell's account is his satire on Communist dishonesty. (About Nazi irrationalism and fanaticism he has little to say.) Why Oceania commits the barbarisms it does is more open to question. Rather oddly, given his frequent skepticism about Progressive pieties, Orwell appears to believe that a growing economy would be in itself sufficient to provide the goods and services a just society needs. Since the three world states wish to prevent that, they encourage endless war which wastes any surplus, and which supports their own regimes by permanent war psychosis. The result is an endless stagnation, and a horrifying stability which could last forever.Now an economic slowdown was clearly a problem with the Soviet Union in the last decades of its life, but equally clearly it was not intended to be that way. More importantly, the worst Communist atrocities, Collectivization and the Great Leap Forward were attempts to radically change society. Soviet Stalinism was a society that went through every sort of radical change imaginable. It was not a society whose crimes were rooted in stasis.Other objections. England no longer exists, there is only \\"Airstrip One.\\" Orwell set his nightmare world in England to challenge his countrymen's complacency. But arguably he reinforced it by showing that it could only occur in an England which was already dead. It was perhaps this aspect that appealed to Czeslaw Milosz and other Polish exiles who viewed their own country as an innocent swamped and threatened by Russian aggression imposing a thoroughly UnPolish society. While this view had a great deal of truth to it, the fact that the former Communists have won two free presidential elections in a whole, suggests that it is not the whole truth. Viewing totalitarianism as a deracinated purging of authentic local traditions has obvious limits. Clearly the Axis countries were militantly nationalist, and it is clear that Communist regimes could not have survived in China, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea without successfully appealing to some aspects of nationalism and national culture. All Communist countries appealed to local traditions (has there ever been any kind of regime that did not?), and Orwell should have taken this into account. Likewise romantic love is viewed as Winston's salvation, yet Claudia Koonz, Geoff Eley have pointed out how Nazism gained strength from its appeal to conventional ideas of family. And Richard Stites has pointed out that Stalin's policy cannot simply be viewed as anti-family.Another weakness of the book is its view of Stalinism as one based on intellectuals. While it could be said of Lenin's dictatorship that the government was dominated by intellectuals, one could not really apply that term to Beria, Zhadanov, or Molotov. Too much concentration on the sins of a Heidegger distracts one from the far greater crimes of the Wehrmacht and I.G. Farben. But the greatest weakness of the book is O'Brien. O'Brien's lust for power is so deranged as to be pyschotic. That he lives only for others to suffer tells us nothing about how torturers work. (It does not help the book that Orwell cannot tell the metaphysical difference between a statement such as \\"Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact in August 1939.\\" and \\"2+2=4\\". The first is a historical fact, the second is a tautology. It would be evil to try to torture people to deny the first, madness the second.) In his portrait Orwell reveals his inability to understand such a personality. Indeed, such a person could not really be human at all. Surely in the name of all that is humane and tolerated, he must be extirpated, like a demon. Arendt's concept of the banality of evil or Sartre's view of the anti-Semite have their limitations, but they tell us more than Orwell does, as does, from the inside as it were, Celine's own later novels."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book in High School and once more since then. Ive also seen the movie which is very well done, almost exactly like the book.... Everyone here says its prophetic and that it is still in the future...is it? or has 1984 been with us well before the actual 1984? Anyways when I read it in High School I got most of it, but some of it went over my head...untill I entered the working world/college and the ranks or society with all the expectations that go along with these situations and experiences....Now it mirrors everyday life....I already distrust the government and most authority figures, religious and non religious. I dont believe in their wars...even after the WTC attacks...and I really dont believe in thier advertising and or media.....If you want a book that will change your outlook and open your eyes and show you the truth of the present and past plus a warning about the possibilities of a future traveling the wrong path...read this! not because I told you to...but because you need to know :)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"was Animal Farm predicting that pigs would walk in the future? NOI say this after hearing other peoples reviews, summaries and opinions of 1984. One should not look at 1984 as a prediction of the future, because it was not truly meant as such. George wrote this as a attack on the dictatorships of the USSR and Spain. It is a satirical work, and a brilliant one at that. However , because it is written so well, it takes on a somewhat timeless quality.This may be why so many people mistake the novel. Those foolish proles. tisk tisk tisk."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, the classic study of total behavioral control, also is a study of Marxist economics. In &quot;1984&quot; a perpetual state of war exists both to enslave productive populations and also to justify total behavioral control over society. Orwell structures his society using Karl Marx's Communist model: 'Proles' (proletariat), large 'Outer Party', and small 'Inner Party'. The Proles are a poor, marginally-educated workforce requiring minimal control -- they are happy with their ale. The Outer Party is the educated workforce that implements routine governmental functions. To enforce their submissive behavior they are spied upon by telescreens, by coworkers, and by family members. Outer Party members are poor but Victory Gin is inexpensive. Well-paid Inner Party members ensure total societal submission to authority using government policies, surveillance, propaganda, trickery and torture. The Inner Party's total behavioral control over others also intimidates potential Inner Party rebels into total submission.&quot;1984&quot; does not contain mobile computer terminals and computerized databases. It does contain 'telescreens': two-way video/audio devices that permit propaganda broadcasts and also allow video/audio surveillance. The telescreens *cannot* be turned off and blocking them is treasonable. Other societal control programs include 'Thought Police' patrols, alteration of all records, and a language simplification program designed both to hinder 'thoughtcrimes' and also to eliminate the critical questions that well-educated people ask.George Orwell did not anticipate computers, but he understood Karl Marx's strategem for controlling society using economics, surveillance, propaganda, and the educational system. &quot;1984&quot; reflects this understanding."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The world of 1984 is one that is completely stained with hate and ironies. Winston Smith, the novels main character, strugles throughout the book to try to discover who he is and how to overcome the power that the Party has over its self-molded society. The Party, which is a perfect example of a complete totalitarianim government, has shaped the world of 1984. The Party has so much control over every aspect of human life,that power including love, sex, and the family enviorment. &quot;The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget childeren for the service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema.&quot;(57) The power that the Party has forces Winston Smith to rebel. He then falls in love with a young women, which is not only a crime, but is completely unheard of. The unlawful act is one that starts the roller-coaster ride that is this novel, and in trun, plays an important role in the theme. Orwell not only appeals to the readers emotions but also plays with ones mind. The themes of government, power, and isolation is what make this novel so fabulous. This novel could be best described as an ironic paradox in every sense of the words. 1984, by George Orwell is a futureistic novel that forces the reader to contemplate the world around them. The novel is so stratigically written that it can appeal to the modern reader. I would reccomend 1984 to anyone who enjoys a well written political satire."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I might not be capitalism's biggest fan but I have to say that this book was one of the scariest things I've read in my entire life. It gives a chilling view of what happens when Communism overtakes the world, leaving an illusory, tyrannical dictator known only as &quot;Big Brother&quot; as the leader. No one has ever seen him, yet nothing can escape the watchful eyes of his fanatical secret police. When one man tries to rebel against the iron grip of Big Brother, it ends in tragedy for him. This brutal attack on Communism would be enough to make Marx himself cringe if he knew the turn it would take."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was originaly a paper I wrote for an English class, but I think it covers the bases fairly well:George Orwell's 1984 spins a gripping tale of corruption, lies, and fear. In a less than modern utopian society called \\"Oceania\\" rebellion is brewing. A man named Winston Smith finds the strength within himself to challenge the local governmental institution and its leader known only as \\"Big Brother\\". Through the manipulation of information and history Big Brother commands a death grip on the people who he convinces to \\"love\\" him. The people are constantly reminded that \\"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\\" (Book 1, Ch. 1 pg. 3). Such control in a society can only lead to one thing: Rebellion.Throughout 1984 multiple references to control are found. By using telescreens, devices that blare out propaganda and monitor the population, and the ironically named \\"Ministry of Truth\\", an institution that changes the records of the past in favor of the Party and follows the slogan \\"'Who controls the past', ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\\" The people are given one hour out of every day to express their hatred. This is a time when,\\"A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledgehammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one evenagainst one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. Winston works as a propaganda officer at the Ministry of Truth's main office in Airstrip One, the name of the region in Oceania where Winston lives. There Winston changes historical records to match that of the Party's will. The Party has also devised a way of both monitoring the population and building an irreverent dedication to Big Brother. This institution is called the \\"Junior Spies\\". The group is composed of young children who are told to watch their parents and neighbors, looking for signs of thoughtcrime (wanting to or knowing that you have committed a crime against the Party.). These kinds of people were \\"one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended.\\"Winston holds an office that is part of the \\"ruling class\\" of Oceania. The other class of Oceania is known as the \\"Proles\\", \\"They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer, and, above all, gambling filled up the horizon of their minds.\\" If a person is found to be an enemy of the Party they are \\"vaporized\\", any and all record of them is erased. Winston actually assists the Party in this when he vaporizes a man referred to as Comrade Withers. A man that was oncepraised by the Party, but was convinced as a traitor and all past praise must be illuminated.When Winston comes upon a diary and begins to write in it, he immediately knows that he will be vaporized or killed on charges of thoughtcrime. When he is at his neighbor's house fixing their sink one of their children calls Winston a traitor and accuses him of thoughtcrime. Winston is terrified at the prospect of being found out. He goes home and drinks some \\"Victory Gin\\", an alcoholic beverage that everyone drinks. The substance has a numbing effect on the people and makes it easier to comply with the Party. He also smokes \\"Victory Cigarettes\\", the equivalent of common low quality cigarettes. Both the products have the name \\"Victory\\" in front of them signifying the Party's propaganda. It all leads back to governments wanting to brainwash its citizens to total compliance and the rejection of other ideals. The Party even went as far as to convince the people that 2+2=5, and that there is a thirteen o-clock.The Party also employs the use of microphones to listen in on conversations. It is by using these means that they learn of Winston having sexual intercourse with a woman named Julia who works in the Fiction Department at the Ministry of Truth. They eventually rent a room together above a store. There is a painting on the wall in one of the rooms that hides a telescreen that the Party has planted. It is through this screen that the thought police finally arrest Winston.The citizens are not allowed to keep documents or photographs that could lead them to remembering elements of their past. This makes it easier for the Party to \\"insert\\" the memories that they wish for the people to remember. Their \\"real\\" memories become fuzzy after time and are replaced with the memories that the Party has installed within them.George Orwell wrote 1984 in a time when Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and Communist China were all on people's minds. These styles of government instilled fear and hopelessness in the minds of American's. Fear that their basic freedoms were being threatened. Elements of these governments are found in the government of Oceania, even to the uncanny resemblance of Big Brother to Joseph Stalin.

A future in which people are lied to, manipulated, and tortured for being different."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"We shall meet in the Place where there is no Darkness\\", whispers the Monster.And he means it.What is it about this little nugget of grue and cold, calculating horror by the English Socialist writer Eric Blair---immortalized to high school students throughout the Anglophonic world as George Orwell---that so captures the imagination, so fires the nerves?Well---it's the lack of Freedom, you might say.But what is Freedom? The freedom to love who you want, unproscribed by the dictates and whims of the Party?Your freedom to do that, my friend, is already circumscribed by narrow geography, by the randomness of your birth: chances are the love of your life, who sleeps so sweetly beside you right now, will betray you of her own free will, without even the torture merited by Room 101.Freedom to do what you want, when you want?Do you have that now?

Ah yes, Winston Smith: who learns, in between delightful pass-times including hate rallies, drooling before the omnipotent tele-screen (oh stop nodding: you've probably got the tele-screen on even *while* you're reading this, and nobody is forcing *you*...yet), and doctoring information in the Ministry's reports---who learns to lust, and after a fashion, to Love.Orwell, consummate artist, illustrates this cubist, concrete, slag-heaped, hate-drunk pit of despair with all the sparse, telling prose of a master at work: every word works, every sentence tells. And it is a concoction, a wicked witch's brew, of every sputtering despotism ever misbegotten on Planet Earth, spiked with a little extra nightcap of hatred and evil: Stalin's USSR, Hitler's 1000-Year Reich, Pol Pot's Killing Fields.The horror is that, in the end, \\"1984\\" was a human construct, made by human hands, enacted by human voices. We choose, ultimately, what resides in Room 101. We sacrifice our freedom to Big Brother, and then we abide by his all-seeing Eye.

I'm glad I picked this book because I loved it. I have always been very interested in politics and propaganda. There were more than a few times during my read that I noticed similarities to our current political climate. Sometimes the instances of similarity were absolutely uncanny. One of the similarities I found most intriguing was the use of hate as a means of control. I believe this technique is being used today in our society. HATE = PATRIOTISM"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\\"So goes the slogan of the Party, the oppressive totalitarian regime depicted in George Orwell's nightmarish and depressing vision of the future circa 1984. Enter Winston Smith, our tortured protagonist, who spends his days rewriting the past to coincide with the present and his nights scrawling rebellious thoughts into an illegally kept diary. The increasingly desperate Smith longs to escape a world in which all thoughts are controlled (courtesy of \\"Big Brother\\", the ever-watching leader of Oceania who may or may not exist) and concepts such as individuality, passion, and love are unheard of. Winston finds his solace in Julia, an eccentric and free-thinking woman who shares his angst. They soon become revolutionaries by having a love affair and taking walks in the countryside. Together, the two join a resistance force known only as The Brotherhood, dedicating their lives to the destruction of the Party. However, Winston and Julia soon discover that the eyes of Big Brother are not so easily blinded.Reading 1984, I was literally chilled by how accurately the novel parallels both our current times and the probable future. Not once did I doubt the credibility of Orwell's predictions; the police state he creates is utterly believable from introduction to conclusion. The author unflinchingly illustrates true evil and cruelty, and the entire book emanates a sense of helplessness and despair. Eric Arthur Blair (\\"George Orwell\\" was, in fact, merely a pseudonym) saw a world in which all traces of humanity have been stripped away, and the majority of the population is composed of automatons devoid of the will to think. It is this world that we will be seeing decades from now unless vigilance is kept. With freedom comes responsibility, and we cannot sit idly by as our rights are taken away from us.In fact, we may already be seeing this type of society in many facets of our culture, albeit on a much subtler level than in this work. Orwell's masterpiece has often - and logically so - been used as a political tool by the left wing. Numerous are the uncomfortable similarities to the world we are now living in. \\"WAR IS PEACE,\\" etc. can easily be made to spell out the Bush Administration's philosophy. The telescreens installed in every civilian's home - used for surveillance and propagandizing - prompt the reader to reflect upon our own major news sources, all owned by large corporations with agendas of their own and vast ability to \\"alter\\" the truth. The Party's license to spy on anyone and everyone with no justification is terrifyingly reminiscent of the Homeland Security Act passed by Congress in 2003. It all gives you a fresh appreciation of your ability to analyze what you're told and discern lies from fact.I would recommend this novel to anyone who treasures freedom and needs a reminder of what we could become if our guard is let down. Orwell was a political prophet, a seer, and the consequences of ignoring his warnings could be very dire indeed. To any Republicans reading this review (hopefully the previous paragraph didn't alienate you), please don't regard this as a \\"liberal\\" novel. 1984 is much more than an anti-Bush clich&eacute;. The book's themes are universal, and all proponents of liberty and justice can appreciate it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith is a middle aged man livin in the superstate of Oceania. There are three superstates, Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. They all have almost the same type of economy. Also their always at war witheach other. The year is 1984 and Big brother and the thought police are always watching you through their telescreens which are located in almost every corner. You can't even think something against the party or else you'll commit a thoughtcrime. There are three types of people in the scoiety, proles, lowest, outer party, middle, and inner party highest. The superstate of Oceania is run by four sections, Ministry of truth, Ministry of peace, Ministry of plenty, and Ministry of love. Winston smith is part of the outer party. He has a harsh feeling of hatred towards big brother. He starts to write a journal, which is a thought crime and SHOWS HIS HARSH HATRED FOR bIG bROTHER. He hears of a underground organization which tries to bring down this system od unjust. Men and women are not allowed to marry unless the show no affection for each other. Winston was once married. Winston starts to think a man he sees at work is against big brother. Winston starts being followed by a young girl. He soon found out from a note that she loves him. They start meeting each other every couple of weeks. Winston rents a room from a man named Mr. Charrington that was suppose to have no telescreen in it and was supposedly completely private. The girl Julia and winston start meeting there frequently. Soon O'brien approaches Winston and gives him his address. Winston and Julia go to his house together and tell him they want to be part of the brotherhood with Goldstein, the leader of this group against big brother. They join it but learn that they'll never meet Goldstein and will die for the cause and do anything except split apart.

When Julia and Winston meet again in the room from Mr. Charrington to read the book they are caught by a telescreen which was hidden behind a picture and they find out Mr. Charrington was not who they thought he was. The thought police surround them. Winston and Julia are taken away and kept in cells. Will they be sent to room 101, executed, or will someone arrive that Winston knows? To find out read this book.

You have to be remarkably stupid to shake off this book for any such reasons. This is a great piece of literature and philosophy, and everything that everyone said about it's pertaining to today is absolutely true.

ESSENTIAL reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As with Animal Farm (by the same author), there is much to learn from this book.What makes this book scary is how easily it could become reality. As you read this book, you must realize that in order to avoid becoming what this book portrays, we need to fight the system now. Because, as Winston learns, once the system is in place it is practically impossible to destroy it. Keep this book in mind while our government makes specific policies... especially while we lose our freedoms and rights of privacy in the name of safety, fairness, and prosperity.And what amazes me (but wouldn't surprise me) is how much the people love what they have; not knowing what they have lost. It is amazing how government can set your mind at ease with the right propaganda. A perfect example was how the government was saying how it had exceeded its prediction in the production of boots (which was actually a lie) and one of its citizens commented on how well they had done in supplying the needs of the people. In the same breath he asked if Winston had any razorblades, which had become very scarce in the recent weeks.And even scarier, it shows how easy it is for the government to twist (spin) our language and use it against us. For instance, in the book we see the Ministry of Love, which is used to torture free thinkers and those who would disagree with Big Brother. We see the Ministry of Truth, which is nothing more than spreading lies on the wealth of the nation and its citizens. So on and so forth. What is especially incredible about this book is the detail of the language that George Orwell went into, while creating a new language called Ensoc (English Socialism).This book shows all of this... and more. It is the model of what any country should NOT become. There is a lot to learn from this visionary book. You can instantly take a lot out of this book. Read it and take a look around you and you will be surprised and how quickly our society is heading in this direction. Fight this trend before you, yes you, fall in love with Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Just as Edmund Burke, during the French Revolution, predicted the subsequent horrors of Robespierre's Reign of Terror, so did George Orwell brilliantly foreshadow the nightmarish life that was ubiquitous under the rule of 20th Century totalitarian states. In 1984, the main character, Winston Smith, struggles to gain personal freedom of mind under the Big Brother government that has taken over London, England and the rest of Europe. The constant chatter of the &quot;telescreens&quot; (written before the days of TV) and other mediums of propaganda are virtually inescapable in this frightening world. Orwell's monotone (but vivid) narrative demonstrates his genius because it makes the scene so much scarier, yet all the more realistic to the reader as well. The novel races up to the climax, before its conclusion with an ending (and final line) that is among the most famous of any from the 20th Century. If you've never read 1984 and only heard it referenced, you need to read it because you may be surprised to see how similar its terms are to life in the modern, &quot;free&quot; world. At the same time, you will see why it is ranked among 20th Century classics as well."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Bonnie Ryder Mercy High School Students Mindy Sheehan Humankind has not been deliberately questioning its government for the past seventeen years, or fifty- two years, but, however, since the beginning of time. 1984 by George Orwell simply expresses the fears and anxieties felt by all people towards their government. At all times, society must worry whether government is too large and controlling or too small and unproductive. In 1984, however, the government is extremely small in how many have power but extremely large and authoritarian in its pervasive domination while actively and purposely promoting unproductivity. After reading this book together, my friend and I have a better understanding of how government can grow so large and bleed the soul out of a society. Yes, we can learn about factual historical events but by reading the extreme we have a better understanding of the norm. For instance, how much of today's media is censored and controlled? What information am I not getting? Fifty- two years ago when Orwell first published this book, the United States government had still not apologized for its treatment of Japanese Americans during WW II. It still denied that it had done anything wrong. Their actions were for the good of the country. The U.S.A. would never stoop to the same level as the Germans did with their interred (or would we). Orwell should have felt lucky to live in such an honorable time in history under the motherly wing of all- mighty protective, militaristic of the United States government. Even today history books very rarely even mention this portion of US history. All hail the mighty and glorious past, but do not forget; whoever controls the present controls the past, whoever controls the past controls the future. Again we ask, what of the past has been changed for us? What do we not know? Is Big Brother still watching? 1984 is appropriate for mature Juniors in high school and older. To read the book, one must have patience because most of it is a narrative. Despite the groaning, whining complaints which often accompany the news that a book is a narrative, the personal intimate thoughts are essential to the book. The reader must know how deeply the vein of ignorance runs. The reader must experience the complete metamorphosis which Winston, the main character, undertakes and his personal opinions about his surroundings. How much of our daily lives is spent thinking only to ourselves and analyzing personal thoughts and actions? Because Orwell wanted to create a realistic man, he needed to have intimate thoughts which the reader must understand in order to understand his actions. How many times do we wish that the world could just read our mind to understand us? The reader cannot be bored with the book if he reads every sentence with a grain of salt and tries to fully envelop himself into Orwell's world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is a world very much like ours today - no privacy, ignorance of the world and wars around us, everyone conforming to be no different than ones neighbor, and government only telling the public what they want them to know.Open your eyes and read this warning to what very well could become true if we do not change."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 remains one of the seminal works of literature in the English language, and one of the most important.

They draw many parallels and both are amazing."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.\\"My definition of a truly classic novel is one that is so talked about and referenced that you can know all about the book and it's message without having ever actually read it. 1984 is one of the most glaring examples of this, as terms such as \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"Doublespeak\\" are now mainstream concepts that no longer require explanation.The book itself gained its popularity, however, by successfully reaching a broad audience by exaggerating and reducing the complicated debate of the illusion of free will and freedom of thought in any kind of government structure that strives to control and manipulate the populace for its own benefit in an almost unbelievable science fiction setting. The extremes that are reached in 1984's may seem only possible in a work of fiction, yet there is a truth beneath the pulp novel trappings that most readers can not avoid recognizing.Note: For those who have already read this, I have a suggestion. Read 1984 again, only assume that the book actually takes place in our modern times, and that the narrator is a paranoid schizophrenic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time, right up there with Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.

I loved the fatal relationship between Julia and Winston, mostly because it was unsentimental and virtually realistic. I don't think Orwell romanticizes anything, alluding perhaps to the bleak style of life led in the book. (The denouement between the two is stunning, yet tragic). The novel ends on a melancholic, similarly unhappy note, which epitomizes the main idea presented: there really are no happy endings, and sometimes there is no winner. Winston, our anti-hero, already dull at the beginning, goes full circle, culminating in a conclusion full of Orwellian grace and sadness. Perhaps the ending was the best part of all, as it leaves the reader feeling like the world of 1984 is, in fact, real and never-ending. Clearly, that was Orwell's point."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"194 is a classic political novel. Anyone who thinks it is redundant or broing is only failing to realize that all the terms in the book have become commonplace in society.

It is a surveillance society in a nation always at war with an amorphous enemy. Fear is the Government's weapon of choice and the image of omniscience and omnipotence it projects upon its people is seemingly insurmountable. The society is deeply stratified and hierarchical with the privileged few at the core going out to the tentative citizens and the listless prolatariat (called proles) at the very bottom of the pile. The story surrounds a very common man and his struggle to be fully 'himself' in a society that frowns upon individualism and independent thought.The context of this book renders it somewhat prophetic of the past 8 or so years of the Western world. Orwell's insight is worthy of canonization because of how right he seems to be about the tools of societal control and influence. He includes the dubious 'tele-screens' eerily reminiscent of the broadcast media, numberless CC TV cameras employed by some cities and perhaps even the ubiquitous Internet and vulnerability it implies on our privacy. Then there is the growing power of Homeland Security laws.Orwell seems like he may be attacking autocrats and dictators but there may be another agenda. It is not Big Brother himself that is to be feared but the system which he represents. The Goverment is as faceless as their ceaseless enemy and Orwell depicts a society that slowly became what it was with time. Can he be saying that any society is prone to the evils of control?The fight of our hero is admirable and leaves us questioning the role of the individual in society. The ending you must read for yourself. But by the time you finish you might be a believer or a revolutionary depending on whose side Orwell convinces you to join."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Do you think that the USA is going to invade North Korea without provocation? Probably not. Even Bush hasn't done it or advocated it, and if he doesn't it probably never will happen. But that's not what the people of North Korea believe. They think that they are going to be invaded. And this is what Chavez is pounding into his masses of poor people in Venezuela. Fear is a very good way to control people. Look at the USA after 9/11. We were shocked, and rightly so. We invaded Afghanistan, and rightly so. But then things got a little wacky and we were not sure if we were continuing in the right direction. If took several years before we could start to see things a little more objectively, but perhaps now we aren't really seeing things correctly either. Perhaps this is just the opposition's turn to confuse us.Orwell shows how masses can be controlled without even knowing it. He shows how 4 = 5, and how you can make people appreciate how little you do for them. Instead of complaining about the Press's mistakes, thank your luck stars that we have a free press. And then wonder just how free it really is..."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So how have I made it this far in life without reading this book? After finally taking the opportunity to finish it, I wonder how I made it through high school and through a Political Science degree without having read Nineteen Eighty-Four.I chose to purchase this book on audio and loved the narration. I felt as if I could feel Winston's thoughts as he made a journey to question the life that he was living and question \\"the party.\\" This book reaffirmed my love for the freedoms that I enjoy in so many different ways - the freedom to love, to travel, to have a family and friends, to ask questions, to write and acknowledge my feelings, to READ! This world that Orwell created, and described in such realistic detail, was a nightmare and was in such contradiction to the democratic freedoms that I know.I think that what struck me the most was the love affair that Winston shared with Julia. That it was forbidden was horrible, but the lengths that they had to go to be together and to hide their relationship was astounding. Winston risked everything to trust Julia, and he did so with full force, with everything that he had.The optimist in me hoped for an overthrow of this world that was described in Nineteen Eighty-Four. I wanted the characters to experience the world that I live in, because the alternative that was presented was so unspeakable. This novel was amazing for its ability to make me appreciate what I have, to describe something so very opposite to what I know.I hope that everyone has an opportunity to read it and is able to appreciate their reality just a little more, because they have received a little glimpse of Orwell's alternative."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was a good book to read. The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila. Both of their stories were amazing and there seceret life together. The bad part of the book is that it got complicated sometimes with the back story of the government. With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear. Overall the book was good but it also had moments of greatness that could hold my attention and keep me riveted. However, parts of the book lacked that spark that kept me coming back for more."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Quick and short review:Book was very well written; the story flows smoothly, not very many names to remember, with an ending that you would probably not expect.A word of advice: Do not read the \\"preface\\" of the book, as the author of the preface writes specifically about what happens in the book. How foolish.Also, the book entitled Animal Farm by George Orwell is very similar to this book, so when reading Animal Farm it felt like I was reading 1984 again.

Having just finished it, I can honestly say that in my opinion this is one of the most well written, engaging, and thought-provoking books I've ever had the pleasure to sit down with. The book had me hooked from the very beginning and never let go. It's so masterfully done and the creation of the Newspeak language just tells the tale of how much thought and effort went into this work. No short-cuts were taken in this time-honored tale. I was mesmerized for days after completing it and it is definitely a book I will read again and again.I can't recommend this brilliant work highly enough.

When he wants you to feel happy, you can't obey. This book itself is a good example of a Totalitarian regime. It absolutely controls you until the last page."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is considered a prototypical dystopian novel by many literature critics. In 1984, Orwell captures the very feeling of helplessness of being trapped within a world where war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Winston Smith lives a worse life in this world than everyone around him. With Winston, Orwell shows that real torture is not being brainwashed, but knowing that you are brainwashed. Some may say that the world in 1984 is not realistic. Actually, this model dystopia is an example of a perfectly established communistic world. Every side of this book is possible, which allows us to wonder if George Orwell's intention of this book was something more than simply a classic word of dystopian literature. Perhaps, the year before he died, Orwell saw that a communistic world was not safely far off, and a warning should be shown to the public. The importance of this novel may have been the reason that Orwell isolated himself on an island in Jura, Scotland, when sensing his impending death of tuberculosis.To aid him in this warning, Orwell found all the imperfect things in the world, made them worse, and added them to the life of Winston Smith. But it seems like Orwell did not have a typical idea as to what the worst things in life are. Such things as famine and lack of clothing do play a part in 1984, but Orwell seems to emphasize that the real means of torture are more mental. One of the main subjects of 1984 is the Party being able to alter the past to fit their means. Because of this, Winston is tortured with having no proof of what may or may not have happened in the past. Only once does he actually find some proof, and even that is taken away from him. With these views as to what is truly an element of torture, Orwell captures the genre of dystopian literature.Overall, an excellent book, easily fit to be one of the model dystopian stories."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I bought this book for one of the boys for a class at school.

Upon reading it 20 years later, I was amazed! This was a very shocking book in that when it was written there was no way the author could have known what would have been invented or happening in our present time or in 1984. It reads like fiction, but we know it is reality. He sheds light on many events that are already in motion, even though government may not make it official to the public. This book is a warning of just how terrible life could be if we continue to be blinded by what we are told by the media; how truth is distorted by the deliverer and their masters and how humans will ultimately destroy themselves for the sake of power if allowed to do so. Of course history does repeat itself, I hope that will be proven incorrect."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell created an interesting but slightly disturbing look at life in his idea of a future world in 1984. He does a brilliant job using symbolism and he really shows some of the flawed points of government and people. His purpose with this novel was to inform people to be aware of what is going on and try not to lost their brains as they follow the crowd. Another important point that he tries to get across is how too much power can corrupt people.George Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair, was born in 1903 in a British colony of India. He was most well known in his time for being a journalist, but today he is remembered for his novels. Animal farm is one of his most famous novels along with 1984.Orwell has many good points and does a wonderful job in passing on those lessons throughout much of the book. That is untill the ending where many of these lessons are then blurred in a confusing, creative, and chilling cliffhanger. While for me the ending was a little disappointing, I can see how many others would enjoy it. I personally prefer endings that are more resolved.I think that the book tells an intriguing story that will keep the reader on their toes the entire time. On top of that, the characters are wonderfully written and easy to relate to. I found that the goals were well represented. Overall, I think that this is a classic story that is full of excitment, terror, and love. I would recommend it to anyone I know who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984By George OrwellSignet Classics. $9.99(Ages 14 and up)Reviewed by:High School FreshmanGeorge Orwell is a gifted writer who has written many novels, several of them involving government and politics. In this creative and haunting book, he attempts to reach out to his readers to show them what the world might be if the use of technology and invasion of government without proper boundaries can be disastrous to humankind and society.George Orwell, pseudonym of Eric Blair, wrote many novels in his lifetime. Many of Mr. Orwell's novels will be read from generation to generation. This was thanks to his great creativity in his writing. One good example of his imagination and creativity is when he wrote one of his most famous novels, which used symbolism to recognize the government, politicians, and effects of the Russian Revolution, is the short but clever book, Animal Farm. Mr. Orwell uses similar elements of government in 1984 to illustrate the evils of governments and what they can inflict on its people.Based on the great detail, originality, and the vivid depiction of Winston's struggle in 1984, I believe the Mr. Orwell has successfully portrayed a negative utopia. For example, in part three, chapter five, Winston, the main character, was placed into the torture chamber of Room 101. Here, he was tortured and beaten in order to clear his head of freedom and independence in order to replace it with the government ideas and propaganda. This chapter shows that there is fragile line between governmental control and supervision, and the dangers of mind control in an entire society.There are both weaknesses and strengths in this novel. One weakness is that George Orwell's explanation of societal views is complicated and difficult to understand without extensive knowledge of political ideologies. In order to fully comprehend what is going on and to understand the symbolism he is using, the reader must be knowledgeable in governmental studies. Although these factors seem to detract from the book, there is one important strength that really makes this book fantastic. This great strength is his use of symbolism and reference. There is more to the story than reader may initially think. I am sure if I reread this book ten or even twenty years from now, I will view this story in a different perspective."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The way Orwell suck you into the book is one of the most effective ways I've experienced. His metaphysical imagination of the last decade is frightening and mind-blowing at the same time. It makes us think of the world in the book, and inevitably compare it with ours. 1984 stands as one of my all-time favourite. And to the 15-year-old reader from USA who said that it's mundane, I have a word of advice for you. If you can't imbibe the message in the book, then you're just immature. Mind you, I'm 16."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"First, I wanna say that this book is above anything else you will read during your lifetime. It is more inspiring than the scripture, and for many, more useful (no offense).When I finished reading 1984 in my freshman year of college, I was completely depressed, devastated, yet infinitely enlightened. 1984 is not fiction by any standard; the techniques used by the totalitarian governments in the novel resemble those of today's Third World countries very much that you would think Orwell was a real prophet, or maybe just the mentor? Anyway, I come from a country with a totalitarian regime, and 1984 was like a slap on the face and a wake-up call: I suddenly realized why my country is in constant war, why we see the portrait of our own Big Brother everywhere, why my countrymen never taste the revenues of oil and how it is all achieved. Oh, in case you were wondering, I come from a country called Syria.The novel cannot be fully appreciated by an American who lived all his or her life thinking that the biggest threat to their life was the Commies or Saddam Hussein using chemical weapons on them, or, not having milk to go with their cereal in the morning. Those who truly suffer their governments' greed and insanity will undoubtedly find some form of solace in reading Orwell's masterpiece. Alas, most of those live in countries where reading is not a luxury to be had freely, and where existence is a struggle. In short,the novel will transform you to a whole plane psychologically and intellectually. READ IT, for your own sake, for humanity's sake. Only then will you know why it is really a free (well, almost) cure to stupidity, ignorance, and apathy."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I believe that this book shows a great struggle between being an individual and being a follower of an unknown power. And it shows the horror of living in a totalitarian world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell has come as close to scripture as possible in this chilling, surreal, astounding book. For those of you who believe that power can be benign, just read this book, and you will NEVER fully trust any power structure again."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is not only the best book he wrote, but also without any doubt the best apocalyptical novel ever written and probably also the best book written in the 20ieth century, that is the most important one. George Orwell once wrote that if one was to summarize his complete work, or find one topic in all of his books, novels, essays and short stories, it would be his fight against totalitarian systems. So 1984 wasn't only the last book he ever wrote, but also his impressive final work on the topic that had influenced all his work. Why is it so genius? Mainly because it is a universal work. Of course it describes perfectly well real totalitarian systems that existed, like Stalin's or Hitler's, and it is basically a book against totalitarian systems, but it is also more. It describes a society, but also the minds of the people living in it, it describes the way mankind could be, it is a universal book about human evil. Ideas like doublethink or newspeak seem frightening familiar to us, we know the trends that lead to what has become out of society in 1984. The probably most shocking thing about 1984 is that it is perfectly realistic and logical in its structure. It is a perfect dictatorship, with High Tech and omniposcient. The main difference between the system in 1984 and, for example, Hitler's dictatorship is that the government in 1984 can do something no other dictatorship in reality ever could: Totally reign over man's mind. What Socrates once said today still is true: The thoughts are free. Even people resisting the nationalsocialistic regime and being caught and tortured still had their thoughts, they could make them say anything, but they could not make them really believe it. In 1984, even thoughts are slaved, it takes a long time to change Winston's mind, and it is not easy, but they finally succeed, finally Winston's mind is changed, impressively demonstrated by the famous final sentence of the book. The shocking thing is that even this seems to be possible to the reader, no one can claim that it's not logical. It is interesting to know that Orwell really believed that the future would look like 1984. Sure, he was dying while writing 1984 and had ergo no hope left, but nevertheless it is too easy to claim that he was too pessimistic, anyway. 1984 also is based on his own experience, the confrontation with inhumanity and human misery in his whole life, the experience of the slums in Paris and London, the Spanish Civil War, English hippocritical people, the Nazis and the Holocaust, etc. One really can see the ideas presented in 1984 developing in his work, &quot;Politics and the English language&quot; is nothing else but a description of newspeak, and in &quot;Looking back on the Spanish Civil War&quot;, he already talks about the concept of the nonexistence of truth in a totalitarian system, even using the same example (2+2=5). It is also too easy to say that 1984 is over, that Orwell was wrong, and what he predicted will never actually happen. 1984 is a warning, a horrible and shocking warning which must not be ignored by anyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell wrote about his own time, 1948. He found the reality of what was going on so disturbing that he refused to acknowledge this time: he swapped the 4 and 8, hence its title.Orwell explores a depressing humanity, listless with meaninglessness.The crux is at the end where Winston is talking to O'Brien and says he knows that he will fail...that there's something in the universe, something that he will never overcome. O'Brien asks if Winston believes in God. Winston says no. Thus there is nothing that exists that the party does not control.This is Orwell's nightmare; a world without God."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's portrayal of a distopic future is extremely powerful. Perhaps what makes it so gripping is the haunting plausability of it all - you'd like to think &quot;this is a book, it's fiction,&quot; but it could all too easily come true. As a college student, this has had far more impact on my beliefs than any textbook or lecture. If you've read and enjoyed Huxley's &quot;A Brave New World&quot; (also very good), you'll like this one, too!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's unbeleivably captivating and horrific view of a totalitarian society never fails to make a reader reflect upon the riddles of our society. The story of a grand experiment, a utopia gone horribly wrong, '84 has never been as potent, or as frightening, as it is now, as we approach an ever higher level of understanding through technology. The novel revolves around Winston Smith, a typical Party member torn between his personality, his emotion, and the omniprescence of Big Brother and his thought police. Constantly trying to stay as far as possible from the party's cruel influence, Winston learns of the truth behind the propaganda, and learns how the incredible power came upon the first leaders of the party. By controlling thought, the party has become intangible, and undefeatable. From the first sentance to the last four horrifying words, 1984 is a novel to be reckoned with, and one that is difficult to recover from. WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 wasn't like 1984, but if the future will be like this sometime I don't want any part of it.In the world of 1984, a communist-ish government called Oceana is in charge of the Americas, Austrailia and the British Islands, at constant war with three other similar governments. (You'll read more about that in the book--it's pretty fascinating.) Thinking unorthodox thoughts about the government and the way things are is a crime, punishable by torture and death. Everywhere you go you are in the presence of a telescreen, a sort of two-way TV where they can see you instead of you just seeing them. The English language is in the process of being modified so that unortodox thoughts are not possible.Other than that, the government seems pretty fair...:)Definitely one of my favorite books. Read it now, if you haven't already, but I wouldn't reccomend it to the young'ins (6th grade and below)...there's...uhh...stuff they wouldn't understand."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"BRAVO! This is my all-time favorite book. Its wonderfully intriguing and sophisticated plot sparks intelligent thought, reexamination of our society, and serves as a warning for our future.

Be prepared to be amazed by the power of the mind!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I feel as though I should be shouting all the cheesy cliches: &quot;What a page-turner!&quot;, &quot;I couldn't put it down!&quot;; but I would hate to parallel such mindlessness with Orwell's pure genius. 1984 is an excellent story with familliar characters (the rebel, the romantic, etc.), but also much more. Orwell's accuracy surrouding both the government and the media is undeniably disturbing. This book and &quot;Brave New World&quot; have turned me on to a whole new genre of literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The key to really grasping Orwell's &quot;Negative Utopia&quot; is to get an idea of where he was writing from. Note that the power of the Orwellian totalitarianism stems completely from punishment and fear of such. This seems reasonable considering that Orwell had just witnessed the &quot;glory&quot; of the Nazi dictatorship and the birth of Stalinism. However, such a society still creates a certain level of discontent."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'm rating 1984 a 10, since it's pretty apparent that the book has indeed stood the test of time to become a twentieth century classic.But people growing up today- particularly since the fall of the Soviet bloc- may have a hard time understanding what Orwell was writing about. At the time the book was written, the Soviet show trials were still in the news, and Orwell- a lifelong socialist who still distrusted most socialists- saw in the Soviet trials what could happen to England. 1984 was then written as a warning to the British of what Orwell felt their world was coming to.Today's readers should keep in mind that the world Orwell warned about was not a fantasy world, but aside from the techology of the Telescreen, very much a real picture of the Soviet Union of the 30s. When government officials start talking about controlling the Internet, and restricting communication between people, or wanting to hold onto everyone's encryption keys, think of 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"de este libro me hab&igrave;an hablado bastante, por lo cual me decid&igrave; a leerelo, y desde esta modesta opinion lo considero uno de los cl&aacute;sicos de la literatura universal.Por lo cual muy recomendable."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Someone wrote that 1984 shows us how the world would be like if the governments obtained complete power over the populace. But HOW is this power obtained? As citizens in democratic (?) nations we have a duty to work for democracy around the world and to see to that all aspects of democracy are maintained. If we fail, the nightmare of 1984 can turn into reality.Orwell's 1984 really makes one think. The novel stays on your mind, and hopefully it will never go away.How would I react as a citizen of a totalitarian state?Would I have the guts to stand up for democracy and human rights, knowing that it could get me killed?Even if 1984 is a nightmare, small parts of it become reality every day, throughout the world.So maybe George Orwell's great novel isn't just a warning?And hey, look out for Newspeak!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like &quot;Animal Farm&quot; better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree.&quot; 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it.

The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story. BEWARE OF ROOM 101."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book is gripping and holds the reader captive for the majority of the book. The characters tale is told intelligently and the plot has all of the litte things it takes to make a good book. However, towards the end of the book it becomes boring unless you really have the perserverence to go on. On a less technical note the book tells a story that you can see in the lay of tomorrow and it is not a good prospect. A time when propoganda is the daily news and and you love your government, dead or alive. They say that love will always find a way, and here it does. For a short time that is. The government goes even so far as to control a persons personal life, and the struggle against them is fruitless, if not gripping.

It is well-written, the characters are excellently portrayed, the themes are strong and compelling... But for me the one thing this novel does better than all that is paint an atmosphere. Orwell draws you into the world he creates so expertly you can *feel* the sense of oppression, it's so real it is perfectly palpable. When the lead characters breaks free, you will him with all your soul to succeed... One of the greatest books ever written. And one of the most affecting."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"i'm reading this book in my english class right now and i'm actually not even done... i'll admit in the beginning it was pretty slow and kind of boring but we're almost done with it now and i really like it.. i'm not too into reading or anything and it's pretty hard for me to find a book i like... i guess what i'm saying is that it's a good book and people should read it :)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell may have not been correct on placeing the date on the book but his ideas to me are seemingly coming true. In this modern world it seems almost impossible to elude video-cameras, microphones and other elements of this sort. If the government wants to watch you they all ready have the means to due so. In our schools we are being taught only half truths to every major conflict with other world powers. For example go to Vietnam and they're musuems and history books have a whole other perspective on the vietnam war, but how are school children to know this other perspective. So in a way the U.S. is actually rewriting history. Also the press seems to rule our lives they tell us whats cool, whats not, how to act, and how to think. What is to stop them from crossing the line. We are given the false myth that they work for us; when in fact every thing you here is edited by certain people to portray certain messages to you. For example, everytime we see a third world country on TV all we see is poverty and starvation, what you dont see is the millions of people in that country that are doing fine , given you the false pretense that life here in America is sooooo much better. Watch out It may not be long before Orwells interpretation of the future might happen."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"People forget that this book isn't about what Orwell actually thought 1984 would be like, but rather it was what he thought the future could be like.

Not only is 1984 massively important but it is a great read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is quite probably the greatest novel ever written. That's my opinion. Read this book, and form your own opinion, but under NO circumstance should you let someone make you read this book. If you look at all the negative reviews, they are bitter and insulting, and most of those readers were forced into reading this book. They thought it wasn't realistic, they thought the characters were shallow, they thought is was depressing. I don't know what they expected from this novel, but there's no reason to insult the book or author. I would like to see any one of the people who graded this poorly write a novel of superior quality! These are the same people who bump into you in the streets and don't apologize, the same people who won't give up their seat on the bus to a pregnant or elderly person, the same people who won't politely hold a door open for you. These people are rude. They go through life complaining about other people, worrying only about themselves. They're angry at someone, but they take it out on a book they weren't bright enough to understand. Huh? We do live in america, and we do have the right to an opinion, and we do have the right to freedom of speech. But we also have something called manners. Well, most of us do. Not these people."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A little unrealistic. Orwell is quite the optimist"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book clearly was ahead of it's time.

What's that all about, this is 1984 we're talking about here! This book is THE scariest and most thought provoking tome around. From the first sentence of the book, &quot;The bells struck thirteen as Winston Smith, yada yada yada&quot; we're thrust into a completely different world, one so different and alien from our own, yet presented to the reader in such a painstaking, logical fashion as to raise questions about the state of our own modern society and the conventions of war and class structure. The society consists of two constantly warring nations: Atlantia and Oceana, embattled in a constant state of warfare which neither can afford to stop, their constant bickering and cosmetic bombings and attacks merely a mutually beneficial ploy to keep the masses in a constant state of shock, making them even more vulnerable to the intense psychological programming they undergo at the hands of the state. Big Brother, the party's exalted leader, is the unquestioned benefactor/leader of the people and is worshipped and feared. No one's lives are private. People are stripped of their individuality, kept placated and half drunk, and bombarded with government propaganda through the large, two-way telescreens in every party member's home. The sex drive is all but obliterated, through forced marriage and sex is only tolerated for procreational purposes. Even the language has been shortened, reduced in words by the govt. in an effort to shorten...look, I could go on and on here, I'm dying to just copy the whole book here so you can read it right now, but I've only got 1000 words. Look, it's Orwell's masterpiece, it's as relevant today as any book in the world, a scary reminder of the power govt. and the herd mentality of the average person, two variables that could result in the kind of scary, postapocalyptic world he invisioned, even though we have sucessfully made it well beyond 1984 on our calenders, Orwell's chillingly believable nightmare still rings out as a warning cry to the human race, made all too scary by the fact that many of the books conventions, for instance, the govt's ability to observe everyone by camera, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, are a realistic possibility now, with the advent of cheap videocamera technology. The story exists on another level in the love story told of Winston, the everyman antagonist and Julia, a pretty young woman who holds a strange hold on him and introduces him to love for the first time in his life. Their coupling is the supreme act against Big brother and the party, yet they continue to meet in secret and profess their love for one another. Love itself is a crime, and the couple on not only scared that the so-called &quot;thought police&quot; might catch them, but KNOW the inevitablility of the consequences regarding their act before it even takes place, with the first knowing glance of their eyes, the deed is done, convention be damed, they commit their Lovecrime and are, for a time, the only truly free people in all of Oceana. It's just a marvelous book, okay? Check it out, you'll like it, it's not even very long, what can it hurt. My favorite book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"You feel a sense of doom from the beginning. Even as Winston and Julia are embracing each other in the field, or in the dusty room above Mr. Charrington's shop, you instinctively know that in the end they will have to lose. I was surprised when O'Brien came in and now I can't decide whether he is good or evil. Like the book said, O'Brien tortured Winston and eventually sent him to his death. But still...did he really mean it? Or was O'Brien yet another brainwashed victim of The Party? You should not read this book if you do not like unhappy endings."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is undoubtably one of the most moving books I've ever read - it made me cry, and it's rare for me to weep on account of a book or film. The society it depicts is so horrific, and so - plausible. I'm not saying that this is necessarily the future, but it is definitely one of the more unpleasant ways the human race could conceivably take. In Winston Smith we have the representative of all of us - he isn't a genius, and he isn't a saint; and he doesn't want ot be a genius or a saint, he just wants to lead his life in the way he, and the rest of human society, was meant to do; in relative freedom in his actions and his thoughts. And the story of his personal struggle, his betrayal, his ultimate defeat is so timeless, so true that it, more than anything else in the book (although the whole novel is brilliant, eg. the political ideas expressed in it are so carefully thought out that we can truly believe in the potential for a party like, well, the Party), marks &quot;1984&quot; out as one of the most moving and human stories around."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"a personification of the human spirit. after reading of the living death portrayed by the author, i realized that the man sentenced to life enprisonment has liberties unbound. to conceive the perils of this novel, is to enjoy life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of the greatest literary works of all times. This book tells of man's dreams, hopes, ambitions, and, most importantly of all, his true self. To those that believe a better world is bound to come, you are fools. This book says the true ending. I cannot figure out but two epitaphs for man: nuclear war or 1984. But why, you might ponder? Because this book depicts the most cruel, vicious, and realistic side of man: the side where communism and fascism are tied together so that the forces of darkness march through the earth (taken from &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;). This masterpiece is the bible of man. All that is in this book is plausible and much of it has happened although these real-life happenings where sugary compared to this book's omen. Goebbels's and Hitler's propaganda machine is depicted in this book, as is Stalin's, Hitler's and America's secret police. And in the book's 5 main slogans lies the truth of man. I call forth anyone that is willing to read this book and not be suprised and horrified. I dare someone to not see that this book is the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I just wanted to recommend to those who say that this book is too unbelievable, and though intellegent, a bit extreme, read the book Imagining Argentina. Based on the period of the 1970's in which many anti-government activists &quot;dissapeared&quot;, the similariies were uncanny between the two, and made me rethink my original reaction to the book and admire Orwell's book all the more."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I loved 1984! Winston Smith was the best character in literary history. With great characters such as Big Brother, Julia, O'Brien and even the hardly mentioned Katharine, (Winston's wife) this book instantly drew me in and I couldn't stop reading it. Orwell's image of life in the future shows through in our true life. Big Brother is our government. A government that constantly watches us and moniters us. In conclusion, 1984 is the best book that was ever written. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER! DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER! DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way?

It may perhaps be the case that when I read 1984 I was less aware of the levels of surveillence in operation however, with the &quot;advance&quot; of technology it is certain that Big Brother is indeed watching much of what we do. With the recent launch (in the UK anyway) of interractive tv it makes one realise just how real the telescreen is. Perhaps received at the time of it's publishing as paranoid rantings, these days the terrifying predictions are one by one becoming true-once a work of futuristic fiction this book could almost be used now as an urban survival guide. A beatiful and chilling read"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"...when people misinterpret 1984 as an anti-Commie book. Orwell WAS a member of the far-left earlier on in life, and 1984 is an anti-totalitarianism novel, a novel that attacks dictators and wannabe-dictators of the entire political spectrum. And it can still happen - look at the world today: censorship, both on the Internet and in the more conventional media, is becoming more popular, everyone's a fashion-enslaved brain-washed conformity-seeking sheep, and we're all continually screwed by politicians who think they know what's best for us.Another criticism of 1984 is the downbeat ending and the essential hopelessness of it all. But the fact is, that if the world slips into a dictatorship like that in 1984 then there will be no hope. Orwell is trying to tell us that we must fight for our every freedom NOW - if we don't then we don't deserve them.This is the greatest science fiction novel of all time (and you can't tell me it's not SF - just because it's SF doesn't mean it isn't literature)."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As one of the people writing about the book here said, it was not meant to incite paranoia, it was about the evils of paranoia. Also, he was a socialist, so I cannot say that it was just propaganda. And don't forget that Communism isn't dead. There are still a few Communist countries out there, not to mention the many dictatorships. As for the book itself, it was pretty good, once you get into it. I like reading about different worlds myself, so I liked this aspect of it. The characters were also pretty cool. The ending was depressing but very very good. It is still very relevant, but I wouldn't recommend it for action fans."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Huxley predicts the growth curve of our civilization with shocking accuracy.

Go Lakers!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I would reccomend this book to anyone, especially someone who is fed up with the &quot;fluff&quot; that they are having students read in high school. I read this book for my honors english class, and was surprised at it's similiarities to the present state of some countries in the U.S.A. If I could put in a section in the library under horror. How are Orwell's telescreens that much different from the security cameras popping up on every main street corner and sometimes even in your office or home. With the way technology is people can listen to your phone calls and read your E-mails I would like somone to tell me how far we are from a totalitarian society. When I read this book I got chills. Maybe, as Winston is convinced at the end, 2+2=5 and the idea that 2+2=4 is ludicruous. The scariest part to me is that we could be wrong."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The dismal,totalitarian way of life in Orwell's 1984 was very sad and seemed very discouraging when one comes to realize that much of what was foretold had already come to pass.Yet,we don't live in a Concentration Camplike society yet,and many of them have vanished.Like Orwell's other great book,Animal Farm,or even Wells' The Time Machine,this paints a picture of society as it might be if certain directions were taken.And like good satire should,it alerts us to make sure these directions aren't taken."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was by far one of the wierdest books i've ever read, but being a younger reader and this book being one of the first real science fiction novels itwas pretty good.

When i started to get into it it was a pretty good book. i usally rate books on if i am hooked on the first 5 pages, i still wasn't hooked on this one until way passed the 5th chapter.

The notion of Big Brother has become a part of everday speech, which I fear is leading to this term becoming clich&eacute;d. Read the book, and you will see what the term implies. The world of trumped up wars, constant surveillance, and historical editing is frighteningly mirrored by that of our own."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In one of my post-grad classes, a fellow student chided me for not having read \\"1984\\" despite having been an English major once upon a time. I soon remedied the situation and devoured this chilling classic. Big Brother and the Patriot Act share remarkable similarities (forgive me for stating the obvious). I thought Winston's requitted attraction and love for Julia very sweet--but of course, Big Brother tortures and disfigures the lovers out of their feelings.The human intellect evolves into \\"quacking\\" for communication. An interesting take on how regressed we can become if we are not careful of the public policy and ideology of elected officials. However, I really hope and believe that despite how bad things can get, we will never regress to that extent---but a brilliant and thought-provoking cautionary tale, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"My title says it all. I was completely immersed in this novel and enjoyed reading it. It was a fast read, and much more interesting than some of Orwell's other works such as Animal Farm.It's a rather unusual novel because it's made to be futuristic and a novel in the genre of science fiction. However, it takes place more than 20 years ago in 1984. If you can get over that fact it's a great book with jawdropping changes in plot and interesting characters."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Imagine a society where the government (Big Brother) is always watching you-invasive, inevitable, inescapable. Such is Oceania. It is a society in which your innermost thoughts are monitored and punishable by death. There is no love or affection, and there is no such thing as friendship. The only suitable emotion is hatred, aimed at exactly whom Big Brother dictates. Individuality is a capital offense. Existing for your own pleasure will get you killed.Oceania controls the present, the past, and the future. Reality is what Big Brother says is reality. 2 + 2 = 5, if Big Brother so dictates. If you protest that 2 + 2 = 4, and the government finds out, this thoughtcrime will result in your death.Winston, the main character in 1984, dares to believe 2 + 2 = 4.To discover what happens in the life of this rebel, who lives in a society that is intolerant of rebellion, read 1984. This book, set in such a chilling dystopia, will horrify and thrill your heart and mind."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell is an excellent novel that displays the possible horrors of a \`utopian government'. The novel takes place in London, a large city in Oceania. The main character is Winston, and he is able to see the lies of The Party, which rules the nation.Throughout history, Oceania has been at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia. The Party uses censorship to revise history to make look as if Oceania has been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or vice versa. Winston is employed by The Party and his job is to change these past records.Along with censorship, The Party uses techniques like newspeak and doublethink to control the masses. Newspeak is an effort by the government to create a very simple language that is dull and not descriptive. This \`lean' language is designed to minimize the brain use of Oceanians. Doublethink is another effort of The Party to control Oceanians. Doublethink is a technique taught by The Party that requires people to believe things that they know are not true. For instance, a citizen may know for a fact that Oceania was at war with Eastasia only a few years ago, even though The Party insists that Oceania is an ally of Eastasia and always has been.Winston begins to question the greatness of The Party when he sees how blindly some people can follow the party. This really struck Winston one day during the \`two minutes hate', in which The Party shows enemies of Oceania on the telescreen, and all of the Oceanian citizens scream at the person on the screen. Winston is bothered by this, and gains a deep desire to \`bring down Big Brother'.This book is an excellent read for people of all ages, and can show the dangers of government intervention into personal life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a brilliant book, written in a cold, indifferent air. It's never slow. You never lose interest. In fact, you'll get mad when you have to put it down. Even during the most mundane things in the protagonist's life (like coming home from work and watching TV) it never loses suspense. Lots of political satire; makes for a good debate when through. If only books were still written like this, more people would have a reason to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I first read this novel I liked it but thought that it could have been better. I think much of my thining was caused by Brave New World. But the more research I did into this work and Blair himself lead me to believe that he was right-on. The type of totalitarianism that he was addressing were despotic. I found it odd though that Blair seemed to demonstrate the Marxist system in such a bad light. But it seems that if one looks at his commentary in the light in which it was written one sees that he was not addressing Marxism but Bolshevism (or Sovietism) and Nazism. These were not the happy pleasant dystoipias that one finds in Huxley. Also the issues that Blair was addressing were different from those that are normally thought of, especially in the cse of Huxley. Blair is addressing humanity and the abstracts that go with it while Huxley is looking at aspects of Western culture (e.g. drugs, technology, education and higherarchical class structure). It's true that many of the same issues are dealt with in both works but Huxley still comes to happier conclusions, disturbing as they may be. The reason for this seems to be that Huxley's world was the precursor to Blair's. The war had not yet begun. The socialist experiments in Germany and the Soviet Union had not yet failed. The Spanish revolution had not yet begun. While the world was not perfect it was much easier to be ignorant about the many evils of the world and assume that the only ills that the world could bring were held in the deterioration that over-indulgance would yield. While both are accurate Blair had a lot more information to work with."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book in one word is shocking. Not necessarily shocking in the sense that it's shockingly bad, but the point it conveys, the powerful frightening messages it contains, and the warning it has on modern-day civilization is shocking; It's too \\"apocalyptic\\" to believe, yet it shows that if our world continues to gradually decline, that this may very well be our future. So in that sense this book is great. It is powerful, well-written, and easily a classic that should be passed down from generation to generation.A word of caution, however; this book is not a light, fun read to quickly skim over. It is a book to dwell on, to study, and to learn from.So, with that said, read this book and see into the frightening reality of 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The world of George Orwell's 1984 is a dirty world that is filled with equally dirty people. This filth is both external and internal. There is scarcely a page in which Orwell does not describe the run-down condition that is Oceania. Grime seems to cover each wall and window. Elevators break. Nearly all moving devices need continual repair. The only device that is guaranteed to work is the ubiquitous telescreen. The characters are the human equivalent of their eroding technology. Almost everyone is fat, gross, balding, or otherwise plain ugly. Winston Smith, the hero, is described in terms that make the reader wonder why his lover, Julia, fell in love with him. It is this preoccupation with grubbiness that serves as a subtext to point out that the world of Oceania is the inevitable result when the beauty of individuality is removed and the uncaring and life-denying collective psychology of the state is substituted. When the only ones in a society who seek to celebrate their independence of mind and body can do so knowing full well that their discovery is certain, then their relationship takes on a significance that is worth the terrible cost. For most of the book, Winston and Julia tap dance around each other before finding out that each is not alone. When they couple sexually, their orgasm is a political statement. The next logical step is to find others like themselves. They believe that Winston's boss, O'Brien, is a kindred soul who is also a member of the secret brotherhood. He gives them a book to read which explains the principles by which the group's members live. Ironically, to become a member of this group dictates that both Winston and Julia must merge into the group's collective consciousness more thoroughly than demanded by Big Brother for his group, the symbol of the party that governs Oceania. Their relation is detected nearly at once, but the party allows them to continue until it decides to arrest them. O'Brien is really a traitor to the probably non-existent brotherhood, and it is he who interrogates both Winston and Julia. O'Brien is described as an aging but still vigorous torturer. In fact, he uses his wrinkled face as a metaphor for the futility of Winston to seek to enhance his own psychological life by engaging in forbidden love. Winston is thoroughly beaten, humiliated, broken. His de-evolution from Thinking Man to Orthodox Man is both rapid and irreversible. As he stares into the mirror, O'Brien tells him that if Winston believes himself to be the last free thinking man on earth, then the wreck that stares back at him merely punctuates the party claim that the individual counts not at all in the political scheme of things. When Winston acknowledges that he now loves Big Brother, the reader can see that this love is not the love of emotion but one of indoctrinated and inculcated values, and thus not worthy of the term 'love' at all. The tragic irony is that the reader can see this even if Winston Smith cannot."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book in an honors lit class in 9th grade and was surprised to find that it was not a suspended book at my high school yet (and at the same time I was glad it wasn't). Now I am a Junoir and able to fully apprieciate the well written polital novel. As I recall, it is about a man named Winston and is based in the furture where the government was nearly in complete control over a person and their thoughts. This place is Oceana which is located in London and at war or allienced with East Asia and Eurasia (Winston is the only one who knows the truth to this and is therefore especially watched closely as he contains top secreate information from the \\"Truth Ministry\\"). Big Brother is the politacal party that controls London and the secrete police is basically it's secrete weapon to reading the peoples thoughts and killing them off. Winston falls in love with a woman (illigally) named Julia and therefore ends up joining the Brotherhood (good political party against Big Brother). Here we see telescreens that are hidden all over secrete and public places to moniter peoples movements and thoughts. Winston gets caught doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing and is sent to one of the prisons (the most interestingly detailed part in the novel). Here Wiston must face the ultimate punishment of his life...his own fear. Read it, ponder over it, and fear it, and enjoy it. I've even heard that today London has at least 1 survalence camera for every 15 people (sounds kind of like the telescreens to me)....."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a thought provoking book of what George Orwell thought the world would actually be like in 1984. It is a scary prediction, that your whole society is controlled by an unseen figure and all individual thought is completely discouraged. Free will is taken away and people are basically forced to become living robots, submitting to every will of the Party. An original thought will lead you to become wiped out of existence, and the Party will change the past so that you never existed in the first place. This frightening society is conveyed by the life of Winston Smith, an unhappy Party member who holds the idea of Brotherhood. 1984 is unlike any book I have ever read. Since it requires some deal of imagination, I would not recommend it to anyone who has trouble imagining a totally new system of living. The workings of the government require deep thought, so it is not a very easy book to read. However, I enjoyed reading about this insight of the future. I am completely honest in saying that 1984 is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book with the expectations that it was gonna make me think, and it did. The overall theme that of an oppresive society in the \\"future\\" was both thought-provoking and entertaining. People say that this book has no relevence today because of the fall of Hitler and Stalin, but I say it means more now than ever before. You just need to think of it in the opposite context. Let me explain. Today, we have a wealth of information, some say too much. That is the point. Since we as people have so much at our fingertips, it gets pretty easy for most to spend all day looking at meaningless junk and buying things that they don't need. There is where an oppressive gov't takes over by giving us freedom to look and buy, they take away our freedom of privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. And that is why this book is so important today, because we may be on the brink of a \\"1984\\" ourselves."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Although Brave New World has been written before Orwell's masterpiece - which is the great merit of Aldous Huxley - and these books show different views of the future, I consider 1984 much more mature than the other. When I started to read it, I couldn't stop. It's intelligent, interesting and VERY well written. Besides, it deals with many, many issues, not only totalitarism, as people use to say. It deals also with loneliness, mass media and the power of verbal language. I really like Orwell's description of a profesional &quot;building&quot; a new language, a language so limited that would control human's thought. George Orwell was very inspired when he wrote this book. Congratulations to this sensitive writer."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I read it again every few years. This is such a scary look into what the future could be. I can't imagine what ran thorough peoples minds who read this book when it was first written in the 1940s. They must have held great fear for what was to come. Since I was 7 in 1984 I, obviously, did not read this book until well past that year.The world that this book describes is a scary place that none of us can begin to fathom living in. Upon reading the first few chapters it was odd to me that people existed in this world without striving for change. Upon finishing the book, I can state that I quickly saw how overpowering the government was and how things would most likely be impossible to change.Lastly I want to add that the scariest part of all is that some of the ideas in the book no longer seem so &quot;out there&quot;."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"...1984 is about totalitarianism. It is about a society ruled by a dictator named Big Brother. The thought police carefully scrutinize everyone in the society. They arrest you if you show signs of rebellion or dangerous behavior. Everyone is under constant observation by devices called telescreens; devices that are like two way TVs. One of the points of their society is to make everybody the same. They are working to destroy all things that are individual about people. They also destroy all evidence about the past. They invent and change events so that they are made to look good. They have abolished marriage in the common meaning of the word. You may only get married if you do not have any interest in the person. The main Character, Winston, questions this society. He longs for a time in which people had freedom. He starts a journal, a crime punishable with death, about the things he feels is wrong with the society. He meets a woman named Julia and they begin a secret affair. They find hideaways in the woods and go there separately because if they are seen too often together the thought police will get curious and investigate. They get a room over an antique shop in a poor neighborhood and use that to meet in. Eventually they meet up with a man named O'Brien who asks them to join the brotherhood, an anti Big Brother organization. O'Brien turns out to be a member of the thought police in disguise and they are arrested. They are tortured and made to confess everything. When they are released, they have no strong feelings for each other anymore and are for the rule of Big Brother.I think the significance of this story is to bring to attention the dangers of dictatorships. What Orwell did with his novel was create a hypothetical situation representing what could come if we are not careful. This book was written at a very tumultuous time in history where there were many emerging dictators. This book is Orwell's warning to society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Surely one among the few best social allegories ever written, together with Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 and Catch 22, and the harshest and least humorous among them. Though inspired by the Soviet regime, the mechanisms described in the text are suitable for most democratic and non-democratic contemporary societies. More than a prophecy, the novel represents a study of current social dynamics.Pressure for acceptance, mandate for substantial submission in spite of retention of a viewable independence, stratification of people by means of limited privileges are the pillars over which any sufficiently complex group relies upon. The thread develops from the particular situation of the chief character, Winston Smith, depicted against the environment created by the Party to his final struggle and breakdown, when he is forced to turn personal feelings from another person towards the Party, because \\"there is no love, except love of Big Brother, there is no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party\\". Even if the description of interrogatories and tortures is quite detailed and has been sternly represented in some film scenes, I have found two other issues as the most shocking in the novel: the speech of O'Brien (Smith's inquirer), in which he lines out the three stages, \\"learning, understanding and acceptance\\", that Winston is going to pass in order to cure his \\"mental derange and defective memory\\", and the picture of the fade remembrances of Winston's childhood, writing out the merciless way of how selfish a child could be, attached to Winston as an eternal sense of guilt, and which builds a parallel layer, more intimate and personal, about the subject of retaining memory of past events. Maybe Orwell has been too optimistic, because nowadays, as a consequence of media development, learning and understanding are no longer required: it is possible to obtain a direct acceptance."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think that every good aware American citizen shouldread this book every five years or so. Our freedom is whatmakes this country so great. The freedom to be different.The freedom to dream and love according to your owndesires. Go into Orwell's world of supression andlive out the danger with those who dare to rebel. Iread this book to remind myself that the freedom we alllove and flourish in, can be restrained in the name ofthe &quot;state's interest.&quot; Reread this book. Encourage yourkids to read it. Orwell is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was for me the most interesting book I've read in 2000. Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's horrific representation of Oceania, a world power and dominating force throughout the story, is a frighteningly realistic presentation of how governments work. Orwell displays the common theme of disinformation (called &quot;doublethink&quot;)used by government powers. Although 1984 has come and passed, the idea that governments can gain totalitarian control through complacent, uniterested citizens is not far from present conditions. 1984 is an excellent read, filled with wondrous insight for everyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nineteen Eighty FourThe book nineteen eighty-four is a novel of fiction written by George Orwell in 1948. Orwell's book is set in the year 1984 and is an account given by the main character Winston smith. In the book we find the world is broken into three different governments (Oceania,Eastasia,and Euraisa), and that Smith is a citizen of Oceania. Oceania is ruled by a tyrannical form of government known as the Party, which is controlled by a dictator referred to as Big Brother. The Party is broken-up into several branches called ministry's, and Smith is employed at the Ministry of Truth, which falsifies any records that would hurt the reputation of the Party. So the society in which Smith is accompanied essentially believes everything they are told, what to do, say, believe, and so on. Smith however gains a conception that this is not right an that freedom is better than tyranny. This however is constituted as one of the most serious crimes in Oceania; it is referred to as thought crime. In this society people are punished for not believing what the government tells them even if what they proclaim is absolutely ridicules. For instance, that 2+2=5, and if there is no evidence either supporting or conflicting that, what they have said must be true. At the end of the book Smith is tortured for committing thought crime and eventually released virtually unable to think for himself. I believe, if there is anything we can take from Orwell's novel,it is that freedom is precious, and should not be taken lightly or for granted, and that we as Americans should never forget the price that our fore fathers paid to receive it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's &quot;Prince&quot; and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious &quot;Book&quot; explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To some up this book, it is a novel written about the future (1984) written in 1949. It is based on a fictional new world order that arose from the history of the world and especially world war I &amp; II. It is a deep look into what could happen if government gains too much control of our everyday lives. The suprising thing is that you can draw parrallels with many of the features of our modern lives. If youve heard the terms &quot;big brother&quot; and &quot;thought police&quot;, this is where they came from. I recommend this one it'll make you think twice about our lives of emails, cameras, political correctness...etc."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Set in the imaginary totalitarian state of Oceania, whose population is controlled in word, deed and thought of the Party, the menacing but unseen Big Brother, the Thought Police and all - pervading propaganda. The main character Winston Smith, tries to stand up for the truth and humanity but is broken by the system. 1984 is an anti-utopian novel that examines the dangers of totalitarian rule and the loss of individual freedom, which is arguably a satire on Stalin's USSR. It seems that governments will never learn the lessons from history..."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To all those kids out there who say, &quot;aw man, not Orwell, this is so boring, I hate it, blah blah blah&quot; Grow up. I'm only a freshman and I loved this book. Orwell has to be my favorite author of all time. Animal Farm and 1984 are two of the best books I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A lot of schools assign this book to kids for their English classes. I wanted to point out that in a lot of ways, a person of that age can get more out of this book than someone of a more advanced age... High school is one of the times in life when conformity, and the perceived importance of fitting in, can be at their most intense, and their most frightening, as social forces. This book takes those ideas, those forces, and magnifies them by a thousand times. Think about how scary it would be if you literally had no libraries. And not only your town would have no libraries, but the WHOLE WORLD had all its records re-written every few years, so the adult version of the popular kids (&quot;The Party&quot; in this book) could tell everyone what to think, who to hate, who to like... I think this is a really terrific book to think over. In a funny way, a reader of that age might even want to compare it to Stephen King's &quot;Carrie&quot; -- in Stephen King's book, a lot of the background to the story is all about conformity, and how the good kids hate it, and some of the bad kids seem to use it as a sort of funnel for hatred, to funnel all that bad energy toward a few kids, to hurt them. I think in this book, Winston Smith could be seen as a parallel to Carrie (the character Carrie, not the book), only, unlike Carrie, he ends up breaking down in the end. This is not a fun, happy story, but I think a lot of kids would really respect themselves a lot more if they make themselves actually think about the story."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is a classic for a reason.

This masterpiece novel works on so many levels, that I guess every reader would find something else in it. For me it deals with the basic and most important issues in life, society, government, wars, religion, education, brain-wash, the place of the individual, the hardship of being alone (physically and mentally), the concept of holding two contradictious thoughts at the same time, the position of the individual in history, the nothingness of being human, love, family, loyalty and betrayal, the instinct of any animal in nature to survive, and so much, much more. I read the book at least 5 times already, and find myself doing it every year or two.I'd also recommend everyone to watch the excellent movie adaption made in the year in question, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, which I think is one of the best book adaptions made for cinema. While it can't contain all the levels and issues presented in the original book, it adds images and voices and makes the reading of the book extremely realistic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"a wonderful novel, makes you feel more secure and also more independent in this world.one of my favorite novels. definitely in my top ten of books I have read, I never get sick of it.a must have for any library.-winston"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The protagonist Winston Smith works as a minor member of the ruling Party in London, under the leadership of ubiquitous Big Brother, who has never been seen except on telescreens and posters which are hanging everywhere.

In it we find bland descriptions choreographed with a rhythmic, powerful force of language and an internalized graphic depiction of a mind on the brink of rebellion.It is false to claim that this is a 'probable future', as many of the issues and threats of the time of the prophecy have come and gone and been resolved by the evolution of society. But the meaning is lasting, regardless of your meaning of oppression.There tends to come a time in life when everyone feels oppressed, trapped by the state of the world and angered over their perceived restrictions. In the case of this novel the specifics of the dictatorship are agonizingly detailed, the interest maintained by Orewell's natural story-telling abilities and spectacular wit. But the meaning is meant to go deeper, filtering away the extremist exaggeration of the satirist and searching for clues in the muck of human nature.These issues are timeless and therefore the threat of 1984 will never likely go away. There will always be either a real or perceived oppressor and there will always be a basic human instinct to rebell. Nowhere is this principle more lucidly articulated than in 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As an American, I enjoy freedoms that are alien to the majority of the world. If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read.

Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a &quot;political&quot; novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the &quot;deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man&quot;. In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"this book simply changed my view of things in life. it sucked me in after a few pages, and the reason i really like it is that he writes one of the most engaging plots, yet he still has relevant views. i love his ideas, and how he carries it all to the extreme. i am now reading &quot;Brave new world&quot; which, although has a different idea of the future is really similar. I first read I984 when i was 11, and since then have read it countless times.

It's not just literature, it's history."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Reading all the reviews has been fascinating! A great and deep book is somewhat like a Rorschach inkblot, allowing the reader to place their own personality and ideas atop it.1984 is part of the world's literary culture, something that is of value beyond the quality of the story and the writing. It's a satire, not a prophecy or prediction or a sci-fi novel. &quot;Satire has, as its prime purpose, not to comment or wound so much as to reform. It seeks to mock, or invert, or exaggerate with the intention, that by doing, idiocies may be corrected.&quot; (Stephen Murray-Smith) The fact that dictatorships, of a wide range of colors, are currently in something of a decline suggests that Orwell's efforts at reform are slowly working.There are many deep parts of the book. Orwell explores the psychological role of language and control of thought by language, something which seems to be an on-going experiment in the USA today. Despair, hopelessness, human frailty, human resilience, love, betrayal; Orwell deals with so many themes in this rich work.Yes, it is deeply disturbing, as good satire should be. Yes, we can see the parallels in our own societies and lives. That is as it should be. 1984 is not an action book, as action and excitement are anathema to control. Satire can be very hard and not very funny, and can take us time and a sense of history and society to grasp properly.It is good that the book is read in schools. You may not fully understand it at the time. Return to it over the years. It is a warning to our cultures and societies about possibilities, but you must understand something of societies and cultures to understand the book and its warnings fully. Let it be a guide to you, not a prescription."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"THIS BOOKS WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN 1956 SHOWS HOW THE AUTHOR IMAGINED THE WORLD IN 1984.

With Erich Fromm writing an afterword, which he cites many examples that displays different types of utopias/thought controlled societies, discussing the psychological aspects of a society that is shaped in such a way, reminiscing from his own book Escape From Freedom.

It lets the reader know how lucky he is. For a future in which you are watched at all times by the ubiquitous telescreens and are sent to authorities by your own children is one that was not so far off when Orwell wrote this masterpiece.The idea of Big Brother gives me the chills even today. The government's ability to utterly manipulate the public's mind is staggering because it shows how easily it can be done...Let's hope that this notion remains hypothetical--at least in America-- for centuries to come.For anyone who wants some insight into a dystopian future, there is no better place to go then Orwell's '1984.'"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am amazed how vibrant its message. Orwell's words have stood the test of time, making its tale even more powerful today. It will capture your imagination while challenging you to reflect more deeply on the state of our society.The book's afterword sums it up beautifully. Written in 1961, Erich Fromm concludes, \\"Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too\\"."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Going into reading this book I assumed that naturally, seeing as it is usually a mandatory school reading assignment, it would be boring. However, from the very start of the novel, Orwell captures your attention with the description of London as it is taken over by Big Brother. Throughout the book my intrigue never ceased as I constantly waited for the rebellious Winston to rise up against the Party and Big Brother. The further I read, the more and more I believed Winston was going to unite the proles and crush Big Brother. Seeing Winston's curiosity as he read through the changed records or remembered more and more about his past kept me believing an uprising was soon to happen. Once he met Julia I was sure that these two promiscuous characters would fight the Party. What was soon to happen to them however, I didn't believe, even after reading it. I was so sure my prediction was right that I assumed the author was just toying with my head. Orwell does an amazing job in making the story unpredictable and interesting. Even though the story can seem long and almost never-ending at times, it is worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I recently chose to read this book as an assignment for my english class.

FRIGTENING HOW HE PERDICTED TODAYS POLICTICAL TRAVESTIES."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The name of the book that I am reviewing is 1984 by George Orwell. I choose to give this book four stars.The reason that I give this book four stars is because it is an excellent written book that gives a scary future of what the people in the 1950's thought the world was coming to. It follows the main character Winston Smith who is a member of the party of Oceania in a oligarchial world of three superpowers: Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. Winston feels as if he is different because he doesn't believe that they are getting the best that they could be getting. He decides to join a secret organization that goes against the government. He learns in a book that is given to him how the government works and why makes the certain choices that it does. The book shows that in the future war will just be used as a way for a power to get rid of surplus goods. The book also states how the government works with the ministries of peace, love, plenty and truth.It also seemed very cool to me some of the ways the government would manipulate the people just so they could maintain control. In the book Winston begins an affair with another party member named Julia and they together plan against their oligarchial society. They rebel at the fact that the government changes history so that it may be able to control there country with ease. With nothing for them to judge there life against they are forced to go by what the government tells them and they each have. They are captured at there secret hideout by the thought police(a group of individuals that monitor for traces of thoughtcrime punishable by death). They are thrown into a jail cell to rot untill they are forced to confess for what they have done. The only reason that I would not give this book five stars is because most of the concepts in the book were very hard to follow.Other books that I would recommend would be Shogun by James Clavell, the Cherub series by Robert Muchamore or Animal Farm by George Orwell. I am a student at HRMS and am in seventh grade."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Have you ever watched a movie that ran your emotions through the ringer? And after you watched it you say it was one of the best movies you have seen even though it was such an arduous journey? That is what this book was for me.There is such a general feel of hopelessness in this book. The governement has such a tight grip on eveything that you know any betrayal, no matter how small, will be found out. The government in this is such a huge and pitiless machine, you know there can be no mercy and even when our \\"hero\\" begins his first small acts of rebellion you almost wish he wouldn't and save himself what you, the reader, know could happen.There are moments you dare to hope that the spark of individuality and freedom of thought might continue if only in secret, even though you, the reader, knows these hopes are probably futile. This, I think is the brilliance of the book. The environment is so well crafted it is like you are rebelling with him in your hopes, even though you know the price and how you will feel when things unavoidably come crashing down. Thus is the human spirit, however, and something I believe the author intended. The journey belongs to you as well as our hero.This book had me thinking a lot in my downtime, about how things could easily go the way of 1984 in our world with only a few more tweaks. It seems ludicrous but I am sure you could come to the same conclusion. I am a conservative fellow by nature and there are things this book says that I do not agree with, however I think we can all agree that the loss of basic freedoms and rights is a horrible thing and this book makes you see what you have and how easily it could all be taken.Try this book out if you are ready for something heavy and to do some thinking afterward. thanks."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Amazing. The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read. Again and again."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"One of the most embarassing secrets in my life has finally ceased to exist. Until last week i had never read 1984. But now i have...Most certainly a harrowing dystopia, by which i was deeply affected. Orwell is a visionary of a rare quality. The links to this present age are evident in nearly every page of the masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Imagine living in a dystopian society where your government monitors your speech and every thought, disguises its corruptive status by saying that it's working for a better tomorrow, and basically everything else to control ideas and brainwash the people into supporting its propaganda. Well, imagine no further, just read 1984 by George Orwell, which follows the life of Winston Smith through the post-war, dystopian society of Oceania as he reminisces his childhood before World War II while struggling to live under the rule of the Party. Winston faces a society where no one is unaffected by the ever-changing of the Party and everyone lives in constant fear that Big Brother is watching over them.Winston lives in the city of London, where he works for the Ministry of Truth as an editor for printed text, condensing words into the language of Newspeak. The constantly shrinking language of Newspeak was created to reduce the possibility of \\"thoughtcrime\\" (the act of thinking outside the Party's beliefs) among its citizens and to eliminate any vocabulary deemed unnecessary. For example, the prefix \\"double\\" can be added to the word \\"good\\" to form \\"doublegood,\\" which indicates that something is very good, and vice versa. This is one way that Orwell displays censorship in a communist society, eliminating as many radical ideas from society as possible.Orwell created characters like Winston who made you sympathize for him, from the way he describes his childhood to the way he shows his secret disdain for the Party. Along the way, Winston meets with Julia, a woman from the Fiction department who is the exact opposite of the Party-supporting person she claims to be. From the way Orwell crafts his characters, you can see that he wanted a character that would entirely rebel against the Party to meet Winston, a man who only secretly disdains the Party, to bring out his dark side and do things that he would never have done by himself. With Julia, he secretly rebels from the Party by engaging in everything the Party is against, all the while trying to conceal himself from Big Brother.As much as you'd like to think that Big Brother is nothing but a fantasy, 1984 was written about the communist countries after World War II like the USSR. Orwell makes this dystopic society parallel to communist society in that everyone is monitored, propaganda is displayed through all areas of media, and the government does its best to alter its ugly past and to sugarcoat current events to put the country in a more positive light. Some say that the novel is too dark; a possibility for this could be Orwell was suffering from tuberculosis during the time he wrote 1984, so his pain and suffering is paralleled in the dark descriptions of society. In the communist society and in Oceania, there are those that strongly support the government's propaganda, and there are those that disagree with the propaganda and long for the days before the government changed. North Korea almost accurately mirrors Oceania in that they're run by a communist government, the people live in poverty, and they live in constant fear of the police taking them away. The sad reality is, the fictional society of Oceania is very much alive in today's world.\\"It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: \`War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength.\\" The scenery and the way Orwell tells the story made me feel like I was actually living Winston's life. The darkness of the novel only adds to the real feel of it. It is a bit slow in the beginning where Orwell describes Oceania, but once you get to the middle, you won't want to put it down. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading science fiction, or even to anyone who is looking for a good read. The only downside to reading this novel is that you might start thinking that the thoughtpolice are watching you through the television and listening to everything you say through the walls."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This novel seems to be becoming more poignant as the years go by. What was once a frightening science fiction tale about a future gone wrong is now a prophetic vision of a reality we all know. One cannot dispute the fact that we are now surveilled in every aspect of our lives and we are only a hair's breadth away from authorities being able to peer into our very private spaces at will. The march of technology makes fiction into fact and it is our job to be ever vigilant against threats to out privacy. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The year 1984 has long since passed, but this novel remains a relevant vision of a world where the State controls every aspect of the person's life, and even thoughts can be crimes.When I was in high school, I tried to pick up this book and read it. I got all of a couple of pages into it before setting it down and never returning to it. Fast forward a little more than a decade, and I finally picked it up again. And you know what? This is an excellent story! I just needed to get in touch with my cynical side. A high school senior has too much optimism to appreciate Nineteen Eighty-Four.I used to think (back when I hadn't actually read the story) that this was a book about a society where the government was watching its citizens' every move. Well, there is that, but there is so much more to this book. I was impressed by the scope of the ideas touched on here. Most fascinating to me was the concept of thoughtcrime. The idea that a government would seek to control and judge the very thoughts of its citizens is horrific, and yet it is one of the more plausible concepts in the book! It's not enough to obey the government; you have to want what it wants, to give up your will to a shadowy, unknowable Authority.Then there is the concept of the State being able to watch you constantly. It's like the whole populace is living in the Panopticon. I loved the scene where the two main characters have to wait for a crowd to be able to meet each other. In a society where you are always being monitored, the only place to hide is a crowd.The spookiest facet of this imaginary, horror-story society, is that it is conceived as being perpetual. The \\"people\\" will never overthrow the government. It functions like a machine, both in its inner workings and its relationship with the other major world powers. It is designed to last forever, to never become the victim of revolution. And through advanced technology and psychological control, it is working.The last part of the book was a riveting, frightening scene. The agents of this terrible society do their best, not to force our protagonist to conform, but to instill in him the desire to conform. To make him love the forces that control him. It is genuinely scary, and painful to watch. The last couple scenes were just amazing.This book is more than just a Bible for folks complaining about the government intruding on personal privacy. \\"Big Brother is watching you!\\" It is a frightening picture of how a society would look where the government is taking captive the very minds of its people, and through technology and thought control achieving a kind of clockwork immortality. It is a dark vision, but one worth seeing.Highly recommended.Final Grade: A"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I've probably re-read this book more than any other book I love. It's one of my top five favorite books of all time. Even in high school when I was first forced to read it, I loved it. If you haven't read this book, even if it's not your particular genre of interest, please give it a try anyway! Those who haven't read 1984 yet would be shocked how many cultural references today stem from this book.

Now I'm 44 and I must say that the book took on a whole new meaning to me. Most people say this is one of the best of the worst books they'll ever read - and I'm one of them. What I find amazing is how Orwell, in 1948, had such vision to see our planet's future unfold. It's hard to know if science fiction begets truth, or if truth begets science fiction - either way what 1984 portrays is very relevant in today's society; even the introduction of Newspeak ... while we haven't gone to this extreme the truncation of today's language certainly lends itself to the whole idea of Newspeak!Don't read this book just before going to bed ... unless you want to experience some very unusual dreams."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To this day, no other novel has changed the way I look at society as George Orwell has done with \\"1984.\\" I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic, 1984, was a fantastic read. It illustrates a world in which people are merely shells of themselves and only live to please their government in it's hunger for power. The protagonist, Wilson, refuses to settle for that existence. He analyzes his surroundings and hates the all knowing, totalitarian government.Wilson struggles to live such a life. He must hide his thoughts and feelings from the Thought Police. As a reader you can sympathize with Wilson and his struggle. It is quite difficult to imagine living in such a controlled state where one ceases to be human to become another senseless drone. He is not allowed to show emotion. He is not allowed to love in this empire that runs on hate. To love is a crime in Oceana. On the other hand, members of the Party are forced to attend the daily Two Minutes hate that forces extreme nationalism into people's thoughts and corrupts them to hate an invisible enemy.These practices that Wilson is subject to make the reader thankful for our world and hopeful that such an existence will not be the future of the human race. The novel exaggerates human behavior in a way that almost makes it seem as though this could be possible. George Orwell tries to convey a message of peace and togetherness through this harsh example of what may come to be. He urges the reader to prevent our world from being ruled by hateful warmongers. The moral of the story is to be aware of yourself and hold on to your humanity. Being your own person and showing compassion for your fellow man are the most important things you can do. Wilson is a great protagonist in that he desparately tries to maintain his humanity even in the face of extreme oppression and opposition."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'm not even going to review the book.

The printing job on the book was decent for the most part, although I found a few places where the ink was smudged but still legible. This didn't bother me though, as it was only one or two pages in the whole book and it didn't mar my enjoyment of one of my favorite books of all time. Seriously, if you haven't read this book yet, just buy this book. $10 is worth this integral cultural experience. Even if you don't like it, you should still read it.

I wonder if I read the same book you did?As other reviewers have said: this book is a masterpiece. Orwell captures many details of life under a totalitarian regime. He backfills Winston's character with memories and dreams -- if I lived in that society, I'd spend a lot of time in my head, too. He proceeds from there to the economic and political system, presented both through Winston's job and his trips to the proletarian quarter and through The Book. And from there to philosophy. The man who tortures Winston explains why, down to the first cause."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is classic literature! George Orwell invented Big Brother in this book and it is scary to behold. He makes Big Brother all too real and all too feasible. I read this in high school and it impacted me even then. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are undoubtedly a lot of great books out there but there's a selective few that I would consider a must read, and 1984 is one of them. Is it really that good? My personal opinion is that there are better books out there in its genre, but none have had the impact 1984 has had. 1984 is a reminder of the things that we take for granted everyday, It's about one mans struggle to keep what he values most, his free thought.I've read this book once, looking to give it a second read. It's hard for me to pick it up again because the feeling you get from reading 1984 is not exactly a great one, it's depressing. Which is why I prefer reading Vonnegut.Regardless, 1984 is one of those books we should all read at least once."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I never had to read 1984 in school. It was always referred to by teachers, but references were never enough to make my realize what the book was exactly about. The idea in my mind had been that the book was about an ideal look at the future of the world (America?) in 1984 (the book being written in the 1940's).Well, the idea wasn't exactly wrong, but it wasn't nearly the happy and bright world of the future I was expecting (lamely I was thinking Jetson's... go figure).So with a Kindle in hand, I decided I'd take it upon myself to explore many of the classics I never had to read as a student in school or even those I dismissed in the way the typical student with a narrow view of the world might.To start at the end of it all, the book was good. It was much better than I expected. Of course the idealized view of the world presented isn't the ideal we all want. It's a utopian world that is to the extreme of being dystopian because the requirements to idealize everything requires a type of world control that isn't as far fetched as it may seem.I don't want to go into many details except to say that the book is disturbing yet enlightening. If you have any awareness of the world around you, especially the world of the early 21st century, you'll see that many of the ideals aren't so far-fetched with our current world governments. Many of the catch phrases such as Big-Brother come from this book, and it becomes very clear what these ideas refer to. Of course the world isn't nearly so extreme, and I do think Orwell was exaggerating a viewpoint of what the world can be like. But in presenting the concepts in this manner, Orwell was hopefully making us aware of the slippery slope we may (now do) find ourselves in with respect to the perfect society.How close we are to what Orwell presented will depend on the reader. I can see parallels with our US government of the last 10 years, but then again I realize that to be as close as suggested would be quite pessimistic. Regardless of how close we may be, any reader should keep and open mind and awareness of what they learn from this book. This isn't the happy world I expected, and ultimately I found it a bit of a depressing world to think of.Yet, in the end this one book makes me really understand the importance of this book as a classic. This book does has its entertainment value, but its influence on the way we think and the awareness that comes out of the book is one that can't be dismissed. It's not a difficult read, and the more people that read it and become aware of it, the better off we'll all be, and the less likely the society ruling this fictional world will ever become real if we are in fact headed that way. And if we aren't head that way, be entertained by it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think it would be safe to say that 1984 is a unique story. As far as stories go, it's hard to categorize. Generally speaking, 1984 fits into the fiction category, yet it rings eerily true. It could be called science fiction because of the prominent use of technology in the narrative (telescreens, rocket bombs, etc.), but this doesn't quite fit either. Is it a political treatise on the nature of dictatorships and their nature to suppress all free thought? Yes, that is true too, but even this doesn't quite get it I think.I suppose to get close to its heart, would be to say that it is a fictionalized political and philosophical commentary. While it is \\"dystopian and satirical\\" according to Wikipedia, and I would agree, it goes beyond this. Its focus is not on any particular dictatorship (although communist Russia comes to mind), but on political power in general. It could readily be used in a political science course. The lecture(s) could be called, \\"The philosophy of the dictator\\".1984 makes me think of Nietzsche's philosophy which included the so-called \\"will to power\\". The political genius \\"Big Brother\\" exercises his power over others to the ultimate extreme. His goal is not merely political suppression or suppression of free speech, but rather the conversion of the hearts of all so that they will love big brother for his own sake. Through reprogramming, Big Brother seeks unified thought and purpose.The story also reminded me of the movie The Matrix and the Borg from Star Trek. In each of these stories, the political elites (the matrix or the collective) use groupthink to accomplish their ends. Big Brother uses it as well. He required the control of language by issuing a \\"Newspeak Dictionary\\". To get everyone to think along the same lines was his ultimate goal. Those who could not adapt were eliminated because they were like viruses in the system. We see this issue in the film The Matrix. Smith says to Neo that the humans are like a virus that must be eliminated.Unlike the Matrix, where there is a hero, 1984 contains no hero. Winston is not even an anti-hero. He is a cog in the machine. It is almost a pointless story in that sense. The reader does not root for Winston, but only stands as an observer in dismay. It betrays the form of novel and the traditional story arc. There is no vanquishing of evil, no destruction of Big Brother. In this story the bad guy wins in the end. It is intended as a cautionary tale of what can happen to us if we are not careful. From a story point of view, I found 1984 unsatisfying. As far as its political analysis, I found it very profound. It was fascinating to read the ramifications of ultimate power.The commentary of O'Brien during Winston's interrogation, torture and imprisonment was right on the mark. The power structure of Big Brother far surpassed all previous dictatorships. Those in the past did not take it far enough. Big Brother had the courage to take power to the ultimate level. Big Brother intended to make himself a god to be worshipped. His thought would be the only thought. Groupthink would reign supreme.I would recommend reading 1984. While it will not bring a happy feeling to the reader by the overthrow of Big Brother, it is worth reading for its political and philosophical reflections on modern society. We would do well to heed Orwell's warnings regarding the potential loss of freedom. He warns us against the aggregation of too much power in government. Orwell has created a chilling tale that will make the reader reflect seriously on the proper role of citizens, of government and the importance of free speech."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I decided to read this book, I was a little apprehensive.

I highly recommended it together withAnimal Farm."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I began to read 1984, I had my hesitations. In the past I have found that books like this were never really my \\"thing\\". Animal Farm, Slaughter House Five, Fahrenheit 451, and other books of that sort I always found a bit too slow moving for the taste of the average high schooler.Opening up 1984 was a risk for me, if I don't like a book the first time around, I probably never will, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself sucked into George Orwell's cleverly crafted world of Winston Smith, Big Brother, the Party, and rebellion.Like every great science fiction novel, 1984 takes place in a world where everything is controlled by the government, in this case Big Brother and the party, and free thinking is the worst crime one could commit. We've all read a book or seen a movie about conspiracies with the government controlling every aspect of our lives, and this is definitely the most well done. Everything from the telescreens to the thought police was so believable it almost made me suspicious I was being watched!Not only did the writing make it seem realistic, but the writing was a bit more fast paced than some other \\"classics\\" and it kept me turning the pages. I understand that many classics seem so dull to us high schoolers merely because we don't have the patience for anything we have to think about. I think that 1984 is definitely a better read for high schoolers because it keeps moving and stays interesting but still manages to make you think a bit about the world we live in and it's future.I definitely recommend this book for anyone, even those reluctant teens that don't usually favor books that are published before they were born."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read Animal Farm back in high school, but had not been exposed to Orwells other works, quite good.See these others by Orwell:Animal FarmComing Up For AirBurmese Days"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It's amazing how close this book reflects the Governments of the World today.

Orwell's style here is compassionate in its matter-of-factness and poetic in its rigidity, which could not be more fitting for the classic tale of Big Brother, Newspeak, and the Thought Police.A surprise for me was not only how brutal Orwell can be, but also the level of humor present in this text - dark humor, to be sure, but comedy nonetheless. This, again, is very befitting of the famous context in which the narrative is set. In oppressive times, laughter is one of the best defenses we have, and it can sometimes be surprising what seems humorous when we take a step back from the situation.As mentioned, the presentation here is beautiful. This \\"centennial edition\\" by Plume (a division of Penguin Books) is a facsimile of 1984 as it was published in it first edition. The \\"aged\\" look fools the reader into thinking they are handling an old and dear text. The paper quality of both the cover and the pages is excellent as well. Also included is an excellent new introduction by Thomas Pynchon.All in all, a very rewarding literary experience. I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is a haunting look into a post Nuclear War world where all world governments have evolved into all-seeing, all knowing, ruthless police states constantly at war. It is a very worthwhile read for all of us now in the post-industrial/nuclear era. Whether humanity is capable of degrading to and sustaining such a system is hard to know, but as Walter Cronkite explains in the forward, this book is a warning about what we may be capable of allowing if we are not vigilant in defense of our liberties and human, not mechanized, way of life. Written from the first person perspective, the reader bonds with Winston Smith, a likable and familiar fellow to any reader. We experience the terror and fear omnipresent in his society and join him as he begins to question the Party. The \\"Telescreen,\\" the infamous device in every party member's home that both broadcasts the party line and watches the residents is a pessimistic preview of what our broadbanded, HD media devices could become."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I found Nineteen Eighty-Four to be genius in the respect that it is absolutely consistent, and original in some cases, in detailing the State's efforts in gaining total obedience from its victims. Most importantly, Orwell acknowledges the means of gaining unquestioned obedience: annihilating man's reason and independent thought, which in turn erodes his will to live by his own efforts. Despite some minor inconsistencies in the plot, Orwell's theme about man's struggle to live in a totalitarian state is an intense, emotional experience.Cleverly labeled concepts such Newspeak, Doublethink, Thoughtcrime, Sexcrime, etc, are an interrelated, systematic means of destroying man's ability to reason and observe existence objectively. Objectivity is the means of identifying and differentiating percepts from reality, which are then condensed into concepts. Without objectivity, concepts cannot be formed; without concepts, language is not possible. Big Brother recognizes this fact and works backwards by manipulating language to shape concept formation. The resulting oversimplification of concepts and ideas eventually leads people to question their observation and knowledge. How will one discern the real truth? By relying on an outside authority: the State.The obliteration of the mind is compounded day by day by the harsh, desolate environments and the endless repetition of propaganda. Dependence, anxiety, and helplessness soon replace independence, confidence, and strength. Students of philosophy will no doubt see the State's stance on gaining knowlegde, ethics and politics similar to that of Plato, St. Augustine, the Medieval Church, Calvin, Luther, Hegel, Marx, etc.Finally, Orwell states the real reason for gaining man's obedience: power for the sake of power. Orwell is consistent: Big Brother does not pay lip-service to man's supposed base and evil nature. No, the state wants obedience because it can take it. This is the politics of, as Ayn Rand once stated, \\"might makes right.\\"Of minor point, there are some minor inconsistencies in the plot. One must ask the question: how can citizens/automatons, who are constantly conditioned to be totally intellectually and perceptually dependent on the State, run a quasi-technological industry by their own independent reason and actions? Despite this, the overall point of an omniscient and omnipotent State is understood.Nineteen Eight-four is an excellent book if one wants to observe the effects of the loss of independence and freedom on individuals. One noteworthy point: Orwell, an avowed socialist, indirectly attempts to distinguish socialism from communism or fascism. Throughout this work he demonstrates the essential need for objectivity and reason in man's life. Despite this, there is no objective reason to believe that man is his brother's keeper and that he must surrender the fruits of his labor under threat of government compulsion. History demonstrates socialism (government control of personal property) as the transitional period from some governmental controls to total control. Observe as evidence the fall of Rome to the Dark Ages, Czarist Russia to Soviet Russia, and Weimar Germany to Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I greatly enjoyed this audio book, partly because the narrator's vocal gifts brought alive the various characters and thier accents. I also enjoyed revisitng a book that I had read long ago, in the earlry years of my life. I now was able to see more clearly the fears inspired by the Communist party in post-war Eastern Europe and China, and how those events inspired Orwell's writing of this book and the reactions of his audience."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 came and went un eventfully, but if you read this now you might see some parallels to modern day things. It is 2006 they were told they would always be at war sound familiar. Rumsfield told us that too. Read the book and see what Orwell predicted would happen and what is happening. Then watch the movie made near 1984. See what you think. You might want to read brave new world after that by Aldous Huxley. It is interesting that these authors were so far ahead of the times."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Richard Brown's voice is perfect for 1984 - a novel about a distopia. I listened to this while driving to work in my car. This is a very deep, thoughtful novel to begin with. It is made so real by a good actor. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a story that, unfortunately, seems to be slowly coming true. Many science fiction titles are escapist literature that either imagine a very different world(s) from our own, or at the very least, hold out some hopeful message - in other words, the good guys usually manage to win. This is neither kind of book. And it is science fiction because the sinister use of technology is what allows Big Brother to invade everyone's privacy and dictate what the characters can do or say, with severe, nightmarish punishment for \\"disobedience.\\" There have other novels that have seized upon this idea of an anti-utopia, but Orwell was one of the first to place it in a realistic future, and in a chilling this-is-all-too-possible way.And the parallels with our modern world are especially profound, parallels that are obvious all around us. The growing number of surveillance cameras on street corners, the ironic (but deliberately) named Patriot Act, the rise of political and religious intolerance in the world...all of it does not bode well for the future of our basic liberties. Orwell got in right back in 1948, and although he was primarily referring to the \\"red menace\\" of his era, the tactics used by suppressive governments are tempting for any government because of the control such tactics provide, liberties be damned. Your agenda- whatever it is- can more easily be achieved if you can identify your enemies early on and thwart their every move. The problem is, when your enemies are law-abiding citizens whose political (or religious) views don't match your own- and that's the only \\"crime\\"- you've stepped over the boundary of national security and entered the realm of repression. And to stop open criticism of these tactics, these governments (including the repressive one in 1984) invariable claim that the critics are \\"unpatriotic,\\" \\"traitors,\\" maybe even \\"terrorists.\\" Sound familiar? Repressive governments have been using these tactics for centuries; only now, modern technology makes it a whole lot easier- and yes, unfortunately, a lot more tempting.Of course we don't want real terrorists. The problem is, a \\"quick fix\\" of sweeping powers put into the hands of a relatively few like-minded individuals- with checks and balances muted if not totally brushed aside- can, will, and has lead to abuse of those powers, primarily for political and personal gains. That was the real message of 1984, and it's one we should never forget. And if the citizens of a repressive government either don't recognize the danger- or worse yet, vigorously defend it under some mistaken notion of being \\"patriotic\\" themselves, surrendering their own liberties in the process- that just makes it all the easier for the incumbents to remain in power, with little chance for genuine reform or change.It's all there in this great book, 1984, which deserves to be widely read forever and amen.-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nineteen Eighty-four is a classic and timeless book; It has as much effect today that it possessed in 1949. I would strongly argue that this book is a classic novel and deserves every bit of praise that it has and will receive. It doesn't feel like there is any type of language barrier between Orwell, his message, and today's reader. He often uses long sentences with very descriptive words to allow the reader to be able to see/feel/smell every place and problem that the main character, Winston Smith, encounters and deals with.I expected this novel to be painful to read and understand, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Orwell had done an exceptionally good job of writing the novel, and thus made reading the book utterly painless. One of my favorite descriptive paragraphs in is when Winston enters the canteen where everyone eats lunch. Here is an excerpt form it:\\"In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.\\"Slowly I began to see the chapters fly by, amazed by the originality that the setting included. This was meant to be a bit of a pseudo-Sci Fi novel, in that it is set in the future. But unlike many other Sci Fi novels, however 1984 does not focus on how the technology works. Rather Orwell focuses on why it works and why the government made it, or replaced something else with this new approved technology.I was fascinated by how believable the setting was and how myself, as the reader, didn't come across any of those usual Sci Fi moments where something is just to out there for the reader to grasp, or relate to at all. This is a book about humans and the human condition, not about sparkily flying cars or teleporters. In fact, many things about the futuristic setting of 1984 make you glad that you are in the present time and not in this hellish future of thoughtcrime and Ingsoc(which means English socialism in newspeak, a new form of shorter English). From horrible tasting \\"victory\\" coffee, gin, and cigarettes, to the constant fear of being prosecuted with thoughtcrime. The reader is constantly drawn into Smith's nightmare. Even just having unusual facial patterns in public or in front of one of the countless telescreens could lead to not only your own death but you being erased from history. Indeed, the world of 1984 is Orwell's own interpretation of a world with socialism as its only form of government, and how he thought socialism would naturally evolve.The sense of paranoia and the disturbing way one could look at this new age as a possible future for the human race is immense, where everyone is as politically correct as can be. Children turn in their parents to be killed by the government for thoughtcrime, and people watch extremely gory movies and laugh their heads off when the children and their mother get pumped full of lead from a helicopter. Wars that may or may not really be going on, constant missiles going off around the towns, blowing up hundreds of people everyday, leaving the others left alive without a sense of fear because they know that Big Brother, the father figure of the party, will save them from their enemies, all these features add to the unusual background of the story. Winston himself works at the Ministry of truth, and basically writes some of Big Brothers speeches, creates imaginary hero's of war to raise the morale of the people, rectifying history books and novels to better fit the parties beliefs, and the creation of propaganda. I found it interesting and ironic that Orwell would make the main character, who despises the party inwardly, work for the very ministry that keeps the lie a reality.I could safely recommend this book to anyone who likes English literature, or likes to think and ponder of an idea or thought. Because I found the whole premise of the book incredibly enjoyable and thought-provoking. It all seems so believable, like Orwell saw all the gaps in the theory of his novel and his invented culture, and made sure to cover them all. It takes you to another world politically, but isn't fanciful about it; in fact, when I think of this new London and Oceania, I think of a very gritty, dirty and rusty nation.I really loved part I of the book as it is more about introducing you to Oceania and the Party's rules/beliefs rather then the progression of Winston as a character and his situation. \\"War is peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength\\" is the slogan for the party, and it is repeated many times throughout the novel. I think that it was a great yet practical way for Orwell to sum up the attitude of the party and the setting of the novel in just nine words. 1984 truly is a classic of English literature. It will, and has, stood the test of time. It feels like this book has hardly aged a day, because of the detailed yet simple writing method that Orwell uses. As long as the English language remains the same, one could read this book and understand what Orwell is portraying in 1984. Because it relates to basic human fears of always being watched and the fear of speaking out and being your own person, someone who thinks for himself. The novel has a universal character to it. Anyone could relate to it; not necessarily paranoia, but just that feeling like you cant quite speak your mind fully for one reason or another."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If not one of the more entertaining novels, this book is certainly one of the most important reads of the century. As others have probably already stated, this book is not so much a warning as it is a clear testament of what is already happening today. It is meant to destroy your impression of society and the world, forcing you to see it as it is; not as it is represented in the news, in film and other mind deluding media.I cannot put it any simpler than that.The story is about a man who lives in a futuristic world that is governed by the will of the nameless, faceless government, which is only referred to as, \\"Big Brother.\\" Big Brother controls not only the actions of the people, but human thought is also enforced. Everyone is watched. The most disturbing aspect to this story is not the fact that human rights and individual freedoms have been stripped away, but the fact that everyone agrees to these terms. That leaves no room for change; no will to fight. It is a story about a government that was allowed too much control over the people, where the future is hopelessly secured and preserved by totalitarian rule.It sounds impossible, I know. But it is not impossible. There are countries and governments who have achieved such power over the wills and minds of the people and, like in this story, do not believe they are being oppressed, simply because they do not know freedom or individuality, having never experienced it, or worse, forgotten what it was like.The People's Republic of China just happens to be one such government, which has managed to not only limit outside information from entering the country, but controls what people see and hear within the country's walls. Chinese search engines are monitored and websites that speak of government crimes are shut down. Local news in China is also heavily monitored and journalists who step beyond their stations and center their articles on truth are threatened with their lives. If you were to tell a citizen of China that a whole village was massacred for protesting the construction of a power plant intoxicating a nearby river essential for the village's survival, then that citizen would most likely call you a liar. All Chinese citizens see on their television sets are repeats and repeats of heroism in the fight against the Japanese occupation, which only strengthens the loyalty the people of China have towards their government, forever binding them to that *one image, while the Communist Party strategically conceals the bloodbaths and assaults on their own people.Despite the fact that this book was written long ago, it has more standing purpose today than it ever did in the past. I use China as an example because I know something of that country and its people, but such human restriction is practiced in all countries, some more than others. I remember when the war in Iraq began, there were millions of people somehow believing that Iraq had something to do with 9/11, encouraging everyone, even senate members of the Democratic Party, to support Bush's decision, and they did.The minds and the wills of people can be bent, shaped and directed by your government, while keeping you completely blind to the fact, and this book here is probably the best example of how it is done and how far it can go...if it is not stopped."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is more of a timeless book than \\"Animal Farm\\" in that while Communism itself has come and gone, the superstate described in this novel, has not.There may be no Ministry of Truth in our time, but who can't see the parallels between the politically correct newspeak and doublethink described in the book and that created by the 'politically correct' wordsmiths of our era?All, in all, a well written book with \\"eye opening\\" coverart in the Signet edition with forward by Erich Fromm."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Even though it may be two decades past its proposed occurence, \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is just as relevant and unsettling as ever. Orwell crafted an original novel of a negative utopia where humans live under the almost complete power of a government which monitors the actions of all. Yet there is more to the story than the fate of what happens to its two main characters, Winston and Julia.Winston Smith is discontented; he finds himself more and more having radical thoughts that go against the government, and finds himself taking actions that could get him arrested if these actions were known. But Winston doesn't care - he knows that there must be more to his life than the lies the government passes off as truth, the very lies that he helps them to rewrite in his job at the Ministry of Truth. When his path crosses with that of Julia, the two embark on an 'illegal' love affair and further rebellion against Big Brother. Their effort is doomed to fail and the reader watches the deterioration of Winston's resolve, and of his memory.While the story of \\"1984\\" is engaging and well-written, the characters vivid and actualized, there is more to the story than such a simple summary. It is a dark treatise on the effects of power when held in the hands of a few, or even also just the corruption that the drive and desire for power can have. In a world that is constantly changing and making advancements in technology, the world that Orwell envisioned is all too ghostly familiar. It would be rather easy to imagine a world where people accept what they are told through the television and other media, without giving it a second thought (or even a first thought) of their very own. It is all too easy to imagine the world described in \\"1984\\" even two decades later, for Orwell's nightmare vision has no expiration date."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences. However, as the plot thickens Orwell extends the sentences conveying Winton's hope and rebellion.1984 is truly captivating and rather depressing. As I read I saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but I couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I had been meaning to read 1984 for a couple of years, considering its reputation and its oft-discussed relevance to our own society, and finally picked it up a few weeks ago. While I did enjoy it, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed by it, and at no time did I ever view Orwell's work to be as earth-shattering in its foreshadowing and cross-generational timeliness as it is universally made out to be. Personally, the conclusion that this book was some sort of uncanny prediction or foresight into late-20th into 21st century American society - Big Brother as the American government, telescreens as television/biased news media, Thought Police as intrusive legislation and access, etc. - I think, is quite a stretch.As far as the book itself, it takes place in a gloomy, depressing world without freedom, where people are reduced to initials and serial numbers. I actually found the \\"chapters\\" of the book of the Brotherhood, with its description and reasoning of the perennial warfare, the prohibition of sex and pleasure, and the hierarchy of society to be the most interesting part of the book. The discussions between O'Brien and Winston later on, as well as Winston's affair with Julia, also revealed much of how Orwell viewed the governments of his time and their philosophies, human nature, and human emotion in general. From these sections alone, there is plenty of material and opposing viewpoints on the government and its role in society, people's place in society, and the role of emotion and memory that Orwell leaves for the reader to tangle with. Orwell certainly succeeded in portraying some of the political forces of his time and twisting them into a well-written, gloomy depiction of a terrible future.However, the fact of the matter is the ideas in this book can be successfully applied not only to governments far and wide, but just about any situation where one group is in power over another. 21st century America is one of tens of thousands - maybe into the millions - of scenarios that can be twisted and bent one way or the other in an effort to fit the roles put forth in 1984 and say with conviction that we're headed toward a world like Oceania. Basically, any situation where there is a body overseeing subjects, where this body has the means to monitor these subjects, as well as the means to control/discipline these subjects, qualifies as a situation that can be successfully compared to Oceania, 1984. Does that mean that every entry-level employee in a large company (it meets this criteria) is a real live Winston Smith? No.All in all, it's a dark and depressing world that Orwell writes about, but it's not nearly as frightening in a real-life way as some people want to make it out to be."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 just proves Orwell to be a wonderful writer.

His book was extremely persuasive and should be read by all that have not yet read it. It is a classic, yet it holds all the contemporary aspects of a newer book. No part of this novel was unsatisfying for me. There were no parts of the novel that did not keep me waiting for what would happen next. This could quite possibly be my favorite book that I have read yet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I really enjoyed 1984 by George Orwell. I thought Orwell really captured what a dictatorship can do to a country. Big Brother was obviously a \\"parody\\" of some infamous dictators of the world (Stalin, Hitler). It was also very interesting to see how Winston acted. He was not a pure outsider, who is only trying to help his fellow countrymen. He is actually a true rebel. His actions, his dreams, his thoughts of sex and his readings of books are all signs of the rebellious actions of an outsider of the government. But, in contrast to Orwell's great portrayal of the rebellious Winston, is his lack of depth when it comes to Julia. She seems to be only into the rebellious act of sex, and that is about it for her. She is otherwise pretty subservient to men. And, I loved the ending simply because tragedy, or just an unhappy ending, is always an interesting way to end a story. I thought the way Orwell had Winston captured, tortured, and then having him turn into a supporter of Big Brother, all through the double cross from O'Brien made it a brilliant way to end the book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was the most mind-boggling book I read. George Orwell'simagination captivated the mind throughout the novel. One constantlyforgot that Orwell was a man of the 1940s writing his view of what the world would be like in 1984. It was amazing to read Orwell's perception of the future in such vivid detail. This is the story of an entirely new world. Just as people thought that the world would become utter chaos in our far future, the year 2000, George Orwell believed that in his far future, 1984, there would only be three superstates in existence: Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania and the world would live under complete government control. ...The totalitarian government present in Orwell's novel is in many ways similar to those which have existed throughout history in Russia, China, Germany, etc. It is fascinating to think how Orwell was impacted by the events going on around him. This novel was the means by which George Orwell warned the nations of the possibility of complete loss of individualities and freedoms. 1984 screams to be read by all. It is a disturbing leap into the reality that these circumstances could come to be, but it is also a novel of great imagination and creativity and tells a story that one could never forget."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I have the chance to read it,I was really shocked because what the book said was the history in red China.All the things are familar to any Chinese people over 30 years old.I am surprised because there was no difference between reality and the imagine of author."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"to be perfectly honest, after i'd completed '1984', i feared for us all. partly because i am a perpetual worrier, partly because this book so easily depicts what can, and already has begun to, happen to us as a race. 1984 intricately details a world shot to hell by mass propaganda, scapegoating, blatant lies and brainwashing. the story is told in third person, through the jaded and frustrated eyes of one winston smith, just another poor soul gone wrong. we see what the world has become: a machine, cold, colorless, dangerous. the government, known only as the Party, literally rules each and every aspect of life, down to the thoughts in one's head. the storyline sounds somewhat complex, but in actuality it's easy, almost too easy, to understand and relate to. the saddest, perhaps, part of this book was the fleeting love affair winston becomes involved with, and its eventual, and inevitable, demise. towards the end of the story my heart sort of dropped, because it does not necessarily end in triumph. i cannot give a good enough description of this book, it's hit too unbelievably close to home. i bought it not too sure of what the premise was(which i do often because i am a fool), but once i'd opened the book, i could see i held a real gem."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is the most influential anti-Utopian novel of the twentieth century. It shows the destruction of power that government can inflict on a society. It is a novel that gives insight into modern society and embodies the nightmare of a totalitarian society.

This book makes the reader question the power of government and wonder where our society is heading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Conspirisy therories aside, Orwell's prolific masterpiece '1984' tells of the struggle to remain human when faced with insurmountable odds. Orwell's unique vison, formed in the desperation of post-war Europe in 1947, descibes a future in which a totalitarism government controls all. The main character, Winston, is not set up to be a likeable, hopeful, hero-type protagonist, but rather, is created in the image of all men. He loses hope, attempts to fight the system with small rebellion of his own, and fails miserably, as anyone would under the circumstances. His affair with a woman is the subject of censure in many reviews of this book, but again, it was not set up to portray a loving, human relationship, but to serve as irony in it's most bitter form. When love, honor, compassion, and other words of that calibure are erased from the human vocabulary, you have 1984. And Orwell's vision may serve as the correct one. People today lose their humanity with alarming swiftness, and we are faced with the simple choice Winston must make: fight or flee. Fight Big Brother and the government, or flee the mind and become another faceless drone like other characters in the story. While depressing, this novel also raises some interesting questions. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned the fate of the human race. In short, everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Someone gave me a used copy of this book when I was very young, and it sat on my bookshelf for many years before I read it.

It is also the story of one man's fight to maintain his freedom in the face of totalitarianism. Through this book, George Orwell depicts, in horrifying detail, a world that is becoming increasingly similar to our own.The book follows a man named Winston Smith, a resident of Oceania, which is a huge country under the power of Ingsoc (English Socialism), commonly known as \\"the Party.\\" In Oceania, the Party has the ability to monitor everyone at every time, so that not even one's own thoughts are private.Winston seems to be the only person alive who (secretly) hates the Party and longs for its demise. He alone believes in truth, in external reality; everyone else is content to let the Party dictate reality. And dictate it does: in order to keep its hold on Oceania's citizens secure, history has to be rewritten, the past continually altered, in order to prove the Party infallible and to erase the memory of the days before Ingsoc took over. Thus, one day Oceania is at war with Eurasia; Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia. In the next moment, Oceania is at war with Eastasia, and suddenly Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Whatever the Party calls truth, becomes truth. If the Party says that two and two are five, it becomes fact. What's disturbing about this is the fact that the people of Oceania not only agree with the Party when it alters reality; they believe the party. Through a process called \\"doublethink,\\" they are able to consciously change or erase their memories, then forget having erased them, then forget the act of forgetting.1984 exposes the danger of giving up our individuality, the ability to think for ourselves, the abandonment of the belief in truth. The only way the situation presented in the book ever could have happened is if the people of Oceania let it happen. They let themselves be controlled to the point that they no longer realized they were controlled, nor that they had at one time been free. Once they did that, they reached a point of no return. Possibly the most frightening thing about 1984 is that there appears to be no way to escape the Party, no way to overthrow it, no way to be free when \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\" That is the message of 1984, and that is why the book is so horrific: once people surrendered their minds, they lost them forever. There is no revolution, no awakening, no hope of revival.Through his book, Orwell warns us, the readers, that if we do not fight for the right to think, the right to \\"say that two plus two make four,\\" we will eventually become the people of Oceania.The world of 1984 is a horrifying, hopeless, utterly dark world, one which we must fight against at all costs. For this reason, I think everybody should read this book. It forces us to see the logical conclusion of the postmodern attitude that \\"truth is relative.\\" That is perhaps the most dangerous belief in our world today, a point 1984 demonstrates all too clearly. If truth falls, so does our world, our ability to be free human beings. \\"Two plus two make four,\\" wrote Winston in the book. \\"If that is granted all else follows.\\" The reverse is also true. If two and two could just as easily make four or three, if truth is left up to the individual to decide, if there is no solid, external foundation on which we can lay the structure of our morals, beliefs, and our society, then it is only a matter of time before we will fall into the hands of Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is an amazing cautionary tale of what happens when the government runs amok and squelches the very people it is supposed to represent. As with any symbolic tale, readers will allow The Party- and its figurehead, Big Brother- to embody whatever agency or institution they deem oppressive, although it should not be lost that the political philosophy of 1984, or \\"INGSOC,\\" is a paraphrase of \\"English Socialism.\\" Orwell, like Ayn Rand, foresaw the bleakness of a socialism approaching its purest form, and recognized how society becomes much blander and grayer with regulation and equal rationing for everyone.For everyone, that is, except for those in charge, such as the antagonist O'Brien and the Brotherhood. The Inner Party members purposely created a caste system under the auspices of caring for those who are less fortunate or intelligent, while in reality systematically ensuring that the rich and powerful stayed that way, without threat of the lower classes revolting. The Inner Party learned from history that those in power rarely stay that way, and eventually get knocked off their pedestal by the leaner, hungrier classes below them. By creating artificial scenarios of constant war, Thought Police, and imprisoning work conditions that held no promise of improving societal conditions, the Outer Party members and \\"Proles\\" (from proleteriat) would always remain too tired and intimidated to rail against their surroundings. The primary aim of modern warfare, for instance, was to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.Politics aside, 1984 is a compelling action story, and I was surprised at the many racy, sexy, violent, and terrifying scenes therein, all of which kept me spellbound. Though the future predictions of Big Brother had not materialized by 1984, or (arguably) even now, this story's plot or action sequences are not one bit dated. Protagonist Winston Smith, and eventually his love interest Julia, is involved in a true rage against the machine that immediately engages the reader and summons both interest and sympathy. Surprises abound, and I had no idea until the story's end as to whether Smith would conquer the system, or end up being convinced that 2 +2 = 5.There are far too many fascinating aspects of this book to list. For one, the concept of memory eradication, and whether or not something really did happen if there is no proof to be found of its occurrence. Oceania, homeland to Winston Smith, was alternately at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia, and as soon as the enemy changed, any proof of having battled the other was immediately banished. In fact, Winston worked in the Ministry of Truth, where he and his coworkers spent their days erasing (e.g., burning papers or rewriting newspaper columns for the archives) any proof of events whose existence contravened the present philosophy- this way, (a rewritten) history would show that Big Brother never got his facts or predictions wrong.The book's language is amazing- clearly Orwell envisioned not only an entire dictionary's worth of new words, but a revolutionary new approach to speech as a device to control the thoughts of the speaker. The elimination of words which hold secondary meanings, and/or which convey independent thought, engenders a world in which people are incapable of- or not aware of the possibility of- treasonous thoughts (\\"thoughtcrimes\\"), let alone acts. \\"Doublethink\\" is the act of consciously denying reality, and making oneself believe wholeheartedly Big Brother's fictions."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"i write this is response to the reviews stating such things as &quot;down with communism&quot; and &quot;freedom demands inequality, orwell understood this&quot;. orwell was,himself, a social democrat. 1984, while being a brilliant novel and political commentry, is not really a critique of communism in it's pure form, nor of socialism and equality. it is a tirade against totalitarianism, orthodoxy and overpowerful government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Well, I was forced to read 1984 for my english class in high school, and welp, it bored the hell out of me.

Not the way the world would or might become, but the way it really was. It exagerrates in the extreme, of course, making _1984_ a kind of bleak satire.It's a shame this is Orwell's most famous book, though, because in many ways it's his worst, with _Animal Farm_ being about as bad. _1984_ is one of the more overrated books of the century. I've read some of his other books (_Down and Out in Paris and London_, _Burmese Days_, _Homage to Catalonia_, etc.), along with many of his essays, and they were all superior to _1984_. Perhaps because _1984_ requires less intelligence to see its point...Having read his less extreme fiction and non-fiction, I have come to respect Orwell deeply as a man who was honest, straightforward, very sensible, and altogether admirable. In many ways he was a remarkable man; but none of those praiseworthy qualities shows through in _1984_, where we only see dark cynicism about not only communism but also bourgeios democracy.If you're looking for balanced, intelligent writing from Orwell, stay away from _1984_ for a while."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"orwell does good job with the setting, characterization, and images throughout the novel, but fails to elaborate on the plot.

It warns about how life can be when a totalitarian power is exerted over people. Orwell wrote this book when totalitarism was identified with comunism, fascism and national-socialism. But today we know that an apparently democratic government can use mass media, TV, doublethinking and ignorance to gain and increase its power. 1984 is not a prophecy but a warning about the evilness of power and its consequences over individuals and society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; is a classic piece of 20th century literature, no doubt. While I can see many things of which he speaks of in today's society (doublespeak, Big Brother, etc.), this book was not written as prophecy, as some might suggest. It should serve as a warning, nothing more.Instead, I'll say that I read it as required reading in a high-school literature class and found Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; to be a less heavy-handed approach to storytelling.

I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was so lost when I first started reading this book. Orwell uses all these made-up words to describe ordinary things, and I couldn't remember them half the time. The very beginning was weird, and I didn't really understand what was happening. If we hadn't talked about it in my english class, I would still probably have no clue what it was about. There's a lot of symbolism that's really easy to miss, so it'd probably be better to not attack this one on your own. Wait until your class reads it, or your book club, or even just a few friends. Just don't try to figure everything out by yourself. If you do understand the book when you're done, you'll see that it was actually pretty interesting, and neat that Orwell, when he wrote it in 1948, actually had such advanced thoughts. Some parts are a little violent, and I don't really think there would be a point for anyone who's not in high school or older to read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was truly ausome book. I read Orwell's Animal Farm in middle school and thoroughly enjoyed that book. I had also started reading 1984 in middle school, but never got into the story. I started reading 1984 a few weeks ago and after getting past the first 20 pages was immersed in the story. 1984, written in the 1940's is about a future gone awry with no freedom of anything, and the political party in power having overwhelming control over all its citizens. The party is divided into 4 main factions the ministry of love, plenty, truth, and peace. It is interesting that they don't call it the ministry of the economy but the ministry of plenty. They are also speaking a new language called Newspeak which tries to simplify all words into their most basic meanings. This is to prevent the formation of new ideas and independent thinking. The thing that I liked most about the book was the believability of the world, it seemed plausible that the future of 1984 could have existed instead of the one we have today. Overall I would rate this book a 9.5 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest. If you are looking to read a truly insightful book into the diabolical possibility of party systems this is a great book to read. If you have some time on your hands this is also a great book to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell was a dedicated communist, but not in the Stalinist sense. Here he takes not just Stalinism to task, but also all societies that manipulate their citizens. If you don't think that western capitalism does not observe and manipulate you, think again. It is doing exactly that, but not using the technologies that Orwell conjured up in the 1940's. Read Vance Packard 'The people shapers' for an analysis of the scientific use of market research for getting into our heads and manipulating and exploting our basic needs and desires. Why else do politicians all mostly run the same lines and have their spin doctors in control of their pronouncements."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A disquieting novel, lucid and magnificent about totalitarianism. Winston Smith, an employee of the Minister of Truth, rebels against the dehumanized and mechanized world of 1984. He, a free thinker, hates the Party and Big Brother, as does Julia. She contacts him and they start a clandestine affair, in a world where passion is forbidden and sex is viewed with repulsion. O'Brien, another character, tells them that there is a secret society named &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;, which fights against the Party. You will be chilled to know what happens next.More than a novel, this book is a clear and horrible warning about totalitarianism and man's overwhelming lust for power, as well as about the misleading uses of technology. A terrifying view of what a society without history, memory, pleasure, love and family may become. It is not pure fiction: in 1984, the Soviet empire was beginning to be deconstructed, but for many years the story portrayed by Orwell had been basically real. There is no guarantee that it won't happen again. New technologies can be a blessing, a tool for the spread of freedom and information (e.g. we can exchange opinions in sites like this one), but they can also be terrible threats to privacy. There is no need to become paranoid after reading this book, but we would do well to be conscious of what might happen in the future (partly, because it has happened in the past). More relevant than ever, this book should be read and talked about. It can only be comforting to know that it is selling very well these days. So read it and think about it: you'll find traces of Orwell's society in the country you live in, no matter which one."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's book, &quot;1984&quot; has been banned. It's actuallyone of the top 100 banned books of all time. Interesting, a book whose principal villian is Big Brother, a figment who controls society through an organization called the Thought Police, would be banned by none other than: government organizations here in the Land of the Free, Home of the Brave. Or is it, &quot;Land of the Chained, Home of the Coward,&quot; I never can tell.Anyway, before I praise the book, I must tell you which organization led the way in banning Orwell's classic: The John Birch Society...An organization of people so far right-wing that they make George W. Bush look like Joseph Stalin. And what side of the political spectrum is supposed to hold the belief in less government and individual autonomy? Oops.So, the real value in this book is this: Orwell is telling us to fight against organizations with these &quot;divine&quot; attributes: omnipotence, omniscience, and omni-benevolence. In English: all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good. Why is Orwell saying, &quot;fight these things?&quot; Well, what were the government's ministeries called in this book? They were the Ministry of Love, whose business was hate (that's all-loving); the Ministry of Truth, whose business was lies (that's all-knowing), the Ministry of Peace, whose business was war (that's all powerful) I believe there was another one, but it is not important.The point here is the message from the book. Orwell wrote this book not only as a warning against totalitarian government, but also against totalitarian religion. He was a socialist and an atheist. When the government says it knows what's best because it's the government and the government is all-knowing, then we've got problems. When the Fundamentalist says that he knows what's best for you because he knows God's word, which is written by God, and God is all-knowing, so if anyone knows what's best it's God, and the Fundamentalist knows what God wants, etc. You can follow the circular reasoning.This book has no other value other than to warn. As an update, Orwell's nightmare may occur some day, hopefully never. But look at these hopefully coincidental highlights: UN troops are called &quot;peacekeepers;&quot; there are three major powers in the world: The US, the EC, and China; fundamentalism is seeing a resurgence world-wide, while liberal religions that allow room for people with another faith, or no faith, are dying; the US government is spending trillions of dollars on a &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; this war can never be won and is being used as an excuse to destroy basic freedoms (police can now almost act with impunity as long as the alleged crime is somehow related to drugs).I could go on, but I have written enough, and the parallels are obvious already.

Freedom of speech, thought, and everything and anything else that we hold dear was snatched away from the world. The Inner Party controls all and creates the stories of the past, present, and future. 2+2=5, and telescreens watch you at all times. This is what has happened on earth in George Orwell's hit, 1984. Although Orwell may not have predicted the future as it is now, it is still an exceptional book. Winston Smith's life is in constant jeopardy from the thought police and telescreens. The first mistake Winston makes is buying a journal. Then he writes in it, and the rest of the &quot;crimes&quot; come naturally. Eventually, the thought police catch him, and try to make him &quot;sane.&quot; My favorite passage is when Winston and his counselor are talking in the &quot;Ministry of Love,&quot; which is where thought criminals are taken when they are caught. His counselor says,&quot; Winston, you know, my mind is just like yours, but you're insane.&quot; They continue their talk. The story's atmosphere, as you could have guessed is overwhelming. The descriptive voice used so realistically however, moves you through Winston's mind, and where ever he goes. At times the book can be extremely slow, yet the last chapter picks up the pace, and excitement level. Bear with the book. As I just mentioned, the first two chapters of the book are not the most thrilling, but they have to be there, or the final chapter would not make sense. Mostly the book was enjoyable, and I kept saying to myself, &quot; Oh, this is what the world would be like if the Democratic Party ruled.&quot; It was exceedingly disturbing. I have to admit, the book was not my favorite, and would probably not even qualify to be on my list as on of my top five favorites. However, the description of the book filled me with emotion.

I started reading it and noticed there was something subtly different about it. It turns out that my version has been altered. Words that originally had an English (British) spelling in the original, have now been Americanized. Just on the first page, coloured has been changed to colored; moustache to mustache and metre to meter.Now, to some people this may seem like a small thing. To me though, this is aggravating...possibly disturbing. Did the American publishers think that Americans aren't smart enough to read it with the English spelling of some words? The odd thing is that while they altered the British spelling, they left in words that are typically British like: flat (apartment) and lift (elevator)...and again these are just on the first page.To me this is akin to a British film that gets distributed in the US, then the US film distributor decides that they need to overdub a British actor's voice with an American's because they're worried your average Americans wouldn't understand the film.I have found out that there is a Penguin version offered that is the original un-dumbed down version.

If the major premise of his book is that communism is dangerous, then why read this book since our experience contradictorily indicates communism was only a danger to the Soviets! If you don't see that 1984 is about America/England, i.e. Oceania! and our socalled western capitalistic democracy of untold Nirvanas then you've taken the ultimate soma holiday. A patriot criticizes his own government and in a democracy the people are vigilant over THEIR government first and foremost. Orwell was writing about home, England, that's why the action is centered in London, Airstrip One where industrialism and capitalism first took flight.

Privacy is a major concern now when in the 1980s it was hardly given any mention or great concern. 1984 is about a government worker (Winston) who enjoys his job but starts to have suspicions about what is really going on in the world. The government severely restricts individual freedom, religion, choice of partner (procreation is not particularly encouraged), choice at all, movement and occupation. Winston starts to slip up and slip into the dark side. He knows he will get caught but cannot help himself. Yet Winston dreams the proletariats will rise up to defeat Big Brother. Is there some force in us which cannot be defeated? It is a powerful work that everyone can relate to. George Orwell has been blatantly copied by scores of book and film writers for over 50 years.

What they are missing is that the main point of this book isn't to provide violence and action, of which it has it's fair share, but instead to entice us to think about the human mind, our existance, the way we govern ourselves, the power struggle, and most of all our limitations as human beings. When one really examines this book and ponders its philosphies, to me, makes it exciting and interesting. This is my second favorite book after &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; by Burgess, which I also highly recommend. No piece of literature is for everyone but I do suggest &quot;1984&quot; as a book that will appeal to the masses and help people change their attitude and feelings towards the world in hopes that they might change this planet and prevent any such scenario provided in this book from actually happening."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As a sophomore in highschool, I read this book as a requirement as outside reading. I couldn't put it down! The concepts it talked about kept me thinking for hours, and I still think about them now! Since then, I have read the book two more times, and still find new topics to discuss about government, privacy, and social orders. If you like literature, history, and society, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I would recommend this book to a reader who is looking for a highly intelligent story. 1984 invisions a future where superpower governments oppress the masses, killing off individual thought. Constantly watched by cameras, people living in these superpowers are essentialy slaves. The story is gripping and well written. 1984 is very similar to Brave New World, these two &quot;utopias&quot; are both trying to eradicate individuality. Brave New World tries to smother the individual with material pleasures, whereas 1984 uses oppression and false truths to achieve these ends. The books focus on characters who rebel against these governments. Their struggle for individuality ends in disaster, but their struggles provide an interesting insight into the human soul."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this novel in 1983 as part of a British lit class in high school. I have never recovered from the hammer blows it delivered-- it is devastatingly thought provoking and eerily haunting. I have re-read this novel many times over the years, and still stand in awe of its power. I am thankful that this novel was required reading in my high school!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Being an avid reader and lover of great literature, 1984 was an advious choice for a good read. Orwell's gripping realism captivated me in the first chapater and held my attention untill the last three words. Not only did I find the plot captivating, but Orwell's voice spoke straight to me.The strong political theme doesn't override the call to every one for a better world. Any one who reads this book and take from it the message Orwell sends, would understand why it is a classic. A fan of classic literature or high thrill novels will enjoy this page turner."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Of the two great Dystopian novels, (Brave New World being the other)this one is my favorite. It is a story of a man dealing with his own thoughts about freedom versus oppression, and also an analysis of how Communism has gone bad (dictatorships) and where it could potentially take us. But how different is Oceania from our own society? Think of all the surveillance cameras you see and the idea of hate crime (which invades the thoughts of people, to find what they were thinking). 1984 is prophetic about China and the Soviet Union yet, it also tells something about America and our &quot;freedom&quot;, showing us that no government is going to give you true freedom. The beginning and end of the book are the best parts, the middle is a little weaker, due to the development of a love story (I am still iffy on whether or not the love story part of this book actually harms the book at all). Anyway, it is a great book for anyone and it is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The novel is written beautifully, and it makes a bold statement about humanity... The government has developed its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. Each superstate has an identical government, one that is at perpetual war in order to gain complete power over its citizens. The process used to gain absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, such as Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. The nation manipulates its citizens into convenient modes of thinking. However, instead of only using propaganda techniques, they also use Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and has its sole purpose in abolishing all independent thought. This is done by drastic reduction of vocabulary, by getting rid of unnecessary words and synonyms. (Example: the word bad is replaced by the word 'ungood.') The telescreens monitor each citizen at all times, watching for any action, word, or possible thought that could be unorthodox. These two Orwell inventions were foretelling, we see the equivalent of Newspeak every day in present society when we are &quot;politically correct.&quot; Telescreens are present in nearly every business, and sometimes in our own homes. Orwell was obviously warning America and all other countries about the control of totalitarian governments. The reader is introduced to the metaphysical philosophy behind 1984. A government not unlike present ones is at the head of Oceania, and that is where the reality of 1984 becomes evident. The sole manipulative technique used by Big Brother is one that is virtually unrecognizable, mental manipulation. Metaphysics, or the belief that there is existence beyond our comprehension, is represented by Big Brother when the reader learns about doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Doublethink and metaphysics are the engines behind the three world governments, and is defined by O'Brien. &quot;Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,&quot; says O'Brien. &quot; In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot; The book reminds us of what has gone wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when government becomes all-powerful. It is because of this political and social insight that 1984 is one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I live in the UK, a place where the world depicted in 1984 are slowly turning from fiction to fact. Newspeak is being introduced by the government. And in the aftermath of a recent inquiry, children are being encouraged to grass on their parents for untoward language. 1984 was not just a novel but a prophecy of a totalitarian society facist or communist, we don't know exactly what, but both are as bad as each other, this book is a warning of extremism turning into barbarity an an assault on the basic liberties of man, that is freedom of thought, speech and activity, if any of those are compromised, even in the pursuit of a &quot;better&quot; society, then there has been a breach of liberty. As Vladimir Putin said last week, &quot;It is your right and a duty to dream&quot;."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Mark Twain said a classic is a book that everyone talks about and no one reads. I hope that cannot be said about 1984. I was assigned this book back in high school, and with apologies to Mr. Johnson, I read the Cliffs Notes instead. But since I am unable to discard a book, especially a classic, I have spent the ensuing years having it stare me back in the face. While the totalitarian warnings are well known and the 1984 terminology is widely used, I just couldn't believe how gripping the whole thing is. The main character, Winston Smith is no abstraction. He's easy to identify with. Suddenly totalitarianism isn't some far off gulag or death camp, but the horrors of a man alone.The thoughts and details are slowly revealed in a way that you can really root for Winston. As he learns more about a world he scarcely remembers as ever being different, you hope that he is about to change everything. What does happen is a pretty good secret considering how much has already been written about this book. I've read other Orwell books since High School, but I'll admit that I was scared of 1984's classic nature. I shouldn't have been. Orwell was always easy to understand. His insistence on using straightforward language to convey complex issues makes the book easy to follow. Now, I regret that I will never have the pleasure of reading it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984, there isn't anything too exciting about that title. Why would you buy a book called 1984? I'll tell you why. Because 1984 is a very unique and interesting book. It has a very different idea of how the author (George Orwell) thought the year 1984 was going to be like. Though we know how 1984 really was, it is still very interesting. This book follows a man named Winston and the horrible conditions he and the world are living in. Could the world turn into something this horrible? Telescreens everywhere, watching everything you do? Thought Police out to get you? It sure makes you wonder. It's almost... scary."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is hard to believe that Orwell wrote this book so many years ago and 1984 has already come and passed over 18 years ago. This book brought up the idea of government control of how people live and think. It is relevant as much today as it was back then. This book is a must for anyone studying political science or socialogy. Remember, Big Brother is always watching you!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\", by George Orwell, is a dark complicated warning to humanity to change its present course or suffer the consequences. Although potentially very enjoyable, this original \\"Big Brother\\" book presents an interesting enigma for the student and teacher. In high school, the science fiction genre can be difficult to \\"sell\\". This book lives in the realm of soft science fiction (as opposed to the hard gadget oriented world of Mr. Asimov), and deals with fairly complicated philosophical and political issues. These complications come with their own confusing terminology. Orwell, with his already expansive vocabulary, even creates a new language, \\"Newspeak\\", to help explain a new set of socialistic societal and philosophical concepts. The fictional nation of Oceania (England) is one under an extreme socialistic, power hungry, and mind-bending government. Once the basic concepts of the government and society are understood the book becomes an interesting struggle of one man against \\"Big Brother\\". Although entertaining enough to earn five stars, the complexity causes some parts of the book to go very slowly and the lack of happy ending is disappointing if not disturbing. If you liked this book, I recommend &quot;Brave New World&quot;, by Aldous Huxley, as a companion read. Unless you have a prodigy on your hands, due to the reading level and complexity of the book, I wouldn't recommend it to someone under 15 or a freshman in high school."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orewll's 1984 is truly captivating however extremely disturbing. It's a story about a cold heartless society and the eradication of, by our standards, the normal human.With it's first [edition] in 1949 it's written as an extremely pessimistic view of the future. The novel examines a socialist empire and the way they can control mankind, the future, and the past.The book revolves around a middle aged, middle class, although extremely intelligent man. Winston Smith works as part of the government changing the past. He is constantly watched and allowed no emotions other than hate and fear. The party controls every aspect of life.Winston can vaguely remember his childhood before Big Brother and the Party began controlling everything. He still maintains early 20th century morals and ideals of what life should be about. The book covers his rebellion against the party.1984 is well written for the most part, however there are some parts that you have to fight to get through. For example at one point Winston obtains an anti party book, Orwell then goes into long chapters that are excerpts from this \\"book.\\" These are long dry passages, that contain information that has already been reveled to the reader through indirect methods.Overall I think that this book is a good book to read. It will improve your appreciation of life today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What simpleton compares &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;Brave New World?&quot;New World is a simple morality tale about a world forced into conspicuous consumption. Yawn. 1984 is the frightening tale of a future gone awry, and a brutal government well aware of its intention to maintain power at all cost.We follow Winston, an editor with an odd job, rewriting history. Wiston is forced to &quot;double think&quot; his way through a life he knows is contrived to forever remain stagnant.As Winston ponders the present, the war weary remains of Oceania's capital, London, he is forced to deal with memories of a very different past - and he fails to reconcile the two.Orwell's eye is a magic thing. A reporter at heart, his eye for detail in fiction and reportage is awesome. While reading 1984, one feels Orwell IS Winston, in his head and in his world. With any imagination it becomes easy to allow 1984 to become real, and Winston's desperation your own.Orwell side steps silly sci-fi detail (that dopey Huxley embraces too readily. What is it with all the helicopters in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; anyway?)and creates a desperate world that, though written 50 years ago, seems perfectly plausible now.This chilling masterpiece is a must read for anyone who ponders the delicate balance of power and politics. More so, this dark tome considers the loss of individuality in an increasing global society. At first blush, it is easy to dismiss 1984 as completely off the mark, but after some consideration, one is forced to concede that maybe nothing here is really improbably.A must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Sad, beautiful, nauseating, incredible, believable.

I've also been on a Utopia kick, reading books such as 'Brave New World,' 'Island,' and, of course, '1984'. In my opinion, it is a good story, but I am not very alarmed about Orwell's ominous predictions of the future. I mean...yes, the massive possibilities given us via the internet do seem to mirror those of the telescreen that always knows what Winston is doing, but I cannot forsee the decline of the human spirit. The book in itself begins interestingly enough, but by the middle, I was more interested in finding the switch to the reading light so I could drift off to sleep. There are about 20 pages that are very slow reading, but I was captivated by the last part (part 3). However, the ending left me with a very sour taste in my mouth, mainly because it is not the conclusion I would have picked; but that's kind of my point...I still have (&lt;---if I could use italics...ooo) my opinion, and Orwell has his.

The main character Winston tells of his life living and rebelling in himself of this authoritarian government. The country of Oceania is trapped in a never ending state of war though in reality no battles are ever fought. The book deals with Winston trying to learn about a past realizing the past he has learned from the party never really existed. Winston himself has helped the party change the past. The party looks for unique ways to steal away freedoms by using things such as doublethink (the act of forgetting a past reality once it immediately changes) which lead them to get their population to believe in things such as 2+2=4. Winston also seeks an escape from the party forming a secret love affair with a girl named Julia. Together they try to escape the party. They are able to show how difficult or impossible escape really is. This book may have been an alternate reality with the year 1984 having passed many years ago, but the danger warns about reflect some elements of today's society.

A lawless party rules over with a cult of personality consisting of an elusive, all-knowing (due to the Thought Police and ever-present devices called telescreens) figure known as Big Brother--or as some fondly address as, BB. This novel shocks with its possibilities. George Orwell demonstrates a theoretical but very plausible type of society that can occur when authority gains excessive control and its people prefer \`blissful' ignorance as seen through Winston's characterization and the conformity in the people around him.Winston Smith is a lowly ranked party member himself; however, Orwell writes the novel from a perspective where his private identity is shown. He begins off with starting his own diary. From the beginning, the reader is taken aback--literacy seems to be dangerous and Newspeak, which is far cries from the articulate language today, dominates. Reading and schooling seems to be not as prioritized in this society and even if present, is altered and maintained by party interests. I enjoyed this novel because it demonstrated the common idea that humans without proper education, fall victim to ignorant or blind obedience to authoritative figures. Even in early scenes in the novel, Orwell describes Winston as falling in step to the animal-like behavior of the people around him as they all hysterically scream over an infamous party traitor.I highly recommend this novel because of its nature as a classic; although it takes some time to truly be able to dive into (I struggled to stay completely interested after the first two chapters) it sends a sharp, vital message that all individuals should be familiar with."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Just to add my voice to the rest here.

The characters are powerful and the plot is disturbingly reflective of some of the challenges we face today.

Peering into a possible future reminding us that the road to dystopia is long and paved with good intentions. Orwell is a literary genius. If I could convince someone to read only one book it would be this one. The themes expressed compel you to reflect on our own world and contemplate our own future.

The beginning of this book was honestly a bit unbearable, I had gotten the picture and message of the main points (conditions, environment, authority figures, main character development) within the first 40 pages or so and everything after was just rehash after rehash...But then, roughly half way through the book, it had gotten so interesting, so good, and so insightful, that if it had taken me three weeks to read the first half, it took me all of two days to finish the second half.The authors account of war and his \\"counter view\\" of the world he himself set up was flat out awesome. He cleverly delivered a thorough analysis of war and society through the guise of educating the lead character, and subsequently further demonstrated his points by breaking the main character.

Also, as several other reviewers have mentioned, some of the ideas present in 1984 could be pulled out of today's headlines. Not only governments, but corporations also now have the ability to track activities, both on and offline, of virtually everyone who lives in the industrialized world. Websites like pipl.com and Spokeo show how easy it is to observe people's activities through social networks and public records. Marrying this technology to a desire to socially engineer the population could result in the type of dystopia that Orwell depicts in this prescient classic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A communistic dictatorship rules over the people living in the country of Oceania. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, people love Big Brother, the head of Oceania. What I have just described to you is what 1984's world looks like. 1984, is the book that explains what would happen to the world if democracy fell and communistic-dictatorship took over. This book was written by a man by the name of George Orwell, who was born in 1903. Soon after writing this book he succumbed to tuberculosis. Once finishing the typescript he sent it to his two friends, Secker and Warburg, who officially published it on the date of June 8th 1949. George Orwell sadly died only a few months after his book hit the shelves in January 1949.Within the pages of 1984 there is the \`Party' which mysteriously and ruthlessly rules over the people who live in the country of Oceania. The peasants are called the \`Proles'. The \`Proles' are essentially everyone who is not in the party, these are the common man and the people who live in much poverty while the Party is able to live with considerable of luxuries. This book gives the reader a feeling of desolation, sometimes while reading it I thought I was Winston the main character who was trying to take down the party, and who was sick of being told what to and what not to do. That is one of the books major strengths because the reader will feel as if it is him being prosecuted. Also the book makes you hate the party. This feeling makes the reader become even more sucked into the book, making him feel like the party is the worst thing possible. The only real weakness I could find with this book was that, sometimes, the book has a tendency to give a little excess information to the reader. These are often unnecessary facts that have no place in the book such as when it describes in a lot of detail how the tree is where Winston and his friend Julia meet; however this does not happen very often.The main goal of this book is to give the reader an idea of what life would be like if democracy ever fell in the modern world. This book accomplishes this goal with an amazing job. Everything is how the reader would think it would be, the citizens are being watched at every moment, there are \`thought-police', the majority of people are poor, is a are the minority of rich people. Also this book goes into so much detail, it makes me feel as if I were there...in 1984. The detail helps the reader become even more captivated in the dark secrets unlocked within the party and the severity of the crimes Winston commits against the party.When reading this book the reader will experience a connection with the book and its characters, the reader will become Winston. The reader will become a Prole. The reader will become Big Brother, the reader will love big brother. The reader will go through many changes while reading this book, and may experience many hardships. Which path they choose is up to them, whether to love big brother, or hate him. That decision is up to the reader, good luck.

It should be regarded not only as great literature, but also as an oracle of the very real storm clouds that are consistently looming just overhead. But perhaps most importantly, it should also serve as a much needed kick in the groin to anyone who is constantly blinded by the bright lights of patriotism, war, greed, fear, and all forms of propaganda.1984 is not science fiction. 1984 isn't fiction at all."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This classic story of Orwell's imagined future in 1984 written during the 1950s is a stark warning against totalitarian systems of government. In the story the government is headed by a shadowy figure titled Big Brother. This popular reference to \\"the man\\" or other monitoring organization originates in this story. The basic concept is that the ruling party monitors all aspects of a person's life through telescreens, microphones, and an elaborate spy system, among others. They create their own history and destroy all accounts which differ from their account of history.They also invent a language called Newspeak which could be a reference to using politically correct language. Newspeak is structured to comply solely with the political philosophies of the Party and is intended to make thought which occurs contrary to this philosophy impossible. If someone tries to make claims to the contrary or engage in discussions that oppose the party it is considered \\"crimethink\\" and the person is taken away to be \\"fixed.\\"If current events or philosophies change, a complex system of forgery and reworking is in place to rewrite history so that Big Brother always makes accurate predictions, the economy is always better than it was in the past and things appear to be great on paper. In reality, people barely subsist, disease and crime is common, and life in general is much worse compared to life prior to the Revolution which occurred in the 1950s-60s in conjunction with wide spreadnuclear war. Old copies of books and newspapers are burned to eliminate any hardcopy of actual history.There is no reality but that which the Party and Big Brother espouse. If you think outside or remember something different from the stated reality, you are considered delusional and in a minority of one. Those who persist in the belief that Big Brother is wrong, are arrested and systematically tortured and brainwashed to the point where they begin accepting the Big Brother philosophy and reality as truth.The main character works for the Party but has doubts as to the positive benefits of the Party and its philosophy. He feels repressed and seeks out ways to fight against this overwhelming power. The first part of the book walks through his growing realization of the continuous brainwashing and creation of reality which can change at the drop of a hat.The 2nd part adds very little to the overall plot and really could be skipped without much loss in value. It additionally contains a gratuitous amount of promiscuous behavior which serves little purpose other than an appeal to the prurient interest.The last part of the book describes in detail the arrest, torture, and brainwashing of the protagonist. He has many logical arguments and perspectives which would likely occur to the reader fighting against the philosophy of Big Brother. This helps to make believable his eventual conversion to belief that Big Brother is good and right regardless of the reader's perspective grounded in the reality of today's thought.1984 is quite thought provoking and serves as a good reminder that any political party or dictator with absolute power is dangerous and measures should be taken to avoid movement towards this type of system."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Ever wonder what it would be like to fear for your life after having bad thoughts about the war in Iraq or perhaps even the president himself?

Winston lives in the country of Oceania, one of the three major superstates in the world.Orwell secretly hates the communist government though it is very hard for him to do so because there are Telescreens in every room that see everything. To add to the effect there are posters hung everywhere with a face that say \\"Big Brother is watching.\\" Propaganda is constantly shouted through the Telescreens and everyone but Winston believes it for fact. The past is constantly changed and is made to appear that life had always been the same if not worse than it currently is. Winston hopes that the government can be overthrown and he hopes for the success of a secret organization targeted by government propaganda simply known as the brotherhood. He meets a woman who loves him and in secrecy they defy the laws of the government. He also suspects a man from the inner party is in on the plot to overthrow the government.This is a very good book no matter how long after 1984 it actually is now. It provides a very real picture of how the government can control huge populations in poverty. This book gives a view of how life would be if communism were to take hold on very large portions of the world while ridding itself of certain fatal flaws that have caused past governments to collapse. Some of the things in this book are very hard to imagine because they are impossible. Doublethink, for example, is a concept in the book where someone says one thing and believes it, and then believes something else that is contradictory to the first thing, which is hard to understand because it isn't possible for people to actually do so to the degree done in the book, but that is one of the few things that are impossible in the book"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I just finished- literally- reading the book 1984 by George Orwell and my very first thought as I gazed over the last four sentences upon my nook version of the book was anger. Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it. Recommended"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I tend to like books with more action than the way this book was written. I also feel like I had a hard time grasping the full meaning intended by the author. Having said that, take my impression and opinion with a grain of salt.This book was more of an expression of feeling, than a good story. The idea of the government watching everybody all the time is fascinating to me albeit ridiculous. He seemed to express hoplessness toward mans future, and extreme cynicism about the reasons for war. He was clearly a socialist. I wonder what George Orwell would have said about the way England, or Israel deal with terrorists in 2010?OK I'm off my soapbox now... I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in conspiracies, just for the fact that it is a classic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book is a little bit more yellow and worn than I would like. This was not metion."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell was a genius at forseeing future trends. He was also ingeneious at crafting the protrait of totalitarian control while using material from the media and political journals as his paint medium. His ability to take \\"spin\\" to its final conclusion with the term \\"Newspeak\\" is truly prophetic. The book is a warning cry for western civilization as it progresses to larger systems of government, and away from individual responsibility.On a somewhat negative side, are the main character, Winston's, interactions with and perceptions of some females in his society. While musing on the obviously \\"politically-correct\\" feminist female of the day, the author, through Winston, steps away from most readers by expressing contempt through Winston's desire to \\"ravage the woman and strangle her at the moment of climax.\\" There are other graphic and sometimes repulsive descriptions of sexual escapades of the main character."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I found the O'Brien character in 1984 to be unrealistic. The idea of someone intelligent enough to run a sophisticated surveillance state acting against economic progress and enjoying ruling over people in the most brutal and barbaric way is not realistic. Compare this to Koestler's Darkness at Noon, in my opinion a far superior novel, where the state is run by violent but stupid brutes who would not be intelligent enough to run a sort of 1984 dystopia.However, this is still a great novel in that it accurately predicted the inevitable surveillance of everyone's lives that has been a reality, and is increasingly becoming more and more prevalent, with the surface justification being anti-terrorism. Winston, an isolated individual, can do nothing against the powerful bureaucracy and his attempt to oppose the state just leads to him being crushed. The imagery is the strongest part of the novel, with, for example the \\"10 minutes of hatred\\" and the \\"Ministry of Truth\\" propagated lies. It has become a part of our language, and both sides on the political spectrum lionize Orwell to demonstrate that the other side is immoral even while engaging in Orwellian language themselves in the same breath.However, Orwell, a miserable pessimist, like so many science fiction writers could see no solutions, and so 1984 has become a symbol of a future that must be opposed. He did not think of any possible solutions but only illustrated a future in which individuals were crushed by an omnipotent bureaucracy which only enjoyed crushing people.Orwell makes the bureaucracy one-dimensional, and as Dr. Dolan from the online newspaper the Exile points out, his choice of the name \\"O'Brien\\" demonstrates his particular form of British racism. Authors do not pick names randomly and Orwell was implying something without actually wanting to provide any details, because 1984 is on the whole a rant, but a very good rant that conjures up powerful imagery. If Orwell had created a more realistic portrayal of the future, even a more realistic dystopia, it may not have been as powerful in its effect on the reader.Since someone inevitably will make use of surveillance technology, either through the government, or if the government's powers were severely repressed, as libertarians believe is necessary to ensure progress and freedom, then through powerful corporations who bend the law and use their profits to surveil and manipulate the populace, and evade government attempts to stop them. Inevitably the power of surveillance will lie in someone's hands; it's just a matter of who. Thus the vast majority of individuals who simply view surveillance with superstitious hostility have not really thought about the issue much, and may simply have a desire to believe their lives are being controlled in the same way that many people, from environmentalists to religious zealots, pray for the end of the world.When this surveillance state uses its powers for its own selfish reasons and for the sheer thrill of power or when its tactics are unnecessarily brutal and disruptive, it must be opposed with every means necessary. However, if it allows legitimate free debate but only acts to disrupt organizations and movements that are nihilistically destructive, and people who seek to impose a 1984 dystopia upon us, then it may be a source of good. However, it is proper that our natural reaction is to be skeptical, and blunders the CIA and FBI continuously make demonstrate that we cannot blindly accept that they are a progressive force.The fact that they allow their blunders to be revealed illustrates the unnecessary barbarity of some of their methods. The check on their power indeed comes from whistleblowers like Mike Levine, author of the bestselling expose of the CIA's involvement in the drug war (their interests were not in stopping people from using drugs) who point out their failures to discerning and curious individuals. If they go too far their will be a reaction against them and their power will be reduced, and individual agents purged.Thus it is important that those who wield the powers of surveillance realize that the most important reason why they possess these powers is to prevent less scrupulous individuals from using these powers to malign and destroy decent individuals. In 1984, the reporting of events was changed to represent the interest of Big Brother. Readers naturally and correctly find this concept scary, and the CIA and FBI have, at times, used such tactics themselves to uneccessarily destroy the lives of dissenting individuals when the tactics of debate should have been used rather than brute suppression if the whistleblower really did not have a full understanding of the larger and correct motivations behind their tactics.If, like Lenin, they see the cautious use of force as a weakness rather than a symbol of superiority, then it does not matter what political party, ideology, or interests they serve; they have gone too far and must be routed out and attacked, not just by intellectuals like Chomsky made inconsequential by his incessant and one-sided rants, but by intelligent and brave individuals, whether liberal, conservative, or apolitical. Certainly there are times when force or using coercive tactics may be necessary, but the less such tactics are used the better. Non-interference, laying back and letting events take their course until just the right moment rather than sticking their finger in every pie, is the best option.Perhaps the key element is how they deal with exceptional individuals - scientists, literary figures, charismatic but intelligent politicians. If they only attempt to manipulate these individuals for their own end, controlling their every action, they may greatly reduce the good the individual could have produced.It is right that we, non-members of the Surveillance Party, skeptically try to deduce the influence spooks have on our lives and political events. It is also natural that the spooks try to keep their actions secret; that's who they are. When they use barbaric and destructive tactics it should be pointed out at every opportunity."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell published a book entitled 1984. The novel made a huge impact and made a statement about humanity. He wrote the book in 1949, envisioning the future of man. He believed that there would be dictatorship by the government by 1984.The novel's main character is Winston Smith. He doubts the system or the government, in which is Big Brother that's controls Oceania, one of the three super states. Winston is older than most citizens of the super state. He slightly remembers life before Big Brother. Big Brother would prefer people not to know the past. Though his memories are indistinct, he thinks that life must have been better before Big Brother's leadership. As Winston's rebellion progresses, he meets Julia, who is also against Big Brother. Winston and Julia become lovers and confess their rebelliousness to O'Brien, who is believed to be a member of a rebel group called Brotherhood. Then comes the story's climax. The reader will be introduced to what's behind 1984. George Orwell brings suspense in the story when he shows us what is really behind Big Brother. Big Brother uses mental manipulation to influence its citizens. This book reminds us of political tragedies, how the government can control everything. George Orwell reminds us of what went wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when the government becomes all-powerful. I believe that this book opened my mind to politics. 1984 is one of the best books written. Orwell writes about reality and bases its contents to the real world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK. If you haven't read it, you are totally missing out. Enough said."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell was brilliant, disturbing, excellently written, depressing and most of all eerily predicting of the future. I enjoyed reading it very much. Orwell's writing is phenomenal. The way he describes things is incredible and beautiful. I admired his bold statement against socialism. His book was extremely persuasive and should be read by all that have not yet read it. It is a classic, yet it holds all the contemporary aspects of a newer book. No part of this novel was unsatisfying for me. There were no parts of the novel that did not keep me waiting for what would happen next. This could quite possibly be my favorite book that I have read yet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Take a deep futuristic look into the mind of author George Orwell in his intense novel, 1984. Orwell's ideas of what our world will be like in his future, is a pessimistic outlook on his new world. The \\"Big Brother\\" controls all, and the civilians of Oceania are powerless. People lack many of the simple freedoms that we are associated with today, and the government runs everything. Oceania is one of the three main super states that are battling for power. The city has a system of monitoring that will keep all residents from rebelling or from even thinking about it. The plot includes all the things that many great books do, including: love, lust, crime, and deception. This great novel shows how the creative mind of Orwell can bring us to the world he thought was to become in the year, 1984As the story begins we meet our main character Winston Smith walking through the corridors of a large building. We quickly learn of the many new things to his world including the \\"Big Brother.\\" Seeing sings posted and messages spread across the walls, Winston can not escape the watchful eye of the \\"Big Brother.\\" Telescreens are everywhere and he is unable to escape their watchful eye. Winston eventually buys a journal and writes in it. From the first stroke of his pen, he is overwhelmed with the fear that he is going to be caught and go to jail. As he writes the words, \\"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\" he knows that even if he had only thought it, it would be just as much of a crime. In fact, the thought crimes were known as the worst.Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, here he alters historical records to fit the needs of the party. He meets a beautiful woman at work, with dark hair, Julia. He is worried that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thought crimes; however she turns out to be an admirer and is in love with him. They are in the same thought the party, and become lovers. They begin a covert affair to see if anyone is monitoring them, and eventually move into the second floor of the store where he purchased the journal. They continue on together for a long time, and Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished, while Julia is much more optimistic.Winston becomes fixated with a party member named O'Brien, who Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood (a mysterious group trying to overthrow the party.) Finally one day, Winston's dream comes true, and he is called on by O'Brien. This is what the couple thinks is the beginnings of something great. At O'Brien's luxurious apartment, he reveals that he is also against the party and all that it stands for. Then he asks for Winston to join the Brotherhood and help to stop the party and hands him the manifesto of the Brotherhood to read to Julia. Then something goes wrong, and our characters are caught up in a tricky web of lies and deception.The way the Orwell is able to set up the characters makes you read faster and deeper into the story. He is able to draw you in using a very simple technique of being instinctively vague. My mind would race as I read the pages of this spell binding novel, and I know how Orwell was able to turn such an ordinary event like the birth of a new year, into what would seem like a hellish nightmare. The \\"Big Brother\\" makes you think how a totalitarian government would be run. What if the world had turned into this place, what if there were people watching us and recording our every move thought, it makes me glad that I am a citizen here in the free country of the United States of America."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the second time I've been forced to read this book for aclass, and I have to ask, &quot;What's the point?&quot; Maybe if you live in a country that's a monarchy, this book's worth reading, but this is *America*, ok? The whole reason we live in a democracy is so that we the people don't have to worry about things like this. &quot;Brave New World&quot; played up the science fiction aspect of it's &quot;futuristic&quot; setting ,and I thought that book worked much better. Orwell's lecturing on politics was ok one time around (&quot;Animal Farm&quot;), but this book gets so bogged down in a million issues that just don't matter (&quot;double-speak?&quot; Who cares how people choose to talk-- we should be able to talk to each other however we want) and gets lost. If you want to read Orwell when he actual has something to say, try &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier,&quot; which acutally is enlightening, not this preachy homily of something that never happened. It's 2000. 1984 was a bad movie with Michael J. Fox."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a good example of the fact that pessimistic and shocking books often receive rave criticism while dynamically optimistic books are dubbed &quot;unrealistic&quot;... NO further comment."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is hailed as the greatest novel of all time. I disagree. Had this been written at a different time, it would have been hailed differently. The fact remains, however, that this was the Cold War and everyone hated Communism. Thus anything that was against it, no matter how false or trivial, was inflated beyond belief. This wasn't limited to 1984; it was present in the case of Solzhenitsyn. Solzhenitsyn wrote a well-written anti-Soviet novel, therefore Solzhenitsyn was hailed as a hero of democracy, even though his subsequent books were mediocre. I do not believe that 1984 is a travesty because it lacks action. I believe that this book is a travesty because it is false.People say that this novel had an exquisitely crafted plot which readers such as myself are too daft to comprehend. They may be right. However, Orwell did not craft this exquisite plot. It was gleaned from Zamyatin's _We_, for starters. Secondly, this was the topic of the day. _Everyone_ was writing about how bad and evil communism was. _Everyone_ was taking pain to diffuse the utopian philosophies of the previous century. The societies of 1984 and Brave New World are very similar. 1984 and Animal Farm are the same book with the names changed. As I stated originally, the characters of the two novels are identical. Napoleon is Big Brother, or perhaps O'Brien, Boxer is Winston, Snowball is Goldstein, Squealer is Mr. Charrington, etc. Orwell plagiarized himself, Zamyatin, and countless other authors who wrote about the exact same thing.Orwell was not meaning to denegrate the theory of communism, becuase he was not familiar with the theory of communism. He was meaning to denegrate Russia and socialism and show them exactly the way the West portrayed them. It makes no difference that he was at some point a member of the Communist Party. If you read Richard Wright's _Black Boy_, you will see several Americans who were in the American Communist Party, yet didn't know the ideals they claimed to represent. They were in it for the fun. Ditto George Orwell.People say that Orwell had to understand a theory that was developed in his own country. I say: pfft. Firstly, many middle-class Americans today believe that excerpts from the Declaration of Independence are Communist propaganda meant to subvert American minds in the Cold War. (You know, the parts that say &quot;all men are created equal&quot;?) Secondly, communism was not developed in England and Karl Marx did not have sole rights to it. The ideas behind it were conceived in the epoch of Enlightenment by French philosophers.I do not say Orwell is retaliating against anything. That implies he had something against it. I believe he was simply playing upon the mood of the day to please the public. Say what they want to hear and add some sex in there to make it interesting and it will sell. People view him as God's prophet; I view him as a boring, unoriginal one-hit wonder who wanted to make a buck rehashing much-talked-of, much-written-of themes."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While embarking on this &quot;classic,&quot; don't expect to find yourself absorbed in a magnificant tale. 1984 is a redundant novel with unnecessary tangents and pages of contradicting philosophy. ...and must we really keep reading in full detail the horror and disgust of Winston's vericose veins?!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell is not my favorite author, obviously. 1984 may have been the crux of his career, but for me it is the worst book ever. It is most obviously an attempt at satire of communism. The thing here is, does the author or any of his readers know what communism is?There are so many parallels between 1984 and Animal Farm, his other acclaimed book. Big Brother is Napoleon, of course. (parody of Stalin) Snowball is Goldstein (parody of Trotsky). The windmill is the Flying Fortress, what keeps being rebuilt over and over. There is little original about this novel.How do the numerous sexually abundant scenes in this book help its role as a satire? All that happens is Winston has sex with Julia. There is a constant war with a country, and the hint is that Oceania is THE only country in the world. Does this hint that communism creates a warlike society?Communism in its true form is a state no government has yet achieved. It occurs when the level fo technology becomes so great that machines do all the dirty work (i.e. growing crops, making clothes) and humanity can devote itself to higher, sophisticated pursuits, like drama or science. It is originally a state of peace, not war. There is no money in a society. There is no government, because everyone can do what they want to do. So bleak compared to Orwell's paranoia. Communism is too often regarded as the &quot;bad thing.&quot; Nobody really understands it. Did Orwell? The fact that he was once a member of the Communist Party makes no difference. As Richard Wright pointed out, Americans in that party hardly understood it either."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's &quot;Newspeak&quot; should include these additions: &quot;Propaganda is Truth&quot;; &quot;Truth is Absolute&quot;; &quot;Freedom springs from Fear&quot;; &quot;Extremism is Virtue.&quot; This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as &quot;The Crying of Lot 49.&quot; At least IT has the virtue of being well written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago in high school, and did not enjoy it. I thought I'd give it another try now, to see if I'd view it in a different and wiser perspective. Given the rapidly expanding government of today along with the weak economic situation, I thought I would be able to draw some parallels from this book in relation to the modern world.Having finished it, I feel thoroughly disappointed. While I grasp the ideas the author attempts to convey to the reader, I feel it is done in the poorest context ever. The story is so utterly mundane and boring that I found my mind drifting from the story to more interesting things - like my fingernails and shoe laces. The characters are so disconnected and the relationship between them and the reader so weak, that even at the end of the book I could not get myself to care about Winston (main character) enough to give a crap about whether he lived or died. The ideas and their implications in the book are deep but are presented so poorly that I would compare it to the reading of a dictionary, or a ceiling fan warranty manual, only less interesting. It did not take long for me to remember why I hated reading this in school.For the life of me I cannot understand why this book is so highly regarded in the world of literature. Yes, it has ideas that could cause one to have complex thoughts on many levels, but I found that the actual reading of this book was so awfully boring that it totally negated anything positive that could be derived from this novel. The main character is subjected to a great deal of torture at the end of the book... and so is the reader - as I found that the only thing more painful than the torture was reading about it. George Orwell is no wordsmith and his style of writing stinks and flows like verbal diarrhea. It even leaves a bad aftertaste, as diarrhea should, preventing one from revisiting the ideas in the book due to the runny, turd-like substance that Orwell considers to be the storyline.The ideas in this book have seen many embodiments since its publication. From \\"Demolition Man\\" to a certain episode of \\"The Outer Limits\\", all of them FAR more interesting than Orwells' own writing, even if the ideology of the message being somewhat diluted when compared to the original. The moral of the story is hard to care about when the story itself sucks. I have to wonder, what kind of sad people chose this book to be mandatory reading in our public schools? What was going thru their minds? \\"I'm am so miserable and everyone should be too, so I will make them suffer by reading this!\\"I remember dissecting the meaning of the novel in school, for over a week. Any book that takes that long to understand is unclear and poorly written. I don't mind a convoluted message as long as the story is good, and in this case it is NOT. I can sum up the entire story in a few pages, but Orwell stretches it out to the point of nausea. I have read many other books from the 50's era and none were this boring. I actually have the \\"New Edition\\", and while I'm not sure what they changed, I feel like it should be advertised on the cover \\"Now less interesting!!!\\" the way cereal boxes advertise \\"Now 50% more!!!\\". I highly recommend this book if you have a melatonin deficiency and have trouble sleeping."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I say the book is unrealistic, but that's not what I mean. It's not that his characters couldn't exist. It's more a problem of verisimilitude -- that is, he states the problem, and THEN HE DEVIATES FROM IT!

And why is good ol' &quot;common man&quot; Winston disbelieving? It's thoroughly improbable. I realize he was talking about communism, but communism was a great deal subtler than that. It's nowhere near the realistic depictions of the future by science-fiction writers, but because the science-fiction writers weren't respected, and Orwell was a Prominent Social Critic, look what we're stuck with -- the paranoid fevered dream of a madman masquerading as a prophet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics.

So much has been written about it since its publication that the question has to be: what on earth can be said about it that hasn't already been said or written?This is a horror novel - pure and simple. Smith's predicament is awful and utterly believable, all thanks to Orwell's bleak, desperate prose and brutally insightful imagination. It could also be described as prophetic, I think.The novel opens with the totalitarian government already in place, the masses already beaten into submission - but how did it all start? No government could shift from Democracy (however false), to this novel's style of complete control and brainwashing overnight. I would love to know Orwell's thoughts about how the transition was made - and how long it took...Would Orwell take a look at the style of government we have now, and see the beginnings of dangerous state interference at work? The way Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have created a government based on deception and manipulating the public may sound alarm bells in Orwell's mind - if only he were here to have his say.People have pride in their national identity - their nation's history, as well. So that needs to be eroded first. How would Big brother do that in the novel? Maybe it started with opening the country's borders to anyone that fancied it, so that the national identity that binds people together could start to dissolve - all in the name of \\"diversity\\". Maybe early Big Brother insisted on smearing anyone who argued against this as \\"racist\\". Sound familiar?But Big Brother wouldn't stop there, would it? It would need to quicken theEradication of National Identity by binding as many nations together by whatever means it could; a single currency, a common foreign policy between nations, perhaps? Maybe that's how Orwell would have written it if 1984 contained Big Brother's back story. That would just be the start, wouldn't it?Perhaps Big Brother would construct the largest DNA database in the world, and try and force the people to carry ID cards containing DNA samples? Maybe it would want to bug the cars on its streets so that the police would automatically know who had broken the speed limit, and where the driver was when they did it? Sound familiar?It's impossible to know how Orwell would have handled Big Brother's back story, and also ridiculous to say that such a society and government could never exist.

Orwell, a critic of fascism and communism, goes in the perspective of Winston Smith, a man who is against \\"Big Brother\\"- the figurehead of The Party. For the first one hundred pages, he gives readers an interesting description and plot development of the terrifying future. After that, the story becomes stained with the smelly stain of an unnecessary romance and it all goes downhill from there. It becomes sadly repetitive and frankly, boring. Orwell reveals a previously unknown side- a sexy, sultry side- as he goes in depth about the human sexual instincts, which becomes disgusting after awhile. The ending is of no surprise. The back cover of the book hints at reading the last four words, and no one can possibly stop from reading them.

The caution of not ever letting a Totalitarianist government come to power was the over arching theme of the book. There were several thought provoking passages that made me think about the world in a new way. However the plot and charcters seemed dull and uninteresting to me. This isn't a book I would recomend to anyone who wants a casual book to read but if you want a book that will make you think a little than this is a good book to choose."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I feel relatively uneasy about saying something negative for such a classic as 1984. But, learning the book's lesson about what the world would be like if one's individuality were lost, I'll say what I truly feel. I think this book is slow and depressing. In fact, the only reason that I kept reading on was because of the introduction of Julia in the story. I found her character intriguing. Why was she put there? Who is she? Can her motives be trusted? It was only after I read the story, that I realized she was created by the author for the sole purpose of being used as a barometer for Winston's (the protagonist in the story) individuality. What Julia means to Winston is an indication of how much Winston has lost of himself. His ability to think and remember the past.In 1984, the world is divided into 3 superpowers. Winston belongs to the Ingsoc Party (a contraction of [Eng]lish [Soc]ialism) where to have thoughts in opposition or in deviance with propaganda meant capture and subsequent brainwashing by the Thought Police. Everyone in the Party is watched and monitored by telescreens (two-way TVs that broadcast as well as receive) and hidden microphones. A new language called Newspeak is a rapidly decreasing subset of English created to make the expression of rebellious thought an impossiblity. On top of this, all books and works of literature were being rewritten in Newspeak and their essential meaning contorted to serve the purposes of the Party.If George Orwell's vision of the future haunts you, then his objective was achieved. His main goal in writing this book was to both set a mood and give a warning. The mood he sets is for what an extreme Socialist state would look like twenty years from the time he wrote the story. His warning is of what would happen if Socialism were perverted by the ruling class where power becomes an end and not just the means.The ideas presented in this book are powerful and well thought-out. However, the story itself is dull and uneventful. If you like a story that you can read and reflect on afterwards, this is your book. If you like faster-paced stories, pass on this one.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (humorless, basic English dialogue)E (Erotica) - 0.5 (go Julia go)A (Action) - 0 (n/a - goes hand in hand with the story being dull)P (Plot) - 3 (dull story, good vision)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The starting point and first dot is Orwell's 1984 how language is used to control large populations.

It is also one of the most misunderstood.Many readers assume that the novel is anti-Communist and anti-socialist. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Orwell was a socialist himself. During the Spanish Civil War, he fought for a revolutionary party called POUM, \\"the Workers Party for Marxist Unification\\". Sounds pretty socialist to me. Orwell was anti-Stalinist, but believed Stalinism to be a perversion of true socialism.So is his novel an attack on Stalinism, then? Both yes and no. \\"1984\\" was written in 1948 and published in 1949. During this time, many intellectuals believed that Stalinism and capitalism would eventually merge, creating a new system, combining the worst aspects of both. This feared system of the future was often called \\"bureaucratic collectivism\\". Rizzi, Schachtman and Burnham believed it could happen. Trotsky vacillated on the issue. Orwell must have believed in the grim possibility of \\"bureaucratic collectivism\\" himself. That is what his novel is really all about.\\"1984\\" is set in a futuristic society called Oceania. On the surface, Oceania is Stalinist. But on a closer look, it actually looks like a strange mixture of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. On the one hand, Oceania has a unproductive planned economy. On the other hand, it fights for colonial supremacy in Africa and Asia. Indeed, its main bases of power are the Anglo-Saxon nations.The ideology of Oceania is called \\"English Socialism\\", an obvious combination of the British and the Soviet. Oceania is run by a party, divided into the Inner Party and the Outer Party. The underclass is called proles. This is both a reference to the hierarchic Stalinist party in the USSR, and to the traditional British class structure: upper class (Inner Party), middle class (Outer Party) and working class (the proles). Interestingly, the proles are kept in line by mass-produced pornography. This, of course, is another veiled reference to the West. No such thing existed in Stalin's Soviet Union.Even Big Brother himself may be a composite character. Principally, he is a symbol for Stalin, and apparently even looks like Stalin. (And his constant opponent, Goldstein, is a symbol for Trotsky. The mysterious \\"book\\" is presumably Trotsky's \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\".) However, some people believe that the inspiration for Orwell's slogan \\"Big Brother is Watching\\" comes from a 1930s advertising campaign in the US, where a certain corporate owner declared \\"Let me be your Big Brother\\" amidst an enormous portrait of himself!\\"1984\\" is undoubtedly a very influential novel. Many terms from the book have become household words, like \\"Newspeak\\", \\"Thoughtcrime\\" and \\"Memory Hole\\". The same is true of the slogan \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\" or even the term \\"Orwellian\\", derived from the very name of the author. Indeed, if you haven't read this novel, you could be considered culturally illiterate.It's a pity that such a popular novel has been so misunderstood. But perhaps that is the fate of all popular novels?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book only plays with our mind."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Okay, it was kind of thought-provoking, and I do admit that comparing the &quot;unpersons&quot; to the exile of Moses in the movie The Ten Commandments was interesting, but the book lost its intellectuality after a quarter way through it. The beginning was interesting, though morbid, but it just goes downhill. The main character, Winston, daydreams about raping Julia, who later becomes his dirty mistress. Then about a hundred pages later, they get caught by the Thought Police, thrown into &quot;prison,&quot; and are brain washed. That's pretty much what happens.I just finished printing out my summer book report for this book. If in honors English they gave you a choice between this book and a book about a snail slithering across pavement, I would pick the latter. I think it's absolutely disgusting that just about every book that we had to read in freshman English had sex in it. The one book that didn't have sex in it was To Kill a Mockingbird, but then that had accused rape in it (that was actually the one book I liked).

Beware the \\"government runs the world unchallenged, but still needs to brainwash old people\\" hole. Read something else instead... ANYTHING ELSE!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a fictional novel by George Orwell. The book is a story of Orwell's prediction of the world in the future (1984). In this story, we are taken to a society that is governed by an oppressive force known as &quot;The Party,&quot; and an intangable ruler known only as &quot;Big Brother.&quot; The main character, Winston Smith, spends his time throughout the novel trying to overthrow The Party and Big Brother, while running from the &quot;Thought Police,&quot; a justice department that monitors the thoughts of citizens of Oceana, the predicted future state of London, England. Winston fails in his attempts. He is captured, set up by people whom he believed to be on his side, and is later brainwashed into loving and following Big Brother.Great attitude George. I truly believe that Orwell's sole purpose for writing this novel was to encourage anarchy, and to convince his readers to be subordinate to authority. Though society and government are not perfect, they are not as evil and as oppressive as Orwell made them out to be. He creates a negative Utopia in hopes to make people hate their leaders and to disagree with any form of government. It is because of people like Orwell that our nation, as well as other nations, are so dramatically torn by the opinions of citizens towards their leaders, and their leader's decisions. Also, at the end of this novel, Orwell leaves readers with a sense of hopelessness, by allowing his main character to be manipulated, tortured, and brainwashed into following what Orwell inderectly refers to as government. Let's try to be a little more optomistic, and work on a happier ending, shall we?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one, unless your into this type of genre. I give this book 1*."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Others may have loved and raved this book but for me, I just could not wait to finish it. I am surprised I even finished it because some books I'll just stop reading it and move on to another book. I don't see how this book became a classic because it was redundant in style.*1984* is futuristic in nature. Winston Smith is one of many who works for the Ministry of Truth and is constantly watched by the televised omnipotent Big Brother. Winston's job is to distort or doctor the truths and facts that may contradict the Party.Discontent with his monitored life, he begins to secretly write in a journal which encourages him to think with critical analyses that would be viewed heretical by the Party. In addition, he meets Julia which they initiate sexual escapades, also in secret.Predictably, Winston and Julia are captured by the Party. Winston goes through torture to which the Party oversees in order to condition him back to Party's mission and beliefs.The plot is fairly simplistic but with redundant lines. \\"Oceania has always been war with Eastasia.\\" \\"Freedom is slavery.\\" \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\" In other words, it was nothing but a lot of nonsensical fillers.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is entertaining, but hardly prophetic. The world is not like 1984 or even close to 1984. Anybody who thinks so needs to learn more about the world or 1984.The problem with this dystopic vision is that Orwell really doesn't understand technology or the way that it affects the world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I first started reading this book I knew it was going to be depressing. I knew Orwell was writing it to warn the world of the dangers of a totalitarian society, and he wanted to make it as horrible and realistic as possible. And the things that happened in the book were horrible, very horrible, but they weren't all realistic.I thought it was a good book up until where Julia and Winston were arrested. I think that's where Orwell stopped being realistic and he started letting his own cynical feelings get in the way of his writing. Orwell had a very sad life, and he was a depressed, bitter, and cynical man. It is good that we were warned about what the world could become, but realistically no government could ever control you to the extent that that government controlled Winston and Julia. When O'brien was torturing Winston he could read Winston's every thought. He knew Winston's every fear every doubt, and every feeling. He even knew what terrified Winston most in the world. He knew everything. He took something so precious from Winston. Someting that most of us take for granted. He took Winston's private innermost thoughts and changed them to fit the Party's ideals. I hated the ending to that book. That was the worst imaginable ending possible. If he would have lost everyting and been killed, but at least have died knowing that the Party was wrong I would have been happy. I think Julia was right. They can't get inside you.Another thing I found unrealistic was when O'brien spoke of how the party wanted only pure unadulterated power. Human nature has not changed in all the time humans have been on this earth. We are still selfish people that tend to want to go our own way, and do our own thing. It's unrealistic that whoever started the Party would desire only that people in the inner Party have only total power. The inner Party's only desire was to keep the Party alive and strong. Somewhere along the way someone would be selfish, and mess things up. I see Orwell's point on how a government can become so dangerously dominating and oppressing, but Orwell carried that idea too far. He carried it to the utmost extreme."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I had never read 1984 and was very excited to do so only to regret purchasing this edition.

It's all about control, man. Look at September 11, which was, like many of the missile attacks in &quot;1984,&quot; staged by the US government to justify war. The Department of Homeland Security (Orwellian in its name) and the War on Terror (in classic Oceanic fashion, everything &quot;bad&quot; has &quot;terror&quot; and everything &quot;good&quot; has &quot;freedom&quot; in its name-- all language and understanding has been reduced to simplicity) were initiated afterwards, amidst much doublespeak and Orwellian rheteric from the mouths of the Bush Administration. The neverending war against Eurasia/Eastasia used to justify domestic surveillance and limitation on civil liberties in &quot;1984&quot; are mirrored in the present day by the ongoing &quot;War on Terror&quot; and its consequencial PATRIOT act that has curtailed civil liberties.

Throughout the entire book there are extra spaces between words and sometimes dashes where there shouldn't be any. For example, I just picked up the book to a random page and the following sentence reads: \\"But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from some- where to the left.\\" After \\"some\\" there is a dash and space before \\"where\\", but the word does not occur at the end of a line or at the margin. Also, each paragraph is separated by an extra space. Overall, this printing is way too distracting for a comfortable read and I was compelled to purchase a different version. I recommend the 60th Anniversary Edition by Plume which is a far superior professional presentation. My girlfried tried to suffer the Akasha version after me, but ultimately had to set it aside because of the distractions (she also enjoyed and finished with the Plume print).

Orwell sets forth a brilliant and chilling portrayal of what could happen if governement went horribly wrong. You hate it, you sympathize with the main character, you root for him to come through it all...and in the end, he just rolls over and submits. No heroic death, nothing. Winston becomes the thing he hates, and thus ends the book. Nothing is accomplished, and the book ends up feeling like a waste. I must agree with a previous reviewer in saying \\"this book made me feel less human for having read it\\". Any book that can make me feel dirty on a fundamental level deserves at least 3 stars for sheer writing power alone.For a more uplifting, yet equally gritty dystopian novel about the human spirit in a fantasy setting, try Terry Goodkind's \\"Faith of the Fallen\\". While the series may not have much merit as a whole, this book seems to me like a mirror image of 1984...it portrays the same world, delivers the same warning, except it doesn't make you want to commit suicide."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What exactly is the truth? It's whatever I tell you it is. This attitude exemplifies the overall tone of 1984. Its actual English definition is any systematic, widespread dissemination or promotion of particular ideas, doctrines, practices, etc. to further one's own cause or to damage an opposing one. However, the Newspeak word, doublethink, would suffice in 1984.In 1984, classism and government conspiracies are taken to the extreme.The proles, and inferior class, are treated as animals, incapable of intelligent thought. For this reason, Party rules do not apply and everything goes.Party members, anyone above the prole working class, are subject to a government invasion of every inch of their lives. They have been brainwashed by Party ideology since day one.Orwell's \\"negative utopia\\" is striking, yet I find the novel to be drab and depressing. Rarely am I inspired to read on; all I have to look forward to is another vaporization. The last chapter was literally torturous, yet I kept reading so as to put Winston, the protagonist, out of his misery.It is also a bit of a stretch to say that deleting words from a language would render its speakers unable to express emotions or intelligent thought. New words would be invented as they have for thousands of years."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The scene in the upper room above the junk shop where Winston and Julia lie on a threadbare blanket-as a man and woman must have done before, free to be together, to feel and to love. Then the arrest, the voice commanding them to not move, brainwashed into unquestioning obedience, they stand at attention, naked, waiting for the mind police to come take them away. Never a thought to run, to resist, to escape somehow. Abject despairing surrender before the absolute power and authority of the State/Big Brother.I never quite got over that scene. The supine, complacent citizens of Oceania were even less prepared to rebell than Winston. Now I have recently read Jerry Furland's &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; and I see a new Oceania, infinitely more subtle, and with fewer doubts as to it's potential. I would like to see a movie done of &quot;Transfer&quot;. Maybe some independent film company will see the same promise. Like 1984, it is a novel about the future-no less terrifying than Orwell's long loved classic, it needs mass market exposure too."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's futuristic world is amazing look at society gone haywire.Also an interesting look at where lots of the language we use today comes from."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I purchased this book to give as gifts.

In this country, miniscule amounts of freedom are given to citizens and the government encourages conformity and submission. Winston Smith, the main character, edits documents which may contradict thoughts and beliefs of the current government. In addition, he writes articles for a newspaper called The Times, written entirely in Newspeak. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania and was invented to limit the individuality of humans by stripping language of variety. This limited language is one of the many ways in which the government manipulates its citizens into being thoughtless human beings. After living a structured and dull life for as long as he could remember, Winston reassesses his life and decides to put a stop to the immense amount of control and power that the government has. The decision that he made would alter his life forever and force him to revaluate his life.This book deals with key topics about humanity and the desire for power. Orwell seemingly predicts the effects of communism and the ugly truth about politics, war, and society. The nature of this society makes readers think about the value of individuality, education, passion, and much more. The Thought Police constitutes another form of control over citizens. Humans are required not to think unacceptable thoughts, dream of anything corrupt, appear abnormal, or behave in a chaotic way. Although the society declares that no rules have been defined, the punishments for disobeying orders are so severe that people stay away from doing anything suspicious or something which would draw attention towards oneself. The plot portrays a message about the purpose of life and the positives of differences and inequality. The stupendous writing and impeccable vocabulary makes this read exiting and intriguing. From the first page, you'll be rooting for the successful overthrow of the government and will remain hopeful that Winston can make a positive change to this society - compelling read!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Fast shiping, the item arrived as described. Different cover though, but it's alright.I have not started the book yet, but I have heard that it was a great book"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This Book covers \\"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchic Collectivism\\" which is rule by the oligarchic plutocracy with or without rigged elections or a \\"choice\\" of 2 corporate owned candidates. This is fascism: the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary components of the oligarchy and finance capital. The regime is protected by dumbing down the population, scapegoating demagogues, fake terrorism....anything to focus the attention of the populace on anyone but their real enemies the looting parasitical oligarchy. The only socialism involved here is socialism for the rich (bale outs for the rich, subsidies from the state). Free enterprise for the working class. George Orwell got it right. In response to the person who claims that this is a book about \\"socialism\\": socialism is collective ownership of the means of production by the working class. We obviously do not have this in the US. The oligarchs own the means of production and the government and the tax payers subsidize them and their corporate fist known as the pentagon. Also, saying that Russians have a dead look in their eyes from living under totalitarianism: would it suprise you to know that in the 2002 Russian elections that the largest bloc of votes was for communists??? The oligarchs then removed the communists from the Duma (Nazi DICTATORSHIP style or USA style). This was not reported in the US corporate media cartel propaganda outlets because it blows the lies that the Russians are happy that the oligarchs are in charge again and have looted 40% of them into poverty in just 10 years."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Few books I have read have captivated me as much as 1984 did. In the two days I read it I actually stayed up near midnight and it took me all the willpower I had to put it down and finally go to sleep. I would highly recommend this book to any reader and personally consider it one of the greatest political statements agains communism ever written.George Orwell's grim tale begins after a future government's attempt to create a utopia goes awry. We start the story as it pertains to Winston Smith, a man who works in The Ministry of Truth, which, despite it's misleading names, works on the 'correction' of 'false' records. Despite his desires to fit in, Winston is at risk merely because he can remember what life was like before 'Big Brother'. He knows that much of the party's propogands is fluid fiction; he realizes that the party controls individuals by brainwashing them with lies and alienating them from each other.Winston soon begins having a love affair with a woman named Julia. In their hatred of Big Brother, they both decide to join an underground resistance call the Brotherhood. However, the organization is not quite as Winston had conceived, and he and Julia realize just how hard it is to resist Big Brother and the Thought Police."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is simply one of the most important and powerful books of the 20th century, plus is a great read.A lot of people I know have read 1984, and no one ever considered it less than &quot;great&quot;.Buy this."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a true classic. Orwell's megastate Oceania is a truly frightening dystopia. Winston Smith and his girlfriend, Julia, rebel against a monsterous police state bent on controlling the very thoughts a person may have.

Smith rebels against the maddness and oppression of Oceania by having a secret love affair with Julia, a woman sworn to celibacy for the &quot;Party&quot;. After being arrested by the Thought Police they are brought to the &quot;Ministry of Love&quot; where Winston is submitted to unremmitting torture and brutality at the hands of his torturer, O' Brien. O'Brien is the consumate collectivist.He loves and worships pure power and enjoys &quot;destroying minds&quot;. He informs Winston that the Party determines ultimate truth and that truth is whatever the Party says it is. He chillingly tells Winston &quot; Here is a picture of humanity, a boot stamping on a human face, forever.&quot; a truly wonderful, frightening, but appropriate classic in these tmes of assaults on our liberties.

It reminded me of the prophetic Orwell's 1984. As the years pass on, the foresight of George Orwell's book becomes more and more amazing. He writes the book as if 1984 is a distant future year when the government and the press run the present, past, and future. Are we not getting to that point now? I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to wake up and see the state of affairs we are in presently in this country, and CONQUEST OF PARADISE paints a frightening picture of how technology may take us there."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is not just a science fiction story, or a political book, or even a fantasy story, but a book on ideas, a book of thought and philosophy. Winstin Smith is us, men and women who believe in Truth and history, family and love and sex, if such things can be linked together. And Orwell shows us they CAN be linked, because they are freedoms, as important as the freedom to vote or speak. Without the basic rights that even many ANIMALS have, without the foundation of current passions and private memories, a free world can NEVER exist.Maybe I am reading too much into it. But I feel the book goes beyond fears of the industrial elite within Western societies, big corporations and Communism. Or maybe it goes beneath these fears, to the root of them all, which is our fear of losing our way."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you want to know what the title of this review means, you really do need to read the book. A technical translation is &quot;very very good&quot; and &quot;very very bad&quot;, but that is inexact.It is difficult to review this book without making comparisons to current events or using the word &quot;prophetic&quot;. It is a world where all freedoms have been eliminated in favor of the bureaucratic order. It is totalitarian, as occasionally one or two people wake up to this fact. There is only one crime, to think bad thoughts, and the main character is guilty, because he remembers the unofficial (and therefore non-existant) version of the past.What is most interesting about the book is how, in the end, they completely warped the thoughts of the protaganist so that he goes from wanting to rebel against the government to the last line of the book &quot;Winston loved Big Brother.&quot;That a government could progress to the point where it could twist a person's thoughts is frightening. That people can read this book and compare it to any modern government is revealing.Yes, this book is all the things people say it is, which is why it should be read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you're buying this book and you don't know much about it then you're in for a trip down a pretty disturbing road. The obvious questions it raises about society, government, control, power, unity, trust, and faith in the human character might leave you thinking critically about humanity's direction (if you haven't before). Ultimately I felt like the book's strongest point was it's exploration of what &quot;reality&quot; becomes when manipulated by the mind's interpretation of it. But I think people's reactions to 1984 will vary according to their own insight into the books topics, especially within the political realm. Without a doubt, a great book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read Animal Farm in junior high and then picked up 1984 because Animal Farm was such an interesting read. Needless to say, I was not ready for the horror of 1984. Animal Farm tells the tragedy of a revolution against tyranny sliding into its own tyranny but it tells the story through the eyes of pigs and horses and dogs. 1984 not only tells the story through human eyes, but it tells a much more horrifying tale of the ease with which people with modern propaganda and technological tools can form a seemingly invincible totalitarian government with popular support.Although this may sound a bit trite, Orwell also gives everyone reading 1984 a wake-up call about how easy it is to give away freedom and how easy it is for a government to use any decrease in people's vigilance regarding their own freedoms and turn the world into a nightmare.One of the interesting parts of the book is the fact that the government in 1984 is creating a new language of drastically decreased vocabulary and increased technobabble that will stop people from being able to think and speak creatively or to find the words to rebel against totalitarian rule.However, in writing the book, Orwell himself created an entirely new vocabulary to discuss overreaching and totalitarian government. Terms like \\"Big Brother,\\" \\"thought police,\\" \\"thought crime\\" and, to a lesser degree \\"double think\\" as well as the title of the book itself have become parts of our vocabulary in fighting against totalitarianism. Thus, in imagining a world in which the government is doing away with people's ability to speak out, Orwell helped spawn a whole vocabulary to help people protest."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 ReviewGeorge Orwell's novel, 1984 is classic, thought provoking literature that everyone should read. 1984 relates to many of the radical ideas of the communist era. Orwell points out the fake reality portrayed by the government with his incorporation of such things as \\"victory cigarettes and victory gin.\\" This story exhibits the reality of life in many small, exploited countries.The exaggerated ideals 1984 expresses, represents the oppression felt by many in the world that is gilded by a thought of true freedom. The story is very descriptive and allows the reader to feel the true emotions that the main character, Winston Smith is feeling. Orwell shows that in our world everything is deceptive to reality. Conformity is the main concern for the masses working for the elite and even the name Winston Smith is symbolic for this lack of individualistic qualities. This book shows the militaristic tactics used by the government of \\"Big Brother\\" to inspire people to work and keep an interest in the common good. Every four years the government of Oceana started a fake war with one of the other two super powers to maintain the work ethic and inspiration of the slaving people in the middle class. Winston represents all people who rebel against the system and know that the illusions presented by the government of aristocrats are wrong. He represents the middle class which work as tools of the elite and the proletarians are the people who the government leaves to their own ignorance. 1984 holds a great amount of symbolism and connects fiction with the real world. This book is a must read for everyone and to me, quite possibly one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It's nearly impossible to overstate the importance of this book. In all the discussion about its influence on modern thought, however, the fact that it's a fantastically good read is often overlooked. Orwell's characters are crisply drawn and the world they inhabit startlingly real.Certainly it's one of the most important novels of the 20th century; just don't forget that it's also one of the best."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Although slow at the start one cannot help, but be swept up in the events that transpire in Orwell's 1984; most especially because of the potentiality of them to arise in any societal faction. The story line and its climax are not necessarily what draws the reader in, but instead the possible reality of the situation portrayed. Moreover, although one tends to lean more towards the \\"this could never happen\\" scenario what's disturbing is how easily a mass of people can be lead like a more inferior animal such as a sheep. Disturbing events in history, most poignantly the Holocaust, only support the docile nature of the human being as a whole. This novel was more thought provoking than literally captivating. It's the questions that are posed at the conclusion of the novel that make it a must read even more than the words between the cover."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"there is a reason that this novel is still considered cutting-edge."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Despite the extremity with which orwell depicts this totalitarian state, this story speaks at a much smaller level as well. in a day and age where brainwashing among civilized countries is ignored despite its presence, this is an important novel. Studies have shown how humans, like chimps, end up gaining a following when in a dominant position in society. only 1984 shows how humans take it to the extreme. Of course this novel does use exaggeration to stress its point. And it does so quite effectively, I might add. The end is fantastic, a climax that is the culmination of Smith's life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is Strength&quot;George Orwell dives into the Depths of communist society, and sees through the eyes of Winston Smith, an aging man and a member of &quot;The Party&quot; of the country of Oceania. A series of events leads Winston to the love of his life, Julia, and they both plan to join a resistance against the Party. But Winston finds out that you can't trust anyone in a communist society.Orwell did an excellent job of placing the reader in the center of the lies that is the communist government. His writing style is captivating and everything about the book is realistic and believable, everything from the brainwashing of children to the technology that was available. The book is filled with interesting twists and turns in the plot that keep the reader engrossed in an excellently told story. I found it very difficult to put this book down once I picked it up. I almost found myself awaiting the moment that I could read it again, which was a surprise. I had heard that this book was a boring political commentary, but it was far from that.Orwell slips in views on the human spirit, testing it's limits, and eventually stating that everyone has a breaking point. The dark ending to this haunting image of the future cast from his imagination back in 1949, still holds true to what people can observe in mankind today.One can can be thoroughly entertained while being enlightened at the same time. All in all 1984 is a book worth reading. Also, a short novel for younger readers I suggest is THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Reading this book was a thrilling experience...

Not quite as good as A Brave New World in my eyes, but close. The plot basically centers around two people's personal rebellion agains the now infamous &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

Of course, it is wonderful, and seems more relevant with each passing year.

The fact that he was able to see or know how things could be 30 years later and with so much detail and complexity is awesome. And I mean with extraoridary detail! Concepts of \\"Newspeak\\" and \\"Doublethink\\" are phenominal. You get into the main character and you start to cheer for him. You too want him to crack the system. The book may possibly get a bit slow or a touch wordy towards the end however I think it's necessary. 1984 can be a brain buster if you free you mind and let yourself understand and follow all that takes place. Your brain will definately get a good workout trying to understand \\"Newspeak\\" and the structure of \\"Big Brother\\". It is fun! I highly recommend this book. It stands as a warning to us all. Freedom is perhaps the greatest concept we know, it would be devistating if we forgot it!Big Brother claims, \\"Freedom is Slavery\\" or \\"Slavery is Freedom\\", \\"War is Peace\\" and \\"Strenth is Power\\".

The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a book I first read in the 8th grade for my English class. I liked it then, and I love it today.1984 is a book you have probably heard of, even if only in passing. And if you haven't heard of the book itself, you have definitely heard some of the concepts that appear in this book. Big Brother, thought crime, doublethink, newspeak. All these came from this book and have entered into the modern lexicon.The best part about this novel is that it provides us with a look at a very real and possible dystopian world. As we follow Winston through the society in which he lives, we get to see what happens when a government is allowed to rule society, and the picture is anything but gumdrops and smiles. One of the elements of this that always sticks with me is the way in which the government goes about controlling the people. Done through technology and the mystique of omnipresence, Big Brother controls his peoples' lives and the people are unaware that they are just rats in a maze.Of course, the primary reason I would recommend reading this book is because it forces you to take a closer look at the world around you. In this novel, George Orwell seems to have predicted some of the technologies we have today, and also seemed to foresee how society would use them. Seeing the world he described, and then seeing the world we live causes there reader of this book to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a wonderful book that describes a dramatically dark world ruled by Big Brother. Orwell uses vivid imagery to show you an exaggerated world where government has been given too much power. Orwell warns the reader of what government could become without the balance of power. A brilliantly written piece of literature that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In terms of exploring the human condition in the modern era, this is the great novel of the twentieth century. I first read this book in 1968, when 1984 seemed far in the future. Now it's 26 years in the past. The totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union which so much concerned Orwell is also long gone. But the novel lives on for good reason.Orwell's book will be read for centuries -- when the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century are as distant in the past as the 30 Years War is from us -- because Orwell is concerned about the nature of reality and the nature of power. Reality, after all, is a construct. We must strive to superimpose some narrative on the events and data swirling around us. This requires the use of language and the use of a context. Therefore, if one controls language and one controls the historical record that gives everything a context, one can control and manipulate everyone's reality. One can, in short, achieve absolute power.In the future dystopia imagined by Orwell the state controls language and constantly rewrites the past. Words are systmatically eliminated from the English language so that there are no longer any shades of gray. Absolute control over information is achieved so that however ridiculous the latest message from the party, it must be believed -- and if it is not believed, one begins to question one's own sanity.Much of debate surrounding this book centers around whether the precise dystopia predicted by Orwell will ever actually occur, thereby missing the point. Given the information revolution, the shrinking of the world, and the fall of the Soviet Union, we are less concerned today about the threat of a totalitarian regime than we are by resource limitations. The dystopia we now imagine concerns a constant state of war over shrinking resources complicated by the ability of small fringe groups to use terror as an effective weapon against highly centralized and complex modern structures.But Orwell's vision is more fundamental. Given the profound ability to manipulate and control the individual, what is to prevent humanity from ultimately degenerating over the next millenia into systems resembling the ant heap? For Orwell, the individual's duty is to be constantly vigilant about manipulations of language, ideas, and history that occur in every society so that we don't take any steps toward the world of the ant heap.This is an absolutely brilliant book, written with great passion in 1948 by a dying man concerned about the human condition. It is one of the few books that everyone must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"bought this book after i heard about references to it. this book makes sense now seeing the way our country is going. it starts somewhere...."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I first picked up 1984, by Eric Arthur Blair (George Orwell), I thought it was going to be a boring book that would be hard to understand. I was completely wrong, 1984 kept me on the edge of my seat always wanting to read one more page. There was action, rebellion, politics, torture, and love all thrown into one amazing novel.Winston Smith, a man in his late thirties, lives in dark grimy London (London is now a part of the state Air Strip One; which is now a small section of Oceania) in the year of 1984. He experiences an extreme dislike for his government of Oceania with its leader Big Brother. Oceania's governmental beliefs is considered Insoc which rivals the two other countries of the \\"new world\\", Eurasia and Eastasia. Winston believes he is the only one in all of Oceania who feels that the government is corrupt and ludacris until he meets Julia.At first, Winston thought Julia was a member of the thought police and was trying to spy on him and uncover his hidden beliefs. Evidently, the two start to interact with each other and Winston finds out Julia is not a spy but another person who shares his hatred for Big Brother. Winston and Julia start to talk politically more and more until they finally decide to join the \\"brotherhood\\" and try and start a revolution.Will the revolution happen? Will Winston and Julia be caught and vaporized? These questions will be answered when you read this thrilling and prophetic book that George Orwell believed the world would be like just decades after the release of 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Until last year I had never taken the time to read this book, even though I was familiar with many of the now iconic references (ie big brother, newspeak, groupthink etc.). Let me say that I was missing out. Whatever you may think of the realistic nature of the society he portrays etc. the reason I think this story is a true work of art is because you cannot remain the same after reading it. The narrative is so unpretentious yet so powerful; the description so concise and vivid--I had a complete picture of the entire story without Orwell having to describe every nook and cranny of his world. This book will reach out and grab you and not let you go. It will twist and grind you, make you care about the characters, fill you stomach with fear and paranoia, and give you a taste for what it is like to live in a totalitarian regime.The only thing which has come close to me is when I took part in a totalitarian regime simulation in high school. I was in a class entitled American Problems, where we took a look at...well...problems in American society. One of our activities was to have a taste of no democracy for a week and take part in a mock totalitarian regime. I will never forget this week. I was randomly chosen to be the third highest ranking official in class next to THE CHAIRMAN and her assistant. I was the high judge. I was a member of the party and could sentence people for breaking class rules. We all had to memorize 15 party articles and recited them every class, sing the party song, have meetings, elect new party members, wear our uniforms to class, solute each other in the halls (this was the funnest, other people were like WTF?). Violations of any of these things would bring severe punishments (not real of course, no lawsuits). Anyway, the pressure was incredible and I actually felt myself getting more paranoid. I tried to get the assistant to THE CHAIRMAN demoted but my two assistant judges voted against me and I got booted.I also successfully ran an underground paper that I posted around school every few days with the help of a friend. We made it look like we had many members in our \\"resistance\\" but it was just me, heh. Anyway...you get the point. Nothing compares to that week but this book.A true work of art not only invites you to take part but demands your attention, and will leave you a different person. 1984 is one of the finest novels ever written in this regard. I will never be the same after reading this masterpiece and I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell wrote 1984 as a warning to the Western World against the terror of totalitarianism and loss of personal freedom. Through personal observations of Spain, Italy, Germany and the former Soviet Union, Orwell saw how state control of the economy, and eventually fascist political regimes subjected their people to totalitarianism with political terror that included threats of physical and mental torture.Using a fictional story about Winston Smith and his lover Julia, Orwell spins a tail about government regulation gone awry, and compliance with government mandates brought about through threats of torture, imprisonment, and loss of social status. Orwell wraps into this story the intrigue of not knowing who to trust, whether that person is a high level inner party member (O'Brien), a shopkeeper (Charrington), a lower level party member (Parsons), or his children. Having served in the US Army, this book vividly reminded me of the former Soviet Union prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.In addition, the Appendix explains \\"Newspeak\\" whereby the political elites change the meaning of words. Newspeak reminds me greatly of modern day's \\"political correctness\\" campaigns, wherein \\"truth\\" can be manipulated or changed by whomever is in power. This brilliantly written book uses a dark, frightening backdrop of a \\"negative utopia,\\" which reminds readers to cherish the freedoms that we currently enjoy, for the time may come when our freedoms cease to exist, if we do not remain vigilant.Dr. B Leland Baker, author of Tea Party Revival, The Conscience of a Conservative RebornTea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn: The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is one of those rare books that really affected me right down to my very core. I was actually a little shaken up after reading it. Going in I knew this wasn't going to be a happy story but I didn't realize the lasting impact it would have on me.1984 is a book about totalitarian control over a society. Big Brother is always watching. Always.This story follows Winston Smith. He works for the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Truth is hardly as truthful as the name implies. His job is to fabricate history and rewrite it. History has been rewritten so many times that nobody seems to know true history - Winston perpetuates these \\"truths\\" so that the party is always correct.In Oceana there are no real freedoms. You don't even have the freedom to think. Right from the beginning Winston shows signs of going against the party. He covertly writes in his journal, which is not allowed but at the same time he blends in, he does his job and he does his best to keep the spotlight off of him. Soon enough he meets a young energetic (and oblivious) girl named Julia who is also going behind the back of Big Brother.I'm not going to go much further into the story, this is something you just have to read yourself. This book hooked me right from the beginning and I charged through it in just 2 sittings (something a bit abnormal for me, I'm a little bit of a slow reader). I just couldn't put this book down.I'll try to leave the story be, but I do want to bring up one of the more disturbing aspects of this book - newspeak. Newspeak is a language (or dumbing down of the English language) that is being developed throughout the book and its the only language in the world where words are being stripped away from the lexicon, rather than added. The new language strips away the feeling of words, for example the phrase \\"All men are equal\\" doesn't make sense in newspeak because \\"equal\\" would only mean equal in size, not equal in freedoms. The greatly simplified language is being developed to dumb down society, to control thought.1984 hit me like a ton of bricks. I was actually quite emotionally drained after reading it. I'm typically not too much of a softy with these types of things but 1984 successfully made my eyes well up a bit and may be the only book that has done this to me. At times I almost wanted to tear this book apart, only because I didn't want it to even exist in my imagination - not because it's a bad book. Yes 1984 is frightening. Very frightening.I'm currently playing catch-up, trying to read all of the books I should have read in my younger days.

This book tells a story through the horrific presence of the unknown dictator, Big Brother.I am a freshmen student and after reading this book I can honestly say a message has been received. I now understand what a manipulated world would be like in the hands of a figure such as Big Brother. 1984 is a classic, fast read book that will have you surprised, shocked, and disgusted.The story is told through the life of a man named Winston Smith. George Orwell's goal to make a negative utopia has been achieved. As stated in a review, this book has become one of the most terrifying novels ever written. Big Brother exploits the citizens of London through television, speakers, guards, violence and power. Through the terror and stress of every day life, Winston Smith, alone and misunderstood, seeks to find the good in life and the bad in Big Brother.This book moves at a great pace and has riveting scenes that make you shiver. George Orwell depicts each character with such detail which adds to the tension and anxiety building up throughout the book. This book cautions us against the gaining power of the media and of the government. The only downside to 1984 is that much of Orwell's writing and references are hard for high school students to understand. I do realize that many people will understand this novel and be able to interpret the detailed meaning but I am looking at this book from a high school perspective.1984 is a great book that will leave you shocked and troubled.

Powerful and enlightening, it offers the reader a glimpse into a society in which the omnipotent State controls the populace through manipulation of language, alteration of the past, and other devices. With a population composed of brainwashed Party members and apathetic proles, the zeitgeist is characterized by contented and unthinking servitude to Big Brother. Yet Winston Smith (committing an odious, illicit act) begins to think negatively of the status quo, giving the basis of this thought-provoking novel. Admittedly, one section (but only one!) becomes a bit tedious, Goldstein's book. Keep reading! The immaculate third chapter soon follows, culminating in the most effectual ending that I have ever read. Its impact proves that Orwell successful captivated the reader throughout the novel. I wonder, considering that literature as chimerical as David Deutsch's Fabric of Reality gains placement as non-fiction, if 1984 has been incorrectly categorized. It would not surprise me if Pol Pot had used this novel as a guide book. Of course, elements are also apparent in modern American society, from the welfare state to political correctness to surveillance devices.

How many scientist who dared to voice their disbelieve in Global Warming were booed down by their colleagues and had to quit?It is but one example.That's life, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A lot of readers seem to miss the point of this novel (especially the people who gave it 1 star, that's just weak). It's not about Orwell guessing what the world would be like in 1984 or really even a poke at communism. Orwell presents an exaggerated and seemingly impossible not-so-distant future to the reader and supports it magnificently with parallelisms to religion and ideology. He addresses whether freedom of the mind is intrinsic to the human conscience and whether or not free thought is necessary for human happiness. It also questions what is real or true. Does 2+2=5? If you believe it and everyone else believes it, than why in the hell wouldn't it be so. The novel left me more afraid of the masses and the susceptibility of the human mind than the government. The people can take back control at the drop of a hat and they are the ones who allow it to get out of control in the first place."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It isn't happening exactly the way Orwell thought it would but close enough for \\"government work\\" as they say. The few differences are covered in \\"Brave New World\\" (I always tell my associates to take 1984 and Brave New World, toss them in a blender and then pour out the situation that exists today) as far as the covert aspects of a government controlled society (although the government didn't have to take over the media; the media is going along willingly without government control and the \\"feelies\\" (to keep people occupied doing ANYTHING other than contemplating the government)are being provided by I-pod, X-box and a host of other distractions provided to preclude the population from observing much of anything outside the immediate sphere of their own existence.I purchase copies of this book whenever I spot them in a used book store and then hand them out like candy to co-workers and friends - just to get them to start thinking about what's going on now. After reading the Federalist Papers, Letters from Jefferson and other \\"Founding Father's Documents\\" it apparent that where we are today is nothing akin to where they would have envisioned us to be - it was \\"Promote the general welfare\\" not \\"give out welfare\\", \\"pursuit of happiness\\" not \\"make sure everyone is happy\\". We are where we are today by ignoring what's going on and allowing a government similar to the one's that Orwell and Huxley predicted would develop. If you have yet to read this book then grab a copy and contemplate a further projection of the predictions; where is the control by the government over the \\"citizens\\" [subjects?] going to be in another ten years?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the most depressing tale I have ever read. Though I know it to be fiction, I still can't take myself out of its ending. Although you KNOW for certain how the story will end, one could even imagine writing the plot exactly as it is only half way through the book, you could still not imagine the profoundness in which it was written and the mood it puts you in. It is also one of the most mentally exhausting reads. Taking you from logical absurdities to the haziness of dream worlds to metaphysical discussions.Ok, so why am I giving it 5 stars despite all this?Because in doing it the way it is, Orwell has succeeded in transferring to you his absolute HATRED of mental bondage, and of absolute unchecked human authority, and anything and everything that can lead to them. The rate at which the story is advanced towards the darkness and viciousness, the way he never for a moment leaves a prickle of hope in you heart or your mind about the final outcome of the protagonists or the world in which he lives, all reflect in no uncertain terms this hatred. Sometimes you think to yourself reading this \\"ok, I get it, why all this darkness\\"? Then, you realize what he was doing. He is shouting with the top of his lungs to all of us to NEVER EVER let things even approach the conditions of \\"Airstrip one\\".What I have found most amazing in the novel towards the end is his resolution of a question that kept lingering in the protagonist's mind throughout the story; the \\"why?\\", why would the \\"Party\\" or the people in it do that? I have seen few reviewers allude to it. His answer was as simple and unexpected to me as it was to Winston - the protagonist, yet was perfectly inline with the extreme world Orwell built. There is no \\"why\\", there is no logic to explain it. Power is an end, not a means. In the words of the party members: \\"GOD is power\\". There is no reason for such attrocities but a sheer animalistic lust for power. Again, he is in a way saying: \\"don't ever try to rationalize it to yourself or others\\".What sets \\"1984\\" apart from its famous sibling \\"Animal Farm\\", which by the way was also very depressing, is that it is not tailored to the history of the Communists. You could see, in a sense, the development of Orwell's thought while writing these two pieces. He started with the first to document one of the worst forms of collectivism that he witnessed, then - seeing at that time no sign of it being defeated or abated - took it to its extreme form. Such a form was sufficiently general to cover all types of mind slavery, to the extent that it can be applicable everywhere. I belive he might have even hinted at that in the part where he recounts the \\"history of the world\\" that he imagined from the his time to 1984. In this history, ALL of the globe, is ruled the same way albeit with different names and insignificant changes in ideology.It is impossible to read 1984 without drawing parallels between contemporary events and something that is taking place in the novel. Indeed, one might never find a place where this kind of world exists. Yet, there is always something to draw parallels upon. Here, in the States, when you here the words \\"spin masters\\", you can't help but think of the principle of \\"doublethink\\"; in which one can not only muster the ability to consciously think of something and its opposite at the same time, yet somehow be able to believe both of them. You hear the word \\"alternate reality\\" in which people hear, read, and see the facts yet still are able to fit them into their worldview. A view in which internment is justified, the poor are robbing the rich, dissent is treason, torture is patriotism, failures are successes, and everything you think is true is a lie fabricated by the an enemy called \\"the main stream media\\". Then, you can't help but think of the \\"Ministry of truth\\" and the \\"Ministry of love\\".Orwell is a champion of freedom at all levels, but most importantly in \\"1984\\", he is a champion of common sense.\\"Freedom is the ability to say that two plus two equals four\\".1984 is a must read for all."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell has not only written an engaging and entertaining, (though sometimes depressing, but in a necessary way) dystopic-future novel; he has also given the reader both political and human insights.Although you won't find a happy ending in Orwell's masterpiece, the reader will enjoy the suspense of the dangers of Winston's world. I could also sympathize with the romance between Winston and Julia, two lovers finding solace in each other while in deadly and dead surroundings. The prose is descriptive but also moves the reader along and lets the reader contemplate the book's political and human insights.Politically it is still very relevant. There are still toltalitarian governments and the situation that Winston suffers parallels not exactly, but is similair to the lives of many in third world countries with opressive dictators.It could even be used symbolically to satirize America. Sometimes the government tells the press and the public lies. It has happened before. Think of Watergate. And to be fair to both parties I'll include both Bill Clinton's lies and the lies about Vietnam.Humanely, it is a moving novel, showing man's inhumanity to man; the ability for a government to have such strength as to wipe out our signiture features: religion, love, freedom, and even language. (By this I mean Newspeak, a form of writing the government imposes into the newspapers.)This is a bizarre, moving, heart-breaking novel about a negative-Utopia.I highly reccomend this book to thinkers, non-thinkers, or anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; published in 1949, projects a parallel world 35 years into the future in which all nations have been combined into three major superpowers in an eternal state of unrest. London still exists, but it is now a part of Oceania, governed by an entity called the Party, headed by a sovereign figure known only as Big Brother. The Party's one goal is power -- power over everybody and everything in Oceania. Surveillance is administered constantly; devices called telescreens are placed in people's homes to monitor thoughts and actions and broadcast Party propaganda continuously, with no way for the resident to turn his off or change the channel. Free thinkers are not tolerated, and roving bands of &quot;Thought Police&quot; are sent to sniff out transgressors. The Party is developing an official language called Newspeak, whose goal is to simplify language by eliminating as many extraneous words as possible and reducing vocabulary to a small number of basic words, thus narrowing the scope of thought.But there's always a rebel. The protagonist is a man named Winston Smith who works at the Ministry of Truth as a sort of professional history revisionist. His job is to revise newspaper articles and documents in which Big Brother made predictions or statements that did not agree with the actual outcome of events; in other words, to maintain the public illusion that the Party is infallible and omniscient. Unhappy with his state of being, Winston would like to overthrow the Party but is powerless to do so. Teaming up with his love interest Julia, another Party worker, he colludes with a high-ranking Party official named O'Brien, who reveals himself as a secret member of a society called the Brotherhood who are planning to destroy the Party. O'Brien gives Winston a subversive book explaining the ideals and motivations of the Party: The upper classes (the highest Party members) need to retain their economic status, so it is important to control the minds and bodies of the lower classes, and wars are waged constantly only so that capital will be spent on the production of war machinery instead of being converted into wealth which could be distributed to the lower classes.Winston knows that if he is caught as a dissident, he's dead. The Thought Police are everywhere, and can he trust Julia, O'Brien, and the friendly old shopkeeper Mr. Charrington to be who they say they really are? Predictably, he is apprehended, but the Party's plans involve not killing but reprogramming him, which unfortunately for poor Winston could be a fate worse than death.&quot;1984&quot; is not strictly an anti-communist rant. (For that, see Arthur Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon.&quot;) Rather, it attacks the complacency of all people and nations who would let a small number of idealists have their way and take command over the rest of the population. Semantics aside, Communism and Fascism, as practiced by certain Twentieth Century world powers, are essentially the same thing: the individual loses all his importance for the benefit of the nation, which really means the ruling Party. If democracy requires eternal vigilance, &quot;1984&quot; illustrates the consequences of apathy."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book vividly portrays the most extreme end of socialism's slippery slope. The book is terrifying to read because the eery science fiction-like society which Orwell describes is not so inconceivable. I lived in Russia a few years ago and was struck by the cold impersonal drabness of everything. In the blank, hollow, empty eyes of many of Russia's elderly I saw how tyranny had literally erased personality. The spark of humanity which puts light in the eyes had been doused, and all that was left was a shell of a human being who was no longer a person, but merely a function with no independent thought. George Orwell's 1984 has existed to a large degree in totalitarian regimes of the past, and its radical egalitarian roots exist in society today. They seem to be an integral part of human nature's dark side.Two things in this book were especially profound for me. First was Orwell's exposition of the social conflicts between the highs, the middles, and the lows, which Winston Smith read about in Goldstein's book. George Orwell understood totalitarianism well enough to see that equality is not socialism's end, but merely the propagandistic means for replacing the highs. Self-serving tyrants inevitably usurp socialism's ideals and use them to become the highs themselves, indulging themselves in privilege at the expense of the rest of society. After reading Goldstein's book, Winston understood the how, and O'Brien explained to him the why when he declared, chillingly, that power was an end in and of itself.The second thing which struck me as profound was Orwell's exposition of Newspeak, the official language of Oceania which robbed people of their ability to think by robbing them of their ability to express thoughts in words. Rudimentary examples of doublethink, crimethink, and the thought police can be seen in various political groups within our society today.This book is brilliant and prophetic, a must read for all those socialist utopians who have forgotten the dark realities of human nature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is unquestionably one of the greatest books in the history of English literature. A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Orwell is meticulously thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist Winston Smith's resistance against Big Brother (the symbolic leader of the Party) and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies, cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a definite must-read for anyone. Enthusiastically recommended; 5 stars."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"_Nineteen Eighty Four_, first published in 1949 by George Orwell (pen name of Eric Blair), is a horrifying dystopian novel of a world in which the individual human being has been completely degraded and deprived of his fundamental humanity that reflects the totalitarianisms of the day, particularly communism and Stalinism. George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power. Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists. As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels showing the degrading effects such societies had on people. Throughout this book, one can witness the underlying hatred of Orwell and those imprisoned by the system for the totalitarian state and bureaucracy which completely controls their lives and existences. This book in particular shows that rage in the main character of Winston Smith, a mere pawn in a totalitarian society. Orwell's books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power. Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men, and maintaining a total disregard for the truth. Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda. This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell's stories. However, Orwell's books are also applicable to the West of today, where the constant menace of totalitarian ideology exists._1984_ gives us a whole slew of new terminology to describe the situation as it exists in a totalitarian state in which political correctness is enforced. The book introduces such terms as thought police, thought crime (and thought criminal), doublethink, memory hole, Ingsoc, and Newspeak. Such terms reflect the complete disregard of the totalitarian state for the truth and the active promotion of propaganda within society. They have also largely entered into our culture as expressions to describe the enforcement of political correctness._1984_ focuses on the main character Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who lives in England and works for the Ministry of Truth. As it turns out, the Ministry of Truth ironically is responsible for spreading propaganda, and as all ministries mentioned by Orwell has a purpose exactly opposite to its stated purpose. The world of 1984 is a very bleak one indeed, run by a single party and its ruling leader \\"Big Brother\\", in which all individuals are subject to surveillance by the state should they commit a \\"thought crime\\". All expressions of individuality in 1984 have been wiped out and the human being is totally degraded living a pathetic existence of total subservience to the party. Sexuality has been suppressed as part of the \\"Anti-sex League\\" as well as religion. Truth itself is highly malleable and memory is constantly distorted, reflected in such ironical and oxymoronic sayings of the party as \\"War Is Peace\\", \\"Freedom Is Slavery\\", and \\"Ignorance Is Strength\\". Further, the nation of Oceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, varying from day to day and reflected in the official propaganda of the state bureaucracy. All party members revere their leader \\"Big Brother\\" (perhaps reminiscent of Josef Stalin or other totalitarian dictators) and despise the rebellious \\"Goldstein\\" (perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet hatred for Leon Trotsky). Further, the party exists in a caste system in which the \\"proles\\" (the proletariat) live underneath the party members (who are divided into the Inner and Outer Party). Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth but begins to keep a diary (which is strictly forbidden to party members) in which he reflects his hatred for \\"Big Brother\\". His work involves developing propaganda for the party. At work he meets up with Julia, who he initially believes is a strict orthodox member of the party. However, eventually he comes to realize that Julia is in love with him and they have a secret encounter in the countryside. Eventually Julia expresses to Winston her complete loathing for the party, though she publicly maintains a persona of utter obeisance and orthodoxy and belongs to the \\"Anti-sex League\\". Together they find a new hiding place in a shop in a part of the city where the \\"proles\\" live and attempt to re-discover the past of England. Throughout this period, however, the two live in constant fear of the thought police, should they catch onto their affair. Eventually, Winston meets up with O'Brien at work, a man who he believes is a member of the Resistance, and is given a copy of Goldstein's book which explains the rise of the party and the need for perpetual war. Orwell quotes extensively from Goldstein's book which reflects much of the social thinking of the time, in particular the theory of managerial elites. However, Winston and Julia are captured by the party and it turns out that O'Brien is in fact a member of the party. While taken captive, both are tortured and made to recant their original beliefs about the party. In a particularly disgusting scene, Winston is taken to Room 101 where he must face his worst fear. There he ultimately betrays Julia (as she has already betrayed him) to save himself from being tortured by rats (the worst torture that he can imagine). Eventually, Winston is completely re-educated and made to love \\"Big Brother\\" while his relationship with Julia is forever changed after their mutual betrayals of each other. Thus, ends in the most horrifying of manners Orwell's classic novel. Orwell concludes with an appendix on \\"The Principles of Newspeak\\" which effectively shows how even the language itself can be put to the purposes of propaganda within a totalitarian state._1984_ remains a classic dystopia reflecting the darker side of human existence within the Twentieth Century as it played out in the totalitarian dictatorships of the age. Throughout this novel, the very notion of truth remains problematic, as the party re-defines history to reflect its own agenda and thus even memory itself becomes distorted. Orwell shows the sheer degradation that the human being undergoes within such a surveillance society, to the eventual point where a man can be tortured by the powers that be to such an extent that he will eventually even renounce his love and embrace the figure he hates the most. While the novel is made to reflect Soviet society and Stalinism in particular, it also reflects the modern world in general, in which large-scale and efficient bureaucratic structures rob man of his humanity. Orwell's novels prove particularly prescient warnings to mankind to avoid the dangers of totalitarianism. As such, they should be read by all thinking individuals who seek to understand the horrors that can be inflicted upon the human being through totalistic societies."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I attended parochial school as a teen and this book was a huge \\"no-no.\\" I read it anyway and understood why those who seek control over others are very uncomfortable with this book. Personally, I think it should be required reading as it helps to define manipulative behaviours. It's a great book about a lousy world where thought is actively curtailed and the powers that be are only satisfied when the soul is utterly destroyed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In a world where political religion reigns, God is replaced by Big Brother (the all-seeing, all-knowing government) and an invisible leader, known by the images projects on the tv screens. History is rewritten by way of consensus - whatever everyone believes is deemed as truth. I am reminded by the quote,\\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" This speaks to the corruption that can result from a search for power, where personal power becomes powermongering over others. It also implies the power of belief over the mind and the struggle between the individual and the group consciousness. The ending is utterly tragic and the coldbloodedness of the Ministry of Love shocked me to the bone. I have read this book a few times and would strongly recommend it to anyone wishing to see the danger that may result in giving up one's freedom for security and the ability to think for oneself in return for comfort. Here, \\"ignorance is bliss.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To me it is somewhat surprising how few people think this is a book about perception and how that perception can be circumvented and subverted by the use of semantics. This should be obvious since Orwell actually takes the trouble to stop the book in mid-stride and lecture the reader about things like \\"doublethink\\". Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is also a book about perception, so much so that one of the Penguin Paperback editions has an entire introduction devoted to this idea. This is why Austen's book is still so timely and why \\"1984\\" is more timely than ever.The liberal left in America has had it's ability to reason literally overwhelmed in some instances by it's own political agenda. If Orwell could have I'm sure he would have coined the phrase, \\"political correctness\\". Political correctness blinds a person to any solution that does not fit in with their world view and so America has become a very troubled place indeed; in America, rape by one group can be the result of 'generational rage' and by another a predatory crime. Crime itself becomes politicized according to skin color. Words like 'colonialism', and 'imperialism' have had to be redefined by the Left in order to portray America in the light they wish. On the Left, it is taken for granted that all cultures are equal, separated only by opportunity and not by an inherent brilliance or lack of it; the benefits of multiculturalism, as a result, are taken for granted and not to be even questioned and America's immigration policy reflects this tenet.The political Left in America in the 21st century has taken on the delusional aspects of the Right in the 1960,s, seeing what it wishes to see and deriding all else with an airy, moral wave of the hand. Obsessed with race, the Left projects its own obsession with skin color onto millions of white Americans it doesn't even know.The Left in America projects it's own oppressive and smothering presence onto the country as a whole in the name of political freedom while absolving America's criminal oppressors of guilt; it is the 'system' that is guilty and the 'real' criminal. Criminals become heros, and lack of achievement celebrated in patronizing asides while success itself is deemed immoral without regard to the intent of the opposite side of that success. Thus failure attains morality in an Orwellian way that is most troubling. The left assigns morality wholesale in stereotypes that consign a banker to spiritual bankruptcy and a college student the opposite in a bigoted default system totally unaware of it's own racism and lack of perception of reality.The political Left in America is caught in the very perceptual trap that Orwell warned about; that trap is insidious and blinds one to it's very walls.Lack of achievement in America on the part of certain groups in relegated to a concept of a generational hangover while achievement is deemed a result of privilege; in the eyes of the Left, both groups are in fact exactly equal in terms of competence.In America, the Left would have you believe that everyone is exactly equal, the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" as it were in not a class struggle but an evening out of class, based on the 'coulda, woulda, shoulda' view that there must be a reason why some groups achieve and others do not aside from their own endemic value system or lack of it. In this scenario success itself achieves a type of tainted corruption while lack of success is to be excused, examined, mitigated and measured in every possible way but what counts and that is as Orwellian as it gets.\\"Big Brother\\" isn't watching everyone, just those it deems watchable by skin color, success and and entirely de-contextualized cultural history every bit as subversive as Winston's job."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Once science fiction, now daily reality: constant war, newspeak, doublethink, surveillance by hidden cameras (and now satellites), TV sets humming 24/7 in many homes, political cover-ups, repression, restriction of language and the concomitant impoverishment of thought, manipulation on many levels.

Never trusting the official government story, whether it be the Kennedy or Martin Luther King assassinations or the official 9/11 conspiracy theory. I realize that the powers that be always have their own agenda, which invariably differs completely from the people's interests. It has led me to do my own research (now far easier on the internet than in the NYC libraries with their budget-slashed hours I could never coordinate with). It has led down some frightening paths that more people should be going down, for truly we are living in Nineteen Eighty-Four this very minute.And as a bit of clarification, Orwell was not \\"predicting\\" this dystopia for 1984, as some have written here. He was not a soothsayer. With this book he artfully expounds on his experiences working in the real \\"Ministry of Truth\\" during World War II: the BBC's Propaganda department.

In the book, George Orwell may well have been warning of the dangers of the Soviet Union and totalitarianism. However, even as these facets of our world have faded, the nightmare of 1984 is still too feasible.The plot of a defective man and his internal struggle against an omnipotent government is familiar to most. The main character Winston Smith can not reconcile the lies that the government has fed to others. He often sees his comrades as being \\"paralyzed by their own stupidity\\". Winston's search for something more not only sanctions the ire of the government, but draws ostracism from his peers. In the end, we see that without the all controlling government, Winston whithers away into less than a man. This is the ultimate danger of a government that has grown too powerful.Perhaps no chapter in the book is more potent than Section IV of Chapter III. In this section, Winston reads from the manual of the brotherhood. In a passage that is all too real, the book derides the profitability of war, the class stucture/structure of government, and the failures of previous governments. We also learn the meaning of Big Brother's motto, \\"Who controls the past, controls the future; who controls the present, controls the past.\\"After being in publication for more than half of a century, 1984 is still a literary masterpiece and one of my absolute favorite books."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell (1903-1950) wrote 1984 in the late 1940s,and the novel was published in 1949. This book was a description of a negative utopia,and served as a warning to the West of not only future events but events that had already occured in Western Europe and the United States. In fact, the original title of 1984 was 1948, but Orwell's publishers thought a futuristic title would increase sales of the book. There are three basic warnings in this book. One is that the status of \\"perpetual war for perpetual peace\\" was a permanent feature. Secondly, Orwell was clear about the corrpution of language and thought that could be used to manipulate the masses (the proles as describved in the book). The third warning was the use of war to maintian unity and the illusion of full employment.The shifting of political alliances in 1984 has an all to familiar ring. Note that during the first had of the decade of the 1940s that the Soviets, Chinese, etc. were gallant allies. On the other had, the Japanese, Germans, and the Italians were the forces of evil beyond redemption. Yet, by 1948, or 1946, the scene dramatically changes. All of a sudden, the Soviets were the evil \\"Gremlins in the Kremlin.\\" The Chinese suddenly became wicked. The previously defined wicked Germans, Japanese, and Italians were now suddently \\"good guys.\\" One should also that those who clearly wrote about this in any honest context were badly smeared or condemned for being honest.Another part of 1984 which should be closely examined is the corrpution of language. The politically approved words such as democracy, world peace, etc., are part of the media's cowardly effort to avoid truth. Political hacks use these approval words in a flimsy attempt to pose as experts assigned to explain the changes of \\"allies\\" and power shifts. Orwell was always aware of the corruption of language and, in turn, the corruption of thought. The examples Orwell uses in 1984 should attract the attention of thoughtful men.Orwell was one of the few who saw the connection between war and economics. He was one of the first who saw war production as an economic engine to maintain something close to full employment. He lived through the Great Depression and realized that wars are started not so much to defeat the enemy as to maintain political unity and full employment on \\"the home front.\\" If a \\"war\\" can be prolonged, the better attempt to maintain war production and full employment. While living standards were not good, workers have the illusion that they are reasonable well off and are busy with important work.Orwell's 1984 should be required reading for any teenager. The political lessons derived from this book are important, and, as some have mentioned, one can learn good prose. Reading 1984 can help explain the shifting of alliances since the start of the Cold War and can help explain phony international tensions from the end of W.W. II to the present. One should reflect how many \\"enemies\\" and allies the Americans have had during this time as well as reflect on how enemies quickly become allies and vice versa. This reviewer would not recommend 1984 to anyone who is immune to reason."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In his book 1984, George Orwell predicts a bleak future for the world from his point of view.

Orwell describes a world in which people are conditioned to believe only what the government, known as Big Brother, wants them to.In this book, humans are denied many of the freedoms that people today fail to appreciate. Privacy is nonexistant, due to the installation of telescreens, like modern-day security cameras, in every room. Feelings and personal opinions are eradicated, and even one's own thoughts are not private, because the government can tell what you are thinking through even your slightest facial expressions. Questioning authority is an unheard of concept, and love toward another person taboo. Even the language is limited to a small range of words to eliminate the ability to think anything out of the pre-determined norm.Taking place in the city of London, 1984 revolves mainly around the character named Winston Smith, an Outer Party member in the three-class society. Smith lives in a shabby apartment and works at the Ministry of Truth, where he alters previously-written newspaper articles according to the government's liking. This ensures that the government can not be questioned, and they are always right. He is, in a sense, rewriting history.In the book, Smith considers himself an anomaly to the methodical and monotonous world in which he is living. He finds it hard to accept the ideals that Big Brother passes off as truth, and therefore considers himself an abnormality. He feels alone in his detestation of Big Brother's policies. Despite all this, Winston has to put up a facade for the outside world, so he is not percieved by the government as anything but normal.At the same time he is pretending to love and honor Big Brother and everything it stands for, Winston is secretly plotting its downfall. He thinks the only people who can do this are the proles, the lowest social class, because they make up the majority of the population. Knowing that he cannot defeat Big Brother single-handedly, Winston enlists the help of O'Brian, a member of the Inner Party, or the upper social class.Throughout the rest of the book, Winston enters the world of the Brotherhood, the organization against Big Brother. Will they succeed in their attempt to overthrow Big Brother? What will become of Winston and O'Brian? Will the rise of the individual ever transpire? You will have to read the book to find out.Personally, I thought 1984 was a, while somewhat depressing, thought-provoking glance at the possibility of a dictatorial society. It made me wonder if what we percieve as truths in the world are really truths, or if they are just what we are conditioned to accept as truths. 1984 is a timeless novel that makes you question everything from conformity to the government and the media. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned the standards that society revolves around today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A passionate, exciting novel of the portrayl of a chilling grim depiction of how government could dominate every aspect of human lives. The motto of the book, \\"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\\" These are the statements used by the party to make ocenias society abide to its laws. Orwell uses this novel as a passage to describe the blind patriotism that powered dictatorships, such as Adolf Hitler, Soviet leader Joesph Stalin. Orwell uses Big brother its revered leader of Ocenia, just as the Germans cheered for hitler and respected him as their beloved father. Ocenia uses big brother as their all mighty protector who will watch over the citizens. Pictures can be found everywhere which is a reminder of Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-sung. A fantastic novel"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The novel, published in 1949, takes place in 1984 and presents an imaginary future where a totalitarian state controls every aspect of life, even people's thoughts. The state is called Oceania and is ruled by a group known as the Party; its leader and dictator is Big Brother. Winston Smith, the central character, is a thirty-nine year old man living in London. He secretly hates the Party and decides to rebel by starting a diary in which he reveals his rebellious thoughts. These humble beginnings lead him to greater thought crimes, until he has an organized secret love affair with another enlightened woman. Soon, he is caught by the ever watchful thought police, hence he is tortured and turned into yet another mindless subject of the Party, feeling only love towards Big Brother, and hate towards Oceania's enemies.My reaction to this book was most likely much less appalling than the average reader in 1949, because at that point in time this speculative future for humanity would have seemed much more possible. With today's powerful democracies, I believe that this dreary potential for humanity has very little chance of happening in reality. It was fascinating to think about, though, and raises the question \\"what if\\" many times in my head. What if Germany had held its territory in Europe in World War II? What if the world was greatly influenced by the fascist and communist governments, and split up into three totalitarian super-states? These thoughts racing through my head was very delightful. As for the book itself, it is wonderfully written, with you constantly wondering when or if Winston will succeed, or when or if he will be caught. It is fast-paced, exciting, and ends with an extremely depressing conclusion, that turns Winston's rebellios actions to nothing, as he turns into the exact thing he fights. This book will entertain, because its fast paced futuristic storyline and intriguing background will make you think about it for days, and speculate as to what really could happen. Highly recommended-I loved it for all of these reasons, and easily finished it in the small amount of time that I needed to for a school project. A definitive page turner.-Alex Bogrand"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I found this novel extremely thought provoking. It is a book every young and old American should read to learn what could easily happen to their civilization or rather what is happening. George Orwell is acting as a visionary in telling a story that is becoming reality more each day. It is frightening to think if the government in our society is not stopped they can become equally as corrupt as the Party in Oceania. The thought that the government not only controls what you are doing each day, but also controls how you think is terrifying.The brilliant novel kicks off with Winston Smith, a member of the Party, climbing up flights of stairs with his throbbing varicose ulcer aching. The thirty-nine year old goes through his life second guessing the Party and all it stands for. Winston starts by recording his thoughts in a diary. After reviewing his thoughts he even wondered if he himself was indeed a lunatic. Through the book he is running from the dreaded Thought Police. Winston became involved with Julia another enemy of Big Brother. They met up secretly in multiple hiding spots. There they exchanged words about their combined hatred for the Party which followed with romantic pleasantries between the two. Inevitably the two are captured and brought to the Ministry of Love where their minds were molded into the stupid followers of the Party. At the conclusion Winston gives his soul up to the Party.This is a must read for all individuals. Even though written as a fiction novel the story 1984, can be linked to parts of today's society despite the fact that the year itself has since passed. The way the novel is able to draw in readers and immediately involve them in what events are occurring in the novel, is simply mind boggling. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sense of excitement for the book they are reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"OK I have been reading some reviews of this book. The book itself, is a fantastic story of a man (Winston) who is beaten down by the society he lives in. Unable to accept the Party, he commits a Thought Crime. He gets away with it for a while, but then he meets up with a girl and this leads to his down fall. Now lets not take the story at face value. The book was written in 1949 (??) just after world war 2. Orwell didn't actually expect his future society to happen by 1984, it probably seems like a nice far enough in the future time. We could rename it 2184 and it will have the same effect on its readers and be just as relevant.Big Brother in the book does not relate to some silly 1990's (2000's) fad TV show. BB is a political party. Now look around at our society. We have CC TV Cameras, a person can't use a phone of an ATM without the government knowing. You can't catch a train without cameras watching you. Neighbour sying on you looking for terrorist activities. (Like the Macarthy era, and now today)This book is a warning to us from the past about allowing government into our private lives. Will we be a free peole, of a society of slaves to a goverment party? This is what Orwell and Huxley (Brave New World) are trying to tell us."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I've been on a mission to read the all time best 100 novels chosen by the \\"experts\\" and by the readers. 1984, of course, is high on both lists, so I read it sooner rather than later.I enjoyed the book. I think it's hard for a book like this to live up to all the hype and the expectations, but 1984 is undoubtedly a masterpiece. While I don't think it's perfect, it certainly is close. The only bad thing I can say is that I don't care much for Orwell's writing style. It's a bit formal. I can say the same thing about Huxley, and it is, perhaps, the way English authors wrote during this time. I prefer an author a little more candid, like Vonnegut, or, a little more fluid and beautiful, like Fitzgerald. However, the formality works for this story. The three main characters are very well developed and you are drawn in. I really liked O'Brien, and can see that he is the symbolism of Big Brother. I love fictional books with messages, and 1984 is full of them. It's amazing to me how well Orwell could predict the future.1984 should be high on your list. Big Brother is watching."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Out of all the books surrounding the issue of communism, George Orwell's 1984 seems to stand out the most. Although the year 1984, the setting of the book, has passed and the author's predictions have not come true, readers are still frightened by the totalitarian government displayed in the book. 1984 is arguably one of the most controversial books of its kind. Readers question whether or not countries today will ever escalate to the super-states in the book. When the book was released almost sixty years ago, people were drawn to the book because of the growing threat of the Soviet Union. In this thought provoking, realistic, and well-written book, the experiences of the main character illustrate the evils of a controlling, totalitarian government that Orwell warns us to avoid.Winston Smith is an honorable member of the Party. He lives in London, in the year 1984. He does his job well and follows all of the rules, until one day when he begins to question the government, which is breaking the rules. Winston realizes that he has always subconsciously hated the Party, and he purposefully breaks the law. His thoughts against the Part escalate to the point where he and his girlfriend, Julia, desire to join the underground resistance called the Brotherhood. They are successful in this but are shortly caught, which they expected living in such a controlling government. Winston and Julia promise not to betray each other, even if they get tortured. Unfortunately they are tortured, almost to death, and do end up betraying each other. Apparently no one wins against the Party. Winston hears one man pleading with the guards:\`Do anything to me!' he yelled. \`You've been starving me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not room 101!' (p. 240)After being tortured for countless days, Winston finally submits by admitting that two plus two equals five if the Party says so. After this event he comes to love the Party because he is completely brainwashed; he is, in sense, a slave. This science fiction story is different from many others in that it takes a hold of the reader and does not let go. 1984 is also one of a kind; its plot is unique so it will definitely be attractive to readers whom have read many books.George Orwell did a phenomenal job making his book seem realistic. 1984 can be interpreted as a warning against governments alike to the one displayed in the book. Orwell wanted the readers to understand that they must learn from history and past mistakes or else become victimized by their government. The main lesson Orwell was trying to get across is that if authority is not questioned or challenged, authority will take advantage. Some people might say that 1984 is irrelevant because communism has already fallen, but they fail to realize that the \\"Party\\" can also symbolize corrupt leaders, the media, or even technology.1984 is an exceptionally well-written book. It seems to draw the reader in and get better as you read further. The reading is very suspenseful. Orwell also knows how much detail to use, which is rare in authors these days. He is praised for his literary devices and even his poetry in his books. Animal Farm, another famous book by Orwell, is basically one big metaphor with personification mixed in. An example of poetry in 1984 is in an old book Winston finds. This poem is symbolic of the future concerning Winston and Juliet: \\"Under the spreading chestnut tree / I sold you and you sold me: / There lie they, and here lie we / Under the spreading chestnut tree\\" (p. 77). Combining great prose with a controversial and interesting theme will undoubtedly make a good book.Making the reader think deeply is what makes a good book great, and that is exactly what 1984 does. The main science fiction theme this book displayed was perception of reality which makes the reader think; something that the television rarely does. 1984 is a necessary read for those interested in science fiction and should be read in high schools everywhere. Many of the concepts Orwell predicted almost sixty years ago have become normal in our lives and that is why everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell, one of the finest writers throughout the depression and world war two, has so brilliantly created a novel based on a prophetic concept of totalitarianism. From \\"Thought Police\\" to \\"Big Brother,\\" Orwell has defined the potentiality of a future government gone mad. This novel is a classic with all the right aspects.1984 is based on a man's curiosity of change turning into an adventure through a power structure we come to know as Big Brother, and his obsession of rebellion, however silent, which later turns into a nightmare. George Orwell puts you into this man's shoes to experience what psychological and physical torment such oppression would bring. You read the text as though it were a history lesson in the future. In the story Orwell demonstrates what it would be like in a power-driven socialistic society. For example: Winston Smith (the subject) works at the Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and fine arts. His job was to correct, or retype, all the history books, or any literature of historical facts for that matter. This was because the Republic was trying to erase any history, and memory, of the past; the way things were before the rise of Big Brother. This demonstrates the ideas and intensions of the regime; to have complete control over the truths, freedoms, and thoughts of humanity.That is really what this book is about; the regime, the power, the insanity and possibilities of an authoritarian rule. Now I'm not saying that you have to be a total anarchist in order to appreciate this book, it is, however, important to understand how power, or total control, can overcome and obliterate the freedoms and ideas that make us who we are. George Orwell has expressed this daunting initiative and should acquire the respect he deserves."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell is the name of a modern equivalent of a prophet. He deciphered the writing on the wall and adapted it to novel form.When I read this book I could practically see, smell, taste and detect the sterility of his surroundings as well as sense Winston's numbness. Not only masterfully crafted, it is stark and chilling social commentary. Had I not learned better by reading this book itself I might have deemed it required reading.In my view Orwell offers what could possibly be seen as a critique of Ayn Rand's warnings of collectivism and redirects her warning at authoritarianism.Recommended companion reading: Orwell's other classic \\"Animal Farm\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a book of great importance, no matter the time or socio-political period that we live in. It is a bizarre and somewhat scary piece of literature that relates closer to our current social situation than one may think. I am a college student who has just read this book for the first time. The parallels between Big Brother and our current political administration is astounding, I had no idea. I would recommend this book for everyone. This book makes the reader think critically about our current political environment."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"Big Brother is watching!\\" This phrase has been so popularly used that the meaning is now synonymous with issues like \\"manipulation of truth\\", \\"violation of privacy\\", \\"conspiracy theory\\", etc. \`1984' is a cleverly written political satire often induced with dark humour, exploring life in a would-be fascist-like totalitarian future where everyone was being monitored and compelled to keep in line ('thoughtcrime' is a crime!), where the individual could no longer differentiate between truths and lies (through the practice of \`doublethink'), where history was being constantly re-written to suit the prevailing political agenda, where language had been simplified to the point of uselessness (through Newspeak), where war had to be kept ongoing to reduce economic surplus so that the population could be held under control, and where party ideology had absolute power over a society dominated by fear, suspicion and distrust.We follow the story of Winston Smith, one who disagreed with the party and was secretly envisioning a different kind of life without being under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother. His hatred for Big Brother and his attempt at joining the rebelling Brotherhood ultimately ended in tragedy and he was captured, tortured and brainwashed. Orwell's gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing. The last section of the book is especially thought provoking and really sends chill to the spine. Overall, Orwell's vision of the future in 1984 is intense and highly disturbing. Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell's \`1984' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a very enjoyable book to read, although I would never hand this to anyone under 14.

What hope can you have in a world where there is no escape - there is no free travel, and nowhere to flee to since all governments are the same?

He's actually not sure what year it is, as the Ministry of Truth, the agency he works for as a minor member of the Party, keeps muddying up the records. The past is malleable, the nation is always at war, words are disappearing from the vernacular, everyone is monitored through telecasters, bad thoughts are a crime, and Big Brother is always watching...How have I not read this classic dystopian novel until now? I've poured through Brave New World, started but never finished We, watched THX-1138 and Brazil, and recently finished The Handmaid's Tale, but somehow 1984 has avoided being in my to-read library. Until I finally got my hands on an audiobook version.This book is eye-opening, a bleak picture of the future, a scary nightmarish world where nothing you do is ever private--and in this age of the internet, doesn't that seem even more likely than ever? Throughout the entire book, I couldn't help that feeling that someone was looking over my shoulder, that any moment someone was going to spot me.The characters aren't particularly brilliant, but they function for the exact purpose that Orwell created them: to explore and poke at this world. Winston Smith comes across as your typical 50's sci-fi hero: he is smarter than many of his peers, aware of his surroundings, and discontent. However, he is also incredibly paranoid and a somewhat weak-willed pathetic man (you see this ESPECIALLY at the ending). What I disliked most about him was how he related to Julia. He tended to treat her like she was a sex toy: a person he had sex with regularly but who had limited intelligence and had to be patiently told each detail that the hero can, of course, immediately understand. While this is not as prominent and annoying as, say, Ringworld, it was still present enough that it grated on my nerves.The only other prominent characters are Julia and O'Brien. Julia, as I mentioned above, tended to feel like only a sex bunny; however, she does in a way, incite Winston to embark on a journey that will change his life and is in control of her own world. For that reason, I do have more respect for her than many other females in books of this era. O'Brien is Winston's coworker and possible fellow dissenter. He's an incredibly complex character, mostly seen from Winston's (clouded and highly paranoid) perception.But what makes this novel isn't its characters, as I said above. It's the story, it's the world, it's the warning about what could happen if nothing happens. And this is what impressed me most. This world is startlingly real. The possibility of a diminishing language is scary...how many words am I currently using in this review would be banished by New Speak (kudos to Orwell for all his work on this language, btw)? How is that similar to the text speak that is occurring right now?What about the idea that your television could be recording you, sending your image to some guy, in some cubicle who is making sure you aren't doing anything wrong? That your neighbors could be spying on you, ready to report you at the drop of your hat? That wars are being faked (okay, so many people believe that is already happening...)? That the past can be changed with a pop into MS Word and Photoshop? How about the thought that your entire day is planned out for you, so that you have no alone time for your own thoughts? That writing in a book (or a review...) could be cause for arrest? If that sort of future doesn't scare you, you are much stronger than I am!I really have only two \\"criticisms\\" about this book. The first is the characters/way that women are treated. The characters are fairly bland/stereotypical of the time. Women, similarly, end up on the short end. They are often described as easily led by the Party's ideals and wholeheartedly embracing them. And most of the women we see are sex bunnies or naggy wives.The other criticism is the long sections delving into Goldstein's book. In my opinion, Orwell did a fine job describing this world, so that I really didn't need the Book to explain how this society worked further. The torture scene also somewhat dragged (though this is somewhat more understandable).If you consider yourself a fan of dystopian novels, this needs to be at the top of your reading list. It is a brilliant study of the future, eerie and intimidating.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So much has been written about Orwell's classic dystopian novel that it is tough to add anything new, many reviewers having offered well-thought of critiques. Orwell's futuristic novel makes one contemplate a world in which various elements of humanity--memories, important events, identities, personalities, family experiences--are rendered obsolete and transparent. 1984's afterword poses a question that is at the core of the novel: \\"can human nature be changed in such a way that man will forget his longing for freedom, for dignity, for love--that is to say, can man forget that he is human?\\", a question that the book's protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles with. Unlike some other dystopians (Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, The Giver, The Hunger Games), which share glimmers of hope for mankind, 1984 is a novel that leaves you shocked, upset, depressed and cold. Reading 1984 is a paranoid, hopeless kind of experience, particularly part three of the novel, but, to apply the oft used expression, it is a \\"cautionary tale\\", a dark parable to what could happen in a society devoid of humanness and ruled by oppressive forces.Orwell uses his main character, Winston, as a scapegoat to this disillusioned society. A sort of everyman, Winston experiences a rush of revolt during early on in the novel during the Two Minutes Hate, where the people stop to decry and lash out against Goldstein, an individual who advocates free speech and liberty. Winston takes measures to silently rebel against The Party: he scribbles thoughts on paper; he ventures outside the district; he buys an \\"ancient\\" relic, a glass piece, a link to the past. Despite his fatalistic attitude that he will eventually be caught and persecuted, he longs for information--and signs--- that will contradict the preachings of Big Brother; he ventures into a pub to engage an old man into a conversation about the world before the revolution, but is frustrated to find that the man only knows meaningless facts about the past. Winston later meets Julia, a woman who he distrusts initially, but comes to trust, as she despises everything about the Party. Winston enjoys the liaisons with Julia, and continues to try to understand more about the past and the possible existence of the Brotherhood. Instincts tell him that O'Brien, a man who works in the department, is the key.Orwell's 1984 is a work that epitomizes futuristic fears of a brainwashed society, evoking emotions on the part of the reader to root for the individual over civilization. As others have noted, 1984 depicts a pessimistic world view with a bleak message. It is, therefore, a bit of a downer to read. However, 1984 is powerful and has redeeming qualities, as evidenced in Winston's valiant struggle and attempt to retain his identity and his hatred for Big Brother; however, we see an inevitable, unalterable conclusion that still leaves us a little bit shaken.Similar to many of you, I was \\"forced\\" to read 1984 in high school; after rereading in college, the book's message was so much more powerful. It's a book that we often have to read, but it is a book that we should read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There have been some great reviews written on this book.

I do recommend reading these books back-to-back, and if I hadn't already read \\"Brave New World\\", that would be next on my list.\\"1984\\" chilled me. I've grown up hearing the quote \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" but never fully comprehended the depth and breadth of what that actually meant.Portions of the book ran dry for me, and a tad long on the philosophy. However, just as I thought I'd start skimming, things would pick back up and I'd get involved again with Winston's life and his burgeoning relationship with Julia. I found myself rooting for them to get out, to perhaps join the \\"proles\\", to start and uprising. Keep in mind, I had absolutely NO idea how this story was supposed to end.I had a physical shock when Julia and Winston were discovered. That voice coming out of the wall as I was reading about their quiet interlude literally shocked me to the core. Perhaps deep inside I knew they were destined to be caught, but not in so abrupt a manner! And that, actually, is what's terrifying about the book -- how Winston had been watched for years and years, how he was so easily duped, and how quickly life as he knew it came crashing down around him.Reading about his torture and brain-washing was nauseating, because I can so easily see how that happens even now in prison camps. Seeing how people can break another person, reading about how hopeless a situation can be, how thoughts and memories can so easily be changed -- scary stuff. Some may scoff at that ever happening. But a slippery slope isn't called slippery for nothing.This wasn't necessarily an enjoyable read, but it was a necessary read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read everything Orwell has ever penned, even his essays, and this is by far his best piece of work. The efficiency of his prose, the imaginative use of language that has become part of our daily lexicon (how many times have you used the term \\"Big Brother\\"?). This is truly a treasure and a novel that I read at least once a year."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Eric Arthur Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, wrote 1984 because of his concern of the spread of communism. It is a dark, gothic look at what society could become if the spectre of communism led to totalitarianism. Essentially, it is a more graphic and adult version of his Animal Farm, with people. It is told by a nameless narrator who knows all the goings-on in the world of the future, and follows the life of a middle-aged citizen of Oceania, Winston Smith, who is an employee in the Ministry of Truth.1984 is not plot-driven, nor is it based on character development (these aspects are still present, however). The primary focus of the book is the setting. We are given the world as it could have become in 1984. Of course, we are not in a situation like that, but the threat of such a situation is still present. This differentiates it from other books, although there is never a reason to dislike or fear something new before trying it. Orwell believed it to be the most effective way to explain the world of 1984, and I think it is effective. If the focus were on the characters or the plot, a high proportion of the messages would have to be interpreted, rather than explained in detail. Different interpretations could mean that certain events make no sense, and discussion would be difficult. Some people may have missed some meanings altogether. By explaining his 'apocalyptic' vision of the future in complete detail, Orwell is able to get the entirety of his message to his readers. Orwell is a very articulate and imaginative writer. The world he depicts is divided into three world powers - Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The Party controls Oceania, the setting of the novel.Big Brother (a parallel to Napoleon from Animal Farm, or Stalin in real life) is at the apex of the social pyramid. He is the father-figure worshiped by the citizens. The Inner Party comprises 2% of the population, and the Outer Party 15%. The remainder consists of the dumb masses, or 'proles'. Any sign of unorthodoxy is dealt with swiftly and harshly by the Thought Police (a parallel to the dogs, the American secret service or Russian KGB). The telescreens that are planted in the walls receive and transmit information simultaneously. The Thought Police use these to keep their citizens under surveillance. Children are turned against their own parents through the use of spy camps and worship of Big Brother. 1984 is partially a look at how easily children can be manipulated and what happens when it goes wrong. Ironically, the people with the least intelligence are given the highest degree of freedom. They do not pose a threat. The chances of an uprising are non-existent because the proles believe anything they are told, and do not take material facts into consideration.Three of the Party's main slogans: 'War is Peace', 'Freedom is Slavery' and 'Ignorance is Strength' are swallowed without question by the majority of the population. The reasons for this, and how the Party pulls it off, are explained in detail later on. The Party was meticulous in its planning. Any totalitarian system requires a scapegoat. In Oceania, it is Emmanuel Goldstein (John Lenin), the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. The Brotherhood is the rebel group that follows Goldstein's teachings, and undermines the Party at any opportunity. The narrator shows us the thoughts that run through Winston's mind, and how he longs for freedom of thought. He meets the book's love interest, Julia, whom he disgusts at first glance and lusts after, due to his own failed marriage and her beauty. She wears a chastity scarf, symbolising her (supposed) contempt for sex, part of the reason for his lust - he believes he can never have her. The message here is the desire for that which is forbidden. He later learns that Julia is a rebel, but in a different way, \\"only from the waist down\\", according to Winston. They find a secret hiding place without a telescreen, and are invited to join the Brotherhood by O'Brien. As it turns out, this is when their troubles truly begin. Orwell describes in detail how the Party came into power, its motives and its true objectives.The full implication and repercussions of these revelations are unfurled in the final riveting part of the novel. However, there are flaws in the exploration of the society. We are not given a sufficient view into the eyes of the older generation that lived through the Revolution. Winston only questions one old prole in a pub, and appeared to give up his inquiry too early. 1984 is a very mature book, and I would only recommend it to people who can grasp similar concepts. If the reader is too young, they may dismiss the book as boring. It may seem so at first, but the novel will make more sense with some thought and, possibly, subsequent readings. If you enjoyed Brave New World, you will enjoy 1984, and even if you didn't, you may still like it. This is a philosopher's book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Don't know how else to say it... One of the best books of all time. Will truly make you think about Big Brother. Are we so far away from this? And he wrote this book way before our time. He was a visionary."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I started this book I was a bit skeptical that it would hold up to its reputation. I had talked with a few family members/employee's regarding the book and was informed that it was quite dull and boring.I'd have to disagree to the fullest. The book was great. It was one of those rare stories that I connected with the protagonist and really liked and cared about him. There were times when I would find myself thinking how careless and stupid Winston was being. I can imagine that if you didnt like or have a connection with the main character that the book would be rather slow and uneventful. So, if your one of those readers that require optimism to its fullest and happy endings then Id advise that you stay clear."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read this one twice.

George Orwell) 1984 has changed my life ever since I read it a few years ago. The political structure of Oceana is based on totalitarianism. The system is controlled by Big Brother, who's personage appears everywhere throughout Oceana. Winston Smith is a member of the party who works at the Ministry of Truth. Orwell masterpiece is his creation of Oceana's vocabulary. The people are truly convince of Big Brother, not knowing that the system is upheld by everyone watching everyone else. Winston's job is to erase past defectors of the party, all while promoting Big Brother. Big Brother dumbs down the population by incorporating a national dictionary with words that severely limits any real discourse. The novel is a dystopian masterpiece. Many feel we have surpassed 1984 in scope, do not believe them. Big Brother and total surveillance exist. Orwell's vision of 1984 is nothing short of prophetic!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A totalitarian, dis-utopian world, undemocractic, controlled, inhumane...yes this is the world that 1984 describes in its vivacity.

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH! These are the slogans of the party. Written by George Orwell, 1984 is set in a futuristic London where a totalitarian regime holds all in check. Cameras observe one's movements and telescreens broadcast news flashes with periodic two minutes of hate while monitoring activities and speech. The language of Newspeak is invented to eliminate free thought. None are safe from the grasp of Big Brother. In this classic piece of literature, George Orwell is able to point out the terrors and follies of a rampant totalitarian juggernaut through the eyes of Winston Smith. As a member of the ruling party, Winston conjures thoughts of a revolution from the oppression of Big Brother while fearing the might of the Thought Police, the ultimate institution for eliminating free thought. With Winston's strong desire for the fall of the oppressive totalitarian government imposed by Big Brother, constant fear of the Thought Police and the numerous stories of their late night abductions strike less fear in his heart, for he already thinks of himself as dead.With a detailed narration of Winston's surroundings, actions, and thoughts, Orwell is able to present to the reader the concept of the oppression caused Big Brother and the possibilities of the injustices caused by the tyranny of totalitarian regimes. Winston's contemplative nature is emphasized by his many decisions to fulfill the rebellious fire ignited by a series of observations. Many of his numerous menial observations revolve around the examination of individuals around him, including his future love interest Julia. His rebellious nature, along with his hopeless value for life, forces Winston to take irrational risks such as involvement in a sexual affair with Julia, all done to spite Big Brother and its omniscient oppressive temperamentOrwell's enchanting storyline with numerous plot twists allows the reader not only to enjoy a well written story of a battle against oppression but to experience it first hand through the eyes of Winston. Emotions will run high in this rollercoaster of a novel as readers are forced to turn the page and even question individual thought. This provocative dystopian novel filled an unforgettable chain of events makes George Orwell's 1984 a must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I believe there are some people--many of whom are artists-- who arrive on this earth to warn us of the future. George Orwell--a Humanistic Socialist--is one of those people. I write in the present tense because although Mr. Orwell has left us, his masterpiece works such as 1984 and Animal Farm, remain, and probably will--as all great artistic works--for a very long time.The warning that 1984 represents is that of impending dystopia--evil in its abject, Senseless, Self-Serving brutality--that threatens to take hold of our human society whenever people become complacent. The question is will we heed the warnings and begin taking responsibility for creating heaven on earth-- or will we wallow in this dangerous complacency and thereby enable the bullies to take over for the sheer love of power?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is very difficult, if not impossible to write an original review of a novel that has been as thoroughly examined as '1984'. However it is a novel that has not lost any of its political relevance and thus maintains its power almost 60 years on. The fact that 'Orwellian' is now a recognised word in the English language shows the extent of its influence.What is most notable about this novel is the intensity with which Orwell wrote it. In every single line there is no escape from the surroundings of the protagonists, which makes the reader feel as though they are every bit as much captives of the regime as Winston and Julia. The power of this central idea of an omnipresent and omnipotent government is a power that is unrivalled in literature and possibly cinema also. Although this idea was formed in the aftermath of world war 2 and was based on musings on the potential of facism, the idea of the existence of such a state still terrifies certain sections of the international community.When it comes to political commentary there is no better writer to attack a political ideal than George Orwell. From 'Down and out in Paris and London' to 'Animal Farm' to '1984' and throughout his prolific career. George Orwell always remained one of the 20th century's most formidable political satirists."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is the story of Winston Smith, an unsatisfied member of the party. The party has control over everything--life, death, action, thought, present, past, and future. Winston grows to hate the party, but is able to avoid suspicion. He is a \\"minority of one\\" with his views against the party, but he claims \\"sanity is not statistical.\\" This book is a warning to society today as we are slowly becoming more and more like the world Orwell predicted. In a world where humans have become more like machines, Winston is an endangered species. He is the last of his kind, and alone he is doomed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I can hardly put it down! It is suspenseful and captivating and written in a way that makes me feel as though I am constantly on the edge of my seat. I did not expect a love story. I did not expect to care. I can't believe this was written in 1949, about a future Orwell envisioned in 35 years. A powerfully sweeping and believable future. (The only thing I keep looking for is email...though it has been pointed out that the Party would not have allowed it.) My favorite line so far: \\"...she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated.\\" (Are all women capable of such power?)Finished the book, and just keep thinking of how believable a brainwashed society really is... and in many cases parallels some of the ideals we as a people have already swallowed. The final chapters were gripping and brutal and made me wonder if I would do the same.Altogether I feel that this is a very well-written book about a reverse Utopia... A false Utopia? A 'modern society'?I come away with a final thought: If you take away the things that (seem to) make a man human, such as passion and beliefs and love and independent thought... is he still human?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is difficult to put in words the power that Orwell's 1984 holds without the grave risk of understating. Orwell offers us a negative Utopia, a world where evil thrives and the word &quot;Communism&quot; is never actually uttered, for the simple reason that it does not need to be...he offers us Winston Smith, a tortured man who's struggle for his own thoughts, ideas, and lover is doomed to failure from the beginnning. The undertones of hopelessness, poverty, evil, and senselessness are ever present in this terrifying novel that I believe will outlive us all. One can only wonder why this novel was not put on the blacklist of Joseph McCarthy, who dubbed so many classics as &quot;Unamerican&quot;. Many have found themselves profoundly depressed upon reading the last four words of this novel, which is every free thinking, open minded man's worst nightmare staring back from a page.."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Most everyday at school, I am assigned reading.

They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached equality and hipocrosy. They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached non-thought and conformity. They were Big Brother. Through out history, a long line of men have stood, begining with Plato, continuing with Stalin, and propagated today by every man, woman, and child who believes that 2+2=5, that A is not A.These men have stood for Big Brother, have stood for Ingsoc, have stood for evil, and have stood for 1984. George Orwell's masterpiece stood for all that which conflicted with those ideals: for love, for happiness, for individualism, for ego. On the surface, Orwell paints a picture more sickening, and more chilling to any person who believes that they are, that they are not a group, not a consortium, but exist in and for their own right.This is not a Utopia; this is what could happen, not what has happened. It is a testament to those who will not take the easy way out, will not conform. It is instead a tribute to those who rage against the dying of the light, for those who think, and those who know that 1984 can be stopped, by those who have stopped it through out the centuries: those who will not sanctify the punishment of virtue. The hero of this book is not Winston; it is the old prole' hanging out laundry, and making the song written by a machine a thing of beauty. In the end, the proletariat must rise; for they are not the lowest class, but the highest. The party members consider themselves higher because they have force, and therefor, by their reckoning, power. But they do not; they have nothing; everything is the Party's. But they are not the party; Big Brother is the Party. In the end, the Prole's are the powerful ones, for they know the beauty of reality, and of the of the simple phrase, &quot;It is mine."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I found 1984 simply terrifying.

If a single man feels one way, that is the way he feels. Even though his ideas may be different than what is normal, they are still his thoughts. Winston Smith is a man struggling between the past and the future and lost in the present. The Thought Police along with Big Brother make the laws, rules, theories, past, present and future, and all that is. Life in 1984 is Big Brother. When Winston falls in love with a woman named Julia, a forbidden act, he becomes hopeful in his efforts to defy Big Brother. The force of it's power and strength is too strong and over powering, and Winston is crushed. Winston is a grain of sand on a beach owned by Big Brother. One grain, in the world of 1984, cannot rule the beach. The beach, by definition, is all the grains of sand. Without each grain, the beach would cease to exist.

Nineteen Eighty-Four indicates the thoughts deep down inside one of us that denote our weakening of individuality and the wrath of group will that exploit this abatement.

I was pulling for Winston and Julia all along, and I even had some doubts about O'Brien. I think Orwell's written a very political, social, economically minded book, that says some very important things about government control and oppression. Walter Cronkite's preface explains the book as a warning, and a successful one at that since our world has yet to fall into the depressing reality of Orwell's vision.

What would be the worst possible life be 25 years from now? It's just incredible and horrific at the same time. The whole idea of the Party is great. Orwell takes almost every tyrannical regime, unfair religious doctrine, corrupted practice and form of government from history and compiles it into one monster power; in hopes of deterring people from following the path, he fears, the world is travelling in towards totalitarianism.The best part of the book is the range and amount of depth there is in each page, just waiting to be picked apart by some curious mind like myself. Though despite all these wonderful qualities, 1984 has some gruesome images so it might not be one of those bedbooks for traditional soccer moms. Overall 1984 is incredibly well written and a history lesson in itself."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In his novel 1984, Orwell confronts the fears of the 1940s that communism would take over the world. Although the issues found in the novel are framed using hyperbole, his overall message carries much significance in our culture today. He confronts issues such as pride, power, domination, and defeat through his description of a dictatorial \\"party\\" lusting for power even to the point of controlling a person's thoughts and emotions.The main character of the novel, Winston, is an ordinary man who is haunted by his distant memory and driven by a suspicion that there is a reality other than the propaganda of the party. He longs to discover the world of friendship, trust, and love of the olden days, which the party has completely erased from all records. But instead, he discovers the cold, harsh, yet bland world in which he exists.My favorite characteristic of Orwell's writing is his use of imagery. This world that he creates seemed vividly real in my mind, and thus emphasized the desperation of Winston's situation. Orwell effectively uses settings that are real today, differing only by the fictional people living there and their actions. Thus the story comes alive for the reader. He also uses many symbols for freedom, encouraging both Winston and the reader with hope in a bleak situation.And finally, Orwell's ingenious mind shines through his work as he displays his intricate idea of what the future would hold. He explains and defends his rationalization, not only through words, but also through the actions of his characters. He ingeniously incorporates these ideas into the fundamental ideas of society, thus creating confusion in the mind of the reader similar to that of his main character.I highly recommend this outstanding novel to anyone who enjoys reading. I personally did not believe that I would enjoy it as much as I did from what I knew of the story line. But, contrary to my expectations, Orwell captivated my imagination through his storytelling. He both challenged me to consider new perspectives on totalitarianism and enthralled me with his methods of writing."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's book is one of those masterpieces that are not only entertaining but are also educational. Author's ideas have many references to Marxism, Stalinism and Fascism. Orwell himself said that he wrote the book after watching political trends around the globe. Many could also find similarities to the Foucault's biopower or Baudrillard's simulacrum. The book depicts life in the totalitarian regime where government not only has control over your physical body but also over your mind. I am not sure if we can compare this book to today's political situation although there are plenty of interesting predictions that are in some way prophetic. For example book describes how the government used war to create fear and fanaticism in it's individuals. How the hatred was inspired by selecting various targets in the form of enemies which could either be real or imaginary but nevertheless provided good basis for manipulating the minds of people. The book is both a science fiction and at the same time a social analysis of modern political atmoshpere. Government of 1984 motives for power was simply power in itself. I don't believe such motive will cause you to destroy human nature within your society to establish control. After all such control is analogous to farmers control over cattle which don't possess free will and are under total influence of its owner. Why would a government choose to control a mindless body of individuals, zombies that offer no interesting input to society. There must always be a degree of freedom in order for creativity to exist and progress endure. Without any channels present where individuals can let their steam out such systems will collapse on itself since members will become oblivious to the world they live in. The book mentions that government wanted to destroy human nature but in doing so it destroys the very thing that it governs. Anyway the book is a great food for thought and allows a reader many insights into modern day politics and mind set. Anyone even remotely interested in science fiction or politics or just looking for something intellectual should read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is very likely the most important political novel of all time. George Orwell's classic essentially seeks to portray life in what amounts to the ultimate totalitarian state. The most terrifying thing about the novel is that nothing in it is at all far-fetched. Other totalitarian states have approached Orwell's \\"Oceania\\" in the thoroughness of their oppression and the ruthlessness of their grip on power. Soviet Russia, Maoist China, and Nazi Germany all come to mind, and all shared many traits with Orwell's fictional tyranny. In 1984 Orwell describes precisely how the ultimate totalitarian state would operate, what life under it would be like, and why it might never be possible for human beings to overthrow it.The novel shows life through the eyes of one individual, Winston Smith, a citizen of Oceania, living in Britain, now renamed \\"Airstrip One.\\" Life in Oceania is unspeakably bleak, with even most of the elite living at or near the poverty line. Shortages of everything are the norm, as the government controls all aspects of the economy with no free market even dreamed of. Love is forbidden other than love of the \\"Party\\" and \\"Big Brother,\\" the Party's leader. Loyalty to the Party is enforced by the Thought Police, whose job is to ferret out anyone who does not conform to the requirements of fealty and single-minded devotedness to the Party. Since Winston is such a one, in the novel he is in trouble. By the way, despite being a political novel intended to make a point, 1984 is also a very readable story in its own right. Orwell's prose is excellent, and the storyline moves along briskly. This is a very dark story, however, with suffering characters and an unspeakably bleak outlook. Part of this is said to be reflective of the fact that Orwell himself was in failing health when he wrote the novel. In any case, this is not an uplifting novel, for all its importance. The theme of the novel is more or less summarized when a Party leader explains to Winston that the image of the world for the rest of all time, may be summarized as a booted foot stomping on a human face.1984 has had a powerful effect on Western political thought, as a warning about the effects of giving government too much power. Concepts such as the \\"Thought Police,\\" \\"Doublethink\\" and other artifacts of the novel have passed into common usage and political discussion. This is a very important novel that shows what could happen to mankind if we fail to nurture and cherish liberty and freedom, and instead allow government to dominate our lives."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"More or less, most things that could be said about this book, have been. So, I'm going to limit it to an interesting coincedence that I found between 1984 and current day America. The coincedence is that between Goldstein's \\"The Book\\"(a \\"history\\" & sociology text on the party systems/countries in 1984) and modern political books. I'm referring to the glut of books on the market these days like Franken's and Coulter's and Savage's and on and on. The scary thing to me about The Book is Winston's reaction to it. He reads it, finds his views validated, and then, ego sated, he goes to sleep and thusly delivers himself into the hands of the Thought Police. Modern political rantings seem to have a similar soporific effect on many people. They buy a book that they know they will agree to a high degree with, read it, congratulate themselves on being active, and then fall to even greater passivity. All one has to do is compare the sales figures of political books to voter turnout on both ends of the spectrum, and you'll see what I mean. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that everyone is this way, but I've seen enough of it to catch my attention. This seems to be the real lesson to me, that most people will become sheep if their basic needs are met while they are simultaneously kept under a wet blanket of fear & suspicion. Most people in the world of 1984 simply needed security and food, while Winston and Julia required varying degrees of manufactured rebellion and love/sex before they were comfortable enough to surrender."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This story is based on a futuristic form of government mostly based on the ideals of a communist government but taken to an extreme. Many would argue that if our own government is allowed to intrude in to our private lives through vehicles such as the \\"Patriot Act\\", we will continue to lose personal freedoms, and find ourselves in a 1984 situation. This book describes a world controlled with fear and kept clean and neat by the brain washed population. All have been blinded by the shadows of big brother and kept there by an enormous army ready and willing to die for their cause. George Orwell the author of 1984 and \\"Animal Farm\\" displays in both books how a society controlled by a totalitarian form of government oppresses the people iti is supposed to govern. If we allow the government to take away our freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism, \\"big brother\\" will be here. I enjoyed the way Orwell described the people as nothing but brain washed zombies mindless and more than willing to follow without question. The book shows how easy it is for a government to lie to its people, and manipulate them. This book speaks a lot of truth and that's like a cold bucket of water in the face in the middle of a warm slow peaceful dream. The way he hits you with the truth of what could happen if a government is allowed to ru amock. This book should be required reading for all freedom loving Americans. Overall this book was an absolute delight to read it was interesting and suspenseful."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Like most kids, I was forced to read 1984 in high school. Like other books I was forced to read, I was predisposed to dislike it. Compelled reading is rarely fun - especially when the book has a \\"message.\\" Coming back to 1984 all these years later, I am struck not only by how spot-on Orwell is in his analysis of human society, but what a good read the book is in its own right.There is a tendency to be snobbish in literature. 1984 CAN'T be a science fiction book because science fiction books are trash. 1984 is not trash, therefore it is not science fiction. This is Orwell's principal of \\"doublethink\\" in action. Not only is 1984 science fiction, it is the best dystopian novel ever written (I would place Fahrenheit 451 in second place - something about books with numbers in the title). Orwell vividly creates a nightmare vision of the future more realistic than anything we've seen before. The future in London does not look advanced because technology has stopped. The telescreens are the only omnipresent gadget. Instead London looks like what it is - a destroyed Victorian England.It is hard to come to 1984 fresh because so many of the terms Orwell invents have become iconic: Big Brother (is watching you), Three Minutes Hate, Doublethink, Newspeak, Thoughtcrime, The Thought Police, and Room 101. I won't go so far as to say that 1984 is coming true - in many ways, humanity is going in the opposite direction - but it is unsettling how many things are coming true. Are there not TV screens everywhere and don't they watch us as much as we watch them. Revisionist historians are all around and, as the Party says, \\"who controls the present, controls the past.\\" Is modern politics possible at all without Newspeak and Doublethink? In Iraq, until recently, it was the face of Sadam Hussein that was everywhere watching everyone and that face bears a remarkable resemblance to Big Brother.It's easy to equate the Party in 1984 with our current government, but I think that is a bit too simplistic. What makes Orwell more than merely a liberal is his pessimism about everyone. \\"The only reason for power is power.\\" It doesn't matter who is in control - it is all doublethink. What makes 1984 truly great is that we are not given a happy ending. Orwell is not a humanist - humanity doesn't stand a chance against the Party. Instead, our vision of the future is \\"a boot stepping on a human face-forever.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Brandon Alspaugh's review is by far the most intelligent of all the reviews, but he really missed the point. In 1945, Orwell saw the signs of things to come. He was not a prophet in the sense of the Old Testament prophets but a man who could relate seemingly unrelated things, what we used to call prescient. 1984 was a year arbitrarily chosen. Of course, some things had come true by 1984, and others had not and never would. One big mistake Orwell made was to make Big Brother an appendage of the government. Alspaugh is exactly right that Big Brother is the media. He's a little skewed in leaving out the rest of the media and concentrating on Fox, but he has the idea. The chief notion of the book is embodied in the character of Winston Smith and his occupation, which is the rewriting of history. As an historian, I am vividly aware of how much history has been rewritten in the past half century by the revisionists. But we may yet escape the world of 1984. There is in the making a rebellion of the proles. They are beginning to object to themanipulation of facts by the media. There are some things the proles know, and they will not accept alternative &quot;facts.&quot; Odd, isn't it, that the folks who think for themselves these days are not the most educated class?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Imagine if the only thing you had control over, or owned was your mind? But, even that has limitations. You are not given the freedom to love, learn, or think of yourself. You lived your life in constant fear, knowing that Big Brother was always watching you. This is Winston's prison. But Winston was a \\"freethinker\\" - he wants to find out what life was like before the Revolution. He is willing to risk being \\"vaporized\\" to find the truth. This book is a classic, but the story is amazing - the strength to risk everything to find the truth and learn to love."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"...well imagine your face being crush by a foot, for ever. Yeah yeah I have to admit I took it from 1984, but it's ok because its only THE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME. I loved that book, poor M. George, he had one sick mind. In this book, around the 1950's(I'm not sure sure, but I know it was during the first or the second war) George Orwell imagined what the world would be like in 1984. The Government, or should I say YOUR BIG BROTHER, knows everything, EVERYTHING ! He hates people that are againts him, so free-thinking and having friends is a crime. With so much power, it's easy to make people believe events that never happened. The kids, ahh those stupid kids, let's brainwash them ...yeah, and let's turn them against their parents, they are so young and easy to manipulate. Yes this book is creepy, so creepy, that you're happy of the world that you are living in right now, that's what makes this book such a masterpiece. When you read the book, you hate BIG BROTHER so much, you want to the guy to beat up his ass, but who is MR.BIG BROTHER anyways, no one ever saw him before, right ? You just cant wait to reach the end, and the ending wont let you down, it's one of the best endings I ever read. Everything is good in this book. If you like DAN SIMMONS, ALDOUS HUXLEY and RAY BRADBURY, you'll salivate over this book.There is no hope if you don't have power, there's only hope in BIG BROTHER.....and Don't forget, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have recently done an essay on 1984's commentary on society (now there's a topic!) for my English class, and reading it made me realize that it is truly one of the greatest books ever written. While Communism isn't exactly the &quot;threat&quot; that it was when Orwell was writing this, the topic is still potent to today's society because it's all about power, and what better topic to represent society when the control of the government is rocking back and forth between the Democrats and Republicans? The book has one vice, and that is the rambling. Take my advice, do not read all of Emmanuel Goldstein's &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism.&quot; It will only bog you down, and most of it is unnecessary to the plot. The first few pages of it give you a clear picture of where and who Oceania is and is composed of, respectively. It will also give some info about Eastasia and Eurasia, but otherwise, just skim. Otherwise, the book is fascinating, vivid, and mind-bogglingly poignant. Do yourself a favor and read it, for your English class, if nothing else."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is probably the best book I read... Although it was a bit repetitive in the middle, the plot kicked in. It was pretty frightening, since many things that happen in the world today also happened in the book. The way that the government worked in the book was through fear and torture. They manipulated the way everyone thought by telling them what to think (much like children are told to finish their meals) but then torturing them if they disagree. If you read this book, you may feel like you are actually there, and maybe get frightened too.I recommend 1984 to everyone!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is a book which perhaps needs no introduction. It is a dreadful, dreary tome which evokes the very nature of despair in the attentive reader who is also aware of how close civilization teeters near Orwell's fictional precipice. In a very real sense, George Orwell futuristic view of a world dominated by three superpowers perpetually at war is actually a treatise on the destruction of an individual's soul.Winston Smith is a lonely man employed by the nation of Oceania's Ministry of Truth. His job is largely the correction of documents which were written incorrectly; i.e., have information pertinent to the doings of a person who does not exist--or rather, a person who does not exist anymore and who the government wishes to phase out of existence altogether, past, present, and future. The what of this job is making someone an unperson, a concept which is both noun and verb.Citizens are always watched and closely monitored by Big Brother, an omnipresent, omniscient representation of the Party leader. Even dissenting thoughts, thoughtcrime, are punishable offenses. Winston Smith is cursed with an above-average intellect and ability to remember things...such as, in direct opposition to Party rhetoric, Oceania has NOT in fact always been at war with Eurasia (one of the other three superpowers). This, slowly, eats into his psyche until he commits two grand offenses contradictory to Party dogma: he falls in love and rales against Big Brother's dictates in his own mind. These two acts of resistance set the stage for the book's climax where Winston's status of plebian worker bee versus enlightened man will be ultimately decided.This book, in the vein of \\"Darkness at Noon\\", not only explores the idea of life under a totalitarian government, but also how persons of power, through threat, force, intimidation, logic, or seduction are able to literally change one's thinking. Manipulation of thought, as suggested by these two books, is simple for a dedicated, organized, and powerful entity to accomplish, as all human's beliefs are essentially as malleable as gold, though less valuable. This idea is the real heart of \\"1984\\", while the futuristic environment, Newspeak, and illustrations of single Party influence are only interesting backdrops. Manipulation of an individual's thought, even as these new beliefs contradict old beliefs or even known reality, constitutes the destruction of the individual's soul.*spoiler*The 20-30 page interrogation of Winston Smith in the final portion of the book shows, through vivid dialogue and Smith's own internal monologue, our protagonist's gradual acceptance of Big Brother's truth as his own. In Soviet Russia, before a dissenter's execution, it was important to the Party that one publically announce all one's \\"crimes.\\" In George Orwell's \\"1984\\", Big Brother wants much more...he wants you to believe what you are saying as you publically renounce yourself and admit your crimes. The interrogation and oft-borrowed \\"Room #101\\" scenes are some of the finest writing in modern literature.*end spoiler*\\"1984\\" is a must-read for everyone on Earth. Once we realize how truly easy it is for organized groups or charismatic individuals to get us to believe virtually anything they want us to believe, we will finally become more careful about what we \\"know\\" as \\"fact\\".As an aside: this book is often placed in the same category as Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World.\\" I am extremely familiar with both books and personally believe that grouping them together is similar to saying that \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" and \\"The Island\\" should be grouped together simply because they both have the word \\"island\\" within their title. \\"Brave New World\\", while not valueless, is a markedly inferior book to \\"1984\\", almost juvenille in it's depictions of social isolation of the quasi-protagonistic \\"Outsider\\" and in the protrayal of future life in the ethically-challenged, biologically-dictated caste structure of Huxley's future vision. Spare a moment to read \\"Brave New World\\", but group it not into Winston Smith's dire future world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I was an undergraduate at UCLA many years ago it was fashionable to compare and contrast the two famous dystopian novels, 1984 by George Orwell and the earlier Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Orwell was writing in reaction to communism with which he had become disillusioned while Huxley wrote in reaction to eugenics and the classical conditioning ideas derived from Pavlov and the behaviorists.Which novel more realistically predicted the future? Which one gave a better critique of the world at the time of its writing? Which novel was more fun to read? All science fiction is grounded in the present of course and reflects to a lesser or greater degree not only the author's extrapolations from that present but his or her understanding of the world in which we live.Orwell wrote 1984 in 1948. His was not strictly intended as a prediction of any kind but a warning. We thought of it as a prediction though, and in the mid-sixties when I was at UCLA there was a tendency to favor Huxley since 1984 was less than a generation away and it didn't look like the dreary hell of Oceania and the thought police had any chance of materializing that soon. Clearly the feel good, feelie, drug-infused mindlessness of Brave New World was much more likely even if probably much more than a generation away.So we decided Huxley had more realistically predicted the future (great seers that we were). But as to which one gave a better critique of the present, we were in agreement: it was Orwell's 1984. Not that we personally, as privileged members of the great American middle class had been reduced to drinking victory gin and going to rallies for two minutes of hate or had girl friends who were members of the Anti-Sex League. What we knew though was that a football rally, with just a little malevolent direction, could easily turn into a hate rally; and the Big Brother of Oceania was not at all that different in some respects from the Johnson administration that had (we believed) killed Kennedy and was now engaged in a senseless war in Vietnam from which we were spared as long as we maintained our college deferments. Orwell's idea that by reducing the words that one could legally speak, by a government imposed reduction in vocabulary through Newspeak, and by an indoctrination of our thoughts through the enforced concept of \\"thoughtcrime,\\" and by maintaining a constant state of war from without, the populace could be controlled--this was something that seemed so very true. We had only to witness the relatively recent examples of what had happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The twentieth century was indeed the century of totalitarianism, and although it did not seem to affect us now, with flower children in the streets and free love and doobies on our waterbeds, it was clear that the danger was there lurking in the distance.Furthermore we greatly identified with the secret and illegal tryst of Winston and Julia, who like us, stole hours away from Big Brother (actually we stole them away from parental authority) to meet and make forbidden love. But what I think really sold us on the psychological truth of 1984 and shocked us greatly were the rats about Winston's face that forced him to betray the only love of his life and in doing so lose his humanity and whatever smidgin of self-respect he had left. In other words what we saw was the overwhelming power of torture to completely subdue, and as it eventually happened, transform the vital human being into some kind of compliant animal filled with fear and the wretched worship of brute, physical power--humans reduced to defeated creatures glued to the telescreen, smoking government issue cigarettes, drinking government issue gin and cheering government issue soldiers on to the slaughter of distant, hated peoples, while all the while over every vacant space on a wall or billboard was pasted not the Marlboro Man but the face of Big Brother whom the populous had come to love as a beaten dog might love the sadistic human that beats it.As to which novel was more fun to read it was a tossup and depended on your personal choice of genre. Those who preferred horror to fantasy chose 1984. Those who could take some secret delight in soma and free sex and in the security of knowing who you were in the stratification of society, chose Brave New World. A consensus view was that if you were a history or a poli sci major you tended to prefer Orwell's vision; and if you were a psych major, Huxley's.One of the unanswered questions about 1984 is whether it really is possible to reduce the human ability to think by restricting vocabulary and distorting history. If some words are not allowed to exist and if history is constantly erased and rewritten in order to conform to the current party line, is it not true that we will more and more lose our ability to think independently and become more and more like cogs in a great repressive social/political machine?Final thought: what would Orwell have made of the possibilities of the Internet to enslave the populace?--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Being the 1231st person to review Orwell's classic, I doubt there is much I can say that hasn't been said already. Then I will simply say that this is the best book I have ever read. I never read for pleasure until I picked this up and started reading. Then, I was hooked. Since then I've been a certifiable bookworm and have rediscovered the power of reading.And you should read it, for Orwell's classic has seeped into popular culture, from the \\"1984\\" Macintosh commercial, to the constant accusations of Orwellian abuses of power by our sanctimonious politicians. Read this book and see what they're talking about. And, despite some people's beliefs that traffic light cameras, security cameras, and wiretapping of terrorists is the start of a precipitous descent toward \\"1984,\\" I thank my lucky stars that we live in a free society. I cringe to think of what life must have been like in Stalinist Russia, where \\"1984\\" was much closer to a reality."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are only two type of people in the world. Those who have read 1984, and those that should. That's all the recommendation I'm going to give, as either you've heard of this book or there's no hope for you at all. Buy it, borrow it, steal it ... whatever it takes, all thinking people owe it to themselves to experience Orwell's classic.So I'm not going to summarize the book, it's that much of a classic. If you don't have some dim idea of what Big Brother represents, my review isn't going to help you. Instead, I want to talk about my impressions, my ideas, and my thoughts about this amazing vision.I think that Orwell's book is gaining more relevance in the modern American world, and that's a really frightening thought. We live in an age of the Patriot act, which allows the government to monitor its citizens in what they do, allowing unprecedented access to private information. Yet, what is a patriot? An individual who performs exempliary service to their govenment as an ideal ... yet, the first patriots were criminals. They were hunted for rebellion or for spreading harmful propaganda against the British monarchy. Now we have a government that could theoretically punish 'patriots', yet calls up images of protection and defense ... I don't know about you, but that sounds like doublethink to me.We live in the age of newspeak. Police actions instead of wars, government jargon instead of truth ... decidedly, we have been so blindsided by the new language of the administration that it is hard to understand just what is meant by what they say. And this has been the truth of all administrations since early in this century. Not a new thing, but it is getting worse. All jargon does is obscure the truth. With the fog of langauge separating reality from speech, honesty becomes impossible.Autonomy is dead. Individuals cannot operate in our society. It has been set up that only groups and parties can exist, and individuals are drown out in the voices of larger parties. People are given their say, and that say is to continue their slavery. People as a society do not know how to shrug off the status quo. Thus, democracy does not know how to shrug off the status quo. The people don't know what's good for them, and that creates the situation of 1984. There is a simple truth ... if people didn't want to be oppressed, they wouldn't be. The public is too many, the oppressors too few, but democracy rules and we are oppressed because we allow ourselves to be. The future is in the proles, but the situation is still the same, and they do nothing.And what solution does Orwell give us? A possible awakening of the proles years and years from now, maybe. But other than that, there seems to be no end to the trap. Indeed, I think the only freedom is that offered not by Orwell, but by Huxley in Brave New World. But that's a story for another day ...I urge you to read this book, and above all to think about it, and form your own opinions. Because individualism is the only freedom we have left. And to give it up is to become the enemy of all intelligence, freedom, and hope."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is an excellent book that really makes you question the type of a world you live in. You will question your own existence, and what you stand for and represent. For those of you who have thought that you live in a \\"free society\\"..think again! This is a book for you to read and tell me Are you really FREE?To me, it was amazing to see that Orwell had the foresight to capture what the world would be like...and when you read this book you realize that we are heading more and more towards the way he thought the future would be.What I will always remember about this book:\\"War is Peace,Freedom is Slavery,Ignorance is Strength\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is one of those books you're supposed to read in school, the kind that all the weird, geeky kids with Chuck Taylor All Stars and too much acne read while ranting about The Man. It's a well-known manifesto of those playing at anti-government, anti-establishment, brandishing about their membership cards for the Society for Creative Anarchy. This isn't for the kids that read trashy romances or pulp novels: it's not for the Collins, Grisham, Crichton, or Clancy fans out there, and it's definitely not something a Harry Potter kid is going to pick up in a few years. 1984 is depressing, it's dark, and as most devotes will tell you, it's happening right now. After all, this is the book that defines what \\"Orwellian\\" means-a word so specific in its meaning, even a spin doctor being interviewed on The Daily Show couldn't put it in a positive light.Considering my choices of literature, it probably comes as some surprise that this is only the second time I've read this book, and really I wouldn't have even been motivated to do so if I hadn't picked up a copy of the movie version of 1984 on DVD. I read the book back when I was a senior in high school-this and Metamorphosis were two works that the teachers at my otherwise fine high school just couldn't be assed having us read. I protested after reading both books myself between Junior and Senior year, and in the end talked the English literature teacher into allowing me to teach \\"The Hunger Artist\\" but it was a rather one-sided compromise, especially when you look at recent statistics. According to one report, the majority of students do not understand or value the first amendment, think that freedom of speech is too unrestricted, that the press has too much say, and that in effect, Americans are too free.It is in this environment that 1984 is more relevant than ever. Look at the National ID cards passed last week without the main media outlets blinking an eye or raising a voice. (Dan Rather, oh distrustful ally of the anti-Bush liberals and libertarians, where are you now!?) In a world where we can go from being at war with Afghanistan to Iraq in the blink of an eye (Er, I mean, we were never at war with Afghanistan. We've always been at war with Iraq. We were never not at war with Iraq. Big Brother Bush says so) and where September 11th is brandished about like a giant banner to take away every freedom known to man, the only difference between the Republicans and Ingsoc is the extent of power and religiosity. While Bush follows a god only he can hear (and really, isn't that signs of a mental disorder, having an imaginary friend that only you can hear that tells you to do things and then acting on that friend's word?) he has yet to understand that to captivate all power, he needs to be God.Of course, the United States isn't the only country with gross miscarriages of justice and invasion of privacy. In addition to China's censorship of the internet, the uniting of England with the US against the unifying European Union (read: Eurasia), there's the almost-but-not-quite-telescreen announcement system in Japan known as \\"The Box\\" to some residents and \\"Off Box\\" to others. Technology was meant to make our lives easier, but as Orwell predicted, it is only being used to impose class systems more rigid than they were fifty-years ago.On the way home from work on Wednesday, David and I were walking past Hyde town hall when we heard the bell begin to chime. He mentioned to me that the bell was given to the town by Joshua Bradley, an Industrialist and self-made man who worked his way up from a mill worker to owner. Rags to riches, the kind of JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie American dream where hard work pays off if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and put your axe to the grindstone-it doesn't exist in twenty-first century America. Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson: they were born into the world they've simply modified. There was never a chance they'd be a factory worker somewhere, watching over robots as computers were assembled or working as a flight or train attendant. Donald Trump was never going to be a bartender in a casino. They were born into their class and remained there, entrenched in their wealth.In the past, this would have sent up a cry through the students and middle classes, charging the revolutionary-minded among us to action, to take our piece of the pie, to work harder. Instead, we see lawsuit after lawsuit as people who feel they deserve something for nothing become litigious instead of industrious while the rest go on with the drudgery of the world in which they live. We've become sedated by our technology, dependant on mass media and the Internet for our information. How many Americans first believed we were going to war with Iraq because of Weapons of Mass Destruction? How many people still believe that? More importantly, how many of those Americans still believe Saddam Hussain was responsible for 9/11? How many media outlets bother pointing this out?In the end, we have to look back at Orwell and realize that he knew this. He saw it all happening, saw where we were going, and gave us a picture of a world in the not-to-distant future that is depressing, bleak, and immanent. His book is more important than ever, and if you cannot believe it, take a look at the film version of the book. Admittedly, it was four years after reading the book for the first time that I happened upon the movie, so my memory of the book was foggy at best. So I picked it up and watched it with some skepticism. Surely, so much of that was changed to meet modern standards. Surely, as it is with Hollywood, the only thing it had in common with the book was the title and characters. It was for this reason I put 1984 on my list of books to read-to see how much had been changed. And to my surprise, not much is different at all, to the point that I could see scenes in my mind not because the movie colored my perception (as the film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did, so that reading the book is nearly impossible) but because it was so accurate.In the end, there was no need for them to change, modernize, or update 1984 because it was spot-on. This is a book that is too important to change, and far to relevant to be relegated to dusty bookshelves in the unused school libraries of the United States, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. It is a book that needs to be read, not banned as it has been in some places. If you didn't read this in school, I urge-no, implore-you to read it now. Even if you did read it in school, a good re-read is always enjoyable and considering the way technology and government are evolving, there's no better or more pertinent time than now."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell wanted to warn his readers about the danger of totalitarian regimes. The promises of the fascist and nazi ideologies had misled millions and thrown the world into the ravages of the second world war. Stalinist Soviet Union was seen by many as a model state. Orwell knew far too well what was hidden beneath the promises of security, bread, and jobs for all.1984 has become a household name as few other books; who does not know about Big Brother, or the Thought Police, nowadays? Even the title has become a catchphrase. I do not know any other cult-book that has been so thoroughly ripped apart by other famous authors; I remember Isaac Asimov thrashing it in the nineteen-eighties for instance. Many seem to believe that the society described by Orwell is an impossibility. The problem with the book is that Orwell thought his society would be a product of revolutions. When instead, in reality, the changes creep upon us. A new law here, a small change to statutes there.The most obvious paralell to the book we have now is, of course, the war on terror. We have from top officials that it is going to go on for a long time, and that it is, essentially, unwinable. Readers of 1984 of course recognize the eternal war described in the book. Another paralell is how history changes; Winston Smith's job is to rewrite history so that it suits the present situation. Don't we recognize that? In the ninetenn-eighties, Iraq was our ally; now, Iraq has always been our enemy. Thought Police, I need not even mention this; the administration knows everything about us, and is prepared to use it.We even have paralells to the Anti-Sex movement! The list can just go on.Orwell's book was a cry for reason in the aftermath of a world gone mad. As with so many other cries for reason it disappears among the siren calls of our leaders.I first read it over twenty years ago, in a different world; it was good then - it should be essential reading now!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a literary explosive, drawing the reader in and then exploding in his face with the realization of how terrifyingly accurate it is. And though it may be dismissed by some as far-fetched, I believe it is more important now than ever before, and should be required reading for kids in public schools. Yes, the famous novel that spawned the famous slogan, \\"Big Brother is watching\\" is quite realistic.\\"1984\\" tells the story of Winston Smith, a jaded denizen of a nation controlled by a totalitarian government led by the enigmatic \\"Big Brother\\" that monitors the people's every action and uses truly original methods of torture and punishment to keep them in control. He begins to break free of the confines of the Party by having a forbidden love affair with a woman, and soon they both become involved in secretive efforts to join a supposed rebellion against \\"Big Brother\\".One of the most interesting points that the book makes is the government's manipulation of the English language. In the book, \\"Big Brother\\" is working towards creating a bastardized version of English called \\"Newspeak\\", in which political deviance is simply incapable of being expressed (for instance, instead of \\"bad\\", the word would be \\"ungood\\"). This, I feel, is hard-hitting in the sense that our language is slowly being manipulated to teach us to say and think things that are far from the truth, only it is political correctness that is causing this and not Newspeak.I recommend this book to everyone, especially those who believe that Communism could work. By the time you finish, you will probably think differently."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is an excellent book. Great for anyone who loves political sci-fi novels or is simply in for an interesting read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 will blow your mind. If you are any kind of serious book reader, you MUST read this masterpiece. It gives a deep insight into the human mind, the fears which lead to failures in society and a bone chilling look at a very probable future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 began pretty slowly, but I got into it more towards the middle of the book. It takes place in 1984 in Oceania (London), where Big Brother and the Party have complete control. Everyone must agree with Big Brother and the teachings of the Party, and there can be absolutely no evidence that contradicts them. In the Ministry of Truth, our main character Winston alters such documents to keep them consistent with the Party's lies. The people's minds are completely controlled by the government, to the point where they would not even question an obvious lie such as \\"2+2=5\\" if they were told so. It's all pretty terrifying, but it was interesting to see the many parallels between totalitarian states in history, our world today, and other dystopian/utopian literature like Fahrenheit 451 (although I thought that novel was far better). Hitler's followers during the Holocaust were completely brainwashed by his propaganda, embracing socialism and nationalism as the people do in this novel. Hitler seemed like a savior to the people, as did Big Brother, no matter how harmful they were to their societies. The Party gave them a false sense of security and comforted the people, but the government was still feared. They were constantly monitored through the telescreens, and could not make a single move without being seen, making it impossible to oppose the government. Because they have to constantly monitor themselves, they start to believe in the things they are doing, and they learn to love Big Brother. This was my one disappointment. I expected some huge rebellion, or at least a little more from Winston, after all of the suspense. I was waiting for that F451 Montag-escapes-the-mechanical-hound-and-goes-free ending, but I did not get exactly what I expected. Nevertheless, it was an excellent read and I would still recommend it, especially if you enjoy dystopian/utopian literature as much as I do."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Having read this book many times in my life, I have to admit that the most recent occasion (this year) found me feeling that Orwell's vision of the future was closer than ever to coming true.My first reaction when discussing \\"1984\\" with anyone is that it is NOT a political novel. I insist it is a philosophic novel. It asks fundamentally the question \\"why are we here?\\" It also, however fantastically, provides a striking and disturbing answer: we are here to serve the rich and/or (for they are the same) powerful. Period. No other possibility can arise. It is about society and a general critique of the human condition.It is NOT about Russia or the Communist system, nor does it in anyway extol the virtues of our present-day government. To believe that it is about \\"them\\" instead of \\"us\\" is to mistake the entire purpose of the allegory and, essentially, live in the dark. George Orwell had already taken his swipe at the Soviets in \\"Animal Farm\\" and while it might be fair to attribute many of the primary, simplistic visual cues or devices to the USSR (Big Brother as Lenin, Goldstein as Trotsky, terms like \\"party\\" and \\"prole\\", etc,) it is a great injustice to the author and his masterwork. It is also to live in pig-headed blind ignorance, which is made all the more worse the more you praise something you don't understand.This is the story of an individual in a society that devalues the individual so much that no one lives in anything resembling comfort and everyone lives in fear. It is about the predominance of the social class system in the world (the upper, middle, and lower classes) and a nightmarish possible scenario of what would happen if the Upper Class decided one day to take the final step to secure their power forever. The world of Oceania is NOT the Soviet Union, it is the western power block (Britain combined with the United States, in particular.) This point is made perfectly clear and shouldn't be forgotten. It is not about Communism in the west. In fact, it is both a critique on Communism, Socialism, and Capitalism.Orwell seems to offer a world where the distinctions have long since eroded away to the point where only the \\"TRUTH\\" remains: \\"Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable ... \\" So begins Goldstein's subversive book. But, here is where you have to pay attention ... Goldstein doesn't exist. Big Brother doesn't exist. Only the class system exists.We are given the perspective of one person, Winston Smith (not coincidentally named after another famous Winston.) Through Winston we learn that he is constantly observed by a television screen, that history is changed and even wiped out completely from one day to the next, that even thinking something which does not correspond to what the government wants you to think is a crime, that language can be distorted to such a point that by eliminating a word for a thing ... you destroy a thing itself. This is a world in which personality is destroyed for the benefit of the whole, while the whole is slowly degraded to an abysmal filth. The stink and grime of Oceania is almost tangible. The decay, the fear, the awful sense of futility. Orwell writes as if he were physically in the place.1984 is a book that baffles many people for another reason. Science Fiction as a genre is never given proper respect, but when used to the fullest extent possible, the power is almost dangerous. Orwell may have deliberately chosen this forum to implode his dystopic vision because he knew it might be overlooked. It is, however, far from simplistic and, if fully digested, quite possibly the most explosive and important piece of literature ever written.But, if you want to believe its political and be caught forever in the \\"trap\\" be my guest."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I love 1984: I think it's one of the most powerful, chilling books I've ever read. As such a big fan, I thought I'd alert other 1984 enthusiasts to a new book that updates Orwell's classic for the PATRIOT Act era. The book is John Twelve Hawks' electrifying, impossible-to-put-down The Traveler. In it, Twelve Hawks introduces us to the Vast Machine, an omnipresent surveillance entity every bit as brutal as Big Brother. With all the political poignancy of 1984--and Hollywood-caliber suspense to boot--The Traveler is a must-read for admirers of Orwell's masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It's been on my list for a couple of years so I finally broke down and just bought it. It's thick with philosophy and politics but these rarely overwhelm the gripping narrative and impressive characters. I've been around the spinoffs and derivations of this story all my life, so I thought the original might seem tame, but what was most compelling about the novel for me was just how terrifying and vivid Orwell's world is. I mean, I could TASTE it. Grim and relentless, yet thrilling and emotional. The some key parallels between Ingsoc and U.S. \\"democracy\\" today are pretty chilling. \\"Endless war for endless peace\\", anyone?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. How prophetic and relevant to the times we live in. Not only does it scare the hell out of you, but the characters are so well developed that you really care about them. It is a tragic story on two levels, both for humanity and for the individual characters. But make no mistake, although it is a great story of fiction, it is also a warning. It may never happen, but it can, and we are heading down that path.So much has been said already in these reviews, I will just add my endorsement and say that \\"1984\\" should be required reading for every high school student, and then it should be required again in college. If you have read it some time ago, read it again, you will find more the second time through. Peace."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"nineteen eighty four was written by the wonderfull author: George Orwell. He was the author of the famous book called Animal farm where he attacked communism metaphorically by using farm animals to represent Humans.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a darkly satirical political novel and love story by George Orwell. Nineteen eightyfour is a similar book. it is about Totalitarianism where the government controlls everything, even the people and how they think. The government has total control on newspapers and practically everything you can imagine. They have the power to spy on people and those who oppose will get in trouble...Citizens have no right to a personal life or personal thought. Leisure and other activities are controlled through strict mores. Sexual pleasure is discouraged, with females being taught not to enjoy it; sex is retained only for the purpose of reproduction.The mysterious head of government is the omniscient, omnipotent, beloved Big Brother, or \\"BB\\". Big Brother is described as \\"a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.\\" He is usually displayed on posters with the slogan \\"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\\".This sense of invasion effects the main character: Winston and his secret hatred towards big brother.The book shows the life of winston and his troubles and how BB controls everyone's life. Winston has to \\"struggle\\" for survival in a world of war and totalitarianism while finding love to Julia.to me, 1984 was and still is a very depressing book. It is so sad how BB controls everyone and how Winston gets effected by this.We really get into the story by orwell's fantastic writing with lots of description so we can imagine what it would be like.This is such a good book, this is my first Orwell book and after that, I read Animal farm and was also great!ORWELL is such a good writer and 1984 is one of his best books about love, survival....., and betrayal.\\"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In 1984 George Orwell tells the story of Winston Smith. Smith lives under the rule of Big Brother. His every move is monitored. On the outside Winston is a loyal member of the party, but within Winston rebels. He does not except the propaganda of the Party. Winston needs to be reeducated and taught to love Big Brother.This novel provokes a feeling of helplessness. It expresses the power of oppression and the simplicity of creating truth. Orwell is constantly playing with the emotions of the reader, taking them on a ride with surprises around every corner. The reader questions its views on love, politics, and truth. Orwell's masterpiece forces the readers to examine their own world in order seek out any lies that they have been presented with."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of the scariest books ever written. It's a story of a society where the government is everywhere and controls everything. Big Brother is what they call the government, and they want the people to think that Big Brother is looking out for them, when actually Big Brother is watching every move they make.It takes 20 or 30 pages to get into the book and start to understand the language used in it. Nothing in this book is what is seems to be. For example, they have a memory hole, which is used to destroy documents and erase the memory of the words on those documents. The Ministry of Love is where they torture people, The Ministry of Truth is where they produce their lies, and so on.The hero of this book realizes that things are not what they seem and are not quite right. He longs for freedom, without knowing just what it is he's missing. It's a bleak book, but one of the best I've ever read.If you enjoy this one you should also check out \\"Animal Farm,\\" by Orwell."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The year 1984 is gone but the portrait George Orwell gives of the control a totalitarian regime exerts on the daily life of its citizens is not. Think about the actual dictatorships regimes in North Korea, Irak and Cuba and you have an idea of the portrait given by Orwell. In 1984 the world is divided in three super-powers, each one of them exerting total control of the lives of its inhabitants via all the means avaiable, turning the lives of them into real nightmares. The mechanisms of control are the total repudiation of love and its demonstrations between human beings, the incentive to finger-pointing, specially among family members, etc... The politics is based upon a permanent state of war againt external enemies, with alliances alternating themselves almost in a mechanical way. Thus, power has to be exerted with its utmost potency. A sci-fi still valid many years after 1984 and the fall of the Iron Curtain. A real classic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is definitely a book that can generate discussion. The topics form strong and sometimes unexpected opinions. A few parts are a bit dull, such as the beginning, but the plot is quite intriguing. George Orwell utilizes superior language and I loved the way he used one example of &quot;mind control&quot; throughout the entire story and ties up loose ends with the concept. MAny different themes are all taking place at the same time, but everything associates with the main &quot;Big Brother&quot; government. I truly enjoyed reading the novel. It was a refreshing change of pace for me because I'm not normally a science fiction reader. Despite all of this, I wouldn't suggest knocking this book off in one sitting, even if you're an avid reader. It can get pretty hard to focus. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"this is a distopic tale of a bleak future under an authoritarian regime... the book raises certain questions about the direction that progress, governent power, and personal freedom are headed...I worry sometimes about these despairing glimpses into the future... were they the product of Orwell's intuition, or has this book and others like it fueled us into a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I dont usually read 'fiction' books... but this one is not really fiction ...I think you understood the main part of the story from the other reviews already...According to me, this novel really makes you think about the world we are living in ..when discussing with friends about '1984', they told me that this book represents our future ... but I have the feeling that there is already some truth in this novel ...When G.

In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show \\"Big Brother\\"), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future.

Freedom of speech has long since become something of the mythical past, people can't even fathom what it could be like.....but, just maybe someone can? Could there be an underground revoloution? And can they get away with the horrible thought: \\"Down with Big Brother\\"This book is so relevant to our world today. Power corrupts, and absoulute power corrupts absoutely.

Also good books by Orwell are Homage to Catalonia, Animal Farm, and the Road to Wigan Pier."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell is a captivating book about what could happen if a government was given too much power. What makes the story all the more interesting is the fact that it is not impossible for such a government to grow in a society that would let it. The story of Winston Smith is just the background for a chilling description of a dictatorship gone too far. The relationship between Winston and Julia tries to show that human nature does not allow a person to love someone else more than themselves. The book overall shows that all the faults we have now can someday turn us into the society in 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Among the vast titles in the dystopia genre, 1984 stands out as one of the most exceptional. In an amazing combination of followable story line and wonderfully hideous prediction of the future (well, technically, the past), George Orwell created an important commentary on the state of human nature now, and what it has the ability to become. Right from the beginning, one dives into the London of Winston Smith, and follows his daily drudgery. Through his experiences and thoughts, the reader is sucked into the individual's fight for individuality in the face of the most extreme facist oppression. Throught systems of constant war, thought control, and the censorship and redefinitions of history, the illusive Big Brother is able to control what people hear, see, and think. The world created in 1984 can chill your soul, but the struggle of Winston Smith will reaffirm your belief in humanity."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I loved this book, and couldn't put it down.

What i am saying is, if our government will deny us information and tell us about cover-ups and mistakes 40, 50 years after the fact , then who knows what's truth or lies now? Maybe our founding fathers should have made a &quot;Freedom of Knowledge&quot; amendment instead of the right to be a gun-toting maniac.

Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Every happy little socialist should read this book! Orwell takes socialism of his day to the extreme, but today his veiw is not too far away. What's the differance between Hillary Clinton and Big Brother? The mustache.---This book is an amazing picture of mankind and a warning to all the people who want to steal the freedom from the individual(socialist)."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is not merely a warning against the possible less-than-ideal communist world. It is rather a combination of denigrations against most of the common held social, political, and religious beliefs. Socialism, fascism, communism, Christianity, Zenism, and many other beliefs beyond the tether of my knowledge. All these harsh criticisms are made clear in the chapter about THE BOOK and part 3 of the whole novel. The denounciation against Christianity, for example, can be clearly seen in the later section of the book, when Winston is being tortured in Miniluv by O'Brien. The purging of the old self through repentance and a renewal of the mind and emotions, which are the ways to get in God's kingdom, are also the cores of the lessons given by O'Brien to get Winston to become a part of the Party. O'Brien also mentioned that one can not change by himself, by can with the help of the Party, or in Christianity, Jesus. These clear remarks relating to Christianity, as well as to other beliefs, are implicit throughout the novel. At the end, a conclusion is made, only democracy works. But this is not why I didn't give it a five star, the reason is that descriptions of Oceania are too awkward and peculiar. First above all, proles are still humans, sooner or later they are going to revolve against a totalitarian government. The wave of human development will break all the hinderance and thrush on; it is never possible to stop history at a moment. Also the theories of doublethink would never be practiced, how is it possible for one to be self-contradictory to a degree the he or she can both believe and not believe simultaneously? It is mentally incapable for humans. If it is possible, then doublethink can easily turn against the Party and against itself. These pedantic political ideas are fun to play with, but can never practically practiced."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When it was written in 1948, Before the Cold War, Communism was a popular idea in England. Orwell, who favored Trotsky over Stalin, faught in the Spanish Civil War and fled for his live because of Stalins rise to power. Orwell considered himself a Socialist, but he warns of socialism to the extreme. This book is a testament to mankind's willingness to forget the past."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I thought it was going to be a cheesy nostradomus-type thing, but it turned out to be a book about the rebellious nature of the human mind, as well as a testament to the number of those who do not understand those things going on around them (the proles). I've read it four times, and it never loses its impact."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When I first read 1984 I thought most of the stuff in it was absurd; the thought police, the cameras in each and every street corner and house. But as I read on, I found out that Orwell was using these as instruments to convey a much deeper message about what would become of society, and this message itself about a world that is thought controlled with no tolerance for deviation was much more important than what I considered their more absurd concepts such as the thought police. I really would suggest most people to read this book; the main protaganists Winston and Julia lead a rebellion against an unjust society that I am sure you all will find in your hearts very compelling."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Enter a world where there is no past. Where the past is the present. Follow Winston as he thinks THOUGHT- CRIME, works on fake documents, and plots to shut down the system. Big Brother's eyes follow Winston Everywhere he goes. If you want to see wether Winston accomplishes his mission, you must read the book. After you read this book go check out the 1984 Movie. But don't see the Movie unless you've read the book or else you will have no idea what is going on in the movie."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is amazing. The author manages to make you believe in this terrifying futuristic setting while at the same time makes each character real and very human. His explanations of this horrific society make them seem far too real. Even the ending, though not what you would want, you must grudgingly admit is realistic. Once you enter 1984 you will always see 1999 differently"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Even more scary when you realize that Orwell is not just talking about the potential of a totalitarian regime: he's exaggerating an already-existing reality.

But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was &quot;When will this guy shut up and tell the story???&quot; The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it.

I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time.

WHEN READING THE BOOK I SUGGEST THAT YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY AND WONT BE CONFUSED."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have just finished reading 1984 by George Orwell. On the surface it seems to be an interesting glance at the \\"future\\" that our grandparents envisioned. This however could not be farther from the truth. 1984 is in fact a lame, boring, and novel that attempts to be philosophical. I say \\"attempts\\" because any useful words of philosophy are lost or choked by the presence of Winston, the lame, spine-less main character who seems intent on boring the reader to death. Orwell attempts to make Winston likable but his acts of stupidity (i.e. trusting in a world where trust really should be earned) and lack or actions, other than sexual, make the reader hate him.However, even in the face of utter boredom and disgust, there are a few good things about this book. Number one would have to be the setting. The book is set in a \\"future\\" London. It is filled with small, aging apartments where Party members live, dark slums and alleyways for nonparty members, and large, imposing government buildings. You can almost visualize this London and replace it with the London of today. Number two would have to be that this book allows Westerners to get a feel for life under a dictatorship, such as life in Russia under Stalin and Germany under Hitler. This makes it a great book to read to understand such a life and appreciate the freedoms of democracy.In short, 1984 is nothing more than a second rate book attempting to develop profound, intelligent themes. However, these themes are lost in the monotony of the book and the reader gains only a better understanding for life under a dictatorship and appreciation for the freedoms of democracy. On a scale of 5 stars, I give this book 1 star for its attempts at philosophical content and its insights into dictatorships. It also makes a great substitute for a sleeping pill because it'll put you out like a light and is not habit forming."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George had a good idea, I'll give him that, otherwise the book fell short. Very short. For me the book took a downword turn during the time where Winston started having a love affair with some girl. This girl latter became a thought police inforcer, which surprised me none. I found the book to be a bore of a read and very predictable. My advise to all of you fair readers is to steer clear of this vile book. You will live longer because of it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Give me a break.

Oh, sure, it is well written, but people make it into so much more than it really is. It is dark, depressing, and I finished reading it feeling like less of a human than when I started. Why is it that a work of literature that is so empty and void of any meaning is considered to be one of the best? I dont understand.1984 is one of the biggest cult classic ever. The only difference is that some people say &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; is very good, and some say it is very bad. I have only heard revered praise for &quot;1984&quot;.It is innacurate, too. In &quot;1984&quot; the government influenced people's minds, taking away their free will. In reality, that is not possible. When the Soviet Union collapsed, even those born into communism helped construct a democracy. Also, in &quot;1984&quot; the party is completely invinsible. It will remain in power forever. History tells otherwise. ALL empires fall. Humanity has been war-torn since it's beginning, and after 5000 years, the world has managed to not be controlled by &quot;Big Brother&quot;.Quote from &quot;1984&quot;: &quot;Humanity is nothing more than one man shoving another man's face in the mud&quot;So, &quot;1984&quot; tells us that humans are completely useless and we have no reason to exist.Let's take a look at Orwell. When he was not homeless, he lived in poverty. None of his books sold until after he died, and &quot;1984&quot; was one of his later books. Didn't he have plenty to be hateful about?The best books make you want to be a better person. &quot;1984&quot; does nothing but make you want to stop caring about everything.&quot;1984&quot; is purely a work of fiction, but even though it is grossly unrealistic, it is treated like it was written by God.There are so many better books out there, please don't waste your time on such an unfufilling and stupid book as &quot;1984&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I recently took up the hobby of reading &quot;classics&quot; instead of teenage dramas or mysterys. 1984 was second on my list. But now I'm left wondering why is this book a classic? This book was descriptively crude with its love affair and prostitute, redundant with its thoughts and routine, and overall dull. I admit that this book did have a good message and was thoroughly enforced from the beginning to end. However, thats all that happened.It was just thoughts of a sad man with perverse and suspicouis thoughts. The main character constantly dwelled on how horrible everything was and eventually how he was going to fight against it. But never did, unless you count having an affair and writing in a journal or buying an old paperweight.At times the story would pick up, and just as quickly as it picked up it drastically fell back into the continuous complaints of Winston.1984 is well written. I guess, there were quantities of complex words tied in with a new language created within the book (Newsspeak). Keep your dictionary handy.The chararcters also lacks personality. They were so 2 deminsional.Overall it was impossibly hard to follow, and paragraphs could be skipped and you wouldnt miss a thing.Not to mention that tragic ending. No steps were made toward anything! It stops about were it left off except Winston loves BB and loves his torturor.This book was an overrated classic and a big fat FLUB!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In my World Literature class in high school, I chose to read the book 1984 as my lit. circle book. I didn't like this book very much. It was hard for me to understand, but I got through it. I also didn't like this book because it scared me a little about what the government can do right now. The book was interesting, but not the type of book I would normally pick to read. I don't recommend this book unless you like to read about \\"Big Brother\\" and the government watching you and knowing what you do."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read many reviews that consider this book a &quot;warning&quot; and seem to think that this is the direction that American society is heading. Personally, I find it a little hard to believe that the American society that so treasures its freedom of thought and actions, as well as its privacy, could ever evolve into the society described in this book. I did, however, enjoy the book and would recommend it, but not as a &quot;warning&quot;.

Mind you I find the romance in this story to be good so rate it 3 stars. Did this book introduce me to torture? I think it might have."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Upon reading 1984 I found myself questioning many things about different economic and social societies. When George Orwell wrote this, ideas of Communism were just beginning to become known and many people questioned Capitalism. This is greatly reflected in the book. However, the so-called hero of the book, Winston, wasnt really a hero at all. In the end, he was brainwashed and lost his sense of individual thought. This was to prove to &quot;evils&quot; of not having Capitalism- The biggest problem with the book was that I feel it is outdated in that it does not have as great of an impact in our society today due to the increasing rise of Capitalism and the fall of several Communist countries. It presents a very extreme idea, but not a very likely one."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book hauntingly describes the danger of the totalitarianism. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\"concentration camp\\" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.When communism and socialism oppress people's creative and force them to work for \\"common Good\\", the productivity drops automatically. Why? men were not made to work for Common good. Maybe some aliens from different planet or maybe Jesus will do for common good. But not men's nature. That's why communism make every one poorer and poorer. When men get prosperous by working hard, with their creativity, they help others if they are normal. because normal people appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace.But if the much power goes to God-haters, but seeking totalitarianistic government, you will see the corruption everywhere. Because they basically don't know, or appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace for all, they will fully manifest their selfishness and brutality. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scenes of the head members. They are not normal mind, full of hatred, and causing always divisions, manipulations Men can't govern themselves.They are very selfish, greedy and evil by nature. If any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace. That's why our America's constitution is truly great, because it was written by the God's fairness and wisdom protecting basic human rights that is originally from God . I realized only those who hate God fall into \\"deny the constitution, or change it because it's old ideas\\". Too old constitution? Then why the whole world always look upon America when it comes, most well practiced freedom and human right? Please have reasons.Collect the real historic facts, separate from the author's propaganda. Lineup the real facts, then you will see the history more accurately. Always develop the \\"reasoning power\\" of your own this way, not swayed by many false propagandas in most books out there. If you don't have your own reasoning power, you will be always vulnerable and get deceived.Interestingly always angry, poor people become the front line deceived victims of these evil ideology. So instead, ask God to enlighten your heart to live with love and peace with others and ask your personal blessing instead of trying to destroy others who seems have.If you believe somebody or some classes hurt your people, look at this. Bible says: forgive your enemy, don't live with your past: Don't covet your neighbors: work diligently on your own hands so you don't steal, become a burden to others. And lastly, love your neighbors as yourself. Then you will live in the true blessing of God, the creator. Those citizens of chines and all the other communist countries, including north korean, who are brutally oppressed in the middle Eastern Islam tyrannies still wants their human freedom with the destruction of the oppressing totalitarianistic regime still today. So why move to backward of mistakes people?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Read NO PLACE TO HIDE by Robert O'HarrowCheck it out on www.muckraker.orgHey, folks, Big Brother has arrived Big Time!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book for the first time after noting all the comparisons various friends and journalists have made between the system of government in the book and the system into which American government is evolving.But the book lacks subtlety and hits readers over the head with the details of tyranny. No doubt, Orwell writes this way to underscore the dangers of complete trust in government, but I find the plot to be so far fetched as to be unbelievable. NO form of government could ever gather the resources or achieve the efficiency needed to monitor each individual in the way the Party does. Wouldn't a more realistic cautionary tale be more effective and entertaining?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is extremely influential on the way we as a society label each other and our government with names such as \\"Big Brother\\" Orwellian and such. These names like calling someone a Nazi allow us to appear to argue but actually allow us to dodge the real issues. This is fairly ironic considering the origin of such terms. Basically 1984 is set in London in the distopian future. Orwell wrote it in response to Stalin's corrupting the ideals of Socialism. He was a socialist and so was really bothered by that failure.The plot to 1984 isn't so important as the setting. Basically the story follows Winston Smith. Smith harbors less than perfect views of his environment, for which he will one day be arrested regardless of his actions. Not loving the government (thought crime) is the only crime that is recognized. Hidden cameras and microphones are omnipresent in the city, included mandatory TVs which can't be turned off, only show a single government station and contain hidden cameras through which \\"thought police\\" may monitor what is in front of the TV at any time. Social interaction doesn't exist, since that would be considered weird and therefore criminal.There are three classes of people in London: Inner Party members, Party members like Winston and the proletariate, who aren't watched so closely because they aren't considered human. In this world Winston goes from merely not liking the government to engaging in unusual behavior. He starts by buying decorative antiques at a proletariate shop and progresses to having a girl friend, who he can only meet with in remote country side settings on account of social interaction is not allowed by the government. It is obvious to him that he will one day be taken to the Ministry of Love, a windowless building which handles law enforcement, and never fails at getting thought criminals to love the government.The novel is always dark. No happy beginning, no happy middle and no happy ending. Still it is important to read it before throwing around terms like \\"Orwellian\\" It has been so influential on society that it is required reading - if you want to pass your tenth grade English.

When I chose this book for an Independent Reading Project in my English class, mostly out of spite and interest in the title, I was brought into a world of tolatanarist leadership and of a little man struggling to find himself.I'll admit, the book itself is difficult reading, but at the same time is very descriptive and almost fortelling of an apocolyptic disaster. There is not one boring point throughout the entire book, and at every turn, someone is decieving someone else and the world is revolving again.I recommend this book to anyone who has the knowledge to comprehend stereo instructions but at the same time, fully understands them. This book is full of symbols and if you can't figure them out in the beginning, you will be lost at the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was a decent book it was written well, there was times when I did not want to put down the book becuase it had some interesting parts in it. But the down side is that I thought that these were to few and far inbetween becuase it was kinda of slow paced and I would lose interest and want to do something else. I found myself forcing myself to read it (becuase I had to for school) rather than read for enjoyment. another negative about the book is that 1984 has pasted and it was nothing like this and it just kind of ruins it for me I would have given this book a 4-5 stars if I had read it sometime between 1950-1965 which I bet was a very good book back then.

Big Brother is watching."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's view of the world in 1984 is amazing, capturing thedeception and reality that exists around us. This foresight from the1950s into the future is great because its accuracy is undeniable. The life of Winston Smith, as well as his interaction with society, can be directly related to the current day.Winston unknowingly is under the watchful eye of Big Brother, who has telescreens and informants everywhere to note Winston's actions. With today's video cameras and listening devices, this fiction becomes reality. The Thought Police are comparable to communist governments and the media, trying to conform people to their standards and/or ideas. Love is also restricted, like the love Winston has for Julia. A person can no longer carry on a simple relationship without intervention from outside sources.The novel was truly ahead of its time, and may still hold true for future generations. The primary reason \\"1984\\" remains popular is because it can still be applied to the world today. Orwell has written a marvelous story of the past, present, and future, allowing us to all live the life of the oppressed Winston Smith and see reality for ourselves."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1) Read Erich Fromm's afterward.2) Don't imply that 1984 was somehow meant to be a prediction for the state of the real world in 1984.

Following these rules, there would be about 50 reviews left and maybe a person would have time to read them all!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Written in the late forties, Orwell's 1984 is clearly a product of its time; a time when the advent and eventual use of the atom bomb threatened the end of civilization. I admire Orwell for the amount of thought and imagination he must have put into the development of this book. It is an example of how a powerful imagination can teeter between extremes of pure optimism and, in this case, paranoia. In 1984, Orwell's vision of the future is grim: war is constant; freedom, as we know it, is an ancient and outdated concept; and love, for anything but government, is perverse. Winston, the book's protagonist, struggles with a lost sense of self and his fear of a government (the Party) that punishes the pursuit of individual fulfillment. Most disturbing is that, in the end, rather than die as a martyr, he embraces his oppressive government fully aware his capitulation will precipitate his own death.Orwell's commentary on the evolution of totalitarianism is profound. Orwell asserts that post-Neolithic governments, with the benefit of written history, were, over time, able to reduce the threat of overthrow using lessons learned by fallen predecessors. Orwell argues that throughout history people have been divided among high, middle and lower classes; and that, with the advancement of successive governments, the intent of the higher class to maintain power over the lower classes has become less explicit. This has left the lower classes less inclined to revolt. In 1984, the proletariat is under the illusion that their government represents their interest. The Party fosters this illusion, in part, by constantly \\"updating\\" any record of the past. As a result, people are unaware of how terrible their lives are relative to the lives of those who lived before them.Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible. It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it.Orwell's prose is not noticeably good or bad. The book's strength is in its power to make people think."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What can I say \\"IT ORWELL\\" the master, funny how right he was and how Obama and Harper are exactly what he warned us about. Every human needs to read 1984 especially now with the totalitarian rule threating every Western Society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"After reading a few of the earlier reviews here I can see, sadly, that Big Brother is winning the war against the Individual and against Democracy. When seventeen year olds, \\"DON'T GET IT\\", it is clear that the propaganda and \\"education\\" that America and other \\"slowly turning fascist\\" nations are are being hypnotized with are hitting their mark and accomplishing their goals.Anyone who can read Orwell's call to action and put it down with a yawn is already dead! Their friends and family should bury them and shrug. Imagine channel surfing when Paul Revere announced that the Redcoats were coming?! Orwell has made his announcement. It's up to us to heed the call or be dominated and subjugated by a government no longer of, for or by \\"the people\\" but rather owned and operated by Big Money, Big Business and Big Brother.1984 has accurately predicted the state that we live in where we are being told by our? own government that there are threats around every corner, so watch out. Be afraid! Be very afraid! BEWARE! CONDITION ORANGE! CONDITION RED? THE TERRORISTS ARE COMING, THE TERRORISTS ARE COMING! LOCK YOUR DOORS AND HOARD DUCT TAPE AND WATER.I am acutely aware that terrorism is a reality. It has been all through history. But how many times now have we been \\"warned\\" that a terrorist attack is being brewed? How many times have we been put on \\"CONDITION ORANGE\\"? But no attack follows and no follow up announcement that the \\"imminent attack\\" was prevented!Where are all these terrorists that planned these imminent attacks? I would expect to see their faces on CNN every night.This is exactly Big Brother's STRATEGY. It keeps people in a constant state of low level anxiety expecting a bomb to be dropped on our heads any second! But no terrorist are found under our beds. Just what does it accomplish to announce these \\"alerts\\" via Big Brother's Big Screen and color coded DANGER LEVEL lights?Does he expect citizens to do something about it? Can citizens stop terrorism if we \\"expect\\" it to occur at any minute? Are we being given guns to protect ourselves and metal detectors to check out the bags of the \\"suspicious looking dark man\\" next to us on the train?How does this work? Just what does our \\"National Homeland\\" Czar expect us to do other than worry, kneel and grovel to the Big Brother in the sky?Are we taking classes or receiving instruction about how to identify and thwart terrorists and \\"suspicious\\" activity? Or are we just being made anxious and paranoid in the obvious (at least to some of us) attempt to get the masses to empty their pockets of even more tax dollars and to give up our few remaining Democratic rights of a FREE COUNTRY? So that Big Brother can \\"better protect us?\\" Please!For the reviewers that can't understand this book I say: MORE'S THE PITY! You are ripe for the picking. All King Bill, George and John have to say to you is give us more money and all your remaining HARD-EARNED-BY-THE-BLOOD-OF-BRAVE-AMERICANS\\" RIGHTS, and we will keep you safe from the big bad terrorist boogie man! Yeah, right. Like they kept us safe in Oklahoma City and New York!THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD IS THE INSIDE OF A PRISON CELL!This is where our great leaders really want us all to be. Not an actuall prison cell but a controlled society with ID stamped into our flesh and eternal fear pressed into our souls.GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS, MY YOUNG FRIEND AND READ THE BOOK AGAIN. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING ORWELL AND BECOMING A REAL AMERICAN.Orwell's classic 1984 is, very simply, true. Many believe that it was a prediction of what our world would be like in 1984 (it was written in 1951). It was not a prediction but rather an analogy to the world of Orwell's time. He was ALREADY LIVING IN 1984.Most people cannot (or will not) see that our world is already controlled by BIG BROTHER. It is sad, scary but true. In 1984 Orwell shows the governments of the world scaring their own population. Well, America does the same thing! So does any country that wishes to extract huge taxes from its population to support \\"needed\\" war machines. Now that the Soviet \\"threat\\" is gone, America needed a new one. Enter: TERRORISM.But if the reader cares to do a bit of research he or she will find that American militarists have been suggesting that the American military and CIA conduct terror against ITS OWN POPULATION for many years now. During the Cuban \\"threat\\" the pentagon asked Kennedy to allow it to blow up an American ship killing Americans! He declined.Are we SURE who was responsible for 9/11? No one has taken credit for it. Why? All terror groups IMMEDIATELY TAKE CREDIT FOR THIER WORK when they pull something off. Why wouldn't the Taliban or Al Quaida jump at the chance of taking credit for the greatest example of terrorism in America? The only LOGICAL explanation is because they didn't do it!I'm not saying that American militarists did it. Maybe it was a country that stood to gain from having America go after those \\"crazy Moslems.\\" Israel? How about Israel and America? Who knows? But there is no EVIDENCE of who actually did it and more important WHY.You can sit back and take the easy explanation spoon fed to you from corporate owned media with its own agenda. Or you can read and understand 1984 and start thinking beyond the \\"obvious.\\" If you want to read a book that picks up where 1984 leaves off try HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. Yes, I wrote it but that is no reason not to read it. Everyone advertises his or her own books. I simply offer it because, like Orwell, I want people to know what is really going on and why.Read between the lines when you read American \\"news.\\" Better yet listen to news broadcasts from other counties. It's not a matter of writing outright lies as much as OMITTING details and SKEWING various parts of stories.Orwell gives you the tools to begin to think for yourself. If it's too much work or too scary, then just put your faith in your president. He would never lie to you, would he? Like his Daddy said, just \\"read my lips.\\" Oh, that's right. What he was referring to turned out to be a lie and he DID RAISE TAXES after all! Oh, well. At least you can trust Orwell.Joseph Francione [author of HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD]"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read george orwells book 1984. I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"By giving it 2 stars I'm not saying the book had no affect on me, 2 stars means it's ok, now my review.When I read Animal Farm by George Orwell, I was blown away, it was a great book, with such a great meaning behind it. So when I decided to read 1984, I was hoping it'd be better, but when I started reading it, I almost fell asleep. It is said to have a warning for Governments behind it, and I guess in 1943 it did, but in the year 2000, I dont think it warns anyone. He was trying to say, that when a government or anyone tries for a Utopia(perfect place) that it falls in on them, and can never work out. Just like The Giver, by Lois Lowry, that book was very good, where a boy grows up in a town where it's all black and white, and people ride bikes everywhere. The people ride bikes so there is no pollution, and also because they dont leave their little town, it blew me away, and maybe you should read it, if you already haven't.But as for 1984 I dont know, I guess I was expecting too much, and didn't get what I was hoping for.Jesse"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a classic. any aducated man and woman in the western world should at least here about it. George Orwell was a major political writer in the 20th century, his novels read by millions.However, 1984 os not by any means a good read. Its plot is incredibly weak, shallow and unitresting- but its not a story we wanted to read, its an opinion we expacted to learn.and you will learn- Orwell leaves no way for you, the reader, not to understand his point. Its annoying. evreything, evrey single metaphore, or situation, or element of the book is epxplained throughly and lengthly. nothing is lrft for the reader to figure out by himself. at times, the didactive tones of the book make it feel more like an elborate sort of lecture than an actual novle. the way things work in the book is radical, the point of view incredibly one sided and narrow, the conclusions unsurprising. overall, while the book has potential, Orwell's insistance on using it as nothing more than a conduit to pass his ideas through makes it a tedious read. on top of evreything, what little story we get is full of plotholes and pushd my way over the cliffs of my suspense of disbelief."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the first time I have ordered a book online and was a little hesitant due to time restraints. My daughter needed George Orwell's 1984 for school and being unable to find it in a local bookstore, we tried ordering it off the internet.

The book arrived in 3 days in new condition and saved the day!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think 1984 is not very interesting. The words are difficult. I had no clue what was really going on. It would be less boring if it was shorter and broken down so it would be easier to understand. You might like this book if you are interested in predicting the future and you can read lots of difficult words and know what they mean. Keep your dictionary close!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I can understand that maybe in the wake of Nazism and under the continuation of Stalinism, the message of this book might have seemed more relevant than it in fact is. Looking past that overplayed message, though, it's difficult to detect the kind of substance, complexity of theme and depth of character which ought to make a classic. The writing is decent, but it's time to stop touting it as something everyone should read. There's no need whatsoever to read it; get the three-sentence summary from someone who has: \\"This novel is about a totalitarian state. The abstract totalitarian authority figure is called 'big brother.' Totalitarianism is bad.\\" But it's not as though that message needs to get spread around these days.As a seperate criticism, never minding that the message it obvious, it has quite a few weaknesses. Presenting the top five reasons why the scenario in this book would never, ever come about:5) This is the English we're talking about, and they don't put up with much. I mean, they're too cool for a constitution; they've got by so far on _common law_. They've had totalitarian rulers, and when they got to be too much of a load to bear, they were beheaded.4) If children were responsible for detecting unpariotic leanings in their parents, given the usual state of parent-child relations, the secret police would recieve upwards of six thousand false reports a day, and the department would collapse.3) Aesthetics. People would complain of sexism and demand a 'big sister.' As ideals of beauty changed and people decided that Big Brother's omnipresent facade was unnatractive (too fat, maybe) they would lose all respect for him.2) Corruption. The evil in this book is some sort of abstract, monolithic thing, but there are concievably real people behind it. Give a group of real people control of the hearts and minds of a country, and it won't be long before there's only one of them. He will eventually die. Chaos will follow.1) Inefficiency. \\"Johnson, the spy camera in living unit 3J07 has been offline for six weeks; I thought you were going to take a look at it.\\" \\"I ordered the parts, sir; I don't know what went wrong. It's not my fault.\\" \\"Fleming, have you recieved an order for spy camera parts?\\" \\"It's difficult to say, sir. Not my department. You'll have to talk to Roberts, and he just left on vacation.\\"If you want proof, just look at how quickly Nazism (and even Stalinism, though it was more persistent) fell apart. No pure system can survive for long."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the 'textbook' of today's Democratic party under the spotlight, where they declare the 'days of peace' under the previous Administration, when in fact we were involved in far more conflicts across the globe than we are today as revealed in a recent report by a University of British Columbia research group. To Democrats, lies are truth and truth are lies. Conclusion: \\"War is Peace\\".The premise that \\"Freedom is Slavery\\" is paramount in the way the Democrats portray their ideology as one that will ensure greater freedom, when in fact their self serving means to demand more and more dependency upon Government and demonizing independence is contrary to achieving the American dream. This 'entitlement' mentality underscores the results of this practice as it serves to remove incentive so we can all live in some socialist 'utopia'; an oxymoron at that. If anyone subscribes to the old adage of \\"money is power\\", then one would have to wonder if the Democrats are always finding ways to increase taxes, rules and regulations that expands the very control by government rather than people, it should become very apparent as to their 'doublespeak' rhetoric when they denounce economic growth policies such as 'tax cuts' by taking that 'money', i.e. power away from the people.\\"Ignorance is Strength\\"; is a platform of conformity which has displayed profound and destructive results from our failing educational system where students are more proficient with condom usage and having 'great self esteem' without any real defined successes, yet are deficient on the basics that lay the foundations for success in the real world, reading, writing and arithmetic.George Orwell laid out a myriad of 'totalitarian' truths that have been played out in parts in the history of Communist and in a lesser part Socialist led nations to the enslavement of it's citizens. These actions are continually expanded by today's Democrats when they use their ever divisive nature to separate out 'new' groups to exploit and demand special rights or status thus fulfilling their 'divide and conquer' goals. For what benefit does it serve to a nation when a group sets out to 'hyphenate' Americans by ethnicity, class or even gender and to a greater extent a 'melting pot' nation speaking one language, english, but rather an ever increasing unintelligible nation with the expansion of 'multi' language groups within that one nation other than to divide in the end?This should be required reading along with our Constitution for everyone so they can get a picture of where this nation is going if left to the Democrats insatiable desire for power 'over' the people, rather than 'to' the people. Self determination; or slavery; you must decide."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"like all the dunderheads that are falling over themselves to fellate Orwell and his hackneyed take on a negative utopia.

The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I really enjoyed this book. But I will explain my three star review instead of 5 star later in the review. The book has excellent characterization and theme. The main character Winston is fighting big brother ie; big government. This is a nameless, faceless power structure who controls things through double think; holding two contradictory premises as being true and newspeak and other illogical and insane techniques. When I read the book through, it seemed to describe some of the methods currently being used in the real world. In the introduction, the editor claimed that the book is about power politics. This book though should not have been published. There are people now who use the techniques in this book, whether they admit it or not. For instance, before this book was published, you could start at the bottom of the ladder in a job, work hard and go to the top of the corporate ladder. Now, you have the use of double think in job situations. They tell you that to get a job you have to have prior experience. But how do you get that, if no one hires you? So it goes. The entertainment business is a prime example of double think. To get anywhere you need an agent, but an agent will tell you to get experience. Ayn Rand would have had a field day with Orwells book. The fact is truth is eternal, and the war against it as in Orwells book is bound to fail."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orewll's 1984 is truly captivating however extremely disturbing. It's a story about a cold heartless society and the eradication of, by our standards, the normal human.With it's first copyright in 1949 it's written as an extremely pessimistic view of the future. The novel examines a socialist empire and the way they can control mankind, the future, and the past.The book revolves around a middle aged, middle class, although extremely intelligent man. Winston Smith works as part of the government changing the past. He is constantly watched and allowed no emotions other than hate and fear. The party controls every aspect of life.Winston can vaguely remember his childhood before Big Brother and the Party began controlling everything. He still maintains early 20th century morals and ideals of what life should be about. The book covers his rebellion against the party.1984 is well written for the most part, however there are some parts that you have to fight to get through. For example at one point Winston obtains an anti party book, Orwell then goes into long chapters that are excerpts from this \\"book.\\" These are long dry passages, that contain information that has already been reveled to the reader through indirect methods.Overall I think that this book is a good book to read.

There are two problems with this argument. First of all, I am sorry to inform you that Democrats are closer to Socialists than Republicans are!

What makes this dystopia stand out is the importance it puts on language & how those who want to manipulate a cultural mangle their language against them.Ungood : Keep in mind I mostly enjoyed the book & think there is a lot of food for thought contained in it. The aspect that disagreed with the most was the relationship between Winston & Julia not at first & not in the end but in the middle.Spoiler Alert : Up till Winston & Julia sneak away into the woods I loved the book. After their conversation in the woods I almost put the book down because of how much it alienated me & I lost interest in the characters & author. Based on the conversation in the woods, I felt if this was their perspective about love then I felt there was nothing for me to learn or enjoy by sticking around. Luckily I hung around because of how much I enjoyed the book up to that point & was willing to give the story another chance.Here's the issue. Julia first contacts Winston by writing to him that she loves him, indicating that she had special feelings towards him. In the woods Winston wants Julia to admit that she just likes having sex for the sake of having sex & the more people she's done it with the better. Winston didn't want Julia to just want to want him, but to want men in general. Winston's speech may have been intended to get people to shake their heads in agreement but instead it made me dislike him for the first & only time in the book. It doesn't even make sense in the context of the story why would Julia tell Winston I love you & have since I first saw your face if she really is just wanting anything & anyone to have sex with. The motivation isn't there. If all she wanted was, sex why not just go with the willing upper party members she mentioned she knew would comply. I say that, in rebuttal to people who may argue she picked Winston because she may have guessed he'd up for it unlike people who were less likely to break the rules. Aside from it not making sense in the story I also had a difficult time relating to that sensibility or lack-there of. In the story's defense, it does seem like Winston grows found of Julia in particular & that he acknowledges they have a special relationship, & may have seen his comments in the woods as shallow or nave. Perhaps the story could have been improved if Winston later on reflected back to that conversation; whether or not he still agreed with his declarations, the more he get know Julia. Who knows, maybe I'm the only one who was so bothered by it. There is saying if you tried to love one woman solely, you've loved them all, & if you have tried to love all women collectively, you have loved none.Here's the issue.

His fantastic view on the year 1984 from his socialist based political opinion in 1949 is one of the most creative stories ever told. 1984 tells of the \\"utopian\\" society Oceana (present day England and the Americas), in which productivity is forbidden and intelligent thinking is dangerous. In this super-power dominated by the Party and held back from progression by continuous war, Oceana's leader Big Brother is always watching every move you make. The story follows the journey of Winston, a Party member that begins to have his own negative opinion on Ingsoc, or English socialism. The reader is absorbed in Winston's life of dangerous individual thought, his forbidden affair, and his ever-evolving view on the oppressions of Big Brother.

It was definitely long overdue that I read this, and I am glad I did. Along with Animal Farm, this is considered his most noteworthy book. It is a scathing attack on authoritarian thinking and government, in which the reader is put in the middle of a bizarre and horrible totalitarian state. This is not a pleasure read, that is for sure. Orwell had a point to make, and he made it in a dark and doomy fashion. It was his last book; he may have been feeling a little harsh from the tuberculosis that would kill him in 1950. One can certainly appreciate the anger that Orwell, formerly an idealistic young leftist, felt toward Stalin's USSR and the Third Reich. In this book he draws on those states to create a state so tolatarian that it dominates every aspect of human life. Probably the closes thing to it today is North Korea.A mid'level propaganda functionary, Winston Smith, is the everyman thru whom we experience Oceania, one of the 3 states left in the world, along with Eurasia and Eastasia, who are also totalitarian. He works eliminating inconvenient stories and words from the archives when the word comes down from above. For in Big Brother's Oceania, the past and language itself must be sanitized. Winston is starting to go a little bonkers, and he begins to rebel in very minor ways. It does not take much - there are Thought Police out there trying to catch those who are showing any sign of rebellion. Although the book sticks to Winston so closely that the POV is limited third person, his life and character are not really that significant. What really matters is the description of the political world that the characters inhabit. Orwell outlines the structures of Oceanian society - the four main ministries, the party and its members, the proles that make up the majority of the population. He describes Newspeak, a strangely computerized version of English in which unnecessary and undesirable words are being progressively eliminated. It is a world in which anybody could be a spy and almost anybody could be guilty of some sort of infraction and eliminated.The only thing that matters is power, says the party boss who busts Winston and tortures him, and the individual is nothing. All that exists is the glory of the state and the party. Orwell throws me for a loop here by (unintentionally, I think) incorporating aspects of Buddhist philosophy into the reasons for totalitarianism. This is a very dark vision, and I find myself wondering why it is still considered so powerful and relevant. The kind of government being attacked here has been discredited all over the world, yet the book seems to really stay in people's minds. Perhaps its popularity is due to its being read by so many high school students. By depicting a nightmarish inversal of of the Western way of life, 1984 serves as an affirmation of that way of life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book the first time if I remember right in the late 80s. Its still as great, and scary, as I remember it being. More or less you can combine 1984, Huxleys Brave New World, and Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail and you have a slightly exagerrated version of the world we live in now. Personally I believe that this book only partially came from Orwells imagination. He was involved in political movements to the point where he went to Spain and fought in the Spanish civil war, went to elitist Universities in England and wrote war time propaganda for the BBC so he had a view of the inside of elites and how they operate. Its such the cliche to say it but I believe this book was written as a warning."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There should be no doubt Orwell's \\"1984\\" is the gold standard for dystopian novels. It's about a Totalitarian society that exists in the future from when it was originally published in 1949 (certainly in our future as well). It's popularly believed the inspiration for \\"1984\\" came from Yevgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\", first published in 1924, and there are similarities. Also, the suggestion, by others, that it's the direction that current politics are leading the U.S. is no doubt contributing to the story's renewed popularity. No matter the reasons, this story is frightening and depressing, but also a testament to the survivability of the human spirit. Prepare yourself though, \\"1984\\" will, without question, provide you a terrifying glimpse in a world bereft of personal freedom.I'd forgo the foreword by Thomas Pynchon though. Read it, if you must, after you finish reading \\"1984\\"."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Why do we continue to read \\"1984\\"? It's a gloomy story, with long segments of political and social theory. The characters show few really heroic or admirable qualities; love is replaced by sex, sex is replaced by duty. Good does not triumph over evil and there is no happy ending. You close the book instead with a sense of futility and hopelessness.Why do we continue to read \\"1984\\"? Because it serves as a warning - a reminder that we must resist when the state squelches conscience and replaces it with authority. A reminder of just how much good there is in the world, and what it means to think and to be human - and how empty the world would be if it all disappeared. And it's a warning that there is a point of no return, after which it is too late to look for change.Let's keep reading \\"1984\\". Once it loses its entertainment value because it seems too much like real life, it will already be too late."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The year was 1974 and I was a twelve year old Puerto Rican boy living in The Bronx where I would often see some of the older kids carrying this book around as part of their class reading assignment. I was immediately fascinated by the title. There was nothing particularly spectacular about the book's appearance, merely the numbers 1984 in a font that was rather friendly looking with only the tiny black silhouette of a running man printed along the spine indicating only the vaguest hints of what was written within.I had recently discovered science fiction and my interest was piqued by a title set that far into the future (to a twelve year old boy anyway) and I reasoned that it must surely have been a science fiction novel and evidently a good one I reasoned since it was an assigned book in school.Those were the days before we had VCR's (never mind DVDs and playable computer files) and as a twelve year old growing up in the Big Apple in that era I was pretty much at the mercy of adults as to what movies I saw and the few TV stations we had back then in regards to what science fiction they saw fit to broadcast. Since Star Wars and Alien were three and five years into the future you can imagine that there was a dearth of science fiction, most especially good science fiction. At that time I had only caught glimpses of 2001: A Space Odyssey at very inconvenient moments.Anyway I could not wait for it to be assigned to me, if at all (that year I got Shane instead) so on one of my many visits to my aunt across town I went around the corner from her apartment to The Grand Concourse where there was a tiny mom and pop book store (this was before the rise of mega bookstores as well) that kept a pretty good selection of sci-fi. To my surprise there were a couple of copies of 1984 not in the Sci-fi section but in the literature section and a few more in the classics section. Well excuse me.Remember that this was before Star Wars so my view of science fiction was not limited to space operas, in fact I was completely unaware of that kind of science fiction with the possible exception, later on, of Dune. The first science fiction book I ever read was Philip K Dick's The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, a great book but quite possibly the worst book you could choose to introduce a 10 - 11 year old to sci-fi, but the point is that I was not nave enough to have any expectation of ray guns and the like. Anyway I read the synopsis on the back and for a moment I almost considered not spending my allowance on it but I went ahead anyway.By the time I finished this book I was not the same person I was when I started it.To this day there is no doubt in my mind that the course I was on in life prior to reading 1984 was no longer the course I found myself on after reading it. I was still a twelve year old boy with all the concerns of all twelve year old boys at the time (toys, summer fun and increasingly girls, who started becoming more interesting to me) but suddenly all of the real world concerns that I was largely shielded from became part of my conscious landscape and I began to experience a burgeoning appreciation of the apprehension the adults around me felt during times of national or world crises.George Orwell painted a picture of a world so horrific, so utterly devoid of hope (unless you reckon differently by considering the appendix as part of the story) and yet so seemingly plausible that its impact in the world of politics as well as the inclusion of phrases such as \\"Orwellian\\", \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"Double Think\\" into the lexicon should come as no surprise.While it is true that ideology of the state described in 1984 is labeled INGSOC \\"English Socialism\\" one should keep in mind that George Orwell was a Social Democrat and references are made in 1984 to some past betrayal, via the incoherent ramblings of a background character, that may be taken as a suggestion by Orwell as the primary reason as to why the state exists as rendered in 1984. I mention this lest one may assume that George Orwell may have viewed Socialism as inherently flawed for I truly believe he made the adopted ideology of the state in 1984 his own so that readers could not construe it as an attack on any particular ideology.I make this case not as a socialist or communist for I am not either, but rather to assure those readers that may find themselves avoiding this book because they fear that it may be a distortion and attack on their own political ideology. Rest assured that this novel is less a treatise on the evils of any particular ideology and more of an expose on the extreme measures undertaken by a totalitarian state to subject its citizen to whatever means are necessary to totally bend them to its collective will, right up to the point of not just breaking an individual's will but to the point of inverting it as well.What is key here, in spite of the compelling main story of a doomed and forbidden sexual affair, is the exhibition of engineered and finely tuned misery via endless war deliberately waged, not for the purposes of destroying a factual or imagined enemy, but rather for the dual purpose of wasting resources to keep the population in abject poverty and also to instill (or at least to coerce the appearance of) strong feelings of patriotism via nationalism which of course makes a foreign enemy necessary.Orwell also deftly illustrates that a dystopia of this kind cannot rely solely on a foreign enemy to maintain its Iron grip on the populous as this does not allow sufficient reason for the state to wage war against those citizens who would question it and undermine its authority. A common domestic enemy is also necessary; one that may actually be in league with the various foreign and interchangeable enemies and who, by virtue of their proximity within the state, are also in a position to sabotage the country's war efforts by the use of terrorist's tactics or by fomenting the rot of rebellion from within.Some citizens might actually suppose that they could benefit from losing the war, surely life could not be worse than it already is and they may consider taking their chances with an enemy invader; enter Emmanuel Goldstein the big domestic terrorist boogeyman who is largely an invention of the state and therefore a tool to entrap \\"thought criminals\\" as well as serving, along with his anonymous followers, as a focal point for patriotic rage the expression of which is mandated by a necessarily public ritual called the \\"two minutes hate\\".Orwell creates (in his fictitious state of Oceana) an endless logic loop in which the state relies on notions of patriotism and in which all citizens without thinking feel the need to protect their now antiquated notions of the nationhood (as opposed to the state). This is in spite of the fact that the state has drifted far from when such patriotism or any sense of duty to country actually made sense. As it is there is no real escape, for Oceana's deadly \\"enemies\\" Eurasia and Eastasia are similarly governed, indeed they cannot exist as is without each other.1984 is a world of near constant and near inescapable surveillance even within the confines of one's home. What is being attempted here however is not necessarily the documentation of any activity you or I would consider a crime for the purposes of prosecution but rather an attempt to discern any possible hint that the citizen may be committing a \\"thought crime\\", that is harboring any negative feelings toward the state or its titular head \\"Big Brother\\", for the purposes of \\"correcting\\" the citizen as the state cannot allow dissidents or martyrs.It is a world in which parents fear their children who are the primary agents of the state responsible for the capture of more thought criminals than any state agency.It is also a world in which there is an active state program laboring to narrow the range of thought by reducing the English language year by year to the final aim of a converting it to some sort of rudimentary drone-speak. Why have the word \\"bad\\" when \\"good\\" already implies its opposite and the word \\"un-good\\" will suffice? Why stop there? There would eventually be no need for phrases such as \\"great\\", \\"marvelous\\" or \\"fantastic\\" or any variation of such when one can merely say \\"good\\" \\"plus good\\" and \\"double plus good\\". The reasoning is that if you strip language down to its most elementary stage, stopping just short of interfering with society's ability to function you can do away with entire concepts such as freedom and civil rights.In Orwell's nightmare sex for pleasure is a punishable crime not for any of the usual reasons of morality but because the state wants you to channel all your energies toward being a productive citizen of the state for the sake of the state.In 1984 society has been dived into three classes.1. The poor, or \\"Proles\\" who are deliberately kept dumb and poor rendering them incapable of rising above their station and yet are largely left alone so as to enjoy the baser joys of life such as pornography strictly as a means of mollifying them. All of which combines to make them incapable of rebellion.2. The ruling class or \\"Inner Party\\" who remain un-incentivized to enact any changes not just out of fear of reprisals by their fellow inner party members via the state but also out of fear of losing the few petty privileges they enjoy.3. And finally the middle class or \\"Outer Party\\" relegated to actually carrying out the will of the state thereby bearing witness to all the lies and totalitarian tactics employed by the state which ironically makes them the primary targets of the \\"miniluv\\" or the \\"Ministry Of Love\\" that is responsible for law enforcement which in this book means oppressing, torturing and \\"re-educating\\" those Outer Party members accused of thought crime.Essentially 1984 presents a juggernaut state that has become unmoored from whatever benign ideals once berthed it and has drifted off beyond site of a reassuring oasis-like coastline. A state in which its inhabitants no longer strive to achieve their original goals be they based on economical, religious or political ideals and have allowed the state to become a living entity in itself with the destruction of the human spirit as its sole aim.Much is made about the last four words in 1984 but for me the most horrific line in the entire book is Obrien's revelation to Winston Smith as to what is in store for humanity.\\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- forever.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So what can I say about this book that hasn't been said before? Having read it I can see how it has become regarded as classic fiction. Of course the year 1984 has come and gone and many folks say had it been titled \\"2009\\" it would have been much more accurate. I chose this book because my son had to read it for school (I was never assigned this one myself) but I always felt I \\"should\\" read it. So I have now.For those of you who haven't read it, it is a complex novel but with a fairly basic plot. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a functioning member of a society in the future who meets a woman he is attracted to. Much of the book surrounds their attempt to form a relationship in this society that just won't allow that sort of thing. Of course the real point and value of the novel is to illustrate where our current society may be headed if we don't change course, a sort of anti-utopian (dystopian?) novel. This book has brought us common terms such as \\"Big Brother\\", \\"doublethink\\", and \\"thought police.\\" There are long sections where Winston reads to his girl friend from the official government manual detailing how the society came to be as well as the evolution of the government-speak (\\"Newspeak\\")language. I am glad that I've read this novel but at the same time I can't say that I would ever want to read it again. My political/societal views are already pretty much cemented in place and this book, while thought provoking, did not change my views. I do agree that it should be studied at the High School level though, not only for its value to the world of literature but also as a way to kick start young people's thinking on what a society should and shouldn't be."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Only four years after his critically acclaimed Animal Farm, George Orwell came back with another masterpiece in the form of Nineteen Eighty Four. Orwell, a British author, is known for his hatred and disgust towards a totalitarian society and social injustice. This novel clearly demonstrates the impurities and chaos that are brought about by such a dystopian society.The story follows the life of Winston Smith, a state worker who has much secret hatred towards the \\"Big Brother Society.\\" In the world in which he lives, citizens are forced to follow the strict rules of the society. Their state, Oceania, is constantly monitored by the government and by Big Brother, their \\"great\\" ruler. In this totalitarian state, the ruler controls all of the actions of his people and even their minds. He does much of this through propaganda and slogans such as the now famous, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" (3). The rulers also are trying to dispose of all unneeded words in order to get rid of all unorthodox thought. Winston Smith is one of the very few who secretly rejects the society and its laws. He believes that he should live his life in a more free way because the end of his life is approaching soon. As a result, Winston has a surreptitious, illegal relationship with a co-worker, Julia. This is a large step for Winston because he knows what he is doing is a great offense, but he does feel very comfortable and safe when he is with her. For example, he states \\"...as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them\\" (152). Winston's life goes from good to horrible very quickly, and he is forced to live out the rest of his existence in physical and emotional pain.The novel mocks the greed, selfishness, and utter craziness that an unstable government can cause if poorly run. Orwell shows through the odd and hectic life of Winston Smith. He grabs the reader's attention with Winston's secretive and mischievous acts. He describes the instability and corruption of a government at its worst. With Oceania being contently at war, one can recognize that the governments are constantly corrupt and the concept of having this \\"Big Brother\\" always watching over the citizens illustrates how the government has an unreasonable belief that citizens will rebel. After reading George Orwell's masterpiece, I believe that \\"Big Brother\\" culture is not as far fetched as I originally judged. Orwell's story completely changed the way I look at how a government can be run and makes me rethink how our country is being run now. Just a few bad decisions can cause chaos."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryAnd Big Brother is watchingThese are the slogans that the people in George Orwell's book, 1984. George Orwell does a great job of telling the story of Winston Smith's life and how he goes through life rebelling against the government. He describes every setting with emence detail and it felt like I was right there with Winston going through his every day struggles to survive and remain in his eyes sane. The way Orwell conveyed the story through the diary as well as just writing it really worked well. The diary tells about Winston\`s character and how he reacts to life around him. I believe that when writing this story George Orwell wrote a book that is a great success.As a high school student I enjoyed 1984. It challenged me to think outside of the box and more critically. To say that War is Peace and Freedom is Slavery and actually believe it causes one to question the meaning of certain things. In our world war is not peace and slavery is the opposite of freedom, so what could have led people to believe and just accept that these things are true. That is what 1984 truly explains, that humans can become brain washed into believing almost anything. The scary part about this is that it actually can happen as shown in the book through a series of torture and reeducating Winston was reformed into one who believed in what the Republic of Oceania believed. With propaganda, the party ruling over the people in 1984 can shape the minds of jst about anyone.In conclusion, 1984 is a well written, suspenseful story of a man who becomes the same as everone else. There is no room for individuality in the setting created by George Orwell. Everyone believes the same or are arrested and reformed!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell depicts a vivid portrayal of the ills of a totalitarian regime - even the consequences of government overreach in general. His society is the most extreme one imaginable created by a government with absolute power. While painting his picture of a dystopian world, Orwell links us into Winston Smith, the main character, an everyman who the reader is able to identify with. He is someone like us - an outsider in this totalitarian world, who is unable to completely submit his mind and will to Big Brother (the State). We are able to experience the absolute control of the government through Winston's eyes - its physical and psychological control of its subjects, to Winston's expanding discontent, his rebellious acts and finally their destined consequences.Under this veil, Orwell demonstrates how weak and frail a totalitarian regime truly is. In order to control its subjects, Big Brother has to have absolute control of information - to even alter the past, to constantly control minds through propaganda, to create constant war to keep the society poor, and to use fear mongering (i.e. encouraging kids to rat out their parents to the thought police) to force its will on the people. It even uses language as mind control - whittling language away to limit thoughts and expressions. Ultimately, Big Brother is only able to force Winston to submit by torturing and brainwashing him into an empty shell like the rest of its subjects.This book is great for the high school reader and beyond - it is an easy read while allowing the reader to consider the implications of living in such a society. Its endurance is also impressive - this book was originally published in 1949 - the same work could be published today and be just as relevant."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am a big fan of science fiction. This book might be classified as such, as it was written to be set in the future when George Orwell published it in 1949. But as time passes, this book is showing itself to not be so much of a story as it is a warning. There are already so many phrases from the book that we use, like Big Brother or Newspeak. And the way some governments are now does not bode well. This is a classic novel that more people should read as a warning, so that we can avoid this kind of dystopia."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith, member of the Outer Party, a small, petty cog in the great machination of \\"Big Brother\\", tries to step out from the shadow of his life in George Orwell's now masterpiece, \\"1984\\". Written over 50 years ago, this book was to serve several purposes, one being a warning to the present that a future like this, however fantastic and unbelievable, could be in the making should we allow for it to happen.Winston leads the dull life of a worker, not encouraged to think, or dream, for feel for himself. His whole life must be driven to support the Party, which promulgates an apparent non-entity Big Brother as the supreme one. Winston early on shows the spark of individuality that the Party so wants to extinguish; by daring to write a journal on his own, he seals his fate early in the story. Soon he meets Julia, another worker, who charms and dares him even further to enocurage having an affair. Together they make a lethal pair, and some lethal decisions, which leads to the great climax in the Ministry of Love.What lies in the story is an amazing prophecy of government gone mad. The Party believes in creating present truths by writing and rewriting the past on its whim. The Party understands in order to control the people, it must control the language, thereby, creating \\"Newspeak\\". The Party makes people simply vanish, eradicating them from existance. The Party realizes the people who follow are merely plebians in society, and therefore, should be encouraged to not think for themselves. In fact, the Party is able to directly lie to the people, using \\"doublethink\\", where they say one thing but mean the other.How much of Orwell's nightmare is something that can be true today? Do we have a government out of control, one that manipulates information for its own benefit, to justify war, ensure fear and terror reigns over the country; one that illegally detains people without trial, right to counsel, or even being charged with a crime; one that wants to extensively monitor our personal phone calls, e-mails, the books we check out of the library, the things we buy in stores. The dots are there to connect them; the challenge is, will you dare to do it, like Winston Smith dared?I believe 1984 is ultimately a hopeful book. Orwell wants to challenge humanity, that during times of crisis, we are able to rise up and change things, so the fateful prophecy so nobly and horrifyingly espoused in 1984 , will only stay between the covers of the book. The choice is up to us."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is unquestionably one of the greatest books in the history of English literature. A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Orwell is meticulously thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist Winston Smith's resistance against Big Brother (the symbolic leader of the Party) and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies, cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a definite must-read for anyone. Enthusiastically recommended; 5 stars."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"That is what George Orwell warns us against in his bone-chilling and now increasingly accurate description of a world of revisionist history and massive invasion of privacy, abetted by technology to produce a society of conformity and fear.Borne out of Orwell's personal experiences in Burma (the present day, repressive Myanmar) and his observations of totalitarianism at mid-Twentieth Century, \\"1984\\" is the story of an average bureaucrat of middling intelligence who seeks no more than to be a whole man who can think and speak his mind, display passion outwardly, and not lie awake wondering who may be watching him. Paranoia rules. Orwell gives us a riveting, sometimes grotesque explanation of what it finally takes in \\"1984\\" for one man to try to restore whatever remains of his genuine identity and self-respect.Since the first publication of this timeless work around 1948 (reverse the digits, you're through the looking glass), Orwell's philosophical sentries have made a point of looking for examples in recent history to prove how prescient he was, and those signposts abound. For example, in the U.S., the Department of War was renamed the Department of Defense (Newspeak), a soldier in Vietnam had to \\"destroy the village to save it\\" (Doublethink), certain municipal hate crime legislation was enacted to curb the utterance of mean-spirited language short of action, and law enforcement officials began publicly naming so-called \\"persons of interest\\" and spending years tracking their activities under the microscope of media coverage. Later, opponents of the Iraq War were branded by the government as unpatriotic (Thought Police). Overseas, Europe and Iran continue to feud over the existence of the Holocaust, with one government staging a conference to help prove it didn't exist while Austria threatens an anti-Semite with prison, raising the nettlesome issue of to what degree free speech should be curtailed in the name of community stability as defined by government.\\"1984\\" does not have a happy ending. Its last four words slam the book shut on freedom. Orwell hoped to foment enough concern with his masterpiece to influence the course of history, and he has to some degree succeeded. There are millions of people around the world who have yet to taste true freedom and who will not relent until they have acquired it. There are others who constantly observe Big Brother, latter-day Orwells who gird each day for a fight to defend individual liberty.A quarter-century after the real 1984, the public and private sectors, enabled by technology, have made it easier to know what the public is saying, thinking, and feeling. And in our own discourse as individual citizens, some of us have taken to playing fast and loose with the facts, or retreating from the world of terra-firma into a make-believe electronic neighborhood.Will we, as a people, accept the \\"truthiness\\" of a Web posting, manufactured definitions on Wikipedia, or be content to have high-powered computer algorithms track our Web footprint in the name of consumerism? Will we retreat to our iPods and virtual reality games? How well will we pay attention? How much do we read? What do we read? And when are we willing to speak up, and to whom?\\"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance\\". - Jefferson"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Having just re-read 1984 it struck me that, whilst the quality of the writing is \\"timeless,\\" (Orwell constructs a better sentence than most \\"literary artists\\"), the book's themes get more and more frightening as Western culture decays toward the millennium. My first school reading was in the days when 1984 was literally \\"the future,\\" (even though Orwell had always intended it as a satire on contemporary Britain, with \\"1948\\" the originally intended title); in England today the resonances are especially profound, and what looked \\"old-fashioned\\" to \`sixties and \`seventies sci-fi readers has gained a new and bleaker realism. We're beginning to catch up with the US when it comes to presidential-style \\"leadership\\" and \\"spin,\\" whilst the rewriting of history - with its horrible parallels with the politically correct mythologies espoused in transatlantic universities and the like - is already being implemented, with particular regard to the guilty denial of the achievements of the British Empire, (whilst the Roman and Greek civilisations still manage to escape trendy censure).The worst shock comes with the realisation that everything 1984 says about the manipulation and reduction of thought by language-control, (Doublethink and Newspeak, respectively), is demonstrably happening right now. Things you can't say become thoughts you can't think, and an attempted conversation with most contemporary English youths on the street will reveal how hard it has become for our ill-educated masses actually to formulate rationale thought: what you get is a monotonic patois recitation of received simplistic opinion - or a boot stamping on your face, followed by a law-suit for your assault on them! One recent encounter left me with the reflection that we are so far from Shakespeare one could weep; then I read 1984 again, where Orwell has Winston wake up one morning with the name on his lips, a fleeting memory of a better past. The book is brilliantly written, shockingly painful and horribly, horribly relevant! (It's also fantastically entertaining and often very funny). Read it, read it again, and read it to your children!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell wrote 1984 at a miserable juncture in history. The Second World War had just ended, the Europe of his memory was in ruins, the full horror of the holocaust had been laid bare and the victorious powers seemed bent on completing the destruction the planet. The best of optimists would have quailed, and Orwell was no optimist. Surrounded by this stark despairing landscape, he wrote a stark despairing speculation. It was his damning indictment of the dark places of our souls.It has been called a masterpiece; one of the twentieth century's greatest prophecies; a visionary dystopia that will speak for all time.I beg to differ.I do not question the brilliance of Orwell's writing. It exactly conveys the utter dejection and despair that he felt in the aftermath of the war. It is an incredibly taut development of character, theme, setting, and plot that strikes our psyche like a fist to the stomach. It attains exactly the right balance between storytelling and polemic.It is also all wrong. It felt wrong thirty years ago when I first read it. It feels just as wrong today.If we ever manage to create hell, it won't be Orwellian. Humans are far more amenable to seduction than oppression. Why spy into every household when one can be persuaded to spy on oneself? Why use techniques as inefficient as torture when far more can be accomplished by appealing to our basest pleasures? Why need doublethink be forced when we will freely embrace it where it is invested with enough allure? And why would the denizens of a misbegotten future bother to listen to voices of discord when their every waking hour can be filled to excess with titillation, shallow ecstasy, and unending bombardment of the senses? The dystopia of the future will not be one of oppression, but of gluttony.An observant person, looking at the here and now, might conclude that hell has already arrived. But it has arrived via Huxley, not Orwell. We already have the Brave New World of test tube babies, mass pacification, casual sex, and broadcasted voyeurism. The key to keeping a society docile is to make docility so pleasant, so seductive, that we will freely and willingly embrace it over the rigours of a well-examined life. The road to hell is paved with syrup, not vinegar.Orwell was a brilliant thinker and writer, not just of fiction, but of social and personal commentary. His essays are probably the finest since Montaigne's, and his powers of human observation and his sheer intellect are overwhelming in their stature. This is what makes 1984 so difficult to understand. Such a keen mind should have arrived at very different conclusions from those exposited in this book.In a really hellish future, there will be no need to destroy malcontents; they will simply be irrelevant."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So much has been written by others on this classic text that I will limit my comments to that aspect of the book I feel is still the most important - the manipulation of language to control behavior. Orwell understood how crucial meaning and communication is to social and political behavior. The Bolsheviks first and then the Nazis both went to great lengths to manipulate meaning, creating an acceptable vocabulary of politically positive words and images and an equally negative vocabulary for that which was to be vilified and destroyed. Attempting to channel behavior into patterns predefined by these limited modes of expression represents the greatest part of the state propogandist's art. Orwell reduced the complexity of this enterprise to something that could be seen for the con game it is. His invention of 'newspeak' demonstrates the reducto ad absurdum of such verbal restrictiveness.In our day, whether Big Brother is really watching or not, we suffer from some of the same contraints of limited language and, in term, limited behavioral options. On the one hand we suffer from a language of polictical correctness that strives to offend no one, but makes speech clumsy and artificial. On the other extreme we suffer from the limited categories that the professional news media use - the narrow meanings available to them for understanding and communicating what is considered 'news'. Since politicians contribute to this limited vocabulary and play off of it, it saves them from facing much real in depth analysis and critique and limits the public to shallow expositions that distort reality and make meaningful political choice impossible.So 1984 has come and gone and we haven't fallen into the dramatic pit that Orwell pictured, but the language we use to deal with social and political issues has been so attenuated that we are in danger of becoming slaves to a limited set of possibilities because we cannot even articulate any alternatives."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"+++++This novel by George Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 to 1950) is about the effects of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (\\"The Party\\") whose leader (actually dictator) is \\"Big Brother.\\" The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of \\"Oceania\\" (in which London is located).At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of \\"Newspeak\\" which utilizes what is called \\"doublethink.\\"Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken). It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought. For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and \\"ungood.\\" Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in one's mind and believe in them both. The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink. Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink. But they also have other methods. For example, they have the \\"Thought Police\\" that investigate \\"thoughtcrimes.\\" These are \\"crimes\\" of just having negative thoughts about The Party. Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls. Thus, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" at all times.Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party). O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did). He makes them pay for their \\"crimes.\\"This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell. Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand. Why does he state this? He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984. (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)This novel is in a word fascinating! It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination. It begins slow but gradually picks up speed. And the story is very interesting.Finally, after reading this book, I recommend watching the 1984 movie \\"1984\\" starring John Hurt and Richard Burton (his last movie role).In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all. Read it for yourself to see why it brought Orwell world-wide fame!!(first published 1949; 3 parts or 24 chapters; 325 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It seemed so innocuous, just sitting there wedged between two other books on the shelf, collecting dust with the others on my \\"yet to read\\" list. I may have passed it by altogether had it not been for the fact that I needed to complete my three hundred pages for the second quarter of my junior year. Besides, I'd read this author's work before and knew that I enjoyed his writing fairly well. So, without realizing what I was plunging into, I picked up George Orwell's 1984; the most unceremonious beginning for a most extraordinary event.As I unconsciously flipped the pages, not realizing that I was still me and not Winston Smith, the story's protagonist, barely cognizant, in fact, that this was a book and not reality, I was dimly aware that this was something special; something far beyond what I had been expecting. If Animal Farm was a slightly humorous, if morbid, look at communism, then 1984 was a ghastly, apocalyptic vision of a demented future. After reading the first twenty pages, I determined that this was the single most quotable book of all time.The infamous Party slogans: \\"War is Peace,\\" \\"Freedom is Slavery,\\" \\"Ignorance is Strength.\\"\\"Thoughtcrime does not entail death; thoughtcrime IS death.\\"\\"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\\"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.\\"Chilling words from what could have been, from an averted catastrophe in which the human race subjugates itself through ignorance. Yet who's to say this could never come to pass? None can honestly look another straight in the eye and say, \\"That is not the future.\\" To presume so is vanity manifest.The one enemy man need truly fear is himself. The notorious Big Brother, the faceless autocrat in charge of Orwell's nightmare world (incidentally, it is never established whether Big Brother is a single man or a surreptitious group superciliously dealing justice to the masses), mercilessly dominates life on Oceania, one of three nations in existence. These countries, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, are continually in a state of war with each other, in which Oceania and one of the others are allied against the last. Big Brother's control over his people is absolute, executed through a methodical censorship that keeps the faade of truth as a contorted mask. Big Brother has the power to efface any record of an event or person - to rewrite the past as he sees fit.Perhaps less relevant as a prophecy today (1984 has come and gone and no dictatorship has arisen to consolidate the Americas and the United Kingdom into a single communist entity), 1984 remains a very real piece of culture, with its own voice in the way it challenges one's preconceived notions and ideals. My English teacher perhaps said it best, when comparing 1984 to Animal Farm: \\"Animal Farm hits you with gloves on; 1984 just smacks you bare-fisted.\\" And it's no slap, no half-hearted jab; it is an in-your-face, force of a moving train blow to the jaw from which the reader reels for weeks, even months after. It is an illustration, as well, of the need of consolidation and the hopelessness that such a government can be beaten: Winston, after waging a personal crusade for his secret freedom, winds up a brainwashed pawn of Big Brother.In the end, Orwell proves that, if the government so wills it, two and two really make five, not four, and no amount of protest is going to change that. This book was a life-changer for me in many ways, but mostly because it made me see a broader view of the world and made me appreciate life as I know it just that much more.\\"He gazed up at that enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark mustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast. Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was alright, everything was alright, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.\\"Quotes taken from George Orwell, 1984, copyright 1949 by Harcourt Brace Javonovich, Inc."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you have not yet read this classic, you absolutely MUST. That is all that can be said about the book itself. Its impact on popular culture alone necessitates a careful perusal.However, after paying almost $9 for this Kindle version (when I'm fairly confident that a trip to a used bookseller would have uncovered a physical copy for less than $5), I was disappointed to find 3 typographical errors in the first chapter of the book, specifically:\\"victory Mansions\\" -- On the very first page, in the very first paragraph, no less!\\"The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could he dimmed\\" -- On the second page (depending on how large a font you use on the Kindle).\\"ordinary shops (' dealing on the free market', it was called)\\" -- I've re-created the spacing exactly as it is in this version.I can understand that the publishers are rushing to make their books available electronically, but surely, even Spellcheck would have found some of these errors.

Orwell points out the fake reality portrayed by the government with his incorporation of such things as \\"victory cigarettes and victory gin.\\" This story exhibits the reality of life in many small, exploited countries.The exaggerated ideals 1984 expresses, represents the oppression felt by many in the world that is gilded by a thought of true freedom. The story is very descriptive and allows the reader to feel the true emotions that the main character, Winston Smith is feeling. Orwell shows that in our world everything is deceptive to reality. Conformity is the main concern for the masses working for the elite and even the name Winston Smith is symbolic for this lack of individualistic qualities. This book shows the militaristic tactics used by the government of \\"Big Brother\\" to inspire people to work and keep an interest in the common good. Every four years the government of Oceana started a fake war with one of the other two super powers to maintain the work ethic and inspiration of the slaving people in the middle class. Winston represents all people who rebel against the system and know that the illusions presented by the government of aristocrats are wrong. He represents the middle class which work as tools of the elite and the proletarians are the people who the government leaves to their own ignorance. 1984 holds a great amount of symbolism and connects fiction with the real world. This book is a must read for everyone and to me, quite possibly one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is not a prediction of the future, but more of a warning of where mankind could be heading. Written in the year 1948, this book is a satiric statement of what might come to pass if people did not take action against the problems facing the world. These problems include totalitarianism, fascism, and - most importantly - the use of language to alter thought. This form of mind-control is what gives a lasting impression on anyone who reads this book. Humans are separate from the animal kingdom because of their ability to grasp abstract concepts (love, hate, etc.) In 1984, people no longer have any privacy, the ruling class spy into their homes, and frighteningly - their THOUGHTS. Anyone guilty of a thought-crime (harboring thoughts against the government) is tortured until they &quot;reconsider.&quot; They are eventually brainwashed through this torture, and the final result is a citizen drained of his personal thoughts and devoted to the government. This thought-provoking satire left a lasting impression on me and I would recommend it to anyone. The symbolism, the characters, and the plot make this story a must-read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell understood the why, the what, and most importantly, the who of post modern tyranny. He is a conflicted and tortured man. A man who exposed his own deepest beliefs in &quot;progressive&quot; politics and plumbed the depth of the consequences. In the year 2000 Orwell is joined by Jerry Furland, Claire Wolfe, Vin Supranowizc, Neal Boortz, David Horowitz and many others in warning us of the dangers of blindly following the newspeak of the Utopian Left. They are with us today. Just as deadly and just as implacable.The Clintons are, in essence, the quintessential inner party dictators. Gore is a bland understudy. This is still, half a century later, political dynamite."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It was quite edifying to read the reviews, as you may read, preaching the book's outdated prophesy and it's over exagerated message, yet when I looked at where these poor souls inhabited I laughed. We are presented with people from the United States to England to Canada slandering a man who beautifully wrote an inspirational attack on that which would prevent you from living in such a lifestyle as you most likely do live in or want to live in. If you have never lived under tyranny how could you know? Now please forgive my hypocritical words for I am only sixteen but this along with other books has opened my mind to something so great and terrible. The more I look at who should be my fellow brothers and sisters the more I think about this novel's relevance. I see how easily one can except anything presented with a superficial answer and how much hate is spread through pride. From the &quot;Two Minute Hate', and 'Big Brother' to the 'Telescreen' and the last four words of the novel, this book is a clearer mirror than any other to view our own times, all throughout time, no longer bolstered up with impressions and controversy."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think Orwell is one of the English language's best writers. 1984 is his master-work. However, to really grasp many of the themes in 1984 one must also look at Orwell's other political writings. (There is an excellent collection of them on the Web - search for 'George Orwell' in Yahoo).Much of what I would say about 1984 has already been said here. However, it never fails to amuse me when socialists and left-wingers seek to cast 1984 as an attack on capitalism. Even the little piece at the end of the edition offered for sale here tries desperately to protest that Big Brother and Ingsoc might also be the product of capitalism. If you believe this, ask yourself how well the words 'laissez-faire' would fit into Newspeak.It is absolutely true that Orwell was a 'democratic socialist.' It is also absolutely true, and Orwell knew, that democracy could produce totalitarianism. 1984 is a critique of two things: relativism (the view that there is no objective truth), and the planner's mentality (that endemic to both the left and right). To think of it as a criticism of any purely economic system is just plain silly."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are many different types of books out there: fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, fantasy, horror, history, and biography. But only a few of them have the same impact that George Orwell achieves in his book 1984. It seems part paranoid fantasy, part tribute to the malleability of the human psyche, and part historical allegory.The issues, even presented in the outdated means that they are, still ring true for our modern society. The line between patriotism and nationalism is a thin one, and one that Americans look at each day. But in Orwell's world that line was crossed, and the result was a totalitarian government beyond anything most of us can imagine. With the government controlling all jobs, information, deeds, and actions, even to the smallest thought of their peoples, his world is stark and horrible to those of us used to a freedom. But the steps into that world are not that far away from our modern media control. In his world of 1984 the media serves the purpose of brainwashing the populace at large, and an ongoing war keeps the pressure on. And while some may claim that the media in our own country has the same control over us, in his world, the media is the government, and has no other agenda than that which the government sets forth.The strange part is that all of this occurs to us, through the eyes of the main character, Winston Smith, as he falls in love with a young woman named Julia. In Oceania, the nation-state in which Smith lives, love is not allowed, and not tolerated. Winston Smith is, in essence, an insurgent in his own nation. He sleeps each night knowing that something is wrong, but not being able to say exactly what. As a reader we can see exactly the horrors to which he is made to endure, and though they might make us scream and shout, he is unmoved. But love draws him out of that sheltered reality, and into open insurgency against his own nation.This is the beginning of the end for Wilson, as the romance, and the pleasures, are short lived. Like a terrible wave the police of the world he inhabits come crashing down upon him to break his spirit. The way they torture him is gruesome, and should offend anyone who values our human rights. But in the end, Wilson himself comes to love \\"Big Brother\\" the face of the state of Oceania. He forgets his insurgency, through a conscious adaptation of his logic processes. He has to know that whatever the nation does is right, even when it contradicts what he has experienced in the recent past. In Orwell's words, Doublethink.These are just the surface issues that come across in Orwell's vision world the deeper issues are buried. As in, how could such a world come to exist? Well, he explains that after World War 2, there came a mighty nuclear war that wiped out most of the population centers of the world. And that out of the nuclear ash arose a political methodology that swept the nations, a kind of socialism that blended into totalitarianism. This totalitarian regime took hold and great purges, on the scope of the great purges in the early communist USSR, ran across the world as we know it. 3 stable nations were born: Oceania (The Americas, the Pacific Islands, Australia, and England), Eastasia (China, Mongolia, The Indonesian Peninsula, and Japan), and Eurasia (All of Europe save England, and all of the Former USSR). The rest of the world was in a constant state of conquest by one of these 3 super-nations, with the captured populations used as slaves. The constant state of war between the nations served to keep control over the people within the nations.This is a world devoid of hope. Indeed, devoid of any emotions except hatred, fanatical delight in the war effort, and the obedience to the governments of the nations. This is the worst vision of what the Nazis in Germany hoped to accomplish in their conquests. A world without any laws, but what the government states to be true at that moment. A world where people disappear, but no one notices, or even cares, a world of total devotion to the state as a whole, without regard to creed, race, or social status.It isn't often that the characters in a book become common usage in the world at large, but the phrase \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" has become synonymous with the government watching over its citizens. It shows up today in almost everyday speech. Especially when people are talking right to privacy issues. This seems apt, as privacy is one of the things that Wilson Smith never had, and will never have. Big Brother (the government) watched his every move of his life, recorded his every word, and rifled through his belongings at their leisure. This book is the origin of that phrase.Orwell gives us a black and white view of the virtues of that world, and its drawbacks. The astounding thing is that it isn't still more talked about. We have, most of us, read this book. But how many too the time to understand the social and political ramifications it speaks of? I will from now on, that is for sure."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"with ourselves ....... 1984 is an epic of living terror. Of the haunting spectre of communism that has gone paranoid.

Take his \\"telescreen\\" for instance, which closely mirrors our giant-screen TVs today and soon-to-be two-way viewing technology that we enjoy with our computers. The little helicopters buzzing around spying on everyone could just as easily be drones and satellites today.And take the ever-changing alliances between the United States, Russia and China -- which could easily be called Eurasia, Eastasia and Oceania. There's always a war somewhere and when you turn on what passes for news today and it's all double-talk spin -- not so much concrete reality than it is flip-flop opinion. The world has yet to degenerate to thought control or \\"thoughtcrime\\", but the increasing constraints of political correctness has us edging that way. And when it comes to our economic system, Orwell nailed that too -- \\"oligarchical collectivism,\\" a system made by the few for the few.The Orwellian lexicon lives on: \\"Big Brother.\\"In the end, it boils down to the book itself. In short, it's a once-in-a-lifetime novel that begs to be read. An enduring classic. It's a book you can read time and again -- I know I have. One man resisting authority.

One year later, I read it as a college freshman. I have brushed up on it several times over the decades -- five decades to be exact. At first, to me it was simply a science-fiction novel. But as the years have rolled by, it seems to me that Orwell's nightmare has come true. This is true with regard to the endless wars, the shifting identity of the latest bogeyman, the lies that are our daily provender from all directions, the demonization of the individual, the internal spying, the hesitation to defy conventional thinking, the shifting definition of words, the dumbing down, state control of the media, the two-minute hate (called by another name, of course), all the jugglery with \\"truth\\" and so forth, it is all here and now. I hesitate to give concrete examples for fear that some of you will think that all of this is to be identified with certain factions, when in fact there is only ONE faction in our society, operating in unison like the tentacles of the octopus. It is not simply political correctness, it is everything. This is not something that can be voted out in an election. You will say that our students are taught this book as required reading, they have all been warned, we are on our guard, we cannot be deceived. You are deceived every day of your lives, you are surrounded by deception. You deceive yourselves in your very thinking. You think in Newspeak and do not know that this is what you are doing.

Written in 1948, he envisioned a society in which truth is manipulated to suit the needs of the Party.

Freedom, according to Big Brother, is slavery to the Party.Enter Winston, whose job is to rewrite books and other literature to suit the needs of Big Brother. He questions what he is doing, as well as loyalty. As he quietly questions his role, he comes to meet Julia and they have an illicit affair. The Party will not stand for this. Only Big Brother can supply all their needs, both physical, emotional, and sexual.This is a must for anyone living in America today. It is requires reading in my Government class and it never ceases to amaze me how the kids can get into it and discuss it with such frankness.Although somewhat dark and cynical, 1984 does reveal how even free governments originally found on Democracy will eventually do anyting to hold onto their power.

The book is a social warning of sorts written by Orwell about the extreme directions that governments might take its citizens. The book follows the Nazi era of WWII, and the socialist revolutions in Russia and China. Orwell got his original idea from reading H.G. Well's \\"Utopia\\" written 50 years earler. Here he takes the concept a step farther with a breakdown of the government to become a flawed and highly controlling socialist society run by the political elite.This is a very interesting book that should be read along with the author's other book Animal Farm. I read the book and saw the VHS starring Hurt and Burton which is mostly a faithful representation of the book - and a good movie in color.Once the smoke and rhetoric clears this is essentially a love story about a man living in what appears to be a communist society or perhaps the National Socialists that has evolved into a tightly controlled and hero worshipping society, i.e.: pictures of the leader (\\"B.B.\\") big brother are omnipresent and everyone wears similar blue overalls, eats similar food, etc. Big brother has taken on a persona similar to Stalin or Mao and like those totalitarian communist societies, the misfits or independent thinkers or small business people are banished to camps or simply killed. Propaganda is the norm and (again) like similar 20th century communist countries history is re-written almost daily to reflect the current whims of the leaders.Unlike many imperfect countries including most western countries and other free countries that have survived the upheavals of the 20th century, we are subject to government propaganda and media bias but we are free to turn off our TV sets, not read the papers, buy any book that we so desire, have religious freedoms or free to be agnostics, and choose to protest and vote as we see fit. This is all lacking in 1984 where society is strictly controlled. Each TV is interactive and monitors the owner for deviations from the accepted patterns of behaviour; it is connected with the \\"thought police\\", and is turned on all the time to monitor the citizens. Only high party members have the luxury of turning off their interactive TV connected to the \\"thought police\\" and drinking wine and participating in the normally accepted pleasures of life. As we read in the book Animal Farm, the utopian ideals of a perfect society are replaced by the corruption brought on by absolute power.The \\"average citizens\\" including our hero in 1984 are subject to a continuous stream of propaganda about external armed conflicts, false production figures to offset real material shortages, criminal activities against big brother and the party, confessions of party members gone astray, etc. They cannot read independent books or articles. Such books, that would expose the government propaganda for what it is, are all banned. People who do not conform are routinely arrested and hung at public hangings - that are televised seemingly daily.The plot is sinister in that the ruling party members use thought control and torture to manipulate the masses including our hero, so the citizens lose most of their human qualities and are zombie like. This is a chilling movie about how a society can take a wrong turn.Written by George Orwell late in his short life, this remains a compelling and unusual read about a society gone mad. It is a \\"must read\\" work of 20th century fiction."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is recognized to be one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, and helped to expose the evil that is contained in totalitarianism.

When I started it, I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I couldn't pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I've finally somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It's ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it's at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I've ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which utterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can't be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it's not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe. You'll never hear the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; again, without chills going down you're spine, and fear filling every corner of your being. I would also like to recommend another book that I recently came across------very thought provoking and unusual, titled THE CHILDREN'S CORNER. Not a book for children but a great, great, colorful romp through humor-land, darkness, great writing, and stellar prose. By Jackson McCrae. Check it out. I read it for a class and loved it. If you loved \\"Brave New World\\" then you'll like 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Another great piece of literature by George Orwell, I'm just I wasn't forced to read this one in school. Animal Farm remains one of my favorite books, but I had to read it in class, so it will forever be tainted.This book brings up so many questions it is hard to know where to begin. The most horrifying thing about this book, I think, is that it can be related to so many situations. Everything from grand-scale government to the aforementioned class room is allegorized in this book in some way. It reminds me, in some ways, of a Harry Chapin song that shares its name with that of this post. In the song a child goes to school full of imagination and creativity; through the negative reinforcement of his teacher the child is forced to conform and never again regains what he had. The tragic loss of the human spirit is really what this book is about.What you really need to consider when reading something like this is: how far from the truth is this? As far as correcting history goes, isn't it true that every civilization writes history from its own perspective? Most American textbooks portray Christopher Columbus as a saint and Native Americans as primitive savages; they all contain direct contradictions of the truth that we are all taught to accept. Often times, even after learning the fallacies of these statements, people still cling to their ideals. A small amount of discrimination toward these engrained teachings still remains even after the facts have become accepted, our own, underdeveloped, form of doublethink. And what are these new \\"facts\\" based on? Primary sources, journals, accounts? But aren't all of these also biased by the person writing them? The only history that truly exists is the memory within one's one mind, also biased, in case anyone is keeping track. So, if history truly only exists within the mind of the individual, isn't it entirely logical that \\"modifying\\" that historical perspective would in fact change history? It's all very confusing and I commend Orwell for trying to break it down a little.Apparently it doesn't matter that such instances of \\"Party\\" thinking occur in our own time and place, it only matters that they don't occur to such a level as to make us uncomfortable. I know I'm not clarifying my point very clearly here, but what I'm trying to say is that everything that happens in Orwell's novel happens in our world too, just not nearly as severely. It's all a matter of perspective, most of the people living in Orwell's 1984 are perfectly content, even thrilled, to be where they are in life. That doesn't make it right, but that is our perspective of the situation. By our standards, the world in which they live is intolerable. Their world is our Room 101. That sounded a lot more philosophical in my head, but I think you get my point."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Creepy. Profound. Intense. 'Riveting'. And so on goes the string of 'good book review' words that one could easily associate with this novel. If you know what 1984 is, and if you know who George Orwell is, you don't need me to tell you to read this book. Because you should.But let's get over that, and dig underneath the book's paperdermis. Because yes, on the outside it appears to be the 1950s equivalent of 'the Matrix', a story laced with post-apocalyptic yet still relevant social commentary. But inside, 1984 proves to be much more valuable than that: this book perfectly captures the western political phobias and ideaologies of the World War II era.Orwell's 1984 was essentially Stalin's Soviet Union (made especially evident by the spot on physical similarities of Stalin and Big Brother, for one), but almost any totalitarian state fits the fiction. The state is ruled by the party, who control everything in life through the use of ignorance, propoganda and 'dissapearances' (purges). Sound familiar?When I first read this, I figured it was just the work of a paranoid British McCarthyist. But I was completely wrong. I came to realize that 1984 is a historical treasure worth reading, not because of the strangely convincing, yet absurd world of 1984, but because it recreates the western culture of the Cold War in an effective manner. This is not simply good fiction, but a bridge between the Cold War, and the political groups and ideas of today. A must read for all students of history."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell crafts one of the most absolutle horrors of a future world in this celebrated novel.Written in the late 40's, Orwell crafts the tale of a bureaucrat in the future whose job along with countless other mindless peons, is (in essence) to erase history.Bombarded by slogans that hammer the totalitarian nature of the state, he finds some comfort in a woman who shares his ambition to break free from the controls of \\"Big Brother\\".Parables abound in this book, to a world and people seemingly oblivious to what is going on around them. Orwell has managed to create one of the most frigthening environments put to paper and weave a future world bleaker, but more importantly, theoreticaly possible in any day or age. So ingenious in usage of slogans, and terms made up by the author, that they are culturaly refered to still in this day and age.An astounding piece of fiction."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a crowning achievement of the negative utopia novel, bringing forth oppressment and totalitarianism in a strict society in which all men are slaves to the Party. Orwell's use of symbolism and foreshadowing are fantastic, bringing forth all the elements of lost humanity which he wishes to bring about in the novel.The symbols in 1984 are striking and disturbing, but completely impressive. The entire idea of Newspeak is well used. It is a symbol of the deteriorating of humanity through simplification and the use of force by Big Brother. Also prevalent is the vanishing of people. People vanish not because of a clear violation of laws, but because they are turned in by others for a violation. Often there is no trial and no chance for a people to save themselves from being killed. This shows the complete deterioration of all human freedom as we know it. People are killed for mere suspicion with no definitive proof of wrongdoing, all so that society can go on smoothly.The foreshadowing throughout the novel is also very effective. Orwell uses Winston's dreams to show events that come to pass soon thereafter. His dream in which he hears the voice tell him \\"We will meet in the place where there is no darkness\\" ironically foreshadows Winston's being in a prison cell full of light, rather than a triumph over the darkness of the times as Winston first sees it. Also well used is \\"2+2=4\\" foreshadowing his change after the conditioning that \\"two and two make five.\\" All of this foreshadowing really works to create a sense of destination for Winston.Th novel's use of foreshadowing and symbolism coincide to create a sense of terror and impending doom. They work perfectly and the end result is one of the greatest warnings from literature ever."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell, whose real name is Eric Blair, was born in India in 1903. He served in Burma with the India Imperial Police and spent the end of the 1920s living in Paris. He later fought for the Republicans against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. He became well-known with the publication of \\"Animal Farm\\", a satire on Soviet Russia. He died in January 1950, shortly after the publication of \\"1984\\".\\"1984\\" is set in London, the chief city of Airstrip One and the third most populous of Oceania's states. Oceania is one of the world's three great powers - the others being Eurasia and Eastasia - and is constantly at war with at least on of its neighbors. Although the roles of enemy and ally change regularly, the change is never officially acknowledged : if Oceania is at war with Eastasia, then it has always been at war with Eastasia. The Party rules Oceania through four ministries. These include the Ministry of Peace (which deals with the war effort), the Ministry of Plenty (responsible for economic affairs and shortages) and the Ministry of Truth (responsible for all forms of propaganda - including news, education and entertainment). However, the Ministry of Love - which deals with law and order - is the really scary one. Heavily fortified and guarded, it is home to the dreaded Thought Police and is impossible to enter except on official business. Oceania's official language is Newspeak, an updated version of English with a vastly reduced vocabulary. Without the words to express an 'undesirable' thought, 'thoughtcrime' will become literally impossible. It is expected to have totally replaced Oldspeak, or standard English, by 2050.The Party is led by Big Brother, and all good things come as a direct result of his leadership. His image stares down from every wall, and he is widely viewed as a savior and protector. His nemesis is Emmanuel Goldstein, who was once a leading member of the Party before betraying the cause. He is now the 'Enemy of the People', and commander of the Brotherhood : a mysterious army dedicated to he overthrow of the Party and State.The book's hero is Winston Smith - he is reasonably sure he is thirty-nine, and that the year is 1984 (though that is not entirely certain). A member of the Party, he works in the Records Department at the Ministry of Truth and lives at Victory Mansions. Although his position brings certain perks - certainly in comparison to the proles - life is bleak. Many items - including food, razor blades and boots - are in short supply, and his home - despite its name - is an old, rundown block of flats. In every room throughout Airstrip One, telescreens are installed. Although similar to televisions, they can only be dimmed but never switched off. They not only receive programmes, but also transmit to the Ministry of Truth - meaning the Thought Police can monitor whoever they like whenever they like. Winston is officially married, although he has been separated for nearly eleven years. Marriages between Party members have to be approved by a committee, though any attraction is apparently frowned upon. Sex is an act widely viewed with disgust, while sexual immorality is known as 'sexcrime'. Winston's life changes when he starts keeping a diary. This is not technically illegal, though - when caught - he knows it could be punishable by death.Generally, I don't like making blanket recommendations, but \\"1984\\" is one of the few exceptions. While it is a grim book, everybody should read at some point. Some see it, like \\"Animal Farm\\", as a satire on the USSR - Big Brother does seem to look like Stalin, there are constant references to 'Three Year Plans' and people call each other 'Comrade'. However, it applies to any form of totalitarian government - or indeed, any government that has too much control over an individuals life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a little more intense than the style of books I usually go for, but after seeing it listed on the \\"Books you must read before you die\\" and seeing so many strong reviews for it, I thought it was one I should definitely make time to read.I had to read A Brave New World in high school and even today I still thoroughly enjoy that book. To me, Nineteen Eighty Four is the next level of extreme when compared to A Brave New World, and although I really enjoyed George Orwells writing style and the overall theme of the book, I think that a lot of the intellectual political notes went over my head.To fully understand and appreciate this book you need to be able to give it 100% concentration for the whole time you are reading it, and at time I struggled with doing that as I found myself skim-reading over the extreme political jargon (i.e. when Winston was reading The Book).I did enjoy the book, and while it is one of the most thought-provoking books I have read, I wouldn't read it again, nor recommend it to someone unless they specifically enjoyed this genre of book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I liked the idea of the book, but I hated it in the end.

This is fine for people who like bad endings, but it was not for me.There were also many elements that were not believable. Three totalitarian states would not constantly maintain equal power. A society such as Oceania would weaken and either one of the other states would gain supremacy, or another would rise up.I originally rated this book as 2 stars, but had to change it, because I can't stop thinking about it.

But it finished strong.I was mildly interested in Orwell's dystopian society. My interest waned until Julia, Winston's love-interest, is introduced. I almost put the book down when Winston reads 'The Book'. In fact, I didn't bother speed-reading through it but literally skipped several pages. These pages pulled me out of the story but just as soon as it was over (many pages later) it jumped right back without missing a beat.I'm not often interested in long narrative. Give me the bare facts and let's get on with the story. But Orwell does such a wonderful job of scene-building that I frequently relished his descriptions of rooms, weather and personal effects. I felt the bone-chilling winter, the guilt, the longing. The suffering.But most of all, it was the ending. Like Animal Farm, I was impacted by the story long after I finished. His portrayal of the systematic breakdown of a human being, the stripping of a soul and the remolding of a mind, is chilling to the very last line.After all, 2 + 2 = 5."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read 1984 and LOVED all of it.

In Orwell's dystopia, the state is all powerful; every aspect of life is controlled, down to --and especially-- the language itself. This is probably the book's greatest contribution to social theory --the idea that words and definitions have such a great influence on our thoughts. If we can't think of the word for something, we can't have a coherent thought about it. Orwell may not have invented these ideas, but he certainly dramatized them in an unprecedented manner. Another significant aspect of the novel is the perpetual warfare. The state is constantly at war, but allies and enemies constantly shift. The population is kept under complete surveillance by televisions that watch the viewer; and this was written years before internet cameras! The everyman hero, Winston Smith, gradually gets involved in a resistance movement that may or may not really exist. The paranoia of this scenario is total --no one can be trusted. In my opinion, many people have missed the point of this novel. ...I can't be sure of Orwell's purpose in writing the book, but to me it's not meant to be a realistic portrayal of any actual or even possible dictatorship. It's more of a theoretical model of a perfectly evil state --the antithesis, for example, of Plato's supposedly perfect society. ... To see the relevance of 1984, we have to focus on the techniques and mindset used by the state in that novel. Armies that are called peacekeeping forces; wars that are never declared against always changing enemies; a language of PC euphemisms and bureaucratic jargon -- these are facts of modern life. The fact that it hasn't gone to the extreme of 1984 and probably (and hopefully) never will does not in any way detract from Orwell's brilliant insights."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Our society and culture are shaped by ideas that have occurred decades, centuries, and even eons before we were conceived. Our perception of history affects the way we see our surroundings and that same perception contains much gravity in the way of our thoughts and actions. We tend to outwardly proclaim our love for idealogical freedom and take pride in our nation. But what if none of it was real? What if our perception of reality and all that has ever happened was controlled not for the sake of our own good, but for the sake of power.1984 was written during a time when communism was on the rise with an inherent fear that the ideologies of the said political point of reference would overcome the freedoms upheld by the American public. George Orwell, an English author born in India, fought against the armies and individuals who would push forth such ideologies. What he saw arising was a possible future in which governments controlled every detail of your life to the point of even telling you who you could marry and where you can eat. We can see the downfall of the utopian communist mindset now, but are we indifferent to the lessons learned through what Orwell has communicated?This is a great book when we open our minds to the understanding that, in my opinion, transcends the breadth of the book. What reality will you trust? When you look at who we think we are as Citizens of the United States of America (if you are as such), do you realize that a probable 2/3's of the world hates us? When we see history, can we see it through the eyes of the Vietnamese soldier, of whose land we invade? Are we able to peer through the thoughts of the Native American who remembers through oral tradition the first encounter with the Europeans as his people are being destroyed by the same people group? I'm not trying to increase a personal hatred or sentiment of discord with what our country is. What I am trying to relay here is that History is not always what it seems to us through first glance, I think that more than anything it is what Orwell wants us to understand. Is our freedom worth the investigation it takes to find the truth? I think so, and I think that reading this book can give us an insight as to why. Very entertaining. Very dark. Very thoughtful. I give it five stars because it's a well written book with a seeming purpose that goes beyond reading it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell was always known for handling tough issues in his novels and non-fiction works. 1984 is a timeless example of Orwell's fearlessness, as the novel deftly broaches topics such as totalitarianism and free thought--topics that were eminently important in 1948 (when in the novel was written) and remain important to this day.The novel follows Winston Smith who is loyally employed in the Ministry of Truth within the futuristic nation of Oceania. However, in Orwell's futuristic world, nothing is as it seems, for the Ministry of Truth seeks actually to destroy historical truth in an effort to protect the unknown but seemingly omniscient &quot;Party&quot; which rules Oceania under the direction of the totalitarian leader known simply as &quot;Big Brother.&quot; What follows is a dramatic transformation of Winston as he questions his role in this perverse society, where spies are everywhere, privacy is non-existent and rebellious thoughts, let alone actions, are criminal offenses.This is a disturbing satire that stunningly dramatizes the perversities of totalitarian/fascist societies and ultimately makes an important statement about human freedom within society. Orwell is a talented writer who moves the story along brilliantly, keeping readers glued to the book and throwing in many unforeseen twists and turns. The conclusion of the novel, with its dramatic last sentence, is classic and troubling. This is an important book for all to read and most will enjoy doing so."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In &quot;1984&quot;, Winston, the main character, finds himself dissatisfied with a world he feels powerless to change. Cameras are everywhere, and no one knows when they are being monitored. Furthermore, government spies abound, and children are taught early on to snitch on someone who is being disloyal. Public records are constantly altered to ensure that &quot;Big Brother&quot; is seen as flawless and all-powerful. Unable to hide in the shadows any longer, Winston begins to search for others who are equally disatisfied. As the story unfolds, the uneasiness builds as Winston tries to find a way to thwart the seemingly unstoppable Big Brother.Privacy advocates often reference &quot;1984&quot; for its nightmarish vision of a world where one's every move is monitored. Equally unnerving are the descriptions of an all-powerful government that can hide the truth by altering documents and that &quot;reprograms&quot; those who disagree. If you're sleeping too well at night, this is a book for you. It should be read by everyone who's ever considered the importance of freedom."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To think that by 1984 we had begun to exhibit some of the ideas Orwell expressed in his novel, or that so many believed that none of it had come true?In 1984, Orwell paints the vision of a world layered with Marxist and Socialist philosophies, a place where individual freedom is being oppressed and forgotten. Told through the perspective of Winston Smith, a member of The Party, Orwell shows the struggles and consequences of a man daring to go against The System.It is a riveting tale injected with political and social philosophy. A timeless classic that will certainly be revisited by future generations and very likely passed off as &quot;incorrect predictions&quot; because the concepts Orwell covers are too frightful to entertain as reality. From Big Brother watching citizens through Telescreens to the past being rewritten from one moment to the next.I highly recommend this novel to not just science fiction fans but to all citizens of the present, as a reminder that freedom is only a reality as long as we do not take it for granted."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"this is a powerful book and a must read for everybody. while some may say this book was written to criticize the corrupted Soviet empire, that is not true. Animal Farm was written for that purpose. this book was instead written to warn the free world of totalitarianism, something that could easily happen anywhere in the world, even in democracies like the US, or England, the setting of the book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is a model of George Orwell's idea of Totalitarianism and in my opinion he wrote it to show people how a political system can suppress individual freedom. Orwell wants to warn people for the future by showing them what society could become if Totalitarianism became true.When I read this book it was very horrifying to me realizing that almost all people, except Winston Smith and Julia, are brainwashed by the Party. They believe everything the Party tells them for example Oceania is at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. But one day the situation changes and Oceania is at war with Eastasia and Eurasia is their partner. The Party tells its people that they are always at war with Eastasia and people don't remember that this isn't true! This is incredible for me.To my mind Winston is a sort of hero because he is aware of the danger that he gets into trouble with the Party. He knows from the very beginning that his diary will be found and later will be used against him. He also knows that his love affair with Julia is an act of revolution because sex is just allowed to produce \\"new material\\" for the Party. But I also think Winston is some kind of naive because he opens his mind to O'Brien before he is sure that O'Brien is also against the Party.A very interesting character of the book, I think, is O'Brien because the reader only gets to know Winston's opinion about him and till the end the reader isn't sure if O'Brien is an enemy or a friend of Winston. For me O'Brien plays his \\"role\\" perfectly, with the result, that Winston is reintegrated into the Party.The Party invents a new official language of Oceania called Newspeak and by the year 2050 this language will superset Oldspeak (=common English). I think one reason of developing this language is to make old books, which are written before the era of the Party, unreadable. It's vocabulary is so constructed that it gives an exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning. This is done by the invention of new words but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words.Orwell also describes the bad living conditions under which people have to live at that time. The Party wants to make them concentrating on the Party and not on their own pleasure.The reader really sees how the life of a Party member is dictated from his birth to his death.I recognized that Orwell divides the Superstates in the book according to their division in the Cold War. Oceania stands for the United States of America, Eurasia for Russia and Eastasia for China. The \\"Golden Country\\" is another symbol which can be compared with the old European landscape.While reading the book I asked myself who Big Brother is and I came to the conclusion that Big Brother, whose picture is everywhere, stands for all dictators that have ever existed. Orwell has certainly been thinking of Russian leader Joseph Stalin, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler or the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. But I think too that for Orwell Big Brother could be a religious figure like God who sees and knows everything but never appears in person. For members of the Inner Party Big Brother is a leader who they can use to scare people and to explain their doings.In my opinion George Orwell wants to show with the book \\"1984\\" that there exists no chance that all people can become equal. There are always some people who have more power than the others because those have for example to rule the country or to make laws. It's very important that people don't trust their leader blindly and forget to think with their own minds. Therefore they must surely get the right education and the historical knowledge to become aware of the parallels in the past and to notice if something goes into the wrong way.Even a person who has such a big personality as Winston Smith, can be manipulated and influenced easily by drugs and torture. For me the sentence \\"I love Big Brother\\" at the end of the book is very impressive and shocking because you feel that it isn't a sentence he says for fun, no, this is his new opinion after being brainwashed. The book shows to me clearly that nobody can resist such cruelty and that a society only needs one person to give violence and Totalitarianism a chance. There are always people who want to control every move and thought to get maximum power which lies unfortunately in the human nature.I also think that the actuality of Big Brother isn't to deny because today we have computers and the internet which give us the possibility of looking into the private life of each person. There are a lot of people who are interesting in watching such, in my opinion, boring films.For the future I can imagine that there will be cameras and microphones at a lot of places. So even if you want to go to the doctor or get a new job you will have to give detailed information about your person and nobody will be able to have secrets anymore.I liked reading this book very much because it is written very exciting. I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know how the story would end. I was very surprised about the ending because I didn't think that Winston could be changed and reintegrated into the Party.I can recommend this novel and satire to everyone because I believe it's very important to become aware of what in our surroundings happens and how easily people can be manipulated and influenced without noticing it. For me it is possible that the story, told in this book, happens in real life again because there are many people who want to get power and look only after their personal benefit."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\", by George Orwell, is a harrowing tale of the dismal future. The year is 1984 and the government has taken over every aspect of Joe Anybody's life. Through the use of an advanced television, called a telescreen, the government keeps a close eye on each and every citizen of Oceania, one of three world powers. If anyone does something that makes them seem \\"unorthodox\\" or unique, the Thought Police quickly show up and capture that person, torturing him and then erasing his name from any record it may have been in, thereby erasing his existence. In this way the government controls all of history. Any record or document not in compliance with the government's philosophy or ideals quickly receives an alteration to rectify the \\"mistake.\\" The future is bleak and getting worse by the day.To call this book a \\"classic\\" would not do it justice. This is the best book I have ever read, for numerous reasons. First, George Orwell writes masterfully, with words that flow like water through your mind; his complete grasp of the written word creates a profound impact on the reader which makes the book exceptionally hard to put down. Second, the questions the book forces you to consider hit with the force of a sledgehammer: what is truth? Can it possibly be attained? These questions haunt your every moment in between reading sessions with this book. The final reason that this is the best book I have ever read is the messages the book conveys. The government should not rule people's lives, censorship is a thing more destructive than most people realize, and to be forgotten is a fate far worse than death. This book made me think more than any other book I have ever read.Although I may speak highly of it, this book may not be for everyone. It is for every person who believes the government should not have more control over people's lives than it now does, it is for every person who questions whether the information the government feeds us on a daily basis is true or not, and it is for every person who has the mental capacity to grasp the idea that the past may not exist the way you think it does. If you want to read an astounding book that makes you rethink what you now know about the world you live in, by all means read this book. If you want to remain complacent and ignorant about what the government could become, then don't read it. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a very powerful novel of great meaning to today's society. One of Orwell&#8217;s most important points in his portrayal of society is how it fits the old adage that &#8220;Ignorance is bliss.&#8221; The citizens believe whatever the Inner Party members tell them because through ignorance they do not have to worry about the meaninglessness of their own lives. The choice between acting upon the truth and staying &#8220;blissfully&#8221; ignorant of it is one that Winston has to face, and he&#8212;-like the other millions of Outer Party members&#8212;-chooses to avoid the truth for a less physically painful life.This novel shows that the quest for individuality and freedom can often be a dangerous thing. By accepting the kind of euphoric idealism of modern society, one can quite ironically lose all meaningful freedom in the process.This book's prophecy is quite similar to that of Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" (another excellent novel), in that they both try to point out that our increasing trend toward individual freedom, coupled with our materialistic attitudes and increasing lack of morality, are leading us down a path to a &#8220;Brave New World,&#8221; or a 1984 scenario. Of course, the feelies will most likely not become a part of our reality, and Thoughtcrime and memory holes are equally as unlikely. What is likely, however, is a new generation whose thought patterns could be very similar to that of Huxley&#8217;s Alphas: &#8220;Ending is better than mending.&#8221;The one question that remains unanswered in either of the two novels is whether it is worth trying to mend our rapidly conforming society, or to simply end all attempts at revealing the hideous face of ignorance that encumbers so many people today. Perhaps, as Orwell&#8217;s Inner Party slogan claims, ignorance really is strength, and those that believe themselves to be free truly are. However, as Huxley and Orwell agree, the &#8220;strength&#8221; of ignorance can never be compared to the power of truth.This is a novel that should be required reading in school. Everyone can benefit from Orwell's brilliant work, and every reader's life will be changed because of it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Read this book! It's not only at once convincing and absorbing, but its also a reflection and an analogy to many things are in our society today. The novel it's hunting not only in the sense that the regime described could become reality (although it seems it would work I refuse to believe it) but because we can see a lot of it taking place today; in a much lessen degree off course. Things such as the lack of reasoning of the majority of people; the destruction of language by slang and the lack of reading; the dictatorship of ideas, dogmas and parameters of life by the \\"telescreen\\" (TV); the absent-mind of the people, where everyone is too absorbed in their day-to-day activities to know any better...The novel is also a lot of fun because we can virtually immerse ourselves in it, seeing it all to the least detail, to such an extent that we can breath the air, and feel in our skin even things that are not explicitly described in the book.

Educate yourself, read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"personally i beleive every individual percieves reality differently from that of another; according to how society perceves them. Here Mr. Orwell clearly provides the ideologies of one man and how it relates to others/it's society. in all actuality no one is right nor wrong, they simply comply or not to that of one persons individualistical thought which has spread-out. &quot;I.E. is censorship ok in our society?&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you have not read this, I strongly recommend it ... ESPECIALLY if you are like me, and somehow &quot;escaped&quot; having this assigned to you either in high school or in college, but have always wondered what the hype was all about.Too many times today, you will hear this book discarded as a bunch of prophesies that were way off -- e.g., that in the year 1984 there would be computers and &quot;telescreens&quot; that would all but read our minds; that &quot;Big Brother&quot; would always be watching us. Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of &quot;Big Brother&quot; -- i.e., how information is &quot;cleansed&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is the story of the main charcter ( Winston) and his life living under the control of Big Brother. Big Brother is the \\"governmental\\" power of the time. The main slogans of the party are: War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. Throughout the book it becomes evident that the party trully believes these staements and does not let anyone else believe otherwise. We see Winston's stuggle with self control and how his meeting with Julia is what evintually takes him down. His feelings fo sin for her and his hatred of just about everything destroys him. He and Julia have several encounters and are eventually caught and only after denouncing Julia is Winston treated fairly. In the end Winston gives in and submits to the growing and ever controling power of Big Brother.My own feelings:This book is certainlly a strange one. In the beggining it makes you think that it is about a lunatic who wants physical attention. But then you realize that he is misguided and that ifhe would not have been corrupted by Big Brother and given some rights he wouldn't have rebelled."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is a classic novel that centralizes around the theme of what happens when human civilization has lost its innate, human qualities and is predestined to have its individuality debased even more. The author, George Orwell, conveys this throughout the context of the book by showing that the government controls virtually every aspect of human life. The main character is Winston Smith, and he is a slightly rebellious and wondering adult who questions the validity of past events and the overall value of human life.On a scale of one to ten, I would probably rate the book an \\"eight\\" because it is a very captivating novel to explore the depths of human thought and fictionalized imagination. However, the concepts are slightly difficult to comprehend, so a person who understands the concepts of utopia would really understand the plot. I would recommend this novel to people who enjoy reading other pieces of literature by George Orwell (such as \\"Animal Farm\\" and the essay \\"Shooting an Elephant\\") because it is yet another book Orwell probes the concepts and ideas of civilization and government, and the results of corruption. I must mention that Orwell uses a direct and rebellious tone, as the plot is in perspective to the third person point of view of Winston Smith. He uses interesting diction as Orwell assumes that the reader knows the order of society in \\"1984.\\" It also contains a lot of detail and imagery as he continuously describes the atmosphere of futuristic society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book when I was only 17 or 18. I was very impressed with it then and continue to be so now that I am in my early 30s. I cannot remember how many people I have suggested this book to but...

Way before its time, 1984 will continue to facinate readers for years to come."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are many works where the story is the content. These books are usually for entertainment. This book uses the story to deliver its content. It uses the story to illustrate some awsome philosophical ideas.

This is the only book I have ever read that has given me the shakes."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 wasn't the first utopia/dystopia written, but it pretty much set the standard for all those that followed, and even for those that came first. Orwell wrote a novel warning us of what could happen if political power went unchecked, and his warning was especially to his contemporaries living in the post-war England. Orwell does a brilliant job of capturing the despair and dinginess of life in his 1984. In fact he does it so well that if the reader is not careful the general mood of the novel could invavde the reader's life (it did mine). This book has been called one of the few masterpieces of modern literature. The third section especially so. Rarely have I read anything as great or powerful as part three of 1984. The dangers that Orwell warns us of leap forth in this section--the loss of free will and the total breaking of the human spirit, which we all would like to believe always survives. But it doesn't."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Thankfully in the year I was born which was 1984, the world wasn't exactly like it was in the novel.What makes 1984 important to the modern reader is several things.First is the fact that culturally its an incredibly relavent book. Most people have today heard terms like \\"How 1984\\", \\"Orwellian\\", or even \\"doublethink\\", in the modern vocab. Hell, even Radiohead did a song called 2+2=5. The reader, particularly the young one trying to grasp a sense of history, in the sense of the progression of modern thought, will find this book very important.That relates to the 2nd reason why you need 1984, not only is it culturally relavent in its influence and often referenced nature. But it is one of those books that have shaped the way that we think, particularly in the free market west, and has helped give us moral justification in avoiding what becomes the excessive totaltarian nature of many collectivist style government. Perhaps in Orwell's mind he may of been more successful then he orginally planed to be in his warning, as he was a english socialist, and was deathly afraid of what he had seen happen with Stalin in Russia.As a story, 1984 is a well thought out and griping story. The intergration of idea's, action, depth, and even a great deal of dark satire blend together well.Although it is a good idea if one does have at least a decent understanding of Marxism before approaching it, as i've seen younger people in my generation approach the novel without the understanding of Marx and walk away with little more comprehension of the tale's warnings then they could.Overall however, one of the few books everyone in our culture should at least attempt to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"one of the best books i've ever read. makes you think about what is true and what isn't. though written in the 50's i believe, the concept can be applied to the present and the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.

Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \\"Ministry of Love\\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity.

The book was written sometime in the 40s or 50s and takes place in England in 1984. In this futuristic world Big Brother is the boss and everything he says is right even if he's wrong. Everyone is under constant surveillance and history can be erased or changed at Big Brother's whim.The form of government in this book is similar to that of any tyrant totalitarian. What happens in this book is something that I believe could happen to society if we let the government obtain too much power over the people. It really gave me a new perspective on just how easily things can change in the world. Overall I was really nervous for the future of the world, but I couldn't put the book down.

Its not only politics its has a hint of a love story, but its mostly about the control of the government in a totalitarian society.

It was also fun to see what he thought 1984 would be like because 1984 was nothing like it.The book i believe would to be too hard from anything below 6th grade, a slight challenge for middle schoolers and a perfect level for mid highschool any older or wiser it would be a great quick read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is incredible.

The main character, Winston, goes through a series of events. First he gets a little green book that he writes nasty things in. He goes on through life watching this girl who seems suspucious. She gives him a note that says: I love you. Winston and the girl, Julia, get together. They have some good times. Then they join a group that is against the Party(people who own and watch everyone). They both get caught by the Thought Police. They go into what is called \\"jail\\". They get tourmented and badly hurt. While they are doing this they get seperated and later on meet each other again. All this is taking place in London, on the streets, in work,and in the \\"jail\\". As Winston is in \\"jail\\" he learns by being tourmented. He learns that the Party can never be beat. It will always win. 1984 is a book I highly suggest. 10/31/06-11/1/06"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" has made an impressive impact on literature, as well as society in general. It is a classic of the dystopian (or \\"Negative Utopia\\") genre. Though it was written in 1949, and the real year 1984 has already passed, the totalitarian society of the future George Orwell describes is remarkably believable and seems more possible than ever.The world of \\"1984\\" is much different than our present world; the territories are now divided into Oceania (which includes Great Britain and the Americas), Eurasia (includes the Soviet Union), and Eastasia (includes China, Japan, and Korea). These three powers are engaged in perpetual war, in which alliances are constantly formed and split. The governments of each of the three \\"superstates\\" has an enormous amount of control over the citizens and media. \\"Big Brother\\", ruler of Oceania, is seen as an omnipotent, infallible leader. The departments of Oceanian government are the Ministry of Peace (concerned with war), the Ministry of Plenty (concerned with rations of food and other goods), the Ministry of Love (concerned with the arrest and torture of those opposing the government), and the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Truth is perhaps the most influential of the four, as it is concerned with spreading propaganda of the Party (the only political group allowed in Oceania). The government places \\"telescreens\\" in most of the citizens' homes and various public places, which are generally unable to be turned off. These telescreens continuously provide information about government affairs. They can also be used as monitors for the government to observe what citizens are doing inside of their homes at any given time.The book centers around the protagonist, Winston Smith, a citizen of London, in Oceania. He is employed in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, where he alters recent and historical articles and documents to coincide with what the Party desires to be represented as absolute fact. He finds his work challenging and interesting, but starts to increasingly wonder about the real facts that are hidden in the past and deeply questions \\"Ingsoc\\" (the form of English Socialism in Oceania's government). Winston begins keeping a journal of his thoughts about life and government, sitting at a place in his house away from his telescreen so he can't be watched. This is just one small part of a chain of events that leads him to become increasingly evasive and defiant of the Party, trying to keep out of the government's watch.Winston becomes romantically involved with a girl named Julia, who also detests the government's restrictions and lies. Winston and Julia try to sneak away to places free from government surveillance as often as they can, so they can be together. Winston hears rumors of a \\"Brotherhood\\", a group secretly working to disobey, and perhaps eventually overthrow, the Party. He constantly searches for evidence that such a group really does exist and that there may be hope for a revolution after all.Orwell takes important details into consideration to make this society seem real, particularly \\"Newspeak\\". Newspeak is regarded as Oceania's official language, and is \\"the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year\\". The goal of Newspeak's usage is to narrow the range of thought and individuality. Synonyms and antonyms are constantly being obliterated and many meanings can be summed up with greater rapidity than in \\"Oldspeak\\" (standard English) through abbreviations. Though Oldspeak is still used throughout the course of the novel, Newspeak phrases often appear in government publications and occasionally in dialogue. One of the common expressions, \\"doublethink\\", occurs when citizens accept the government's new and false facts as truth, in the place of previously established and real facts. The fear and oppression within such a society, where words are twisted in the government's favor and freedom of expression is destroyed, is conveyed with incredible believability in Orwell's work."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"After reading this book for a class, I realized how true it was. George Orwell predicted the future and what is really going to happen. Although he figured it to be around 1984, it is in the process of happening now. The government is slowly taking over us by taking away our God-given individual rights, and they are doing it right in context with their (insiders) plan. In 1984, he said that we were going to end up having a system where we won't even have money in our pockets, it would automatically be put into the bank at the end of each work week. Then if we needed to pay for something, we are assigned individual numbers for which we use. Everything Orwell predicted is actually happening now, but most people see it as a good thing that the government has planned for us. If they actually researched more in-depth than the media, they can find out what is really going on. Orwell was not wrong when he knew that the government was going to be controlling our lives, and I personally think this book was a warning. This book was very early for its' time to most people, but little do Americans know how long this conspiracy has been going on. 1984 was a very scary novel to read, especially to think that it will eventually happen to us if we lose our rights guaranteed to us in the Constitution of the U.S.A.The main point I gathered from this book is that if we don't take control, we will be controlled."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Overall, this book is pretty good. It's creepy, though! We should all take it as a warning about the kind of world we could become-- one with a totalitarian government who watches you constantly and takes away your every freedom, even freedom of thought-- if we don't adhere to our beliefs and preserve the human nature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In my senior year in high school, I was assigned three books to read; Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, and 1984. 1984 had the greatest impact on me of any book I ever read.

The main reason for this is that I managed to read it after I had been in the Army for over three years. After reading it I realized that the Army wasn't just an OK place anymore, it was actually bad, very, very bad. After I got out I realized just how much it applied to general society outside as well. I guess what I am trying to say is that everyone should read this book to realize just how important the right to make your own decisions about your own life really are"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the best books everwritten. 1984 isn't just a science fiction story, it's also, moreimportantly, a warning. In a time when cameras are being placed on street corners, it's almost ironic to watch as so many of Orwell's predictions have become a reality. It really doesn't matter what year this is; 1984 will always be important."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"We all know that the year 1984 has come and gone, but Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world is becoming timelier than ever. 1984 is still the great modern classic of the &quot;negative Utopia&quot;-a startingly original and hounting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny this novel's power, its hold on the imagination of whole generatins,or the power of its admonitions-a power that seems to grow not lessen, with the passage of time.It is the story of a man by the name of Winston Smith he lives in a time when love of a woman is illeagal not just the act but the nature and feelings to one. A time when you are watched by your television and never have a life by yourself. A time when no one is safe from big brother. And a time when no one can rebel."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell creates a frightening picture of how easy it is to manipulate human minds using extreme nationalism, unification from a common enemy, misplaced love, and the love of hating things.

Orwell paints a future so totally evil that it takes one some time to recover"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"By revealing the extreme; George Orwell, in 1984, described a chilling reality. This reality was a testimony to the extremes that a government could reach if given the license to do so. Big Brother is a microcosom for the greater socialistic atmosphere that was created in the Soviet Union of the 1940's."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read 1984 when I was in High School and its still amazing how many of us remember it and refer to &quot;big brother&quot; in our everyday lives. After all 1984 has come and gone but has the concept of an all seeing government watching our every move? We are in a digital world we every bank transaction, movie rented,item we buy can be electronically tracked that allow others to see more of our private lives than we realize. Doesn't it ever make you wonder where all the junk mail comes from? The concept is still valid and probably more so...it would be interesting to see what the generation X'ers think."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When 1984 was first published, Orwell's fellow socialists denounced it for its clear criticism of Stalinist Communism along with the Nazi regime and all other forms of totalitarianism. After two generations, the common view was that 1984 was on-target for its time but was now dated as the Communist regimes evolved into ordinary authoritarian ones. Today techno-enthusiasts like Peter Huber say 1984 was based on fallacies, because the spread of information technology aids freedom, not oppression. And to today's teenagers, the totalitarian experience seems to be ancient history. Why should anyone still read 1984?Partly, of course, they should read it for the same reason they should read Wiesel, Milosz, Solzhenytsin, and many others-- because we ought to remember the evils of this century for memory's sake. But the autobiographies and histories written by those who lived under these most evil of regimes-- important as they are-- necessarily offer a bottom-up view of them.1984, among many other things, offers insight into the psychology and mindset of the rulers, the torturers, the propagandists. Through reading a (possibly forged) samizdat manifesto, through his conversations with O'Brien, and through his knowledge of the workings of the Party's rewrites of history and language, Smith learns-- and through him, we learn even more-- about the tight links among cruelty, terror, and power over the body and the mind.At the moment we are mostly free of the specific kinds of regimes Orwell attacked, though we should not lightly assume that they will never return. We are not and probably will never be free of those who seek power for power's sake, of those who use torture and terror, of cruel and evil rulers and would-be rulers. We are not free of the corruption of history and language by politics. 1984 is in that greatest of categories of fiction-- the literature that allows its readers to understand reality better."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I didn't expect much from a book written in 1949. I thought I was going to read about ideas which we would view as humorous living in the 90's. But Orwell's vision of the 1984 might as well be called any year in the future. For one simple reason, this could happen too easily. The three powers Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia are in fighting a war that keeps there citizens in oppresion. Only a handful of secretive revolutions toil in the dirty, drab society of 1984. To read this book is to almost read a non-fictional work of the struggle of man and the over powering forces of government at work. Winston Smith is an ordinary character who leads us through the innermost thoughts of human psyche and the truthes and terrors which lie within. This book is scarier than any work by Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft or Dean Koontz. Quite simply put the dangers of the olligarchy collectivism seem to real and are just as close to home as they were to readers of the 50's and 60's."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 must be called an epic. Few stories have so firmly entrenched themselves into the fabric of our society like Orwell's masterpiece. From the concept of Big Brother to those of &quot;newspeak&quot; and &quot;thought crime,&quot; this book has filled several voids in our language. Perhaps the book has frightened us into paying it homage. It hits us at home by addressing issues such as our right to privacy, the extent of control a government should wield over its people, the boundaries of patriotism, the value of love. This novel runs deep in my veins for these reasons and more. In case you hadn't noticed the 6 movies, 15 albums and 3,645 features on 1984, it is the story about life in a hypothetical future. At the time Orwell wrote the novel, the year 1984 was a far-off place in the future. Now it belongs to an era with which we associate opulence and injurious Presidents. For the sake of argument, however, 1984 represents a hypothetical future in any era whereby government has reached too far down our pants. We follow the life of poor Winston, smoking his Victory cigarettes and drinking his Victory coffee, who has the unfortunate affliction of thinking for himself. We follow Winston through the dim corridors of his housing facility hoping that he remembers, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING. Big Brother is watching Winston and the rest of the community to make sure they stick to the law. After all, they must keep up in their perpetual war with Eurasia and Oceania, the ENEMIES. Of course, Winston has the misfortune of falling in love with a woman, which has no place in the effort to win the war. You'll have to read the book to find out what they do with Winston... This novel builds on a brilliant premise that makes the reading - and learning - fascinating throughout. Read it before the government tells you that you can't."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 was a compelling, haunting book. I liked this book and would give it an &quot;10&quot; because, although it dealt with large contemporary political issues, it addressed them in a personal way. The reader was forced to see that human dignity, intellectual integrity, freedom, and personal needs of love, passion, family, warmth, and security were mankind's true imperatives. This was a message worth both sending and receiving. It was conveyed on an individual scale that engendered an effective emotional reaction. I liked Winston; I wished to free him. I hoped he would escape into the &quot;prole&quot; world with Julia and be content. When Winston was captured I wanted his torture to cease; but most of all I longed for his intellectual integrity to survive-its destruction was devastating. For me, therefore, Orwell created an effective warning. Winston told Julia &quot;we are the dead,&quot; since because of their individuality, private beliefs, and his intellectual integrity they were doomed. Thus, Orwell vividly reminded us that we must value and safeguard our personal freedoms."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I found 1984 to be a fascinating and realistic portrayal of human nature. Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Alright, George Orwell was largely wrong in one of his major premises- technology ended up undermining totalitarianism. Technologies like the Worldwide Web have lubricated the flow of ideas; government hacks are too incompetent, lazy and stupid to crack down effectively on computer users. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was anti-Stalinist to his core and this book is a brilliant attack on the whole Stalin machine. Sometimes the best critics of a system or idea are those who share some of the same assumptions. No right-winger has ever been as effective (with the possible exception of Solzenhitsyn) in bludgeoning Stalinism. Orwell is unusually prophetic in his use of the Telescreen as a government propaganda device and indoctrinator. Remember, television was in its infancy when Orwell wrote this book in the late 40s. Television has become a propaganda device though it is not used as crudely as in the Big Brother state of Orwell's 1984. Television has effectively dumbed down the population with insipid, trite programming to the point where the average bloke is as intellectually tame and lazy as the Julie Christie character in Fahrenheit 451 (one has to believe that Ray Bradbury was heavily influenced by 1984). Television has numbed the brains of a majority in the Western world to where they are compliant to the whims and wishes of the current ruling classes. One last night- George Orwell's mastery of language is a thing of beauty. Read him for the robust joy of the written word."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is an incredible book. It'll totally change the way you think. That's the irony of the book. Orwell seems to be trying to make you think, Don't let people control what you think. Irony aside, this foul little book seems to be a commentary on both bourgeousie and socialist society, which makes it ever more timely. A great companion for Brave New World and Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a wonderful book almost every moment is gripping. I'm 14 so the parts that I found less interesting or lost the storyline I probably misunderstood the message. I gave it a 9 because the end made me angry I feel winston should've still hated big brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the first time I have read 1984. I guess it never came to be that any of my high school or college classes made it a required reading.Obviously, there is nothing one can add today to the discussion of the central theme of the book that probably has not been discussed already. However, I think it is a book that one needs to read and discuss today, and in the future, in terms of the parallels we find in Orwell's 1948 vision of 1984 and the world of today. It's bothersome to realize how many connections you can find on a global or national scale and then again on a smaller, local day-to-day scale. On the smaller, local scale I mean to include not just governmental but also office and even family.Orwell truly had an ability to identify and register the extremes that man is capable of obtaining. Through looking at the extremes we are able to see the potential harm that slight breaks in treasured behaviors and freedoms can lead to. Unapproved monitoring of the population, taking the face away from the enemy, the use of language to deny freedoms or manipulate facts and fear, torture for the sake of confession and re-education have all been headlines or points of discussions in the recent past and I am sure will be in the future. After all, man is man. Somehow Orwell captured a timeless and scary side of man in 1984.My one knock on the book is that somewhere in the second part of the book, I put it down and gave it a rest for some time. Somewhere in the middle of Winston and Julia's sadly dark utopia, I moved onward to something else. I did come back to it though and am glad I just didn't leave it unfinished.Anyway, enjoy the book. It's a great read that has multiple connections real or imagined to our lives."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a review of George Orwell's 1984.I had never gotten around to reading it before this. I found it to be great and truly profound.Big Brother is watching you! This is that book. One of the scariest I have ever read - not as in Dracula, but as in we have to make sure we don't slide into this and we may have started to.I saw a few parallels between my own experiences and what goes on in the book. That was more than a little upsetting.The whole thing about DOUBLETHINK was especially unsettling. People today do use this all the time - especially in the media. Not a good thing. Maybe if more people read this book, they would realize what they are doing and stop. I know I will be on the lookout so as to avoid being guilty of this myself.Though Orwell may not have thought about this when writing, he did seem to provide readers with a warning against politically correct speech going too far. Consider the issues with NEWSPEAK in the book and see what you think.There is a movie version with Richard Burton that is well done, but read the book first.If you haven't read 1984, then get hold of a copy and read it. If you have already read it, then read it again."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you read the book and look at our government you will be somewhat disturbed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Imagine a world where \\"freedom is slavery,\\" \\"war is peace\\" and \\"ignorance is strength.\\" The things we take for granted -- love and sexual relationships, a difference of opinion, private thoughts -- are taken away from you. Your nation (or in this case, the \\"Party\\") is your whole reason for being. You owe everything to it, including your life and every thought, and no other aspect of your life matters. In every corner of the city, telescreens (video cameras?) watch and dictate your every move, and the \\"Thought Police\\" are on the lookout for signs of traitorous thoughts. Once captured, traitors are erased from humankind as if they had never existed in the first place. The past doesn't exist, and no traces of history remain. Sex, wine, coffee and other pleasures are not allowed unless it benefits the Inner Party in some way. The world consists of three areas: Ocenia, Eruasia and Eastasia. Countries have lost their individualism and history. They are just a map in the globe. A new universal language in which the meaning of one's words are clear and devoid of deceit is being created...That is the world Winston Smith lives in. And that is the world George Orwell (real name is Eric Blair) envisioned back in 1948 (the last two digits diverted, very clever), two years before his death. 1984 is a futuristic novel with a political message. Orwell predicted that humans would become robots, a shell of their former selves, brought on by communism. The word \\"communism\\" is not used in the novel at all -- or at least I don't remember it being used -- and Russia is seldom mentioned, but it is clear that this is what the author alludes to. Orwell was an opponent of Russian communism at the time, and used his protestations to create fiction. Some describe this book as \\"prophetic,\\" and might even go as far as to say that some of the book's prophesies have come true, especially in the last couple of years. I know one thing though: Orwell's views were light years ahead of his time, and it is as impressive as it is frightening. As for the book itself, at first, it seemed boring to me. It just showcases the every day life of an average Joe with opposing feelings for the Party. He is paranoid about making wrong moves in front of the telescreens and other Party members, yet is helpless to resist his traitorous thoughts, going as far as writing them down on a personal diary. The first part also showcases what the Party consists of and the changes that London has gone through since the \\"Revolution.\\" Things get interesting when Winston meets Julia and begins an affair that could get them both into serious trouble. The third part is the most riveting -- and the spookiest. It is a thing of true nightmares. I can go into detail, but I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it yet. One thing I would say is that one of the novel's themes is centered on how human beings cannot be completely controlled, that their refusal to yield helps them survive even the most unfathomable torture. O'Brien and the Inner Party might have taken Winston's freedom, but they would never able to overtake his soul. But did they take his soul? Read the last sentence in the book. It shook me to the core. The language is dark and gloomy throughout the novel, and the ending is creepy in its subtlety. I could give out numerous examples about how real life events and political manipulation (the whole War Against Iraq, and the fact that easy access to one's credit, criminal, medical and employment history does make one feel that Big Brother IS watching us) that mirror Orwell's \\"negative utopia,\\" but others have done so already, and better than I would have done. All I know is that I love this book and will reread it again and again. I'll look into reading Animal Farm and other Orwell books in the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a classic, and should be read by everyone claiming to be literate.The good thing about this particular version is that it's relatively inexpensive, and doesn't have a lot of extra material.The bad part about this particular version is that the afterword, written by Erich Fromm in 1961, has been overtaken by events. Communism has been exposed as an unethical, immoral system, and I am offended by Fromm's suggestion of some kind of moral equivalence between capitalism and communism.There needs to be a new afterword, written sometime after the World Trade Center attacks. It would actually be nice to have two small afterwords, written by people on different sides of the political aisle."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The slogan Big Brother is Watching derives from this work. Winston Smith decides to keep a diary, (against all regulations prevalent in Oceania). He detects that a man named O'Brien is a fellow dissident. Smith works at the Ministry of Truth. The really scary organization is the Ministry of Love. The danger of history is not knowing history. Winston Smith has a problem. He remembers. Ingsoc may have dated back to 1960. Newspeak has a vocabulary that grows smaller every year. There is a Ministry of Plenty, but there is rationing. Winston separated from his wife eleven years earlier. The Party prefers celibacy.Winston believes the best chance for the future is the proletarians, (proles). He decides to wander among them. The one thing they pay attention to is the lottery. There are big prizes. The book shows Orwell's mastery of the uses of propaganda, the perils of bureaucracy, and an understanding of totalitarian trends as exemplified by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and in smaller ways by the modern democracies of England, the United States, and the colonies of India and Burma. Orwell was a student of the uses and abuses of authority. Winston Smith's descent among the proletariat resembles Orwell's experiences, THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER and DOWN AND OUT IN PARIS AND LONDON. Loving details of the scene reflect also Orwell's love of Dickens and Kipling.A girl from the Fiction Department writes a love note to Winston. He is amazed. They arrange to meet at a crowded square. Even though there are telescreens, it should be okay. (Not only is the Party Puritanical, but it is expected that Party members engage in wholesome communal activities. Sexual privacy induces hysteria.) Surveillance of citizens is carried on with the cooperation of other citizens rather in the way of Stasi or the block captains of Chairman Mao. Winston rents a room above a shop. Julia brings Inner Party coffee to the meeting, not the victory coffee everyone else drinks. Winston and Julia know their conduct is suicidal, but they continue. Winston is no longer bored with life.Julia believes that everyone secretly hates the Party. As under Stalin, there are show trials. (Taking things a step further, there are hate campaigns. One means of civil control by the Party is mass demonstrations.) Children are encouraged to spy on their parents. Winston explains to Julia that the past is actually being abolished. Suddenly Oceania is at war with Eastasia. All information concerning Oceania's war with Eurasia has to be obliterated.The Party has an enemy, Emmanuel Goldstein, a Trotsky-like figure. There is an anti-Party organization, the Brotherhood. Goldstein has a book, although most copies have been destroyed. O'Brien endeavors to get a copy of it for Winston and Julia. Reading Goldstein's book, Winston learns that the three superstates are permanently at war. Even if war hysteria is continuous, war takes place on the margins, and is the product of specialists. War cannot be decisive because the parties are too evenly matched. War uses up surpluses. A war that is continuous ceases to be dangerous. Party weapons are doublethinks and the mutability of the past.The end is nightmare. There is a Cold War flavor to this, (Orwell seems to have anticipated everything). Beyond politics there is the point, raised recently in a journal, that the author of this masterpiece was dying of tuberculosis during its composition. It is his testament. Our clever author has left us with a prized gift at the end of the volume, an Appendix detailing the Principles of Newspeak. Bravo--this is a book to be read and reread only by the strong-minded."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the gold standard dystopian novel which all others are wan and pale by comparison with, and it is so clear and brilliant that it makes the mind reel at its inventions and delivery. If it were discovered a few thousand years from now the reader would still get the sense that at best, civilization was teetering on the edge of annihilation at the hands of its own institutions. There is a timelessness and immediacy in the prose which defies description. Every character in this book is suffering in ways that strip him or her of all the joys that can be shared between people. Only a genius in immense pain is capable of producing a work of this caliber; this is the culmination of a life that was, in the writing of this book, essentially sacrificed. When some people die young we think they left great works undone, but if someone makes something like this, it's something we should all be thankful for and leave it at that; no one having done a thing like this can have died in vain. Of the few that can make a book like this in the first place, only one of them has. This is a treasure of the most vital importance and I say this without hesitation or fear of contradiction, one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Absolutely scary outlook on the ramifications of allowing government to creep incrementally into our lives--eventually consuming and controlling every one of our actions.

Winston becomes a free thinker in a society where the Thought Police will kill for doing such criminal acts. He starts to rebel against Big Brother in ways that I couldnt even believe (writing in a diary, having sex, purchasing certain items at a store). Winston's journey is a scary one from beginning to end. Part three is especially creepy. I know that this story is very extream, but it is kinda crazy how it describes things that happen in our world today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Big Brother is watching in a utopian vision of 1984 where everyone is being watched. With the invent of modern cell phone technologies and such it is entirely possible that we are all being watched by someone or multiple someone's without being made aware. Love is also forbidden and mixing between classes is frowned upon. Love in modern society is under attack by the pressures of a bad economy, work schedules, children, and fifty bajillion other things and I personally have noticed that there isn't exactly a lot of mixing between people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and occupations, so my thought is are we really that far from the basic concepts of 1984 : technological watching possible at any moment, a loss of love and intimacy and a divides between ethnic and cultural groups that still can't mix ?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'm a first time reader of 1984 and am in love. I can't believe that it didn't show up in my reading list before now! I have been a long time fan of dystopia and am so excited to have read finally a founding book of the genre.I was absolutely enthralled. It has been a while since a book has grabbed me like this.

Since then it has had a lasting impression on me. It really makes you think. It was a pleasure to read and have read it a bunch of times since then.

This book is highly entertaining to read and will change your life as you know it. I'm glad I was forced to read as a teenager."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Too much has been said about this novel to even try to be original in a review. I will underline that this is one of the most important books I have ever read. It taught me the value of freedom, its pricelessness in fact.The book is written very well, fluent prose and gripping plot, but that is not its main value. The value is its moral about democracy, which we may take for granted now but is to be nourished all the time. The book, of course, was written in the late forties, at the height of Stalinism, so it is obvious it refers to that scenario, at the peak of the Cold War. But too many people seem to forget the value of democracy today, in the information age.One could argue that Orwell was wrong about the state controlling people through technology, in fact internet has provided all of us with tremendous power of horizontal communication that governments have a hard time controlling. But the game is an ongoing one... not yet over! I think this book should be taught in schools."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Well I just finished reading this book about a half hour ago and I've been trying to find even a sliver of hope within its pages. When O'Brien hands Winston the book about the underground movement known as The Brotherhood and swears Winston to do anything for the movement, I have to believe that there is a possibility that the Brotherhood does actually exist and that O'Brien is an actual member of this Brotherhood. I recognize that later in the story O'Brien is the one torturing him but remember that one must always show no sign of deception to Big Brother in order to not be discovered. O'Brien must play his role in order to avoid detection and may have simply been better at avoiding detection by being a long time member of the underground movement and knowing ways to avoid detection. Winston may have been discovered through his careless acts by the various spys and/or telescreens.I felt that the arguments between O'Brien and Winston was the climax in the story and it was my favorite section to read. The ending where Winston meets Julia again one last time seemed to me to be the saddest part of all as Big Brother has destroyed there love for one another and their humanity."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Over the years I've read 1984 many times, the first time was for a book report in High School and the last couple of times as a paperback.

It is beautifully written and one of my all time favorites. I recommend it for everyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's last book - 1984 was published in 1949 for the first time. It has since been reprinted in 1961, 1977, 1981 and 2003.Many reviews have been written. I do not presume to have anything new to say about the book.As the author of the foreword of the Centennial Edition, Thomas Pynchon, observed \\"It is not difficult to guess that Orwell, in 1984, was imagining a future for his son's generation, a world he was not so much wishing upon them as warning against. He was impatient with predictions of the inevitable, he remained confident in the ability of ordinary people to change anything, if they would.\\" It seems to be a thread woven through the book...\\"that human decency, like parental love, can always be taken for granted - a faith so honorable that we can almost imagine Orwell, and perhaps even ourselves, for a moment anyway, swearing to do whatever must be done to keep it from ever being betrayed.\\"In his Afterword, Eric Fromm offers this observation. \\"Orwell. . .is implying that the new form of managerial industrialism, in which man builds machines which act like men and develops men who act like machines, is conducive to an era of dehumanization and complete alienation, in which men are transformed into things and become appendices to the process and production and consumption...Orwell...is not a prophet of disaster. He wants to warn and awaken us....the danger with which all men are confronted today, the danger of a society of automatons who will have lost every trace of individuality, of love, of critical thought, and yet who will not be aware of it because of 'doublethink.'\\"Fromm continues \\"Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings. and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.\\"As in all timeless creative writing Orwell has given us, the reader, many lessons. He has raised the alarm - it is up to us - 21st century humans - to heed it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I personally hold this book in so high a regard that I find myself unable to make it justice by way of an extensive review, so I'll try to keep it brief. For me this is perhaps the greatest novel of the past century, almost any other book looks childish and frivolous by comparison as regards style, narrative pace, plot, structure and of course allegorical and metaphoric power (\\"The Trial\\" by Kafka, is the only other worthy contender of \\"1984\\" that I can think of).Orwell masterfully describes a nightmarish future in which all individual liberties have been rooted out. The book chronicles the alienated existence of Winston Smith, a minor bureaucrat, and his personal and solitary rebellion against the establishment until the final annihilation of his personality. There is terror and horror in literature (as understood by authors like Poe, Lovecraft, Barker, etc) and then there is this book, which is one of the most disturbing experiences a reader can face in a lifetime. Some people hate it precisely because of its very bleak denouement. I can tell you that this is a compelling novel that will stay with you after days of having finished it. It is also one of the very few literary triumphs hailed in equal measure during decades by critics and readers alike. No other writer that I know of has been able to describe the sheer abstract terror exemplified by the infamous Room 101. Horror has many faces and the powers that be many ways of imposing their tyranny upon an isolated individual. Unfortunately, there are things worse and more humiliating than death, and that is what the protagonist of this terrifying novel will discover...It is difficult for me to find any kind of flaws in this book, the underlying message is tremendously powerful and the writing addictive and stylish, plus the plot leaves you virtually breathless. It ranks easily as the very best dystopian fiction ever written, and it doesn't look like it is going to be overthrown in the near future. George Orwell who, some years prior to the publication of this book, already showed to the world what he was capable of with his amazing \\"Animal Farm\\", inscribes himself with ease among the greatest authors of all time thanks to this masterpiece.Do not go to your grave without having read this book first."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I had to read 1984 in high school for English, usually I never engaged with the required readings for class and sometimes I wouldn't even read the book, but 1984 was an exception.

I remember we had to do chapter summary oral presentations in class and we went through about 10 chapters a class, but I was only up to chapter 4 at the time, I used to either block my ears or skip those classes! Riveting read! Chances are if you're reading this, you've already read 1984, and if you haven't then you must pick it up. Basically the plot follows a character named Winston Smith as he attempts to hang onto his humanity and creativity in a dystopic society that has abandoned both.

While i was reading, i was truely affected by this book, and i really couldn't force myself to put it down except to sleep.I'm really tired of kids complaining that it has a sad ending: it couldn't have worked out any other way.

It is certainly about communism. You can tell from their physical descriptions that Big Brother is Stalin and Goldstein is Trotsky. At a time when many people admired the Soviet Union, George Orwell saw the Soviet system for what it was- a brutal dictatorship based on fear. However, it is not just about communism. It is a warning against all totalitarian systems of thought that seek to impose forcibly a particular ideology on people and to mould people at will. Winston Smith's struggle to hold on to objective truth in a world of lies and human decency in a world of cruelty symbolises the real life struggle to do just that of so many people in this century that has brought us the horrors of the Gulags and Auschwitz."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"After being a smart English teacher for 41 years in Venice, I've reached the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a vivid satire on the Russian Revolution.

This and the description of the many approaches used by the state to assure the loyalty of its people make this an all-time great. Plotwise, the key approach is the use of Emanuel Goldberg to locate and draw out those who are not loyal to Big Brother.

The book reads as if it were written only yesterday with many aspects of the story describing the current state of affairs in America and warning of the dangerous path that we as a nation are travelling down - a path where we are coaxed by fear into giving up essential liberties and freedoms in exchange for greater &quot;protections&quot; from numerous false threats to our security. Ours is a nation that has become consumed with fear, and consequently one whose people are willing to swallow whatever bogus stories our leaders come up with to justify their unjustifiable wars and the profiteering they engage in. &quot;[The people] could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.&quot; Ignorance and fear have taken over our lives in America, and Orwell shows us in frightening detail where it must eventually lead.

Oceania is a nightmare of totalitarianism. The Party controls everything, from Oceania's history to people's freedom of thought. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. Big Brother is always watching you. Winston Smith is a rebel who is desperate to overthrow this all-powerful system. Nineteen Eighty-Four documents his quest for a way to defeat the Party.This book astonished me from beginning to end. The things I love most about it are its unrelenting darkness, each part's unique theme, and its overall message. The dark tone fits the book perfectly. The way everything unfolds paints a picture of bleakness and horror. The layout of the story is what interested me the most. It's organized into three distinct parts: Part I illustrates the world around Winston Smith, Part II describes the hopeful steps Winston takes toward rebellion, and Part III recounts Winston's downfall. Most importantly, I could comprehend the urgency of Orwell's message. The author's purpose was clear: to communicate not the evils of socialism itself, but the dictatorship and tyranny that complements it if it falls into the wrong hands.I strongly recommend reading Nineteen Eighty-Four. It is a landmark classic. The external story is pretty easy to follow, but you'll only truly enjoy it if you are able to interpret its underlying meaning. If you can understand its message, then you, like me, will love this book to death."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A Review by Jordan1984, by George Orewell is a book about what our Country could be like in a negative point of view in the year 1984. The book begins with a future Government trying to gain complete power of the world and its people. In this world there are no freedoms, no freedom of thought, no freedoms at all. The thoughts of the totalitarian Big Brother and the Party were nothing but complete power. Can you have complete power without pain and torture? The Party and Big Brother control everything, history, science, time, everything. Also the Party and Big Brother believed that if enough people believed something is it not true? They think if enough people believe that 2+2=5 then does it not?I liked how the book kept you in suspense and how it was somewhat dark. The plot is very well done. I also liked how Winston started as a Loyal to Big brother and then changed and joined the rebellion. The author allows your mind run wild with ideas of what is happening or will happen to Winston. I really liked how the author actually made you think that it is possible for out government turn out like this or maybe already headed that way.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi books and dark adventures and mysteries."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"First off it was a great book, and i wanted to say something to Sheri that lives in Grennsboro,north Carolina, when you said that George Orewell needed to stop writing books i almost crapped my pants because he has stoped because he is DEAD stupid!Anyways it was a great book and you should read it. It makes you think about what our country could have been like if we made the wrong choices or lost a war."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It feels a bit hard to add my thoughts about this much discussed masterpiece but I will do the best I can. 1984 tells us of a (not so) distant future where all our thoughts and actions are watched by fascist leaders. We follow our anti-hero Winston throiugh a journey of discovery and rebellion. To say more would spoil the fun of this book. This book is a thriller for the thinking mind. Do these leaders actually exist or is it all a sham? Will Winston succeed? It also raises questions towards our modern world in which there are cameras almost everywhere and in which we are constantly using newspeak don't u think? (hehe) A great pessimistic work. Though it is realist in the context of the dictatorship it describes. Also note the theme of the liberating woman which has been used many times in literature notably in \\"We\\" by Zamiatine (a precursor to Orwell ). I could say much more but I have a feeling everything I've already said has been said over and over again. So just read it and join the revolution of the masses."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I finally got round to reading this 'classic', and I must say I wasn't too disappointed, as up until now I've disliked nearly all the so called classics I've read. The first two parts of the book are largely mediocre- Orwells writing style has never really been particularly special and the world and characters he depicts are somewhat clumsy.It is only upon reading the final part of the novel that this book rises above the crowd, as Orwell firmly clarifies the message of the book, not only depicting the true horror of an omnipotent dictatorship, but also the systematic manipulation of information and fact to it's ultimate extreme. This latter point has tremendous relevance as it does occur in western societies, hence in America words such as 'liberal' have had their meaning altered by the media to the point at which they become non descriptive, merely remaining as a form of abuse. This use of language manipulation is revealed in the book to be the final step in ultimate control- to manipulate peoples actual ability to think.The book does leave the reader with much to ponder, and indeed many will take different messages away from it, though I must admit how anyone who has read the whole book can go away thinking that it was merely a straight forward attack on communism, is beyond me. Left, right and centre poltics are all capable of using the methods warned against in this book, and have all done so to a certain degree.Overall, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell wrote a classic novel, 1984, which was, at the time, science fiction. It was a look into a forbidding totalitarian future. The enemy was Communism.After the inevitable nuclear war, the world has been divided into three sectors. The sectors are at continual war with each other, necessitating severe restrictions on personal freedoms. London is capital of the sector of Oceania. Here, Winston Smith is a clerk, working for \\"Big Brother,\\" the media-hyped totalitarian dictator who keeps a close watch on all of his subjects. One can almost hear him saying, \\"If you are talking on the phone with someone from another sector, we want to know.\\"When Winston discovers a little personal freedom, he is amazed. Delving further, he carries on a love affair. But this is all forbidden. Officials try to brainwash him into giving up his free will, using torture, sleep deprivation, and psychology (finding out what he fears most). Finally they make up give up not only his free will, but his reason. The interrogator holds up two fingers and gets Winston to say he is holding up three fingers.One can hear the chilling line in today's world: \\"Winston, tell me about how we can cut taxes for the rich, and cut benefits for the poor. That is only justice, right, Winston?\\"They work on his girlfriend the same way. And they pit one against the other until their loyalties are to Big Brother alone.The book was also an admonition against the Nazi dictum that if you repeat a lie loud enough and often enough it becomes the truth. We are making progress on the war in Iraq, aren't we Winston? Or is it the war in Vietnam? I forget. You should forget.As early as the 1960's Charles Colson was raising his technique of \\"mind f**king\\" to an art form. As documented in David Halberstam's book, The Best and the Brightest, when Colson became a White House operative he put his method to work full time in the service of the almost imperial president. To some, it looked like 1984, spying on the anti-war demonstrators. And people still remembered Orwell's novel. Of course, Colson went to jail for his role in Watergate. Watergate? What was that? I forget.Now, in the post-9/11 world, we need strict curtailment of free will. After all, we are in an unending war with terrorism. We have periodic episodes of the \\"three minute hate,\\" to vilify Osama bin Laden, or Ayman al Zawahiri, or some other \\"evil-doer.\\" The White House spokesman will give us all the details we need to know about warrantless wire-tapping. Or, perhaps, the House will just change the law that makes this type of surveillance illegal.We all have cameras on our computers that we could hook up so that Big Brother could watch us all the time. We like surveillance cameras. They make us feel safe. At least, since they put that rat mask over my face, I've been convinced that I like surveillance cameras. They make me feel safe.You can read this book if you like, but whatever you do, don't take it out of a library.Buy it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Certainly not a book for high school kids (I wish teachers were assigning more age-appropriate books). I first read it at 17, and that was too early. One of the greatest masterpieces of world literature. The book is too complex and multi-faceted to be discussed here. Indeed, it is like a Rorschach test - everyone finds something of oneself in it, or projects on it something that is not there. I would just like to correct some gross misinterpretations.1) This is not a prediction. Maybe Orwell should've called it &quot;Any year&quot;. The year 1984 came up simply because he took the number of the year when he was writing (1948) and reversed the last two digits. This book is not a prediction, it is a warning and a description.2) This is not a satire or an exaggeration. OK, maybe to a small extent (governments still cannot read people's thoughts). It is certainly not a fiction about a made-up world and it is not just a philosophical musing on life and humanity. While to the people in the West it might sound exaggerated or absurd, to those from the Communist world it is very precise and factual. Orwell is the only Western writer who got a true description of totalitarian communist reality. He got it perfect down to tiny details, such as the absence of razor blades.3) This is certainly about Communists, but it is more than just about Communists. By the time he wrote it, Orwell was not a communist any more. He was not a Trotskyite (in Animal Farm Trotsky/Snowball is just as much a pig as Stalin/Napoleon). He was not a socialist or an anarchist. He was an individual beyond labels. 1984 is a book about totalitarianism in whatever form and under whatever label.4) This is not about all of us. One has to make distinctions. Modern U.S. is far from an Orwellian society, surveilance cameras and political correctness nonwithstanding and whatever paranoids might think. Most of the newspeak in the West is self-imposed: people prefer to be blind slaves. Should one of us desire to break their personal mental chains, doublethinks, etc., who is there to stop us? But there are some countries that are indeed Orwellian. A short list:a) Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea) - the most Orwellian of them all.b) Burma. Sorry, Myanmar (they renamed the country, just like in &quot;1984&quot;, England is renamed into Airstrip One).c) Afghanistan - dictatorship in the making. (&quot;1984&quot; plus civil war).d) Islamic Republic of Iran.e) Libya.f) Peoples Republic of China. &quot;Ministry of Plenty&quot; might be closed there, but &quot;Ministry of Love&quot; is certainly not. This country alone is 1/4 of humanity: how about that.g) Iraq.h) Syria.i) Cuba.j) Vietnam.Plus most of Africa and quite a few other places. Plus all kinds of cults. As you see, the book is still quite relevant. It describes what was and is. Be grateful that you don't live there."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair, was nearly alone amongst British socialists in his ability to see through the socialist rhetorical fog and saw that Russia's Stalin was not a socialist but an anti-socialist tyrant. George Orwell was to British socialism what Robert Higgs is to American conservatism. Higgs can see through the propaganda and information warfare propagated by the British sleeper cell in Washington and he sees George W. Bush as the anti-American, anti-conservative monstrous tyrant that he is.Orwell, who worked for the BBC during World War II and was therefore quite familiar with the state's disinformation methods in support of information warfare, could see right through Stalin's disinformation as easily as Higgs can see through Bush's today. Bothersome to Orwell was his fellow socialists refusal to see the truth on Stalin or that Soviet Communism was actually a betrayal of socialism. Orwell wrote \\"Animal Farm\\" just to make this point. Yet too many socialists remained duped over Stalin just as too many conservatives remain duped today by George W. Bush and his army of word-pushers.So Orwell set out to write \\"1984\\" to explain to us how people are duped by statist techniques of information warfare; how people can believe \\"WAR IS PEACE\\"; and how socialists were duped by Stalin. He drew heavily upon his experiences at the BBC where he had signed the Official Secrets Act barring him from mentioning anything he had done. So he set the novel in the future and maintained that any similarities were pure coincidence in order to cover himself from being charged with violating the Official Secrets Act.In 1984, there is a dreary monotony of provision in society rather than a vibrant free market; the heavy hand of the state has stunted everything. Food is bland and often rationed. Technical innovations are controlled by the state; two-way wall-sized televisions spy on people; the Thought Police (a futuristic version of Homeland Security, or is it vice-versa?) monitors thoughtcrime. Hidden microphones add to their NSA-like arsenal of state control and state terrorism.The novel's main character is Winston Smith - nearly forty and one of the few remaining humans that can remember having parents, who had sacrificed their lives to the state so that the youthful Winston may have a chance at life. He works for the State as a wordpusher, rewriting current events and even history books - turning history into \\"his story\\". Yet, he is society's few remaining yet hidden libertarians - a person who thinks and feels for himself. Watched always, he must remain on guard to never betray any emotion.The plot centers around Winston meeting a female supporter of the Party whose hidden agenda is much more hedonistic. They have a relationship between them, at the risk of all. In fact, they know their relationship is doomed and their actions to be suicidal. The heavy weight of the state looming over their heads is tragic. Like an Iraqi or Afghan today, they never know when the crushing weight of the state will descend.In the end, the state catches up with the two individualists. They are arrested and sent to a type of Guantanamo Bay where Winston is finally broken by his fear of rats - \\"Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. . . Not me! Julia! Not me!\\". Winston lost his love for Julia - his ability to sacrifice himself on behalf of another. Yet through sacrifice lies our hope.Pynchon's Foreward is awesome: \\"This grouping of Britain and the United States into a single bloc, as prophecy, has turned to be dead-on\\", he wrote. Actually, Orwell probably knew something about the British sleeper cell dispatched to Washington to pull America back into the second part of the world war. Orwell probably knew, too, that FDR provoked the Japanese to hit Pearl Harbor and sat on his hands while they did it, so that the Yanks would become war crazy and provide the brawn to British empire (which they did). Nicholas John Cull's \\"Selling War\\" is a good review of the British sleeper cell.Today, Bush and Blair are doing American-powered British empire hand-in-hand. An American can only wonder what George Washington would say?!! But I wonder, too, what Orwell would say? Or has he already said it?!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a thought provoking novel about a future which we were fortunate to escape...or did we? I enjoyed this novel not because of the storyline itslef, but rather because of the theories and ideas brought forth by the story. Orwell writes of a man named Winston, his girlfriend Julia, and their boss/confidant O'Brien, in the future continent of Oceana. Oceana is constantly at war with one or both of the two other super-countries, Eurasia and Eastasia. 1984 is the tale of two people struggling for independence and freedom in a country where the government controls everything down to our very thoughts. Winston and Julia set out to change the way things are, or at least try, but after only scratching the surface of the true reasons behind the way things are, they find that the government, \\"Big Brother\\", has powers reaching far deeper than they ever could have imagined."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Isn't it eerie how the Patriot Act could have come straight out of this masterpiece? Don't we have people in jails right now in Gitmo, people who have been detained for no legal reason, except they might be &quot;terrorists?&quot; Doesn't the government now have the right to tap our phones and spy on us without a court order (a la Big Brother)? Many people thought this book was silly when the actual 1984 came and went without this apocalyptic vision becoming reality. However, 20 years later, you can't read this classic without getting a familiar chill down your spine as a &quot;president&quot; tries to find imaginary weapons while seemingly rewriting history? If any English teacher wants to assign this book in 2003, they can find plenty of real world parallels to it, which should get the kiddies' attention!!!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So powerful and yet still so relevant. Shows you power of independent thought."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 offers a brilliant foreshadowing of the world we are coming to. The inhabitants of Airstrip One, or London, are constantly under the watchful eye of Big Brother, the semi-divine and metaphorical leader of the party. All citizens of Oceania, one of three superpowers in the world (the other two being Eastasia and Eurasia) worship Big Brother. The slogans of the party are War is peace, Freedom is slavery, and Ignorance is strength. You can see all of these things in today's America. George Bush told the nation that he was entering into a very long term war that would lead to peace in the middle east. Sound familiar? Meanwhile, the government, in order to ultimately protect our rights, has passed bills such as the Patriot Act, which allows the government to tap into our phone conversations and even enter and search our homes without a warrant. This clearly and directly infringes on our fourth amendment rights, which states \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause...\\" And in today's society, there is certain knowledge that the general public is better off not knowing about. Who knows what the government is really up to? But if the general public knew all of the coverups the government has committed over the decades, the nation would panic and riot. The three slogans of the party, as predicted by George Orwell are very true today.The citizens of Oceania all believe in the party and in its slogans. They all wear blue overalls and conform to the party's principles. Much of the book is a shot at communism. This is evident in the fact that there are no laws in Oceania, yet you can be put to death for exercising free speech. Here Orwell was attempting to point out the hypocrisy of communism, the whole idea of \\"do your own thing, but only within what your comrades limit you to,\\" and I think he succeeded.In Airstrip One, there are four ministries which are the headquarters of the party. They are the Ministry of Love, the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Peace, and the Ministry of Plenty. One of the main principles of the party, Doublethink, is in full effect here. Doublethink is the practice in which someone simultaneaously believes two contradictory things for the benefit of the party. It is a common practice for any party loyalist. This applies to the ministries because they each concern themselves with just the opposite of their names. Love with torture,truth with lying,peace with war, and plenty with poverty. A loyalist must be able to practice doublethink because often times the party will state two contradictory things both as truth, and you must believe everything the party says. Doublethink is a fundamental practice of a partymember.But there is one man in the book who does not conform to this way of life. His name is Winston Smith. All through his life,he knew something was wrong with the way the world was. He would try to think back to when the world wasn't like this but he could never remember it. He knew that the party was not infallible as was the common belief. He stood and cheered at the news of a victory by the Oceanian army, but his heart was never in it. He thought he was alone.Then he met a young woman. He hated her because of her party pride. She proudly wore her Junior-Anti sex league sash and imploded at the sight of Emmanuel Goldstein, the leader of an association of anti-party advocates. But after a while he finds that she's not what she seems...Ok. If you're still reading this, which you're probably not, I'm not going to give away any more. But I strongly suggest that everyone read this book. It not only got me way into politics and the Libertarian cause for individual freedom, but it changed my life.

I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment.

Its one of those books that you finish reading and you just cant stop thinking about. \\"What's for dinner?\\" \\"Who cares, I just read 1984, food's not important.\\" Its unpredictable, its innovative and creative, and its captivating; all while making very good political points.

I feel that I lack the writing skills to fully summarize Orwell's masterpiece. I also feel I lack the ability to write a review about this book without hitting every possible cliche used to describe it, such as it being &quot;Orwell's masterpiece&quot; or that &quot;1984 is as timely now then it was then.&quot;It's odd, though, that my school never had me read this book. It's that book my teachers would always mention, but never put it in the curriculum. It really is a long read and I know that students today would object to that. And hell, in school I barely read, so I'd definitely object to it. But this year I've been struck with a burning desire to read, and read I have.I'm not going to elaborate what this book is about, since it's pretty well known. Even I had a basic idea of the plot years before I read it.All I can say is it's the most captivating book I've read. Never have I felt such empathy for the protagonists of the book, nor ever felt such hatred for the antagonists. The ending really brought out my emotions. Meaning, I didn't put it down and go &quot;Oh, it's over.&quot; I put it down and said &quot;Why is it over?&quot;It's a beautifully written book. I don't think we'll ever have another author like Orwell, who's hatred of dictatorships and oppressive regimes and hypocrisy was poured into his two most famous novels, Animal Farm and 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"[...] As for Orwell, I recommend &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; more highly than &quot;1984&quot;. But if you must read something dreary, Kafka is more profound and more imaginative (in my opinion).nston believes that there is another man who believes that the party is a fraud, his name is O?Brian. He helps them join into the brotherhood. The only problem with all of this is that they are all being watched and heard by the telescreens that are set up everywhere. The party has set up divisions within themselves to stop such things as thought crimes, and other things. Anything could give you away may it be a twitch, or your heart beats too fast. The type of conflict in the story is person vs. society; it is Winston and some of his friends against the world. I think that this book is really good and shows some of the conflicts that we face in our own lives today. Sometimes we feel like we want to get away from it all, but we are still being watched. We still end up finding places that we think are safe to speak our minds and safe to act as we wish but find that we are still being watched and being seen. In the book Winston and Julia think that they have found the perfect place to be alone and do as they please but find that they are still not by themselves, they are still watched which is the cause of there downfall. The book showed a relation to Christianity because of the fact that there was a higher power that no one could see or touch, but all felt was there. The Big Brother character of the book is like a god to the people of London in the story. Winston and Julia are the ones who feel like the party has too many rules and cannot be tolerated. Just like in life, a lot of people feel that Christianity has too many rules and is too overpowering. Christianity is a force like the party, it will never be defeated, and it will always be there. In the book Winston feels like the proletarians (common people outside the party) are the only ones who could defeat the party. I think the proletarians are like us, we just accept Christianity and do not question it. We figure that God is a force that should not be reckoned with so we do not object to it. Only a few people think that Christianity is untrue like how Winston feels about the party. 1984 was written in a 3rd person point of view and in a very descriptive point of view. I would give this book a rating of eight on a scale of one-ten, one being the highest and ten being the lowest. It showed how life could have been in 1984, although almost none of the things were accurate it still showed the conflicts of life, and the conflicts of trying to be different. I recommend this book to any one from twelve to any age over that. It is a tough book to read because of all the in depth description of everything but should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Eric Blair's 1984 is not only his finest work but also one of the most influential and provocative books of our time. The work obviates to us to full actuality how the world had evolved for the worse during the dark period from 1932 to 1949. Winston Smith and O'Brien are the most important characters whose keystone dialogue raises alert for the prospect of human future.Prophecy or Caution?While we might prefer to interpret \\"1984\\" as a precautionary tale or some social warning, bloodshed, warfare, massive torture and murder, not to mention Stalin's cruelty, the Nazi mechanized techniques of organized massacre, the Cambodian, the Iranian and the Iraqi, the North Korean, and all the other countless horrors, have inevitably to a certain degree changed \\"1984\\" from caution to warning, further elevating the work to a 20th century prophecy.Despair about Future of ManA sense of hopelessness about the future of man hovers over the book. In a way \\"1984\\" is an expression of such a hopeless mood about the bleak future of man. It warns readers that unless the course of history (and leaderships) changes men all over the world will forfeit most of their human qualities and become soulless automatons without being aware of the depravity.In the Winston Smith-O'Brien dialogue, \\"Imagine a boot stamping on the human face-forever\\" might have exaggerated the current state of human soulness. The 20th century history has confirmed and fulfilled dehumanized practices as mentioned in \\"1984\\" like 24/7 surveillance of all sounds, activities, and conversations; deprivation of freedom of speech, penitence for thought crime and wiping out of existence and memory and thus forfeiting any way to make appeal to future. For example, a Party member lived from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police. Even when he was alone he could never be sure he was alone. Wherever he may be, he could be inspected without warning and without knowing that he was being inspected.The Party tacitly encouraged prostitution as such outlets for instincts that could not be altogether suppressed. This unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members in order to remove all pleasure from sexual act. Even to his wife, a Party member was expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. A real romantic love affair was all it took to crumple the Party. Desire was deemed thought crime, which entailed death.The Party saw that it was not infallible and that all its belief rested on the omnipotent Big Brother. It therefore called for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts-alteration of the past and rewrite of history in order to wipe out existence of certain human beings and historical facts. It was not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases accurate. It was also that no change of doctrine or in political alignment could ever be admitted. Whatever the Party held to be truth was truth. It was impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.Notwithstanding the Party contrived to have its way and imbued the belief in people, how could the Party control people's memory? The Party had wiped out most of the older generation during the great purges and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender (sounds familiar like the Chinese Cultural Revolution?) When memory failed and written records were falsified, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.\\"1984\\" is meant to be read as a warning, an exhortation, and not so much prophesy. However exaggerated and haunting the negative utopia is being depicted, the book is a startling work of an imaginary world that is convincing. 4.0 stars.2004 (4)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is indeed one of the best books I have read, its a books that got you thinking about the events happening around you and getting you to arrive to your own conclusions. I do not think that a long continnous read is desired for this book, its a book that should be read in smaller sections and then *absorbed*, rather then in a long contineous run which in the end the reader fails to grasp the smaller more important details of the book.In visiting literary post boards, and from people's reactions in school (high school that is), I have noticed many people fail to see the clear difference between Bigbrother-ism and communism.Is Communism the same thing as Bigbrother-ism? To be frank, the answer would be an stern no.If you have paid enough attention to Emmanuel Goldstein's essay on &quot;War is Peace&quot; (chapter 3 of Goldstien's book) you should have noticed that the constant warfare is support by the government of the 3 powers (Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia) because without constant warfare a hierarchical society would cease to exist! The goal of communism is certainly not the existance of a hierachical socieity, but rather the elimnation of one.Stalinism, Maoism and perhaps even Leninism is not true communism, but a distorted version of communism, Stalinism, one can honestly say, is something that resmbles Bigbrother-ism. The constant warfare, as explained by Goldstein, is to prevent the build up of WEALTH in the general people. If WEALTH was evenly distrubuted, then POWER would be impossible to remain to a small privileged elite, therefore in order to have power, warfare is needed to take away wealth from the people and spent on military purposes. Therefore, one would be utterly mistaken to think of communism (the word &quot;commune&quot; as base) as the same thing as Bigbrother-ism.What Orwell offers us in 1984 is not something completely fantastic but very much likely to occur in the near future. Keeping secrets from the general masses, lies and propganda and the distoration of certain truths exists in all of the powerful &quot;democratic&quot; states. Orwell's Big brother simply goes a step beyond the conventional control and offers us a view of extreme control, in which only a small amount of people actually notices it. Rather, the general mass accepts it and whole-heartedly welcomes it (same as some of the general masses today), a very horrific thing to see.All in all, Orwell's book offers us a great, relavent story and desveres to be read by all who has an interest in our political future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a great book. The book is full of suspense, you never really know what is going to happen next. It is also scary that someone would predict the future to be so negative and it is even worse that some things in the book are actually happening today. The author really brings the to life book by using good diction. Overall, I immensely enjoyed this book and I believe it is a must read for all people."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is probably the most bonechilling novel I have ever read. It isn't even a cheap thriller either. A true testiment of the reality of human nature and that of the future. I cried at parts. Everybody should read this book at sometime in their life or they will be missing out on a chance to really understand how frightening Bolshevism could have been. I would also like to say that you shouldn't read this book to young or you will be shocked and you will also not fully understand it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In light of our current climate, a totalitarian government, the ministry of truth, newspeak, doublethink and the thought police seem chillingly real and not too far removed from our present circumstance. Inspite of the stark, cold, lonely world which Orwell warns us about,Winston, the main charecter shows us the real strength and ultimate weakness of human nature.It is a strong thought provoking and yet extremely touching work of genius.This is one of those books, which you will want to read again and againAs Orwell said &quot;during times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell wrote 1984 to show us his grim view on what shape life would take by the year 1984. Orwell not only wrote about the world of the future, but also stood out by writing his idea of the supremely successful, and everlasting government, the anti-Utopia. Within the story Orwell created the Brother Hood, an evil organization with advanced technology and the desire for power, even at the expense of sanity. Winston, the main character of the story, is a comrade under the Brother Hood. He turns out to be quite the odd man out, since Winston is always seeking for some sort of salvation from the evil grasp of the Brother Hood. Since the Brother Hood watches everyone in Oceania, the country Winston lives in, twenty-four hours a day through two-way telescreens, all personal and social lives of its countrymen are eliminated. The Brother Hood skillfully takes apart all connections between its citizens, leaving them weak and alone, also preventing them from rebellious organization. The Brother Hood destroyed the bonds between family members by instilling pure fear, the fear that your spouse, or even your child will turn you in for thought crime. To commit a thought crime, it would have to appear that your mind is thinking in some way that is opposing the Brother Hood and Big Brother's, the supreme ruler of the Brother Hood, bests interests. This is the Brother Hoods way of controlling what you think; giving them the power to break a man's sanity, and mold him in any way they please. This society formed as the anti-Utopia has one advantage over other ruling parties, it does not promise love and equality for its citizens in the end, but sets forth to create hate, separation, and total inequality among people, making their rule everlasting and indestructible."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"_Yeah. So I was bored. I picked this book up and read it cover to cover.When I finished, I was sortof angry, to be truthful. I was mad at the author when I read the ending. I wanted, y'know, a black-and-white storybook-type finale and was pissed when it didn't come. Yup.But after my temper had cooled and I pitched a couple pillows around the room (not literally, whaddya think I am, insane?), I sat down to think about what the author was trying to say with his book. And now I am really happy with the way he concluded the tale. Yeah, I know. I sound like one of those annoying English Teachers with their \\"What does this Symbolize\\" questions (no offense to all you teachers out there).But seriously. This book reminded me of all that BullS*** propaganda pervading countries around the world - And YES, that includes the US. The \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\" that runs throughout Orwell's book reminds me a bit of good ol' Uncle Sam, y'know? Which is kinda freaky.Anywho. READ THIS BOOK!! You can yell at me afterwards if ya didn't like it, but give it a chance. PLEASE!! I disagree with these (*cough* STUPID *cough*) critics writing on Amazon who are saying that only old folks will like this book. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?!? I'm 15 and I liked it. What am I saying... I didn't like it... I -L-O-V-E-D- it! I'm a highschooler (we tend to have short attention spans sometimes).GIVE THE BOOK A TRY!!! for me? (can't you just imagine those little puppy dog eyes begging you to read this book?) TRY THE BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I won't say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve \\"the Party\\" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 is one of the sharpest, cruelest and smartest books ever written. It critisezes the communist idiology, the way it was practiced in the former USSR. Although in those days few people outside Russia knew the horrors of life under Stalin's regume, Orwell draws the most correct picture of this life. Once a communist himself, he is not afraid to talk harshly of the ideas he once supported.But the book isn't about the Soviet regime in particulare, it's about dictatorships of any kind, that's what makes him very relevant today. An interesting plot and a tasteful touch of sarcasm."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book in 1954 when 1984 was thirty years in the future.The book scared the hell out of me. But I kept re-reading it. The other day, I sat down and opened this book again.It still scares the hell out of me.Democracy and the free market are such sweet pastries. Freedom of thought is like the first zip of coffee with the first bite of the chocolate donut.This novel is cold and chilling. It has no warm fuzzies to soften the blow. This is serious stuff. George Orwell rang the alarm and it is still ringing.This is a nightmare lingering in the midnight moving shadows where your eyes don't want to go.1984 still lies creeping in the future, sleeping in the cold puddles in the dark nights just outside your window."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is about a society that doesn't exist. This society is evil and strict. In this world you have no privacy. Thinking is a crime. There is no freedom whatsoever.Winston Smith is the main character. He is the readers eye into this world. Luckily for you, he's a very interesting chap. This guy has a diary! That's not illegal, but it's punishable by death. Nothing is illegal. The government is called the Inner Party. These shady guys operate the whole society. The use strange techniques like doublethink. They can change the past.Big Brother is a major theme in this book. He's the scary face watching over everything. There are 4 ministries. The Ministry of Love deals with Hate. The Ministry of Peace deals with War. The Ministry of Plenty deals with the economy. The Ministry of Truth deals with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. These are all coined Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.This is a heart-wrenching book. It's very suspenseful. It's also unbelievable in some respects. Telescreens? Can you imagine being watched all the time? In the future it's possible. The unbelievable thing is that the government keeps changing the past. Smith is in this department. All he does is constantly change facts to suit Big Brother's agenda.The end of the book is frightening. If you haven't read 1984 and read everything above, I already gave you the main gist. Does that mean my little review substitutes the book? Of course not. There are many juicy parts I saved for you potential readers. The end is a really cool ending. There's also a little naughtiness, if you know what I mean.Anyway, 1984 is a book that I had to read for school. I was assigned a hundred pages. I thought that was a lot. It turned out that I finished the book ahead of schedule. Enough about me, I want you all to read this book. I think it's a book you shouldn't pass up. It may be the world in the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Let me tell you about one of my favorite books ever. The book is George Orwell's \\"1984.\\" It had been sitting on my bookshelf for several years but until recently I had deemed it too \\"boring\\" to read. It was only this summer, having nothing else to read in its stead that I began a full-hearted attempt to read this book.How wrong I was about its supposed dullness. By the first few pages I was hooked, trapped in the year 1984 as Winston Smith. I was unable to escape the ever-watchful eye of the telescreens that were in every room, watching every move I made, studying my face for any emotion that might flicker across it: unhappiness, anger, or anxiety. Never once during the whole book did I ever feel truly safe, as one might feel during a weekend or a vacation. That feeling that there is nothing to do but simply... relax, let loose all of your worries. Throughout the whole book I felt as though my nerves might break from the terrible strain of keeping my face devoid of any revealing emotion or feeling.That's half of the book; the feeling of hopelessness and depression that George Orwell masterfully weaves into his writing. The other half is the doomed world that his story takes place in. Never once throughout the whole book did I ever think to myself, \\"Well that could never happen,\\" or, \\"That's rather hard to believe.\\" The world that George Orwell masterfully created was completely, utterly, and... depressingly realistic.Even a few days after reading the book I felt the world to be small and bleak. I have a dream of becoming a great and revolutionary director, such as Francis Ford Coppola or Steven Spielberg. Yet how could anything I might accomplish, any change I might make to the world of film, matter if George Orwell's nightmare prophesy, or something similar to it, became a reality?Now, I consider this my one of my favorite books of all time. I would give it 500 stars if I could. It is my personal opinion that every person running for President should be required to read this book, to do whatever is possible to make the sure that the world of 1984 never comes into existence.Any people who liked this book (you rock!) might also enjoy, \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz,\\" \\"Watership Down,\\" \\"Starship Troopers,\\" \\"Bridge of Birds,\\" \\"Hyperion,\\" \\"Neverwhere,\\" His Dark Materials trilogy, and works by Howard Philips Lovecraft. There is no connection between 1984 and the books I just mentioned; these are simply some of my personal favorites and if you share my taste in books (way to go!) I would like to suggest them to you."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is my first time writing a review, and i'm not going to bother writing a synopsis because other people before me have taken the liberty in doing so.

The story that dared the world to behold its possible future during a time when the future was terrifyingly uncertain, still today holds its grip on the reader!Orwell could have been a tennis player, because he serves you up so perfectly with the heroic struggle of a man and woman against the omnipotent, ever-watchful State, and then smashes you into oblivion with the absolute destruction of any hope for a good ending or bright future.This book warns you as obnoxiously as the whistle of an approaching train of the dangers of absolute government that has technology at its disposal and ignorance its only adversary! Many people believe that 1984 never happened because '1984' happened....I would be inclined to agree. Read the powerful book! It will Stun you, I promise!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Possibly Orwell's greatest work, this was published in 1949 and served (and still serves) as a great warning for what might happen if we aren't careful enough.The year is 1984 and the setting is in London, which is part of Airstrip One, which is part of one of the three world superpowers, Oceania. Oceania was formed on the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism) and is governed by a group of wealthy people and the imaginary &quot;Big Brother&quot; who is a figure designed by the Party for the people to look up to as their protector. Oceania, and London is particular, is not an ideal place to live at all. Only the Inner Party, which make up a small percent of the population, have enough food to eat and live in considerable luxury. The Outer Party, which are a group of people that hold many of the jobs that keep the Party going, are forced to live under the microscope of the Party and live in relative poverty. While they have it better off than the low class (Proles) they do not have the freedom that the Proles have, and they spend all their time either working or attending Party functions. It is not considered good for a Party member to be doing anything alone besides sleeping and things of that sort.Part 1 gives us the basics of the book. It describes Outer Party member Winston Smith, who is the main character of the book. In Part One, Smith finds himself and realizes how much he hates the Party.In Part 2, Winston meets another Outer Party member named Julia. Julia shares Winston's hatred of the Party and the two both consider themselves to be criminals and they know that they will eventually be destroyed by the Party. However, they agree to dodge the Party as long as possible. At the end of Part 2, Winston is captured by the Party.Part 3 is about the Party's efforts to change Winston by means of torture and make him a loyal servant. I won't go into deep detail because I don't want to ruin the book :)1984 is a great novel. Maybe harder to understand and more complex than Animal Farm, but you probably get a little more out of it. If you want a complex tale about what we could be headed for, read 1984. If you want something simpler, more lighthearted, and less time consuming read Animal Farm. Both books are great in their own right."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"this book is great. it shows how if we let ourselves become ignorant and don't protect our rights then we will be taken advantage of. if we do not consistently farmiliarize ourselves with our surroundings we will allow ourselves to be manipulated, and if we suddenly realize and protest there will be devastating outcomes."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"After i read this book i made a doodi"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was a wonderful book where the main character, Winston Smith is compelled to speak out aganist Big Brother and the end result is exactly what any one of us would have done.

Thank you Mrs. Hanthrop-Fifteen years later I finally did read this book and absolutely loved it. But I must say that was then, this is now. Now I have found the next generation man of insight and novel for my time. Mind Bomb, by John Mayer is comparable to 1984 or Stephen King's The Stand to which Mayer takes this \\"More is NOT better\\" idea concerning the awesome deluge of people in the world and really makes you wonder if everything is going to fall apart.

This book gives you an entirely new perspective of the world around you - how much of it can you believe, and how much of it is truth &quot;through the eyes of the Party&quot;?

Not scary in the 'boogy man' way, but in the 'this could happen' way. If he was still alive, i'd tip my hat to Mr. Orwell."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984, by George Orwell, is the story of the reality of a society stuck in a nightmare of Negative Utopia. The author's influencial views of the haunting novel transport you into a world where individuality is loss and the sense of Big Brother comes into play. Winston Smith, the main character of the novel, is stuck between the encasement of the Thought Police, to the overseeing of the Party. Winston is faced with the turmoil of going against the government, which puts his life in danger. The part I like about this book is that with every page, there is always a new scene of interest which keeps you reading until the very last sentence. The struggle of one man--in world where all is against him.But then again, this book makes us wonder, when is it &quot;too far&quot; in regards to Big Brother, and how close is are society becoming to it today? 1984, is a thought provoking book which ponders many questions about the involvement in citizens person lives, and how much should they know about you personally. -I only hope that the world never comes to such a reality, because once it does, all individuality becomes completely lost."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book creeps. The work took on a life of its own and conveyed more than Orwell intended. The mood betrayed Orwell's own confrontation with the inevitable. He endured to finish the work before his death. His analysis of a world left to authoritarian control reached that point of no return where sequential logic becomes prophetic. In that unexpected place his gaze was able to penetrate even the iron curtain and the atrocities happening in Russia. He also presented an organic scene where new technology could potentially be used for control and surveillance. That state of innovation and our responsibility to administer it will always resonate.Orwell allows us to plod along with Winston, who despite the desperation of his situation, manages to convey hope through education to his audience. The cautionary message: it could happen to us. The threats may now be wearing different masks, but the dangers will always be present.This well established literary work presents a bold fight against relativism and is an equalizer of all political systems because it is the result of any one taken to the point of perversion."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984, which was written in 1949, is a frightening vision of what the world could turn into in just three and a half decades. This addicting novel takes place in the city of London, in the territory of Oceania, which contains Africa, the Americas, and much of Europe. It is the story of Winston Smith, one of the last non-believers in the principles of \\"the party.\\" This party is a governing body of startling proportions and power. The party has the influence to erase the past, and change it to better suit their needs. Anything they say goes, and those who oppose them are tortured and killed. In a world of fear and absolute control, Winston is one of the last believers that the party can eventually be overthrown. Winston believes that \\"If there is hope... it lies in the proles.\\" Winston's hope is that eventually these proles, or members of the working class, will ultimately rise up and cause the downfall of the party.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready for something to read that will make him or her think. This is a book that is not for the squeamish reader. If you are looking for a charming tale to lift your spirits, you are looking in the wrong place. 1984 is a thought provoking piece that force you to question the world around you and think about the possibilities that the quite possibly come to pass in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is in short the creepiest books I've ever read. 1984 is filled with all sorts of disturbing images and ideas that make you winder how stable the world really is and how easily it could fall apart. Although it does follow the story of one mans sufferings it is almost more interesting to think about the world that he lives in. This world full of riddles and lies is disturbing to say the least and what is even scarier fascinating.What is even more interesting is all of the symbols and ideas that run through the book. Such as doublethink and that if you control the past you control the future. But doublethink is by far my favorite. I thought it was fascinating how the concept of proving a lie with a lie was evident even in the characters themselves. Like how Winston is a lover and a hater of the Party. These ideas make the book even more amazing. This book is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic novel, 1984 is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. It deals with a totalitarian government that has complete control over the populace, right down to their thoughts! The government even has the Thought Police, which make sure everyone is doing everything solely for the benefit of the government. Telescreens constantly monitor them to make sure they are doing everything for the good of the \\"Party.\\"Orwell's novel illustrates the basic human need for freedom through the main character, Winston Smith who begins the dangerous practice of questioning the government and trying to find one of the main rebels of the government, Goldstein. The book tells of his struggle to overthrow the government and how he tries to rebel against it.Orwell dives deep into the logic of how to control a populace under wartime conditions by constantly keeping them active for the cause of having their country win the war and not being able to think of any ulterior motives. He also shows how perpetually being at war helps to waste resources, so people have just enough to survive and won't become too comfortable. If they became too comfortable they might start thinking and thinking is dangerous to a totalitarian government. An example of how resources are wasted is any extra metal is used for ships or any extra rubber for raincoats, therefore making luxury obsolete.He also writes about different totalitarian governments like Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia and where their mistakes were in attaining absolute power. He points out that both these regimes started off tough, but as time went on got laxer and laxer until the people revolted. Orwell also dives deep into government propaganda and how that shapes the attitude of humans by constantly bombarding them with one thing over and over until it becomes fact or reality. Through exploring the propaganda in 1984, he shows us the need to trust our government, but verify what it says in order that we won't get taken advantage of.He also explores how, in his book, humans can be taught one thing, but when the government says so, switch to believing something totally opposite. He does this under a principle called doublethink. Two examples of this from the book are that people are taught 2+2=4 but then can switch to knowing 2+2=5, completely denying that it ever equaled 4. He also shows the importance of keeping accurate and undoctored records so that if an event occurred, the facts cannot be changed to hide blame or recognition or tossed down the memory hole, simply to be forgotten. This is done often in 1984 so that the government will always look right and infallible and people will always believe that they are.In conclusion, this novel will profoundly change how you view government and will also make you realize how important your civil rights are. I would not recommend this book to anyone under 13 or 14 because it has some sexual content."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is just one of those books I've always wanted to read. Although I had never heard anybody talk about it for long, or anything other than the phraes &quot;Big Brother is Watching You,&quot; the fact that I heard it referred to everywhere as a good book. While browsing at Barnes &amp; Noble, I saw it and decided to pick it up and, suffice to say, I'm glad I did.Orwell's use of character development in 1984 is on par with the astounding work done in Animal Farm. In a sense, you aren't just reading about Winston Smith, you ARE Winston Smith. Every thought, every nuance of his mind, is so clearly conveyed that you can't help but feel like you're there right along with him.The negative utopia dreamed up by Orwell is astounding in both its shocking nature and it's beleivability. It's a world where everybody either has a government job or is an outcast. A world of a vast caste system that is all too beleivable. A world where the all-pervasive government can, for all intents and purposes, alter the past, the present, and reality itself. Their control over the minds of the citizens of Oceania is so great that they have no choice but to accept without question what the aprt says, or be eliminated.Let me get one thing straight: This book is not a happy one. It displays a party who can and does shred every remain of human dignity. You will leave this book not with a sense of happiness, but with a sense of awe. The shocking tale held within the pages of this book is one of the finest peices of modern literature ever written. I'll leave it at that."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The epitome of fiction about totalitarian states. Orwell was a socialist, however 1984 is a warning about what happens when the government, not the people, have absolute control over everything. The year is 1984 and Winston Smith is a citizen of a country called &quot;Oceania&quot; which occupies a third of the Earth's landmasses. He lives in what is called Airstrip One in a place that used to be called Great Britain. The government ominously titled &quot;Big Brother&quot; attempts (and quite successfully too) to control everything in the population right down to their very thoughts. Winston hans't fallen into this trap yet and is an outsider but only in his mind. He knows what Big Brother enforces and while he plays along with it he condemns it in his thoughts. Thus, he has committed what is called &quot;Thought Crime&quot; something punishable by death. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. Big Brother forges the population into a 'machine', one that will elevate the party (the controlling members of the government) into almost all-powerful status. The government can control the very thoughts of it's citizens it blatantly changes past events to it's own will, which is what Winston's job is. He re-writes history for the government. History has become so muddled that it is impossible for Winston to know the real truth beyond what Big Brother says is true. He knows of at least one instance which although he can never prove, where the government was wrong, he is exposed to every single instance when Big Brother changes the past. Big Brother knows that a population must have an outlet for it's negetive emotions, for that Big Brother points to an enigmatic man named Emmanuel Goldstein, a person who supposedly was once on par with Big Brother himself then betrayed the party and is leading an active rebellion. Whether Goldstein even exists is questioned. Winston decides to join Goldstein's rebellion. 1984 is in someways prophetic even. At one point Winston meets someone in jail who was turned in for thoughtcrime by his own daughter. The ability of children to get their parents in trouble for abuse occurs today. 1984 is a must read for anyone concerned about current politics. It is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Though it was published in 1949, George Orwell created an insightful look into a possible future with his writing of 1984. The story takes place in London, England in a \\"super-state\\" called Oceania that is perpetually at war with one of two other \\"super-states\\", Eurasia or Eastasia. The government, run by a figurehead party leader called Big Brother, monitors all actions, facial expressions (thus, thoughts), and conversations via \\"telescreens\\". Any potential threat to the government that is caught by these screens is punishable by death, and Spies or Thought Police carry out the sentence.I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of the rising and falling suspense throughout it. I expected this novel to be a dry political book, but it seemed to be one of personal change and survival in a world of conformity and unrealized oppression. The love story sub-plot running through 1984 is one of companionship and unity instead of lust and personal gain. The removal of liberty, freedom, and individuality disturbed me, but these restrictions were the driving force behind the actions taken by the two main characters.The circumstances in this novel seem to have become commonplace occurrences to some degree, and that is what seems scary in the novel. Now that there are cameras monitoring every public place, Orwell's \\"future\\" doesn't seem so far-fetched. The events in the story inspire deep thought and moral reflection; I thought about this book for days after I finished it. I recommend this book to anyone. There are elements of action, drama, romance, and mystery in this novel, and it's easy to see why it is talked about after 1984 has come and gone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think anyone who creates a language (even if it's only been partially created) for his/her writing, is an absolute genius. George Orwell is no exception. The vision and ideas that he brought forth in 1984 is something that can never be copied without disastrous results. This is one of the most enjoyable books that I've ever had to read for English class.While reading this story, I have to keep telling myself that the book was written in the 1940's. It's amazing what Orwell predicted for our future and how our much better, and how much worse, the present really is. The creation of Newspeak is a message to the deterioration of the English language, which is not so far fetched. Orwell wasn't so successful in his other predictions, but the book is fiction right? Every page of new developments and plot lines engrossed me more and more. It's a great book that can evoke so much emotion in its reader. That's what happened to me. It's wasn't happiness, either, mind you. I put so much confidence and hope into Winston, that I was crying for his failure and my disappointment, by the end of the book. Truly a must read book. Even if you hate the book after reading it, it's still a book that should be read by everybody. It's sheds light on corruption, power, and rebellion. The only part I didn't enjoy was select portions of Goldstein's &quot;book&quot;, such as the repeated chapters. If Orwell lost any readers of 1984, it was probably during that part of the book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Ok, Ok, I know . . . 1984 came and went and we are living in the 21st century. Orwell's book is certainly dated and that does affect the reading. However, any good work of literature does not rise and fall on the culture of the day, but on the inner struggle. This book is well written and the dangers printed are always on the horizon for us all. This book is still powerful enough to make your insides twist and cause you to watch the news in a new way."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a scary, dark, and depressing book. What makes it scarier is that it could happen...Anyone who likes novels, politics, and/or government must read this book. It is, of course, about the totalitarian society of Big Brother and the Thought Police. What makes the novel scary are the parallels that can be drawn between the novel and the U.S. government (and those of other Western countries). For instance, how war is used in the media by the government. This is why it is a required read, read it for yourself and draw the parallels where realistic- they are there.Besides that, the story is excellent; fast paced, well written, and entertaining. The characters are believable and vividly drawn. Overall, an absolutely essential book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a study of the human psyche, both at individual and group level. Written in the setting of a Nazi and Communist style dictatorship, the book examines the struggle between the individual and the masses as well as providing a brutally frank answer to the question of why does history repeat itself. Orwell's profound insight takes the reader on a rewarding journey of discovery. But let the reader beware: once you read 1984 and comprehend its message, there is no going back. This book is not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In today's technologically oriented world, people still seem shocked when movies come out that portray governmental security that seemingly invades on the public's privacy, which makes George Orwell's 1984 even more of a masterpiece. This thought-provoking novel, written in 1949, well before computers, surveillance cameras and hidden microphones, depicts a world in which the government controls everything, knows everything and has no feasible opposition.Winston Smith, our connection to Airstrip One, lives under the oppressive leader Big Brother. Big Brother has set up an undefeatable party that monitors its citizens with telescreens, Thought Police, Newspeak, and Doublethink. Newspeak is a language that the party has created, eliminating all words that might bringnegative feelings toward the party, and doublethink is the party's control over its citizens' minds that makes them believe anything (ex: 2 + 2 = 5). Winston strives toward defeating the party, but is constantly met with another layer of Big Brother control. Orwell constructed the book to have a gloomy feel over it, one that creates &quot;negative utopia&quot; for which it is famous. The reader will never get fully emotionally involved with any characters, yet will be engrossed in the plot. This book is one that leaves readers thinking 'What If?' days later, and exercises the mind in the meantime. Orwell crafted the book precisely, evoking certain feelings and certain times, which I think makes this book a must-read for anyone interested in expanding their imagination while reading a classic. But remember, once you pick this book up, don't stop before the end. Big Brother might be watching, and youcertainly don't want to be on his bad side."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To sum it up, this book scared me to death. No, there are no monsters, serial killers, or anything else like that. 1984 is about an extreme communist society and how one man tries to break free from it. The book may seem like a bit of a love story, but that's not the point. The frightening thing about this book is that our hero fails. With most books, the hero is triumphant at the end, or at least there is a glimmer of hope. Not with this book. Our hero, Winston, falls in love with Julia and together they want to break free from the hell they live in. But they are caught, tortured, and eventually betray each other. Since they have betrayed each other (something they thought they would never do), they no longer love each other. The idea that a society can make you stop loving somebody and change who you are in a realistic manner is frightening. This book had me paranoid for about a week. Even still, not all lessons are happy and this book is well worth the paranoia you might feel because of the lesson it gives you. Although this book was written in the 1940's, it is still hauntingly relevant today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I consider this one of the top 3 Dystopian works, along with Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and Huxley's Brave New World. But I think this is the most philosophical - and the most grim - of the three. All the ingredients are here -- we get the grim, joyless, totalitarian nation that is such a nightmare to the Western ideas of individuality and basic rights. Like in Fahrenheit, we get an obsessive control over language - though here it goes much farther, to the destruction of words. Like BNW, we get government controlled social structure and recreation time, even sexuality. Seems the main point of all of them is how shallow life can become if one obeys the authorities. What's different here - and I hope I'm not giving too much away-is that the rebel doesn't win. That seriously disturbed me at first, but the more I think about it, the more I feel it makes this work stand above the others as a Dystopian picture and a call to fight Power in government and protect individualism and free thought. For if the rebel can beat the Man, then the Man's power is limited, and we need not worry too much about the Man - the rebel can always win, if he wants. But if Big Brother can become powerful enough that no rebel can survive, as is the case in 1984, then we must truly fear and fight the Man-now, before He has that kind of power.In the end, I think I find this Dystopian work more well thought out, more complete, and scarier than Brave New World of Fahrenheit 451. Yet it still remains incredibly readable, and a disturbingly good time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you only read one more book, read George Orwell's \\"1984.\\"Other reviewers including the ... reviewer, has captured the essence of this incredible, disturbing, poignant, an accurate view into the mind of the totalitarians - and yes, folks, they live among us even today.I'll only add this: the \\"book-within-a-book\\" by Orwell's fictional author, Emmanual Goldstein, should be required study by every single high school and college student in the world. Don't know what I'm talking about? Read \\"1984\\" and look for Emmanual Goldstein within this book's pages. Then ask yourself the questions you dared not ask yourself before.Then go read \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"The Probability Broach.\\" The first is a different, altogether more pleasant version of Hell. The second holds out the real promise of freedom-loving people (\\"Broach\\"). Then tell others what you have learned."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When i first picked up a copy of this book, i thought it would be about new kids on the block or something else 80's. Little did i know i was about to read a literary classic. 1984 is an amazing book, and somewhat terrifying. Though some of the themes are a bit radical, i immediatly came to a realization that the world could be like it is written. The main charactor, Winstin, is a common man, who can easily be related to someone you know. The book depicts the horrid possibility of the world being ruled by communism, and big brother, and what happens to a man that is against it all. I definetly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I don't think I could say anything about this book that hasn't already been said! This is probably my favourite novel of all time! This has unbelivable power, the atmosphere is incredible. It still grips and absorbs me every time I read it! I love the ambiguity of the ending. If you haven't read this novel and are wondering if you should, don't think about it any more, get a copy as soon as you can and get reading. It'll be one the most rewarding reading experiences you'll ever have!A totally exceptional novel!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was forced to read this in school when I was younger and I didn't really &quot;get it&quot; nor was I even interested in &quot;getting it&quot;. I think if you are over 20, you want to re-read this classic novel. It was much better, the second time around."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It would be hyperbolic to say the world of Nineteen Eighty Four has arrived. But there are too many elements of today's society that evoke parts of the book. We hear a lot today about &quot;Hate Crimes&quot;. A more accurate term for that concept is the one coined by Orwell -- &quot;Thought Crimes&quot;. In fact, calling Thought Crimes by a different name in order to make the idea more palatable is simply a creative use of Newspeak/DoubleThink. I don't think I have to give examples of Big Brother -- you can supply your own. My point is that we may yet be a long way from a totalitarian state, but we have at least taken small steps in that direction -- and perhaps we should be concerned at how little we are resisting that movement."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"All I have to say about 1984 is it really makes you think of what we all could be living in. Overall it is one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic tale of a dysponic government ruling a futuristic society is, in my opinion, the greatest book I have ever had the pleasure to read. What is so disturbing about this story is how it parallels our own society. In an age where technology,media, and good old-fashioned human rotteness are all on an out of control path, it seems big brother is getting nothing but bigger. Orwell is not only an author of incredible talent, he could very well be an unknowing prophet. The best book of its kind anywhere!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Although morbid, it's fitting to know that Orwell basically died writing this masterpiece, as it clearly encompasses a life's work.Cast your mind back fifty years. You read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; when it came out and enjoyed it immensely. Now this hits the market and blows everybody away by its grim forsight and bluntness.Whether you think Orwell's predictions were overly accurate or not, that's not necessarily the most important thing. Orwell portrays the *potential* that exists, clearly making this novel timeless. Change the name of the book to &quot;2044&quot; and it would be just as effective as it was fifty years ago. Too many people take Orwell's predictions literally, when in many ways it's a warning...Winston is Orwell, he is the tool, a technique Orwell neglected to use in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. This book could easily have been written in first person, but the use of third person puts a necessary distance between Winston and the reader, meaning that although the reader shares all of his experiences, and the world he lives in, there is enough distance to look at the wider world.An interesting footnote I was praised for when I went to school that I have not seen anywhere else is to note the very striking parallels between Winston and O'Brien. I got the feeling that O'Brien basically *was* Winston years earlier, before he was &quot;cured&quot;. Behind the rock of the torturer, there is a feather of a man that does care, but isn't allowed to.This novel is what Orwell was trying to achieve. He scratched the surface in &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and went a lot deeper here."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book describes an extreme situation of what totalitarianism can lead to. But I think that's just the power of the book; because the state, as talked about in the book,is an extreme example, but I think that extremes show the real danger of something; it makes you more aware of a situation (a state form, a social question etc.) than a report based on real facts does. therefore you also shouldn't take this book for real, but you should take parts of this books and compare them to reality. and by doing so you'll find a lot of things that form, as described in the book, dangers in present day society also. this book actually shows all what totalitarianism can lead to, and therefore enables you to see the danger of it"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 simply can't be described. It's the most fascinating and worthwhile book I have ever read. Orwell dares to ask 'what if...' and he succeeds in constructing a frightening yet possible situation for the citizens of the world. Great book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It sure doesn't take much of an imagination stretch to realize that the society Orwell describes in 1949 is becoming reality in 1999. Ever since I read it 4 years ago (and since reread it several times), it has not been replaced as my favorite book for its political satire, catchiness, and yes, timelessness. Definitely get this book and read it-- just make sure you do it away from any telescreens...."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book really makes you think about how powerless us, the citizens can be. The last lines of this book change your entire philosophy about the entire book. Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"!984 is that kind of book you has heard people talk about so much you have very high expectations. And this book delivers. It's a brilliant work. The construction of a society where peolple are constante surveilled and know and feel it is one of the more vivid and disturbing portraits I've read. Loved doublethink and newspeak."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book had to be one of the greatest books ever written. It stands out with books like Ulysses by James Joyce and Gone with the Wind. This book was a frightening prediction that will probably come true. I'm not saying that it'll come true in the near future, but in, maybe, 1000 years or so. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but this book does contain many fictional things, but those fictional things might become factual 1000 years from now. Like, for example, telescreens, mind reading, vaporizing (which is something you'll learn about in the book) which includes brainwashing. I, personally, thought that this was by far the best book I have ever read. But when you read it, read it with an open mind. If you are not thinking strait you may miss out on an important plot twist or quote that can change the story. Again, this is one of the greatest books in the world, and it'll be bad if you don't read it with an open mind; it would be a major shame if you didn't understand this material. The story line could change the way you see things, almost completely, as did mine and my other, sane, may I add friends who also read it. I hope you'll love it, or should I say I guarantee you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I liked how true this book was, even though it was written 20 years before 1984. Most of the futuristic devises that Orwell was talking about came true. Such as, the security cameras and trackers in the airport. Also, the government was prying into your personal inforamtion. I believe that the society was high tech and the government had more laws to look at a persons information. Soon, the governmnet will be able to track anybody anywhere. Also, they will be able to read a person's thoughts and ideas. If a person wanted to revolt against the government they will be able to stop him/her before they can overthrow the government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In these novel there are many actors,characters. To manintion the major actors like Winston Smith, O'Brien Mrs. Parasons,comrade Ogilvy, Mr. Charrington, Julia, were the one who make the novel very intersted to read. It is very hard to imagen to live in these kind of society,that had three kinds of people. One who control everything which is known as the Big Brother and they are the high class of Oceania society, and the other one who is manipulated by the high class ( Big Brother )known as the inner party or the middle class, and the last one of the kind that are living majority in Oceania and they are called the &quot;Prole&quot; or the outer party. All these stratarfication of society is because the government(Big Brother)want to controls and manipulates by any means, for example the telescreens, the newspapers, and the party people. I read it with wondering that If I was right there inside the Oceania's society, what would be like being control all the time. I even can not stand if my mother or my girl friend( whom I love the most) want to run my live. But you what is going on now a day, I thought that the telescreen and the televesion have a lot in commen to start with the TV. programmers manoipulates the people who watching the show by thew means of advertising."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Poignant, scary, and doused with a sense of unignorable urgency that is not as urgent as it was when Orwell wrote it. His horrifying prophecy thankfully did not come true, but prophecies aside, &quot;1984&quot; is an unmistakably brilliant account of a normal man's search for &quot;truth and decency&quot; in a frightful, loveless world. The novel is very hard to put down, and can be not only riveting, but genuinely entertaining at times. A true empathy for the characters, Winston and Julia, stems from a humanity which they possess and a love that we can recognize, that is contrasted by Orwell to the extreme squalor and general de-humanity of their surroundings. A definite must-read, &quot;1984&quot; is not only a fascinating novel, but its bleak and intense imagery, its memorable characterizations, and its involving narrative will stay with the reader long after completion. My favorite part is when O'Brien places Winston in front of the mirror, shows him his decayed body, the tells him that quite certainly, he is &quot;the last man.&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read this book many times and have written many of my high school english papers on it and others similar to it. I must admit that this type of fiction is not right for everyone and I do believe that you have to have a very open mindset to understand it. But to all of those who gave it 3 stars or less, I implore you to consider reading it again when you are older or willing to accept a new and different way of writing about our society and our future. No, it is not the type of book to be taken at face value, or exactly as it is printed. To really understand the thoughts of Orwell you have to be able to read between the lines and make the story and its lessons plausable in any time and with any society. There are many timeless lessons here, you just have to get past the actual fictional story. Just try it again when you are more openminded about novels."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book changed my outlook on the future. It made me realize what this world is coming to in terms of privacy. For someone to have written this book in the 40's and have the whole plot still be chilling today,has to be a genious!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am not that much of a book lover- but this one is, no doubt, the book to read. This is a stunning piece of art. The most impressive part is, to my opinion, part three in the book- where O'Brien makes Winston an 100% supporter for the Party. In this part, you can feel the pain, the panic, the screaming, and the range of anger junt under your skin. Also the flashback Winston had throughout the book where he's being selfish to his motherr and sister really touches, in some horrible-kind-of-way. My conclution- if you can handle this book, you can handle anything."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The main idea of the book is to portray how evil and corrupt the government is becoming. It continues to become more powerful and controlling as time goes by. In fact, the government is so powerful, that people no longer have freedom to make their own decisions in their lives. I think George Orwell wrote &quot;1984&quot; because he wanted to warn people how society was slowly becoming like Oceania's in which the people begin to think less and the goevernment gains more power. I feel this way because during Orwell's lifetime there were many wars being fought and he was in a few of them. I believe he saw how greed , power and money could change a government and ultimately become corrupt.I definitely recommend this book. It is such a touching, powerful story. George Orwell writes such an interesting, sad story that is totally plausible. &quot;1984&quot; is a &quot;haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing&quot; (back cover). The book just goes into so much detail from the character's mind. I love this book - it is just so thought provoking. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading &quot;the book&quot; is rather boring and takes a while to read.

Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo).

It starts out kinda boring, going more than at least 10-20 pages without any dialogue. However, the story soon started to pick up, detailing Winston Smith's challenges in his world. In this world, which to call &quot;unique&quot; would be an understatement, the characters are faced with restrictions that we fortunately never have to deal with. Even though I think the book would've been more exciting to read in the years before 1984, as there was more excitement and horror to imagine the prospect of the book's story coming true, this book still reminds us of what could be."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;Does Big Brother exist?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;In the same way I exist?&quot; &quot;You do not exist, Winston.&quot;Beauty can sometimes take strange forms. Beneath the decaying architecture and verminous rats of Ninteen Eighty-For's gangrenous surface there is a glorious centre, one which screams out profoundly that it is a master of all it says and that George Orwell is the master of his cxreation.The book was completed, ironically, in Ninteen Fourty-Eight when Orwell had seen the future. He had fought in the Spanish Civil War and had lived through the Second World War. The future, as he saw it, was a brutal labrynth of pain and torture, where the only way to escape the pain of everyday life was to become oblivious to it: to succumb without reervation.Orwell casts us into a paralell universe where events post 1945 turned out quite differently. Among the shambolic ruins of the ninteenth-century buildings there exists the Party: a totalitarian entity which monitors its citizens with greater zeal than it fights its wars. The Party controls the vast super state of Oceania, permanently at war with its corresponding entities, Eastasia or alternately Eurasia. Winston Smith is the fragile everyman, a man who has somehow kept his sanity and some degree of individuality. He rebels against the regime by falling in love with a woman who thinks along similar lines. His rebellion is touching yet we know what it ultimately entails.But there is an underlying sense of poetry to the great book as those who read Lord of The Rings will testify to feeling a sense of history. The novel makes no excuses for its treatment of the charcters. People are brutalised, subverted, their minds twisted into bizzare forms of life and then ultimately destroyed. Yet through all the turns it takes, Ninteen Eighty-Four leaves a deep impression on us and its message echoes throughout our society.Beauty is such a strange thing.&quot;There can be no love, except love for the party. If you want an image of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face...forever.&quot;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book has been on my shelf for years. It was required reading for many students when I was in high school in the early 1960s. My Father read it in college in the early 1950s. It's required in many courses at Universities today. And, I discovered that eighth graders were reading it in a local school just this last year! The book, contrary to the opinions of those earlier reviewers who gave it a poor rating, is still a major classic. It is not only studied in literature courses, but also in classes in political science, history, semantics, and even advertising. It is an extrapolation of the grim world predicted by Orwell if totalitarianism and the perfect police state gain true power. This is an important work to read. Abuse and manipulation of power is a timeless topic. In the world of this novel, power is the only thing that counts. [Note that there is another book that readers might be interested in. Orwell used it as a &quot;stepping stone.&quot; The book is &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamiatin (or, Zamyatin) first published in 1924.] Personally, I also find the whole subject on how language is used to alter people's thoughts (and even the direction of their thoughts) is fascinating. The presentation provides considerable insight into journalism, political speeches, political correctness, and advertising. (Newspeak: &quot;The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible.&quot;) Many of the words coined by Orwell have become quite common (for example, doublespeak, crimethink, newspeak, etc.) Winston Smith is a worker in the Ministry of Truth whose job requires him to &quot;alter&quot; the past by rewriting history (\\"who controls the past, controls the future\\"). In his world there is no privacy (\\"Big Brother\\" is always watching), individuals with unorthodox ideas are executed, and perpetual warfare exists between three global powers (who keep the war going to keep their populations controlled). The Thought Police attempt to control people's minds by what they see, hear, and experience. When Winston falls in love (a crime) with Julia, the Party tries to destroy this &quot;crimethink.&quot; Smith's \\"reeducation\\" destroys his individuality and spirituality. The &quot;place where there is no darkness&quot; is not the light of Truth. It is the light in the torture room in the Ministry of Love."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"An unforgettable book. A wonderful respite and a refreshing alternaive from all the modern every-day reads, I would say. What makes this book so good is the character development and the sudden events which are totally unexpected. The book is unpredictable and there are always new twists and turns to explore. George Orwell created a virtual city and his own political parties and ideas perfectly and they seamlessly bind together to make this the most substantial book I have ever read. Possibly the best as well.Big Brother is watching you so read the book!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I don't know how Orwell could know what would happen 36 years later but he could. In my country the book couldn't be published until 1989, because the communists feared that it made too many people turn against them. Life wasn't much better in those days as written in 1984. Disinformation, getting the 'untrue' people out of the way and of course lots of phonies. The only shocking thing is that people really believed in that. And I may say that they some of them still believe in it in 1998!Thank God Big Brother is gone forever. But 1984 remains and warns us. We shouldn't ever have another Big Brother! So read this book and open your mind! You won't be happy in fact you'll be very sad but it's worth."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Perhaps the description will seem turgid and tiresome as you read 1984, but in retrospect it will have been to your great advantage to have read of this negative utopia. Regarding the one reviewer who gave this book one star -- please, actually pay attention before you write another review, and get your facts straight. Julia wasn't in the Thought Police. Why don't you go back to English class, and after you've mastered &quot;Green Eggs &amp; Ham&quot; try Orwell again. Thank you."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 does not live up to it's reputation. I'll grant that Orwell had a point (that _western_ societies, as well as soviet society were headed toward his future). However, Orwell is not a great novelist -- excellent essays, poor novels. Almost the entire plot is stolen from an earlier russian work (We, by Yevgeny Zamyatin), which is far superior. If you're interested in Orwell's political thinking (yes, he's a socialist), check out his essays. If you're looking for a good allegory, DON'T get 1984..."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I feel that Orwell tried to warn not just the people of his time, but future generations of the atrocities a form of government such as totalitarianism would create.Yeah, it (facism and nazism) was very rampant in '48, but as '98 approaches, many of the things mentioned in the book are seemingly apparent in today's society.I read this novel my senior year in high school, and I honestly have to say that no other book has ever gotten to me... not even Slaughterhouse 5. Now that I am in my first year in college I have to write a paper on this arbitrary fanatical form of government,I understand where Orwell was coming from when he said that &quot; BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!&quot; Our government, which has sworn to protect the public, says that we the people have our constitutional rights as americans to have privacy and freedoms, yet our lovely government harasses law abiding citizens by invading thier privacies and shutting them up when trying to express their opinions. Don't get me wrong... I like this country, but it is gradually reducing itself into this sadist form of government that Orwell had desperately tried to warn us about. I guess this is about all I have to say about this."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Before I review the book, I must get this off my chest: ORWELL WAS BRITISH! He was NOT writing a warning about the government to future generations of Americans, he was NOT trying to warn us about black helicopters or the cameras on the street corner or anything like that. And in a time when a woman can be raped in public in broad daylight and get no help because people are too scared (this has really happened), perhaps a LITTLE surveillance is a good idea. It will never reach the horrific magnitude in 1984 because Americans are too paranoid (if hypocritical) too let that happen. Does anyone out there seriously think that a culture that fights to legalise automatic weapons because of &quot;Constitutional Rights&quot; would ever let Big Brother show his face?Now the book:1984 is undeniably a masterpiece. It skillfully and pointedly demonstrates the evils of Stalinist communism. It is not a prediction of what the American government would turn into; that is a ridiculously ethnocentric supposition. Rather it is a then-timely warning about Joseph Stalin written during the height of the Red Scare in America. Big Brother IS Stalin. He even looks like Stalin. The war that was the origin of the three governments in 1984 was the nuclear war that America and Russia were poised to fight all throughout the Cold War. Perhaps more to the point, 1984 is a fairly accurate representation of the prevailing atmosphere of communist Russia. People actually lived like this. Children as spies? Yes. Hate week? Under different titles, yes. Thought police? Without the technolgy in 1984 (though nearly so), yes. As a warning for today, 1984 admonishes against war, senseless hate, and extreme concentration of power. In America the concentration of power is pretty much impossible (watch Clinton try to pass a bill), but the other two seem to be the latest fashions.1984 was not meant to create paranoia; it was about the dangers of paranoia. This book needs to be read and taught, but it needs to be taught accurately."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read the Penguin Books edition and I loved it. Beautifully cynical and easy to read, I read it in 17 hours. Orwell hit the nail on the head with this publication, about Winston Smith and his coming to terms with the fact that he does not accept the world around him. Word has it that, when Stalin read this, he walked around a room breaking furniture. As an Englishman I believe that Orwell is one of the best writers the nation has produced. Buy this."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was amazed at the brilliance of this book! Incredibly powerful, I cried at the end. What I found the most remarkable was how well thought out the whole system was: newspeak, doublethink,etc. Read this!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is not only a book, but a work of art. Orwell was ingenius in telling the horrors of a Totalitarianistic nightmare. Few people realize how important WWII truly was. If the axis powers had succeeded in their task the nightmare of Orwell's book would certainly become true."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The main theme isn't a love story by far,it's suppression and total control, it's a doom scenario. It's difficult to say anything new, after having read a couple of reviews, they all say the same. I would like to add that the writing style is boring, it isn't a book that you would read none stop. It is however a &quot;contemporary&quot; warning for the dangers of information control that is becoming more and more an issue of today. Read it, for it is a classic and a warning. 5 stars for the contents -1 star for the style"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is incredible and terrifying, it is well-written and the topic is highly salient to our time. This is about more than communism, but about humanity. If you have read We, by Yvegeny Zamyatin, you really must read 1984. (I, for some reason, read them in that order) I would say that 1984 is the superior. Erich Fromm's afterword is worthwhile, additionally, it is quite short and readable."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Could it still happen? The ultimate totalitarian state that Orwell foresaw? Not in every detail but *1984* got ahold of my imagination to such an extent that it still gives me the willies to contemplate. It's almost a shame Orwell didn't name the book &quot;2034&quot; or &quot;2084&quot; so that literal-minded school boards could still make it required reading. It's a masterpiece and remains to be one. The story of Winston Smith's battle to keep his individuality and integrity will not grow old."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},A={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],x={key:0},q={key:1};function H(n,e,s,c,r,a){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",A,[(t(!0),i(g,null,f(a.visiblePoems,(h,w)=>(t(),p(m,{key:w,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(W,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-51d8ada4"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/11.md","filePath":"quotes/11.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/11.md"},z=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{G as __pageData,z as default};
