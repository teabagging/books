That is where this series is headed at this point. I only hope RJ pulls it out of that rut by book 10 or I may never read his stuff again!That is my humble opinion. If you still like it, I am happy for you, but don't tell me I have no right to disagree with you."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been a fan of the WOT series for abour 3 years now, and when i first started reading them i was just amazed by the depth of the books and the sheer volume. Unfortunatley the most recent books in the series \\"Path of Daggers\\" and \\"Winter's Heart\\" have been let downs.In the previous books, each book covered a good amount of time, and had a predictable rotation between the three main characters. In \\"Winter's Heart\\" the book seems to cover less than a month, and it has so many characters and events being refered to that i found myself wishing i had all the other books so that i could cross reference names, locations and events. This book degenerates from boring to worse, after a lame introduction it goes on for 500 pages of \\"who cares?\\" material. Twords the end, there finnaly is a conflict revealed, and action happens, but it is very empty compared to the previous book's action points. By the end of the book i was rather exhausted, and allthough there are some interessting events being foreshadowed for the next book, i really dont know if i want to bother buying it, after such a boring book as this."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Talk about a wordy waste of paper. RJ has contracted Stephen King Syndrome - make 3 pages of babble where 1 paragraph of literature would do. Seriously, the plot slows down even more than before. There is more plot movement in any 2 chapters of the first 3 books than in this entire volume. RJ must be paid by the word and Tor is trying to make this series go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I like the story, but it could have been done in 4 books, and done well. But Jordan/Tor have decided to milk this out and make it a lifetime project. Don't waste your money buying this book now - wait for the next book and buy THIS book at the used book store for 99 cents. If you don't die of old age waiting first."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have got to agree with the zillion reviewers who find themselves confused over the many, many charactors, minor plot lines, politics and so forth of the WOT. The overall concept is good, the basics are solid and interesting enough to keep a reader coming back, but there is plenty of over-kill in this series.One reviewer wondered why people complain about too many charactors and why can't these folks use the internet to find out who is who? Well, simply put, they CAN. The real question is, why SHOULD they? Yes, there are very good web sites out there listing who is who in WOT. But geez, do I want to run to my computer every time an unremembered name comes up? Especially since this happens often -- and I read the series back to back twice! Get real. Checking out charactors on the internet in order to be able to go on reading the book(s) is stupid. It breaks up the story and, other than satisfying curiousity, serves no purpose. The complaint people have is not that they can't find out who is who, but that they need to do it in the first place.I think, as do many others, that Jordan has let this series get away from him and now he is rambling on in a holding pattern. This book did advance the plot somewhat but there still seems to be a long way to go. How many more books will there be? And how long do we wait for them? I like reading a nice, thick book but at least let there be some movement to the series! Let's ease up on the rhetoric, the constant bits about smoothing skirts, pulling braids, etc. Let's get past the blue fingernails and all the myriad fashions and get to the Final Battle! Hopefully before Rand gets to be an old, old man -- along with three wives and a million kids!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"My heart sank when it arrived - the paralyzingly dull Perrin on the cover did not bode well. Jordan's least successful (but obviously most impressive to him) invention, Daes Daemar, doesn't get balefired out of plotline like it deserves. Egwene is practically non-existent. But...... this book ACTUALLY ADVANCES THE PLOT. Rand does something, rather than react. Mat's back. Nynaeve's no longer a witless ninny. The Chosen actually show up and deliver more than massages to the Amyrlin(s).Perrin &amp; Faile are on too many pages, but all in all, a very welcome improvement over PoD. Yeah, I'm glad I shelled out for it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Look at it as one story, not individual books.I understand that many people are upset because the story seems to stretch further and further with each book without much overall progress .I am assuming that most readers who are 'tired' of this series are simply tired of waiting for progress to occur , and when a new book comes out every two years, there are so many plot line s to address that not much progress seems take place. Winter's Heart does something good about that.Each of Books 1 and 2 can work as a perfect stand alone story. But starting with Book three you simply need the previous and the later books to make sense of the 'madness'.I read all 9 books within the last two months. Books 1 through 5 resolved a great deal of the plot lines initiated in the beginning of the each book. But with book 6 (Lord of Chaos), the pattern of leaving a story hanging in mid air started, although book 6 by itself was only 2nd best to The Great Hunt in the whole series.Books 7 and 8 did not progress the story much, but having read them within days of reading the previous books, it is very clear that they are very important to the series, even though they did not cover many areas readers wanted covered.Book 9, Winter's Heart, finally ties most of the plot lines together, and resolves some major conflicts in the series, as well as introduce others. Consolidation is what it does best.Mat meets his Daughter of the Nine Moons and settles some unfinished business. Other characters come to him that three or four plot lines have now been consolidated into one, with Mat heading it.Perrin is up to the same thing. Even though he did not depart from the camp in the book, Jordan managed to consolidate some 5 or 6 plot lines into one by uniting the plot lines of the Prophet, Morgase, Falcon and Hawk, the Shaido, and the White Cloaks.Rand not only manages to settle down his harem's business but also fulfills some of the prophecies of the earlier books and strikes his most stunning victory in the series. Not even the fallen Stone or Callandor or Rhuidean come close to what he did in Book 9.There are many other sub plots that were either resolved or consolidated. Winter's Heart does an excellent job at consolidating plot lines. It is clear where every character stands, we have far fewer plot lines going on now, and some major problems out of the way.It is clear now, as book 9 ends, that we have fewer plot lines to follow, and most characters know about things they should have known about along time ago. Which is something I always hated about the characters, everyone is keeping secrets that would make everyone's life easier have they revealed some of it.I did a research project about the seires for a class when book 7 came out, I expected the series to total 12 books. But having read all of them now, it is likely that we might end up with 15 books.So, here we go. Excellent Book. Kudos for progress. Kudos for plot line consolidation. I give this book 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If I had Robert Jordans address I'd write and ask him how the hell he can write a book that's 600 odd pages long and have absolutely nothing important happen at all.No push towards an ending to the series,in fact an ending looks even further down the road now than it did after reading book 8.The distance between books is annoyingly long,and I find myself having to stop mid-read to try and remember a character or situation from previous books.I find it difficult to criticise Robert Jordan,as the first 5 novels in this series were superb reads.But I find now that he has lost the central core of the novels and is painting broad strokes of scope and depth in all the wrong directions.The result is a misguided mess of unnecessary sub-plots,not enough action,overlong scene settings and the most unforgivable crime of all,a complete neglect of the main characters(especially Rand).They,along with the Forsaken,made the whole thing enjoyable.Now they are all becoming stereotypical liberties that are not only annoying(Nyneave's braid pulling being a prime example) but are also in danger of becoming boring,and the reader might find themself not caring who lives or who dies.I think Jordan needs to address this as soon as possible,because without the emotional resonance the characters gave us in the first 5 books,people who were avid readers of the story,will become disinterested in the books and the need to read the whole series(something I think Jordan relies upon too much)will cease to exist.Utter Trollocs."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The writing is exemplary, the plotting intricate, all of what is said about this bok is true - INCLUDING THE COMPLAINTS! Someone needs to get through to this HACK, because his fans are clearly not making an impact on him. I have read all nine books. Of this, the tenth book, I have just finished chapter 22, which ends talking about someone named either Luc or Isam dropping out of the world of dreams long enough to kill an elderly couple we don't know for reasons that aren't explained, then slipping back into the world of dreams to talk to someone who is disguised about God knows what...AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE FLAKE LUC OR ISAM IS! Maybe I read about him once in one of the other books, but with arguably BILLIONS of characters big and small WHO CAN KEEP TRACK!Chapter 23 starts with someone named Shalon gating to a clearing with someone named Harine and her swordmaster Moad...and again I HAVE NO CLUE WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE!

After clinging gamely on, hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel I am going to have to call it quits after this volume.

So I decided maybe I would care if I knew more about them, so I reread the entire series and actually tookotes on the characters that I had forgotten about and skimmed over the first time ...I sat back and was literally STUNNED. That is one fantastic book! Originally I thought book 2 \\"The Great Hunt\\" was like Back to the Future II (you know - filler to get you to III). Boy was I wrong. It is a subtle, deft, imaginative plot manipulation that sets up the entire series and along the way, almost subliminally, brings one slowly yet completely involved with the main characters. Book six on - If I have to read about one more woman smoothing her dress because of thinking about a man I'm going to go POSTAL!!!! Here's my advice to Robert Jordan - whenever something was great and now it ain't you HAVE TO GET BACK TO BASICS!!! If it doesn't have to do DIRECTLY with Rand, Perrin, and Mat and to a much, much lesser degree - Elayne, Egwene, and 'I hope she dies soon' Nynaeve, THEN WE DON'T CARE!!! Oh yeah, and stop killing off the Forsaken one a book and then bring them back giving them a different name. It adds nothing except reader apathy."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have found the entire saga to be comparable to a chess game - you have the beginning game, mid-game and end-game.The beginning game is exciting, fast paced and fairly predictable - Books 1-4 or 5 (esp EotW) are very straightforward and exciting. Incredible depth, but you know where things are going - there is going to be story development and then a big fight with a Forsaken at the end.The mid-game of a chessgame is fairly slow, plodding and somewhat boring as the players try to clear out the extraneous pieces and get positioned for their end-game strategy. Essentially they are saying &quot;I know how I want this to end, I just have to figure out how to get there. . .&quot; - same thing Jordan has said. To me, books 5/6 - 8/9 have been the mid-game section. Jordan is trying to get all of his pieces to the places they need to be for the end-game section.The end-game section is, to me, the most fun to watch and most tense to play. Pieces quickly are eliminated and hard (impossible) choices are forced and made leading to a conclusion. I believe that the end of Winter's Heart is showing the start of the end-game. I think that we didn't see much of Egwene because she is pretty much where Jordan wants her. Everybody is staged at Jordan's jumping-off point and ready to begin the roll toward his Tarmon Gai'don.The series is long (very) but with Winter's Heart, it is beginning to show the payoff promised in the beginning. The end-game is near!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I know at this point nothing I can say will dissuade you from continuing to read the series. However, I must vent. This series has degenerated from enthralling to absolutely frustrating. This book is the final straw for me. The last four books including this one are nothing more than a series of subplots. It's difficult to maintain interest when the story meanders so. I gave this book two stars, because the main story does progress a little bit. I can give it no more than that however. In this and in recent books Jordan undermines the rules that his has set up for his world. He also eliminates any drama as only expendable star treklike crewmen ever die. The penalties and punishments doled out in previous books have all been removed in subsequent books, thereby lending credence to the notion that if a character is good they will forego any unpleasantness. Finally, the characters in the series are almost wholly defined by their gender. Everything that they do, or are compelling to do, is always somehow related to their gender and how wayward the opposite gender is. People are slapped, caned, whipped, or otherwise coerced by nothing other than the raise of an eyebrow. It's too much to take. I can read no more. If you are already at this the ninth book I'm sure that you will read on, but do yourself a favor and wait for the release in paperback. As for me, the frustration has outweighed the pleasure, and I honestly couldn't care how it turns out anymore. I'm sure that in the end all the primary characters will live happily ever after anyway."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Sorry, fans of Wheel of Time, there are better books out there. I really enjoyed the first 3 books of this series, then it got boring, long, and dull. Jordan writes like he is just milking this for as much money as he can make.For a far better series turn to George Martin's 'A Song of Fire and Ice.' I just finished the 3rd book (A Storm of Swords) and it was amazing."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan's style in writing has changed throughout the WoT series. At the start of the series, Jordan focused on the development of his main characters, the cultures and main plot lines. He now seems to have abandoned his original charter while writing and has lost focus.Books 1-3: This is the intro to the series. Jordan sets up the rest of the series with these first three books. Some of the plot lines and characters from these first three books fizzle away after serving their purpose in moving the main plot line forward. Other plot lines and characters establish the purpose of the plot continue to stay in the focus of the reader. In these first few book, Jordan strings together the character threadlines into epic crecendos at the end of each chapter that blend together into a climactic panoply of unfolding plotlines at the conclusion of each book. The character view point of each chapter constantly shifts to provide a multi-hued perspective of this facinating world. Jordan suspends the reader's anticipation at the end of each chapter leaving the reader compelled to start the next chapert.Books 4-6: In this part of the series Jodan has developed the characters and lands to a point the reader is familiar with behavioral reactions. The readers is familiar with the overall plot line, but is still surprised at certain twists along the road. The characters have abandoned many of their original concerns and have started to focus on seemingly larger issues. Jordan maintains the rhythmic story telling of the first three books while pushing the complexity of the plot lines to new highs. The new feeling the reader had with the first three books, Jordan replaces with a warm sense of familiarity and consistency.Books 7-9: There is a seeming difference in the format of these next few books. While the seventh book concludes with an intense scene maintain the same feel of the first six books, some of the original luster has faded and the plot seems to start dragging away from the original main plot. In books 8 and 9 Jordan piles HUGE plot lines onto the main plot line pushing the complexity of the story to new hight. In a way Jordan pushed the story to such highs in the first six books that he has trouble reaching the same highs. While Jordan adds more characters and facets to the plot, he appears to have trouble with the overflowing plot lines. At times it appears the characters are waiting for something to occur. Joran laces these books with small plot lines that do little to futher the story. Another discouraging trend that is apparent in books 8 and 9, is Jordan's lumping of individual point of views together. Only in the Prologues of the books does the character point of view change within 40 pages. There are few hanging moments that leave the reader filled with the desire to read more. This issue could easily have been remedied by moving some of the chapters around to chop up some of the 200 page segments that drag. Another annoying detail that I observed in the 8th and 9th books is that the font size increased in the hardcover editions. While the 8th and 9th books appear the same length as ethe earlier books, in reality they are probably 60 to 100 pages shorter if using the same font size. Notice how the 7th book is pretty skinny compared to the 6th book. In contrast, observe how the 8th and 9th books seem to have fattened up. The font size deceives the reader to believe that more should be happening in the story. Another unfortunate detail is the sloppiness of the editing as seen by numerous gramatical and spelling mistakes. These errors may have been corrected in later editions, but they were readily apparent in the earlier release.While this book remains part of a wonderfully complex and colorful series, it is forgettable compared to the others in the series. I love reading about the characters that I have learned to love over the years. Many of the new characters Jordan adds are interesting, but seem periferal, although any more detail would further detract from the linear progress of the story.RIP R.O."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"once again, mr jordan has shown that p.t. barnum was correct. there IS a sucker born every minute. like a bad soap opera, he drags on and on, belaboring every scene with detail so excrutiating, it borders on the manic. he's gotten so bogged down with minutae, he's lost the big picture. i shelled out 30 bucks, only to find out that i'm no closer to the end than i was in book 7. mr jordan, do us all a favor, and get to the point already!! perhaps you could use a collaborator if you cant come up with any new ideas."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Let me summarize this book - 300 pages of pointless plotting, 300 pages of plodding politics, 25 pages of useful character development and plot movement. For anyone who has not started the series I offer you this advice: Wait for the series to end (sometime in 2040), read books One through Three, then read the finale. Use the following summary for all the books in between: 1.) Rand ineffective. 2.) Aes Sedai imperious. 3.) Female characters insufferably arrogant. 4.) Rand's companions travel a lot.Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"With Mr. Jordan's books coming out every 2 years, you need a photographic memory or his exploitative and encyclopedic &quot;The World of Robert Jordan's the Wheel of Time&quot; to get (back) into the series without being confused or too bored. I have truly enjoyed his Wheel of Time but....I think he got a little bogged down in Winter's Heart. There is some plot advancement but it plods until two-thirds of the way through. It did pick up at the end so that I was able to finally finish the book. Maybe the next will be better."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think that if this book deserves 4+ stars it's only when comparison to the last few books in the series, not because it in itself is such a great piece of work. I started reading this series more than 6 years ago and I can hardly remember anything that's happened in the first few books other than a few VERY major events. I truly sympathize with those who have followed the series from the very beginning, especially since Jordan specifically mentions an event and then doesn't give you any clues to refresh your memory; as if he's expecting that we reread the entire series before we pick up the latest release. This is getting really old and ponderous now. I want to know what finally happens to Rand before I grow old and die. (I'm 21, btw)As much as I enjoy the storylines of this book, there are way too many subplots that easily could have been reconciled in a few pages, if not deleted altogether. If the entire series was written the way that the final chapter was written, I think there would be a lot more satisfied readers out there. (Where DID that last chapter come from anyway? Did someone else write it to move the plot along?)I definitely think these books are worth reading, but you'd save yourself a lot of frustration if you just go to the library."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I would read it even if it stunk (it didn't), but this recent Jordan effort left me a bit unsatisfied. Having read the other 8, I had to read it. I enjoyed the saga's continuation. And like one of your other reviewers, I too revelled in the return of Mat. We needed his random luck and oh so human frustrations. I love how his character is both sexual and not in his constant running from seduction. His humanity rises to the occasion in this episode, and that too is refreshing.Now for the harsh stuff. My big question was. What is happening, I mean the big picture. We get very little of that. Now that the characters are fractured and the whole world is waiting, frankly the whole thing gets annoying. First we're in the snow...then hey, where did Perrin go? Rand fixes one thing, but still has not got a handle on much, and by the end I wondered what had been accomplished. The whole experience was like going to a distant relative's for Christmas (I love the holidays) but getting a bunch of stuff I didn't ask for.If you've been riding the wheel, you can't get off now. You'll want to know this stuff. But you'll be hungry again very soon."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is a better book than at least the previous two...but it's not that good. He has too many plots going on which hardly get addressed, and are never resolved in one book, often not even two. He has finally resolved some issues here, which is nice, and he finally brings Mat back, which is better, but now Egwene is MIA. I used to be a big fan of the series but it has now become more like a chore to read the books than a joy. He could still use some editing help, as his writing style is still somewhat bloated and awkward. If you still enjoy the series then you should like this book, but if you are hoping for the book which will re-kindle your love of the series.....this one isn't it either."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Much of what I have read in the reviews is right on target: it seems that this epic is slowly turning into a marathon soap opera. Having started the series when Eye of The World first appeared I have now invested somewhere around 10+ years in a story that reads like it is at the HALF WAY POINT.What is obviously Mr. Jordan's strength -- character development -- has also become his downfall. Dozens of pages of material are used to provide insight into characters that would rate no more than an &quot;extra's&quot; role in a movie. To make matters worse, the glacial pace by which the books are produced are compounded by the fact that a MAJOR character/subplot may be skipped entirely in a book. The net result is that I often find myself reading about characters that I vaguely recall but don't have any real idea of who they are or where they fit into the story, taking away from the overall experience.Needless to say, it is really disappointing to see this. Had Mr. Jordan found a way to conclude the [seemingly] final battle in about book 6 and reengaged the characters in a sequel (ala David Eddings' work) he would likely have been hailed as one of the greatest SFF writers in history. Instead we are faced with walking away from a decade's worth of reading or struggling through psychological work-ups of stable boys and footmen in order to get to 100 pages of plot development.Bottom Line: If you have not started the series yet, DON'T. Wait until (if? :o) it is done. You'll have a much better chance of following the hundreds of characters in the story, making the overall experience more enjoyable.hT"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've had #9 for one week and have barely made it through the first 200 pages. Remember when a Robert Jordan book could be finished in a few, non-stop, dry-eyed, read-by-candles-and-flashlights-if-you-have-to days? Those days are gone. I think I will force myself to flip and skim through the last 600+ pages and try to find out what happens to any of the people I care about. This book is difficult to fight through because Jordan taunts us with brief stories about our old friends from the first 4 books. #9 means I'll have to wait another few years for the next installment that may be a disappointment again. It's a sad day for people who started reading this series when it began. By the time Jordan tells the end of the story I won't remember where it began!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Robert Jordan series started off with a bang. I read the first three books in under a week and looked forward to the next books in the series. (At that time I had no idea that Robert Jordan had no idea what he was going to do with his series). I don't remember how many Forsaken were left after the first three books but it seemed like a good number to show up at a great final battle. At this point we had one, maybe two, books to go. Then Jordan plodded on. There were some memorable scenes, but the books were so bad that I don't remember which book had which scene.But I kept reading. Each book was good to bump off two Forsaken (I think that is the mean number of forsaken dead per book) but Jordan began the habit of brining the dead back to life. And his characters didn't go anywhere- apart from wandering all over his imaginary world. I will give Jordan that he has created an interesting imaginary world. He is obviously so excited about what he had created that he now requires his main characters to tread every last inch of it.They have too much to go.I finish the books I begin to read. There are very few that I don't. I have even finished books so that I could give an educated negative review. I was unable to finish Winter's Heart. The book was long and unbearable. And I don't use the word long lightly. A Song of Ice and Fire series by Martin are as heavy in the hand as Jordan, but reading them is exciting and by the end of one you wonder why 700 pages only took a few hours (until you look at the clock, realize that instead of going to bed you will now be getting up and going to work). Neal Stephenson's Cyptomonicon is over 1000 pages and only took me a weekend. Something was wrong with Winter's Heart when I was at it over a week and was only about halfway.Jordan has succeeded in proving the Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy will always increase with time). Jordan's plot has become so spread out as to be unrecognizable from background noise. And I have given him too much of my time. I want it back."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK, this is where I have to part with the series. The problems with the series have far outweighed its original appeal. Here are just a few that I feel compelled to describe:1. Jordan isn't getting paid by the word anymore, he's being paid by the page. There are far less words in this book than previous ones, yet there are just as many pages. It would have been 1/2 the length of Book I if the font had been the same size. And they still charge us the same price for less book (much less).2. The main problem with his stories is that Jordan is stretching his books out to these boring \\"One climax per book\\" stories. Remember in TEotW when things happened? First the Trollocs, then the chase, then Shadar Logoth, then the split story lines, etc. At the pace the story moves at now, each episode of TEofW would have been mangled into an entire book. Getting out of Emond's Field would have been almost 2 books, with the attack as one, and the chase to the ferry as Book 2. Now one thing happens in the entire book, usually in the last 50 pages.3. The length of time between each book is way too long to remember or continue to care about each character. I don't mind waiting for books, but keeping track of all these interchangeable people with interchangeable names is impossible.4. Actually, the only way I remember the story lines is by coming here and reading the reviews. They can't put a paragraph summary on the back of the book, since there isn't a paragraph worth of plot to speak of. But a brief synopsis at the beginning of the book or an enlarged glossary would be nice.5. Everything everyone else has said about the constant \\"braid pulling\\" and irritating females and idiotic males is also true. I can't say anything about it that hasn't been said before, so I won't.That's all I feel worth writing now. I made it more than 500 pages, but I just couldn't care about Harine or Cadsuane or Far Madding anymore. Hearing about Elayne's politics or what's flowing through each character's bonds for the tenth time in as many pages isn't enough to keep my attention anymore."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After confirming that Jordan's wife has become his editor (which I have suspected from the last several books), I am lowering my rating of this book to one star. No wonder Jordan writes such stereotypical &quot;tough&quot; (arms crossed, hair pulling) female characters, and such meek men; he doesn't want to ... off his wife! And what a poor editor she is: I have never read a book with so much fluff and as many spelling/grammatical errors. Word to the wise: avoid buying these books until Jordan gets a better editor (perhaps the one he had from the first several books), and pick up George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones instead!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A big problem with this series is a lack of rationality and personality in the characters. Through 9 books and the lord knows how many pages of paper, it seems that the lessons normal people would learn over time are wasted on the WoT lot. In addition, since all the main female characters (excepting Moiraine and possibly Verin) were obviously stock characters and/or foils for Rand, Mat and Perrin, the result is a noticeable lack of a female point of view in a series that relies so heavily on gender differences.I am not going to comment on the females in the stories. Most of them are just repeating the same motions and behavioral quirks they had in the start of the series. At this point, we are so numb to them that we don't even care when Nynaeve learns to channel. And with the 50 characters stronger in the Power than she is anyway, there is nothing particularly special about her either. Needless to say, the loss of Moiraine was a tremendous blow to the female cast, and the only one we see approaching some level of development is Egwene. And the whole Ebou Dari philosophy of beat your man was another point of disgust. Mr. Jordan should take some time and read Ursula K. Leguin's works. Hopefully he'll get a clue that women don't enjoy browbeating each other as a matter of course.In addition, most of the male characters occupy a score somewhere between perpetual victim to pathetic. There is no forward movement with the men either, and when they sit around with the women and complain for 100 pages straight, even the most ardent Mat supporter gets tired. Rand is boring, Perrin is boring. With no strong female leads, the series relies on the males, and the only entertaining one in the bunch is Mat. And Lan, if you go in for a lack of emotional responsiveness.This lack of direction in characters correllates to a lack of direction in plot. With no character taking the reins and getting something done, the plot drags and has been dragging for about four straight books now. R. Jordan perhaps should start realizing that time in which nothing happens to one character should best be spent with another character, rather than cutting characters from entire books in favor of 300 pages of descriptions of clothing, various minor characters (who at times seem more important than the main characters themselves) and political plotting.We don't really need to see what some random maid thinks of some random lord for a whole chapter just to introduce a sub-plot into the book. If you are going to load tons of sub plots into the book, please don't spend more time than is necessary to flesh it out. It detracts from the main story and ruins the dramatic effect of the event itself. Mr. Jordan, could you please give us surprises in less then 1000 pages? Jesus, by the time I heard that Faile was being marched around in the snow, I began to hope that this would thin the ranks of minor characters a bit more. She's so boring, she should be shoved into the snow and left to die. She's Saldaean. She's used to it. And toss the rest of the cast in there with her as well.On to the villains. Oops, there is nothing to say because they are all the same traditional 'I'm bad and I know it' character. The Forsaken are boring us. Either make Rand and the main characters less powerful or give new enemies IQ tests before hiring them.In fact, I would like to put together a book list for Jordan to read: The Mists of Avalon, Shogun and The Fionavar Tapestry.My only advice is stay far away from this series. Go to the library/bookstore, read the last chapter and leave. You won't miss a thing."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The series unfortunately, is becoming much like a daytime soap opera. It's unfortunate because he has so much material available to draw from that there really is no need for the characters to stay on any one minor plot for too long. The story started out like a winning racehorse right out of the gate. The horse can still run like the wind forever but the jockey is getting tired.When &quot;The World of Robert Jordan's, The Wheel of Time,&quot; came out it gave so many things to look forward to. There are whole other continents and people that can be written about in this series that there is no need to linger about in the same places. Jordan could easily have the characters Traveling to the other regions and creating whole new interesting adventures without the fear of running out of story sub-plots, yet I don't feel that he really needs to explain everything either. Mystery is a cornerstone of all fantasy. It is what makes the fantastical immortal and enduring.Regardless of how Jordan handles the rest of the series until its end, he has shown his genius. I suppose a story is much like a child, as it grows it becomes harder to handle all the things it is getting into. Hell, and as far as this one goes, it's definitely a teenager. Maybe he needs to listen to his creativity and take more time. I know that sounds crazy considering the ever lengthening spans between each book, but I wouldn't mind waiting &quot;a little&quot; longer for better, for what he showed us he could do with the earlier books. Of course just as long as he does finish the story some day, so we can all have a drink and thank him for the memories."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First, I'd like to say I enjoyed this book a lot. There are only two points I did not like, although one of them I'm still not sure what to think of.The first of them is the extent of the parts of the book dedicated specifically to Perrin and Mat. I seem to remember that when the 3 major characters' plot lines started separating, the chapters dedicated to those plots were well distributed along the book. However, now they're all together in a block and that can be very tiring. I found myself wanting to skip the chapters about Perrin and Faile at the beginning of the book because its plot wasn't so interesting and it was way to long.The second point is about the lenghth of the whole series. I know many readers have been complaining about this and I must say I have to add my complaint to theirs (Mr. Jordan, if you ever get to read these reviews, please listen to us). I read in an interview with Jordan that he plans on AT LEAST 3 more books. That would make more than 15 years of Wheel of Time books being released and I must say that a lot of people will have given up before the last book comes out, which is a pity.On the other hand, I kind of have to aggree with its lenghth. With so many plots and subplots left hanging, there is not a chance to finish the series in less than 3 books and I certainly want to see EVERYTHING worked out (I have not spent hours of my life with this novel to see something still dangling loose at the end!). Besides, the long description he gives of places, peoples and scenes does add to the versimilitude of the series. Well, all in all, there are good sides and bad sides for everything.That's it. If you like the Wheel, read this book because something very important happens in it, and avery fan will love to see it happening.The last scene is its strongest and most thrilling part. Go on and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm a big fan of this series. I started to read this back in the early 90s. There are two main problems with this series right now: 1) Jordan writes them too slowly. I can't believe its been almost 10 years since I started reading the Wheel of Time. 2) The plot of the story moves way too slow.Jordan seems to have tried to correct the second problem in book 9. In previous books (books 6-8) he had 50 different plots and subplots running throughout the story. Who could remember all the names? There must at least be 100-200 different characters. The books dragged and by the end of the story we only learned a small detail about the main plot (Rand &quot;The Dragon REBORN&quot;). In book 9, Jordan seems to stick with only the top 4-5 main themes. The story line runs faster...The other main problem is that this series has become too predictable and stagnant. In the first 3-4 books, action was the common theme. Plus, Jordan used to write the greatest war/fight scenes. I recall in early books, Jordan would describe in detail about different fighting styles. I could basically hear the clang of steel as I read the novel. Now, he battle scenes are routine and, in fact, quite boring. This series has become less action and more planning.If you've read the first 8 books, I recommend reading this book as well. It's not bad... just not as good as book 2 or 3."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Although wonderfully written the most important events of the book could have taken 100 pages.

In the end of the book there are a lot of them wanting to put an end to Rand. They can do nothing. A bunch of Aes Sedai and Ashaman can hold of the most powerfull channellers of the world and make them flee? Very disappointing.I also expected the battle of Tar Valon in the beginning of the book.

The publisher, I'm sure, has given RJ a guideline on how many pages the book should be and frankly you can only put so much in them. I personally enjoy how indepth the characterizations and histories are. The end of Winter's Heart was very exciting though, and left many questions regarding the next book. This is not a series for the impatient person. This series is for the person that likes a great epic! I started reading these books in 95' and eagerly await each one. I usually devour them in 2 or three days then reread the entire series to see if there are any details I may have missed.

This is still a good book b/c of those I mentioned before but not as good as it could've been.My favorite part of this series was &quot;Eye of the World&quot; simply b/c of Mat and Rand on the run playing for their supper.

How the auhtor is planning to bring this all together in the final book no ten will be interesting to see. Let's hope he will not fall into the &quot;Twin Peaks enclosure&quot;-trap.

Lots of boring court details with Elayne, a brief part with Perrin, and a lack of &quot;moving on with it&quot; in general. WoT has been a truely awesome series but i'm wishing a conclusion would be nearer on the horizon.However, after the first 200 the book really picks up. We finally find out what happened with Mat Cauthon and Rand participates in several GOOD combat scenes. The finale here was arguably the best in the series, even topping the Horn of Valere ending the second book had.Winter's Heart has a rocky start but continues the series in Jordan's winning style. Definetly worth reading, the last hundred pages or so will have you dancing with excitement (difficult while sitting)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Having re-read Books 7 and 8 while waiting for Winter's Heart, I expect that I shall upgrade it to 4 stars eventually. Still, some old problems continue to annoy. It starts slowly - deadly dull until about page 225. Some important and winning characters (e.g., Egwene, the White Tower powers) are slighted or left out entirely. Grammar and typography (in the last third especially) are sloppy. And, after ending Book 8 with Faile tramping enslaved through the snow, he visits that subplot early on, then just leaves her tramping through the snow! On the other hand, the author seems finally to be moving toward resolution of several long-standing issues, such as Mat's fate, Rand's ultimate plans and love life, how Nynaeve will mature and fit into Aes Sedai society, Elayne's prospects as Queen, etc. He does further explore Rand's very important relationship with Cadsuane. And the book certainly ends with a great big bang that may change everything! All in all, I feel a little let down, but will probably like it better in a few months. As well for me that these books only come along every two years!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"THE NEGATIVES (the positive below)The book seems more hurried than previous one as if the writer was under the gun to finish it faster. The final battle of the book seems to be missing details of individual fights. Lan's fight with another sword master is undocumented other than the fact that it happened. What happened to the two renegade Ashaman who were coming up the stairs?Where is the author's vaunted imagination when it comes to describing what Rand and Nyenvae had to do to ... with the most powerful sa'angreal? There are no battles only talks of them, the same goes for swordfights and the power is used mostly for traveling and healing. The bubbles of evil are nowhere to be seen and the crowd of forsaken and dark friends sit on their butts through 98 percent of the book.THE POSITIVESHowever, weather and scenery as well as people are described in great detail just what you had come to expect from Mr. Jordan. I waited for this book for a long time and, I read it with a hungry passion, not being able to put it down for any great length of time. I want to know what happens next, and will wait eagerly for the next book, which may or may not be the last. The plot is magnificent in its diversity and wondrously detailed. Mr. Jordan's imagination rivals that of writers like JRR Tolkien and Isaac Asimov.CONCLUSIONThis book is a slightly more active continuation of pulling all of the threads together and getting them ready for what comes next."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It's amazing to see all these one and two star reviews still lingering around this late into the series . . . don't get me wrong I don't say that because I feel those folks don't have a point (they do) but I figured by now, this late in the game, Jordan would have whittled his fanbase down to the diehards. It's a testament to the strength of the early books and the promise that people still see that so many are sticking around to see how it ends, whether it's from honest interest or just morbid curiousity. Reviewing these books is a bit of an odd task these days because I'm mostly writing this to people who have already read the book and want to see if I hated or loved it as much as they did (or conversely, they've given up on the series and want to confirm they made the right decision). Any potential new readers should take these reviews with a grain of salt . . . the series really is very good, but has some serious flaws which may or may not do it in by the time it finishes. Best to wait until it's near the end and then read the whole thing straight through. This novel, book nine in a series that maybe possibly might be a total of twelve books (so he says currently, only time will tell) and unfortunately this tends to follow the same pattern left by the previous couple of books . . . characters tread water for the bulk of the novel and then in the last chapter something important happens. Really, if you were try to summarize the novel through events you'd really only be able to name the last chapter as crucial and after six hundred pages of epic fantasy, I think the reader needs more than that. However, this novel bodes well for the closing sections of the series . . . for one thing, something does actually happen that will make a difference in later books, which is probably more than the last two novels combined. Secondly, Mat returns to action after being totally ignored in the last novel . . . he doesn't do all that much but it's nice to have him back in the story itself . . . although that does come at the cost of losing Perin, who makes an appearance early on and then vanishes with nary a mention again (though to be honest, he's getting less and less interesting as the novel winds on). Jordan remains as readable as ever, his penchant for over-description never bothers me so much since when I sense it's starting to overtake the narrative, I just start skimming . . . chapters really do fly by and I managed to finish the book in only a few hours of reading. A bigger problem is that there are just too many stinkin' characters, cutting the glossary down to bare bones was a terrible idea since Jordan tends to keep exposition to a minimum and some chapters only feature supporting characters, most of whom are just people with funny names talking about stuff I don't understand (it's like visiting a foreign country only we're all speaking the same language) . . . I've found the solution to that, other than getting angry, is to simply go with it . . . the trick here is that very few of the supporting character subplots are really vital to the main story, it's just there to give the reader an idea of what's happening in the world and thus I just simply breeze through it without trying to understand and if it becomes important later by some odd chance, I'll just figure it out then. This highlights yet another problem with the book though . . . the beyond glacial plotting. Rand announces his main goal at the end of the prologue and then proceeds to putz around for the rest of the novel right up until the end. It's the same with the other characters, they fiddle about and then as the novel starts to close stuff starts to happen as if the characters all realize they're running out of space. The problem is that most people are reading because of the main narrative, of Rand getting ready to either save the world or crack it in two . . . and any chapter not dealing with Rand is mostly just taking up space and killing time, ensuring that any steps the plot takes are baby steps toward the end. Awash in characters not doing anything too important, most readers just stop caring. On the plus side, the male-female politics are toned down a bit to a more reasonable level (though Rand manages to achieve the ultimate male fantasy, it stretches credibility a bit, but hey he is the Dragon Reborn) so at least the characters aren't as annoying as they were threatening to become. What the novel (and the series at this point) is missing, I think, is a sense of momentum, what made the early books so fascinating (besides the shock of the new) was that the End felt imminent, that the world was really racing toward the Final Battle and it could happen at any second and time was running out. The series has sort of lost that \\"running for their lives\\" aspects of things and has traded it for a more leisurely pace, and yes this allows Jordan to stretch out and show a nice crosssection of a world in turmoil, but at the same time it sacrifices nearly all the drama from before. Even the Forsaken no longer seem scary, once they were terrible and fearsome, now we're not even sure how many there are, and most of their appearances involve them sitting around talking about evil things they might do. If there is anything that brings hope for future books, it's the final chapter, which should have served as a template for the rest of the novel, with a dozen things happening at once, with important things at stake . . . but even then the biggest action seems to happen off-panel and there's still a sense of momentum missing, I liked it but it still felt by the numbers to me. So what's the verdict . . . readable but lacking that pressing sense of \\"I gotta know what happens next\\" . . . I bought this when it came out and haven't read it until now, simply because all the urgency is gone, I get to it when I get to it. And while this means I don't get as agitated as some others do when it doesn't live up to my expectations, at the same time, it's clear that something is awry. It's good, solid fantasy, but I really can't recommend people start it until the whole series is finished, lest they be trapped in limbo like the rest of us."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Do you remember the characters you created in the past Mr. Jordan?Do you find it easier to make up a whole new cast of characters rather than to research and develop the characters you created long ago?Do you have any clue whatsoever as to where this story is heading?My son and myself used to spend hours each week discussing characters and plot lines.

It's pretty bad when you can skip entire chapters and not miss a thing.The best part of the book is the last part, if you have the patience to wade through countless and seemingly meaningless storylines to get to it.Also, am I the only one who thinks Rand bonding and bedding three women is turning this into soap opera trash.

More soap opera trash?The ending finally gets down to business and moves this story along. It's the best part of the book and yet Jordan spends way less time on it than on the rest of the book. I wanted more. He begins descriptions of the battle with the Forsaken, skips the most of the action and then we pan to the end where we get a brief body count and Cadsuane making up her mind to keep an eye on Rand...duh. What happened to all the Forsaken? Were they injured at all? And speaking of them....their identies are now so hard to keep up with you need a reference manual to see who's who.It's better than Path of Daggers, which did nothing to advance the story. But it's not good enough. Mr. Jordan is beginning to seem as overwhelmed by his story as his readers and one wonders if he is making this up as he goes along or even has an end in sight."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Beginning with a prologue that's too verbose and then focusing on Perrin and Faile for the first six chapters, Jordan writes a book that has some strengths and a lot of weakness. Starting with the weakness, I don't really care what happens to Perrin and Faile as the entire Masema plot line seems to just be about giving Perrin something to do. Now that Faile has been kidnapped by the Shaido Aiel, one of the hallmarks of the series continues - constant fracturing of the plot lines.The Elayne section was rather terrible. Not as terrible as anything concerning Faile but still pretty bad.Mat makes a return to the series. His section focuses on his attempts to rescue some Aes Sedai from Seanchan occupied Ebou Dar. Along the way we are introduced to new POVs. Egeanin. Bethamin. Tuon. All Seanchan. And all allowing us to gain more knowledge of the Seanchan from their perspective. This was interesting. I could only wish Jordan focused more on showing us Seanchan.But wait. There are more POVs introduced. Now you can have double the POVS. Order yours now and Jordan will throw in some discussion of courses (More on that below).And of course there is the Rand section. The Elayne and Mat sections are both longer. But hey, who cares about the Dragon Reborn when you can write lengthy passages about fashion, horses and Elayne's courses moving a week to match Birgitte's. But there are some moments of levity. The section where Rand confronts Elayne, Min, and Aviendha in front of Nynaeve is hilarious because of the latter's reaction. Later, everything that happens in Far Madding is middling. It's like Jordan wanted to show every single nation in the course of the series. And even later we get to Aridhol. But the events around Aridhol, that sadly only take place over 30 pages, are some of the best of the series. And if you've read my reviews you should know what happens in every odd numbered book so far.All in all, not as bad as Path of Daggers, but nowhere near as good as the first six books.

I've tried many times, but I'm considering dropping the series at this point because it's become so dull.If you decide to continue on with the series and have the dedication to plod through Winter's Heart, just be prepared to read pages and pages of details about the clothes of characters of only peripheral interest to the plot. Every single character presented will be fully illustrated, every time he or she changes clothes, and even repeated multiple times when they haven't even changed clothes, down to the last thread. I've learned how to skim Jordon's writing and not lose anything, but there's hardly any plot progression that happens in this book, that even skimming is hard now. I'm about 60% of the way through this book now and there's only been about 2, maybe 3 chapters worth of material about any of the main characters. It's very frustrating when an author deliberately holds out on you and only gives you clothes - not that he hasn't been obsessed with women's clothing all along, but with this book I feel he has lapsed. I honestly can't tell if he knows the difference between describing lace and describing his characters.Beware this book. Maybe read a plot synopsis and skip it altogether if the next ones are any more tolerable."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I wasn't wowed by Book 8 [The Path of Daggers], and neither did I revile it, as so many reviews did. I felt that it was somewhat rushed (due to its short length, and sometimes difficult-to-comprehend writing), and the least satisfying novel in the Wheel of Time series, but still a decent book in its own right, as a commentary on the aftermath effects of foreign invasion and the drawbacks of leadership positions; [The Path of Daggers] managed to move the larger story forward, though not as much as I wanted. It's for this reason that Book 9 [Winter's Heart] has exceeded my expectations, righting many of the wrongs I found in its predecessor.[Winter's Heart] brings back Mat Cauthon, a move that many fans found to be a marked improvement, myself included. He is one of the saga's most important characters, and his presence was sorely missed. Now, I'm not against Jordan's decision to leave certain characters out of some of his books; this only makes it all the more exciting when they return, as evidenced here. With the sheer number of characters who contribute to the grand story as a whole, it's impossible to cram all of them into one novel and have everyone doing something interesting or useful. As such, Egwene al'Vere is absent from [Winter's Heart]; her character appears a couple times in the dream world, but her plot thread and point of view are both absent.More elements that I found to be improved from Book 8 were that the writing was more cohesive and less confusing. Although there were a few very conspicuous typos, and Jordan does occasionally overindulge in descriptive details, the writing is mostly high-quality. I also didn't find myself having to look up who characters where as often as I did in the past couple books; I'm relieved to see that Jordan didn't overuse minor characters as he did in the past few novels. Instead, some characters return from previous books, and a few important ones are introduced, while the number of newer minor additions to the cast is small enough to keep track of. While some new story threads are introduced, a few of the novel's longstanding mysteries are beginning to be solved. Most importantly, I felt more satisfied at the conclusion of [Winter's Heart] than I did after [The Path of Daggers]. I felt like this book carried more enjoyment and momentum, and I had a good time tearing through itThe big plot point is Rand's attempt to cleanse Saidin, which is one of the most famous story arcs in the saga, and frequently cited by fans as one of the best. The book sets it up as the central event, with Rand announcing his intent to cleanse the source in the prologue, and the entire length of the book mounts tension, leaving fans to wonder if Rand will finish the job by the time the book concludes, or if he even has the power to do so. The arc culminates in an intense scene in which Rand's enemies amass against him, and his allies unite around him in order to protect him. Beyond that, a lot goes on in Rand's story: his character grows pessimistic and cold; the tension between him and his three lovers is finally put to rest; he begins to resolve some of his issues with Alanna; Cadsuane makes her best effort to restore some humanity in Rand; Rand embarks on a quest for vengeance against his would-be assassins from Book 8 and comes back with more than he bargained for. Rand's arc is by far the highlight of [Winter's Heart], and series fans should read the book for that alone.However, [Winter's Heart] is still a distance away from the greatness of the series' early works. The pace is slow in the plot threads besides Rand's. Perrin and Faile show up for a short time at the beginning, and then are not mentioned for the rest of the book. Mat attempts to liberate some Aes Sedai prisoners and escape Ebou Dar; this is a good arc that reveals more about the Seanchan, but I felt that it could have been slightly shorter. Elayne begins to consolidate her power in Caemlyn, but not enough progress is made, and her arc doesn't end on a point of interest. A conflict between Logain and Mazrim Taim is hinted at, but Jordan doesn't explore this potentially interesting plot device. The problem here is that Jordan does not use cliffhangers; there's nothing to get readers excited and wondering where the characters will pick up in the next book.Despite the flaws, I do maintain that I liked [Winter's Heart]. The problem is that it's good, but not good enough. It must be hard to avoid criticism when the early Wheel of Time books set such a high standard, so I will give Robert Jordan credit for soldiering on with his vision of the world he created. However, he is asking for a lot of patience from his readers, who have waited several books to see the series' mysteries solved. Each book has its strong points, and a strong underlying theme, but we must keep in mind the story at large. It may be no fault of the author's, and instead my own impatience, but I'm growing more eager to see the end of the wheel's turning. I'll continue to read and enjoy, and hope that the next book offers a little more of the resolution I've been waiting for. [Winter's Heart] is a worthy addition to the series, though, and possibly the strongest of the \\"middle\\" part of the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A good book like all the WoT Series, Very interesting about the Taint as well as the sea folk, it has a great story and what he's trying to accomplish is fascinating, can't wait till I can read the next book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ooooh. I can see the end in sight and this one hooked me by the nose, pulling me along.My patience with the previous book (no Matt) was rewarded this time. And, boy did I love how Mr. Jordan drew out the whole Matt finding out who Tuon was. And Matt's response when he does find out? Priceless. And the 3 women who love Rand and what they do? Hilarious. And the attempt to cleanse saidin? Whoa!My only concern is what is going on with Faile (but there was a little hint of another plotline there).Setting: Nothing much was new here. We just get to see even more of the world. I don't remember having anyone go to Ebou Dar before, though. So, that was very interesting.Conflict: I touched on a few above, but there is a lot going on here. Every chapter seemed to have something new, some new way to deepen and intensify the conflict, or even to add another level of pain for the characters. I actually started to like Alanna (I know!) and I'm understanding Cadsuane more - and totally respecting her.Plot: The main thing is about Rand trying to cleanse saidin. But, there is also the Seanchan in Altara and Matt's love life. There is Rand and the Asha'men. There are the machinations of the Forsaken. There is even Paiden Fain, crazier than ever.Character: We get even more insight into characters like Alanna, Cadsuane, Nynaeve, and even Rand. I had gotten a bit tired of Rand in previous books. But in this one, we get some more insight into his thinking thanks to some intimate psychic connections from others.Text: Still lots of flowery description and details about what people are wearing. I felt like the action sequences are also getting better, though. Previously, I was having trouble following along sometimes."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first six chapters of Winter's Heart follow Perrin and Faile after Faile is abducted by the Shaido Aiel. The next several chapters follow Elayne as she returns to Caemlyn and prepares to make a bid for her mother's crown. These two storylines are incredibly dull and I confess that I skimmed over a lot of it and read the excellent cross-referenced chapter summaries at Encyclopaedia WOT. I read Winter's Heart years ago and I just did not feel like once again sitting in on Elayne's steward's descriptions of the rats in the Caemlyn sewers or Perrin's angst about Faile (good riddance, I say!).Mat's story, as usual, was entertaining, and we finally get to meet the Daughter of the Nine Moons (who turns out to be not nearly as exotic as her name suggests). Rand's storyline was side-tracked by his quest to hunt down the rogue Asha'man, so he doesn't really accomplish anything new until the very last chapter (as usual).There is the usual plodding pace, annoying references to women's clothing, and frighteningly frequent mentions of spanking. The only thing going for this series at this point is that it is truly epic in scope and I still want to know how it will end. I just hope I can hang in there a little bit longer."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The artwork on the cover of this book couldn't be more appropriate. I would love to say that Jordan picks up speed here, but the pedestrian pace of recent volumes in the series continues. Numerous subplots still await resolution (some barely advance at all), while still new characters and subplots hit the scene. One begins to wonder if Jordan is creating a literary Frankenstein here--how will he be able to control what he has made? On a positive note, I will say that the ending of this book is vintage Jordan and is actually one of my favorite scenes from the entire series. That still doesn't redeem the book to a higher rating, but I offer this as encouragement as you wade through this one. Fellow WoT fans, you have to read this one, just make sure you bring your snow boots."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Without giving out spoilers...The Good:1) Jordan moves a few of the major plot lines forward. Certain events that we were expecting finally occur along with the revealing of several identities.2) He returns Mat to the story and provides him with some good chapters.3) The juvenile romances (among every single couple) are mostly absent.* It frustrates me not to have more positive things to say about a WoT book.The Bad:1) Still overly emphasizes on EVERY female character continuing to either tug at their braids, smooth their skirts, adjust their shawls, blushing, etc.2) After the last book's cliffhanger of Egwene and her contingent of Aes Sedai approaching the White Tower, Jordan decides to completely skip over that subplot (in the same way that he left Mat out of &quot;Path of Daggers&quot;).3) The prologue is over 70 pgs long. Most of it contains worthless story filler without much happening. The 6 chapters following the prologue mostly involve Perrin and Faile in rotations. They are likewise dull and uneventful.4) Way too many minor characters with similar names. Keeping track of them all seriously requires an index. As someone pointed out to me in a slight exaggeration... &quot;you need to distinguish Daigian from that other character Dagin, without confusing him from Degian or that scum Dagean.&quot; Really hated looking back into the last 8 books to check.5) Excessive details given to minor characters and scenary. A lot of talking, but a lack of meaningful conversations. What suffers from this is the progression of the story.The Ugly:1) Not by any means a large book (625 pgs) considering the large font that Jordan chose to have each page printed in.2) Waited 2 years for this, book 9 of the WoT, only to learn that Jordan still hasn't recaptured his writing technique from the first 5 books of the series. Although improved from the last 2 books, Winter's Heart continues to show that Jordan is losing control of how to get to the end of this once epic story.3) Jordan has announced (verbatim) at a recent book signing in San Diego that he &quot;can not complete his vision of the story in fewer than 3 more books.&quot; Given that he takes 2 years to write each one... we'll have seen Star Wars Episode 2 &amp; 3 by that time.Final Thoughts:I've faithfully been following RJ's acclaimed series and have been a fan since book 1. The first 3 books of the WoT series are his best. RJ has created a rich fantasy world with some great characters and background history, but for all that potential... the writer must keep his audience encaptivated and loyal. After enduring the declining quality of his story writing, it scares me to realize that I'm losing my emotional attachment to the story and its characters. It's no longer a series that I can confidently recommend to my friends and colleagues, knowing that a new reader will find the WoT deteoriate as an engrossing story as they surpass book 5. Why are many once loyal fans of the WoT starting to have serious doubts, some of them leaving the series behind only to pick up another fantasy author's work? It's really a rhetorical question. Some die-hard fans will continue to exalt RJ's work without unbiased eyes. 2 years later, I'll continue to read his work simply for the sake of intellectual curiosity to the story. Meanwhile, I search for other authors who've been &quot;overshadowed&quot; by Jordan's fame (slowly turning to infamy) and publicity, but who've been given genuine praise for their writing in the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Be warned that this review contains some minor spoilers. Let's be honest - if you have read the Wheel of Time to this point, you'll read it to the end no matter how bad the future installments are. Unfortunately, Robert Jordan realizes this too. Everything in this book and the last two could have been condensed into one, excellent book of the same quality as &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; or &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot;. But why charge readers for one book, when you can charge them for three?Jordan's biggest problem, in the words of a good friend of mine, is that he loves keeping secrets for the sake of keeping secrets. For example - in Book 3, a gray man showed up dead in the White Tower. Now, in Book 9 (8 or so years later) we find out that Isam killed that gray man. I only remembered this because I decided to re-read the series for the first time before this one came out. Why keep this a secret? Isam kills two unidentified poeple in this book - I'm sure we'll find out who they were in another 8 years. Every other chapter of Winter's Heart seems to involve either: a) The resolution of some irrelevant plot point left in limbo for years or b) The introduction of a new and equally irrelevant plot point.Jordan's ability to develop his characters has also apparently whithered. He used to stir and inspire us - for example, Ingtar's redemption in Book 2. Now, his characters almost seem fungible. Why should I care if one sniffing, vomit prone Aes Sedai dies? There are apparently hundreds more just like her ready to take her place. I cared more about what happened to a single minor character in the first few books than I do now about most of the major players in the series.For that matter, the writing itself is a bit stilted and utterly fails to inspire or energize the reader. Not to give away too much, but there is a battle at the end of the book that involves most of the living Forsaken. Talk about anti-climaxes. For example, Demandred attacks, encounters minor opposition, and just leaves. The battles at Falme and Dumai Wells kept us at the edge of our seat; this one puts us right to bed.Half-hearted writing about half-hearted characters just doesn't work. Considering what happens at the end of this book, you'd expect some sort of big to-do. Instead, the book just ends. Jordan missed a wonderful opportunity here. A five or six page pro-logue about &quot;after-effects&quot; could have redeemed this entire book.With that said, I should emphasize that I only criticize this book because it was written by an author of Robert Jordan's caliber. If this were from some minor author, I would be raving about it and recommending it to my friends. But we all know Jordan can do better.I should also say that, in my experience, there are few people as unforgiving as fantasy and sci-fi fans when it comes to their favorites. Everyone has a bad day, and I think, if we really are fans, we owe it to authors to give them a break and not act like hysterical children when they turn out a sub-par work. Problem is, this is Jordan's 3rd (arguably 4th) sub-par work in a row. I'm starting to think that the quality of this series doesn't have as much to do with Jordan having an &quot;off&quot; day as it does with him holding his readers in contempt. The &quot;five dollars for the pro-logue&quot; fiasco certainly doesn't help Jordan's case."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I, too, have been a reader and rereader of this series since it began a generation ago. This latest book was, AGAIN, disappointing. Jordan and Tor should be concerned, too many people are giving this series up for dead.Can you remember what those first books were like? Fleeing at breakneck speed from Shadowspawn? The fear? The wonder at this brilliant world, the histories, the cultures, the laws of nature and magic? The amazing women and men? The innocence of the good and the black heart of the evil? Those books made your heart pump! And the characters - just as that first original cover review stated so long ago - seem like old friends.What happened?Slow, gradual, decent into mediocrity.The last several books have been, as many other reviewers have written, fluff. Filler. Spotted with great scenes, but generally shallow and getting shallower. We want to get into it! But at every turn Jordan forces a sigh of agony or a roll of eyes from his readers, by repeating the same descriptive passages, or repeating the same bickering between characters, or repeating the same tired thought threads (Faile...likes to be shouted at...?). Aarrgg! Same thing again! We know already!!Put some focus into it. Rand and his tragic love square(trapezoid?)? Soap opera? Didn't have to be. Mat as Queens plaything? Overly obnoxious? Didn't have to be. Focus, follow the arc, and move on. Our characters becoming less and less important and powerful? Fine, just tie it together and move forward. New characters, new background, new threads? Fine, but remember the story. Remember why we all came to the table in the first place. Tell the story! Put your back into it man!Its not too late for this series. Just give us something to cheer for! Cut out the filler, the petty, the repetitous. Give us intrigue! Give us glory! Give us a 300 page battle for Tar Valon! Give us love! Give us Moraine back from the Aelfinn to save the day as the Blight spills shadow over the lands! Give us peril! Aei Sedai at the gates of The Dark Ones prison! Adventure! Passion! Mystery! SOMETHING!!50 pages at the end of 600 is not putting your back into it.He needs to stand up to his publisher and swallow his ego. Jordan began as the best voice in fantasy we had seen in ages, but like so many greats before him, has been broken under the weight and fame of this series.But its not too late...just one powerful book is all we need. It'll feel good to write it. He'll see how satisfying it is. And his numbers will stop dropping off so sharply. Reading bad reviews from the industry as well as fans has got to get old."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First of all, let me say that I too am often amazed and awe-struck by the complexity of the WoT series. It's obvious to me the Robert Jordan's outline alone must have been a huge undertaking. That's what keeps me reading and coming back for more.However, some of the reviewers here are accusing readers who give this book a less than sterling review of having short attention spans. Anyone who has stayed with the series this long is not suffering from a short attention span. The problem with the series is not the length and it is not necessarily a lack of action. The problem is that the series has gotten stale. The same things and the same descriptions are just being repeated, and they are still being described in the same way. There is too much filler. I don't think most people want to read a description of what each character is wearing unless there's a specific reason. It may have been important earlier in the series that Rand was wearing elaborately embroidered expensive finery while his friends were still dressed in humble country clothes. Now, however, he's simply wears variations on the same outfit, but they're always described in detail.I'm not surprised that some readers are having trouble remembering the huge cast of characters. Just the similarity of the names alone is becoming an annoyance. Notice anything similar here?: Alaine, Bain, Berelain, Cadsuane, Caredwain, Dain, Deain, Dobraine, Egwene, Elayne, Ellaine, Faolain, Jain, Lain, Logain, Luaine, Melaine, Moiraine, Mordraine, Padan Fain, Raen, Shiaine, Tigraine. It's enough to make Nynaeve tug the braid right off of her head!I've also noticed the lack of a really evil, frightening foe in the later books. Trollocs were scary in the first book or two, but now they're just fodder. The Forsaken have, for the most part, been too easily overcome. The book needs something like a Balrog to spice things up. The gholam isn't active enough, and I'd like to see the gholam be a much bigger threat.I, too, am disappointed in the depictions of the women characters. The most ridiculous scene of all was when several groups of women got together to use the Bowl of the Winds and right the world. Strong and capable women should have been willing to put their differences aside and work together, but did they draw together for a common cause? No, they argued back and forth and acted like a group of 10 year olds, even though some of them are supposed to be hundreds of years old. I've seen very little evidence of wisdom among all these &quot;Wise Ones&quot; and &quot;Wisdoms&quot; and whole lot of childish temper tantrums. A bad temper is a sign of weakness, not of strength. The casual attitude toward violent physical punishment among all cultures of women is also disturbing. I'm amazed at the number of times grown women are punished by &quot;switchings&quot; or beatings. Every culture is also obsessed with status, and whoever has the lowest status in the room is forced into doing menial tasks. Just once, I'd like to see the lowest-ranking Aes Sedai have some spunk and say &quot;Pour your own tea, you lazy slob!&quot;Finally, there's one thing about our Two Rivers heroes that really puzzles me. These characters are still very young, yet they seem to have completely severed all family ties. Rand is understandably hesitant about seeming to care about his hometown, but why hasn't Egwene written to her mother to say, &quot;Hey Mom, guess what? I'm the new Amyrlin Seat.&quot; Personally, I can't believe her parents haven't hunted her down and...given her a good &quot;switching&quot;!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First things first: Winter's Heart is a much better book than its two most recent predecessors, A Crown of Swords and The Path of Boredom...er...Daggers. I can't really go into plot specifics about why Book Nine is better without spoiling the story, but I will say that fans who have been waiting for &quot;big stuff&quot; to happen won't be disappointed by the ending of this book. The ending of Book Seven was so abrupt I still have whiplash, but this one is actually good, and in the last chapter an event takes place which is the biggest moment in the series so far. And no, I ain't telling what it is. On the down side, if you were ticked off because Mat wasn't in Book Eight (he is in Book Nine, though), RJ pulls a similar stunt this time around. A major storyline from the previous book is not dealt with, and that's not good. Other than that, if you've read the first eight books, you'll read (and probably enjoy) this one. Still, RJ introduces more plotlines and complications than he resolves. Storylines are left up in the air until Book Ten (at least), there are more dangling threads in this series than on a cheap suit. This series is going at least eleven books, so buckle up, it's going to be a long ride."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Jordan, regardless of the waste of time the first halves of books 7 and 8 were. This book is a breath of fresh air - not only does it finally move the plot along in a direction that makes it look like Jordan might actually complete the series in book 10 (Believe me, if it goes to book 11, I will be fast on my way to losing RJ fandom state), but this book is actually well written! Some of the things that we've been waiting for are finally starting to happen (unfortunately, not all of them, so lets hope book 10 remedies that in 2003...) I won't say more, but the book is good. It's NOT like books 7 and 8."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"That's right: for those of you wondering when this series will end, according to my sources--someone at Tor--there will be four more books. Nor has this been a recent development: I have been aware of the projected length since before the release of &quot;Crown of Swords.&quot; And there is a certain logic within the context of the story at ending the series with book thirteen. Hopefully this will clarify matters for those of you wishing for a rush to conclusion. Of course, Jordan could always change his mind.What does this bode for the rest of us waiting to read the remaining four books? I suspect a ratcheting up in the advance of the major plotlines, perhaps hinted at by the conclusion that ends &quot;Winter's Heart.&quot; There is little question that, in terms of plot advancement, the last three books have slowed considerably, and many would claim that &quot;Path of Daggers&quot; decidedly lagged. As one of those who defended that book, finding a rationale to its structure justified by a need to establish the set up for events that were to follow in &quot;Winter's Heart,&quot; I must say that not all my expectations were fulfilled. At the conclusion to &quot;Path of Daggers,&quot; I suspect that many readers--myself included--may have held a reasonable expectation that several major plot threads would be advanced in the following book: Perrin's rescue of Faile and confrontation with Sevanna; Mat's encounter with the Daughter of the Nine Moons and his as yet unrevealed role in countering the Seanchan; Egwene's march to the walls of Tar Valon and confrontation with Elaida; and progress in Rand's movement towards Tarmon Gaidon. Of these four--and there are others--in &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; only two are addressed, and even then just barely. Much of the book instead is devoted to further development of interpersonal relationships and world building, as well as secondary plots. While this is done with the detailed and written skill Jordan has evidenced in his earlier books, it is bound to be a disappointment to those who had hoped for further plot development. While I suspect within the framework of four more books that the pace will begin to pick up--by necessity if not desire--nonetheless &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; must be perceived, along with the preceding two books, as a period in which the series, in terms of major plot development, has slowed.This does not mean that there are few rewards in reading this work. Jordan again reveals his mastery in world building, especially in the details of the society of Far Madding. Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne are further differentiated, their personalities developing in different, and at times opposite, directions. In separating the many major characters, Jordan has clearly delineated the emerging differences in their personalities, and while they do at times seem a reflection of each other, nonetheless clear changes and development of character are taking place. And the emerging role of relatively new characters--especially Cadsuane--are adding fresh strengths to the story. Finally, Jordan continues to vividly construct the landscape of his world in detail--some would say too much, but I would argue that perhaps no world in fantasy has been realized as fully or successfully.As an aside, I wish to address some of the criticism of this book, as well as some of the praise. Discussion of Jordan's work has become polarized, and this is unfortunate. In perhaps understandable frustration many have damned this series, while others have risen to its defense. At times this has led to comments and ratings that seem based more upon emotions or partisanship than a considered reflection of the work's faults and merits. Scores and comments ranking any of Jordan's books as trash or deserving of one or two stars ignore the quality of the author's writing, the imaginative character and scope of his tale, regardless of any flaws found in his plot development or characterizations. Equally, those who praise individual books as if they were the second coming ignore, as in the case here, flaws, such as the lack of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; to significantly advance the major plotlines, instead becoming engrossed in detail and characterization at the expense of developing the story. Despite the rousing conclusion, this book is not the equal of books one through six, and while an improvement upon &quot;Path of Daggers,&quot; is not among Jordan's best. While, compared to many other author's works, it may be one of the best books of the season, weighed against the author's earlier work, it is hardly deserving of full marks, anymore than it is deserving of the lowest.Regardless of one's opinion as to the success of this book or the series--and it is obvious they are divided and many--there is little question that the author is redefining the meaning of epic fantasy, in sheer scale if nothing else. The scope of Jordan's narrative reveals both its richness and its flaws, the latter being evidenced in the author's desire to expand his creation in ancillary, and some would say unnecessary, plot directions, the richness in the equally epic vision revealed in the unfolding narrative, whether at times lagging or not. And even though occasionally the main plotlines appear to lose focus, there is never any sense that the author is not fully in command of his story. Chide him if you wish for stretching out his tale in directions serving their own individual stories, but never doubt that the march is ultimately to Tarmon Gaidon.I suspect, when this series is finally completed, when it can be read from book one to the end, when it is no longer necessary to wait a couple years between installments, that most readers will find a tale complete in its fulfillment, and that many of the current criticisms that appear to stem from impatience may need reassessment. Of course, this is predicated upon a belief that Jordan will successfully conclude this series, and that the remaining four books will resolve and move more directly to conclusion. If my earlier assessment of his books and intentions are correct, this will be the result. If not, we are in for a disappointment as huge as the scale of this epic."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Did anyone have this problem: I read about 250 pages and was so confused about what was going on because I didn't remember who these people were? The relatively minor characters that are running around performing tasks all over the place, like those sisters hunting Black Ajah in the Tower, had me scrounging around for my copy of PoD so I could look up who they were and what they were doing. I didn't even remember that Morgase was now 'Maigden' or whatever the maid's name is that she's pretending to be. The only reason I remembered that's who it was is because the inside flap of the book says Morgase is a captive. The book itself never even mentions her name. Shouldn't RJ give a little reminder? One quick sentence like &quot;Morgase was getting tired of the charade.&quot; I mean it's been 2 years and PoD wasn't that memorable. Most authors do give minor rehashes to keep their audience abreast. It doesn't dumb down the book (too much), and for people like me who don't read the r.a.s.f.w.r.j newsgroup that often, it maintains our sanity.All that said, I enjoyed this volume even though the ending everyone here had been raving about was rather short and VERY non-descriptive. Sure a momentous event occurs, but the Aes Sedai vs. Forsaken battles are skipped over! &quot;Cyndane approached the Aes Sedai and began to weave the flows...&quot; Then it jumps somewhere else and you never get to read about the One Power battle! Mucho annoying. You only get the aftermath, and that was even quite abbreviated.On the plus side, several plot mysteries are unraveled, such as the identity of Osangar, the Taim=Demandred issue, and who Cyndane is. (OK, She's back, now where's Moiraine?) Mat finally meets the Dot9M's. And the next book should ROCK due to Rand's success at his project in this book.So a decent amount of stuff does happen, even though the books are now deceptively shorter than they appear. Anyone notice the older ones, about up to Crown of Swords, the font type was much smaller allowing about 48 lines per page, and with PoD and WH there's only around 30 lines per page? Thats a big difference when dealing with 600+ page books.Anyway, like the title of the review says, if you've come this far, we all know you're not going to stop now. There's no point in saying &quot;dont read this one!&quot; or &quot;skip it&quot; cuz you cant if you want to finish the story and no one is quitting after digesting 5000 pages of WoT thus far revealed. If he takes another 6 years and 3 books to finish I'll be in my friggin 30's. So write on RJ, you know we'll all still be here to read em. Except for the really old people who die before you finish the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, don't get me wrong. I've been a big fan of the Wheel of Time series ever since I picked up Eye of the World. I've read all of the previous books 5+ times. But these last two books have been incredibly frustrating in their lack of plot advancement. Jordan has turned his epic into a soap opera, and for me, the soap bubble has burst.Winter's Heart spends an enormous number of pages meandering around slowly grinding out yet another maze of twisty little passages, all alike. After all the trouble Rand and his friends went through in the first 8 books fighting the Dark, they have gotten practically nowhere. Sure, maybe Jordan is trying to convey the feeling of futility the characters must feel about what's (not) happening, but with this volume, I think he succeeded a bit too well.Then, about 30 pages from the end, it appears Mr. Jordan was pressured by the publishers to finish, because it seems as though he suddenly realized he had forgotten to put in a point. I'll admit, those last 30 pages were riveting. But I skimmed the other 630, hoping against hope that something interesting was going to happen to these people I've spent so much time getting to know... and ultimately I discovered that I don't really care any more."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"to take a series that once had such promise and absolutely destroy it? The first 4 or 5 books were great, and book 6 was decent. Crown of Swords and Path of Daggers were difficult to get through, mostly because they sucked... they were slow, characters were missing, and the plot was hardly advanced at all. They should have been one-half of one book combined, and would have been, if Jordan had a decent editor (PoD was actually much shorter than the other books, almost as if Jordan pumped it out for a deadline, cash, or both...). At any rate, this newest installment is _slightly_ better than the previous two, but it is not on the level as the first few books. I'm sorry to say that despite the cool ending, I've given up on Jordan from here on out - I discovered WoT when Dragon Reborn came out, and have been a huge fan ever since... but no longer. The cliched, stupid male/female relationships, the invincibility and god-like powers of the main characters, and the ridiculous villains, combined with the poor plotting and lack of a main storyline have all made me decide to throw in the towel. When everything's completed, I may go back and read the remaining novels in paperback if my library has them.If you're looking for epic fantasy on the scale of Jordan, but with realistic characters, great dialogue and incredible prose, look to George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire saga (starting with the novel A Game of Thrones). Also try out Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy (beginning with The Dragonbone Chair). Both of these works are far better than WoT (in its current state)."},{"Title":"More Quick Watercolor Quilts","review":"Dina has outdone herself, again. Her creativity, and talent for design and color selection, produced another beautiful book. Again, her instructions are clear and concise. She shares her ability to select fabrics that compliment each other beautifully. I didn't have any interest in watercolor quilts until I discovered Dina's books. If you love beautiful watercolor quilts, but were intimidated by sewing so many little squares together, try Dina's method. You'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"More Quick Watercolor Quilts","review":"I have owned this book since it first came out. I keep returning to it for projects and basic sewing and quilting instructions--like how to sew the ends of binding together so there are no lumps. I especially loved the Diamond Jubilee design shown on the back cover and opposite the table of contents page. Although the pattern wasn't written up in the book, I was able to count the squares and recreate it. (The pattern is now available in quilt shops.)

This is ambitious. It is useful for finding reproductions of sketches for final works. Most of the sketches are reproduced in two inch tall black and white in the margins of the book. More detailed sketches and final works are reproduced larger. When applicable reproductions are in color. All of the reproductions are high quality and limited to one page - no two page spreads where the pic gets cut in half by the binding. This book is a bit large to fit nicely on a shelf at 10 x 14 inches. This tells you that the maximum width for a reproduction is going to be about 8.5 inches. It is the book to check if you want to find a copy of an obscure work by Van Gough, or see sketches and drawings to follow the artistic process for a particular work.Jan Hulsker (the author currently unlisted by amazon) has also tried to provide dates for as many of Van Gough's letters as possible. These letters are published in the 1953 four volume compilation of letters by DW van Gough. They are quoted frequently but not reproduced here. The text and pictures are arranged chronologically. The goal is to present as much data as coherently as possible. It possible to read through this, but it is a bit dry, and I don't recommend it unless you are hard core. If you are doing in depth scholarly research on Van Gough then you will want to take a look at this book.University libraries should have a copy of this. You will have a book about Van Gough anyway. So why not the complete works?People who like Van Gough's work will like this one. If it isn't available don't be sad. He is a popular artist and it will be easy to find a good book to please you.Chapters:PrefaceNote on the CaptionsCanvas SizesVan Gough's Course before 1881Etten/ April - December 1881The Hague/ January 1882 - September 1883Drenthe/ September - December 1883Nuenen/ December 1883 - November 1885Antwerp/ November 1885 - February 1886Paris/ March 1886 - February 1888Arles/ February 1888 - May 1889Saint-Remy/ May 1889 - May 1890Auvers-sur-Oise/ May - July 1890NotesConcordance of De la Faille and Hulsker NumbersList of ColorplatesPicture CreditsSelected BibliographyBiographical ChronologyIndex"},{"Title":"DAVE GROHL","review":"I agree with everyone else so far who wasn't fond of this book. I've been a fan of Dave Grohl for most of his career and what I thought would be insightful as to who he is as a person or whatever, turned out to be a boring endlessly analytical review of everything Dave Grohl has been involved in musically.I wanted the FACTS of Dave Grohl's life and career, but all this useless music critic had to offer was his opinions about what each track sounded like on each album and which ones were good, which were bad... excuse me? If you're a fan of Dave Grohl or the Foo Fighters in the first place, we're all probably going to have a difference of opinion as far as which album/songs are \\"best\\". What's the purpose of injecting Dave's BIOGRAPHY with your opinions? And the book is full of this guy's opinions and I'm NOT INTERESTED IN THOSE! He literally goes on for fifteen pages about how exactly each track on 'the colour and the shape' sounds and if it's good or not when I really don't need that because I ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE!!!!Another note- Martin James needs to learn how to spell. Numerous words and names are spelled wrong and punctuation marks used incorrectly. Once he said \\"...basketball star Codi Bryant...\\" Did he mean 'Kobe Bryant'? Apparently he also needs a hearing aid. I was feeling embarrassed for the guy. It's crazy how in love with his own perspective he is. He basically used Dave Grohl as a tool to unleash a perfect medium for his own views on music. I was thoroughly disappointed."},{"Title":"DAVE GROHL","review":"Although this book was an interesting summary of the bands Dave Grohl admired and was influenced by growing up, and, of course, played in, I was disappointed that it really didn't talk about him much in terms of his personal life. Most of the personal stuff in there I had already read on the internet. The author doesn't make it a secret that he pretty much pieced this together using interviews to other magazines or web sites. It seems that he must personally know Dave, but there is no indication of any one-on-one interview for this book.I guess I was looking for the: what was his childhood like, what was it like growing up with him as a child or teenager, where did he work, where did he meet his wives, etc.If you're looking for a breakdown of concerts and albums, this book does a good job of that. I do question reviewing each song from each CD...songs seem pretty subjective to me, and the author uses a lot of \\"this has a hint of the Pixies with a Metallica type chorus\\"... If you're getting that much out of it, you're analyzing it too much. IT'S JUST A SONG! Ya like it or ya don't!"},{"Title":"DAVE GROHL","review":"What could have been a fantastic biography ended up being a poor excuse for a useless music critic to write a book on punk music. There is very little information on Dave Grohl the person and not even that much on the Foo Fighters. Instead the author simply tries to analyse each and everytrack that Grohl and his bands have released and then analyses every track that influenced those tracks and then analyses the bands that performed those tracks. In a nutshell this book is a collection of interviews with various magazines. If you were to take the information on Grohl alone the book would be a good 5 pages.A complete waste of time. Do not even bother! Go and spend the money on music mags instead. I seriously think the reason the author has worked for so many different publications is because he got fired for trying to sound clever."},{"Title":"DAVE GROHL","review":"Yes, it's true that there is probably more detail than many people will want to know about punk rock and you may not agree with all of the authors opinions as he discusses each album and track (The Colour and the Shape is a great album start to finish!), but if you are the kind of person that looks for magazine articles to learn more about Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, you will get a lot of insights within this book that you won't find anywhere else. No question, you need to be a big fan of the band to get this book, but I'm guessing you must be or you wouldn't be looking for this book anyway. The author did his homework and extracted comments from many sources throughout Dave Grohl's entire career to give a lot of behind the scenes information. I enjoyed the book enough that I wish it had been longer and covered their recently released album. I recommend it for the die hard fan that is looking to get the inside information that they haven't been able to find anywhere else."},{"Title":"DAVE GROHL","review":"I love a good biography, especially those of musicians. I love all of Dave Grohl's creations esp. the Foo Fighters. I was really looking forward to learn more about the man. Unfortunately this book doesn't focus much on Dave but rather on the Punk music scene and a who's who of punk music. I didn't need a whole chapter on Cobain either. Who's bio is this anyway? The book does have some really good pictures, just not much personal info on the man. I grew bored and didn't even bother to finish it, which is rare for me. Not recommended."},{"Title":"DAVE GROHL","review":"Fantastic quality product, I am extremely impressed with the care and thought taken with packaging my book.Every thing the description said was true and an absolute honest example of an awesome second hand product.Haven't been able to put it down since it arrived, which was quicker than I expected.Truly great service I would recommend any products from this fantastic seller.Thanks again!"},{"Title":"Dream Spells","review":"In this book, Claire Nahmad transports us to a lovely dreamland with a distinctly Victorian flavor.This book's style may not appeal to everyone, but it certainly got me into the &quot;dreamy&quot; mood Nahmad was trying to evoke, with beautiful writing and great ideas for how to understand your dreamlife.

The dream-like synbolism and use of Jungian archetypes and zodiac syboloogy were a welcome surprise in this small book. There is also an underlying leitmotif of marine symbology - ships, drowning, etc... contrasted with the fire/flame motif. The feminine struggle is presented, but in a tasteful, non-militant way, making it appealing to both genders. The drowning man (sailor) is a bit of an anomoly, but in keeping with the mermaid/angel/valkyrie theme.

My thoughts were that it would be a book of traditional geometry, based on the Euclidean set of axioms. Instead, the book covers the geometry of lines and conics in the Euclidean plane.It begins with the representation of points and lines as vectors and how length and distance are computed in the Euclidean plane. From this, the equations of the three standard categories of conics, as well as all of the associated figures such as the asymptotes are examined. Understanding the material requires knowledge of the basics of linear algebra, in particular how to work with matrices and determinants.The presentation is well done, based on a large number of worked examples and many figures. If your interest is in learning the formulaic representations of conics in 2-space, then this book is right for you. However, I do consider the title misleading, the book is not about geometry as we usually consider it in the Euclidean sense. It deals with an application of geometry as applied to a specific class of figures and equations.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Salar The Salmon","review":"Salar is at the top of the food chain, literarily speaking.

His story starts with the order to move towards the German Ardennes offensive and he proceeds to relate his experiences in the battle for Norville and the breakout towards Foy, during which he was severely wounded. He then writes at some length on his journey through the hospitals and of his recovery.The battle of Noville was quite an affair. A lot of German armour was trying to get through it and the men of the 10th Armoured and 101st Airborne did remarkably well holding it as long as they did. Addor's role was generally in communications, monitoring the signal equipment. He doesn't write about firing his weapon a great deal but during a major German attack he puts himself in considerable peril to engage Tiger tanks as a bazooka loader. While the attack is eventually beaten off by tank destroyers (Addor counted over 20 burning German tanks at the end) he had demonstrated incredible initiative and courage, to the point the TD officer took his name in order to recommend him for the Silver Star. Unfortunately this officer was killed in the withdrawal to Foy, shortly before Addor himself was seriously wounded.The next half of the book concerns Addor's treatment and recovery. He has a few moments where things are quite grim and frankly he is lucky to only lose his leg. Despite this Addor remains incredibly positive about his prospects and given the narrowness of his escape, very grateful to have survived at all. He writes of the excellent service he received but also of some fairly quirky developments. Overall though, one is left with great respect for the medical system that treated the wounded. One is also impressed with the fortitude of Addor himself. Although a keen footballer and runner he displays no bitterness about his fate. He even takes the opportunity, when he arrives home, to visit schools and other places to help the war bond program by talking of his experiences. It is quite extraordinary for someone who was only nineteen.Addor finishes with some other stories about his time in the ETO, so it is a broader account than it seems at first (altogether the combat passages make up about 40% of the book). Addor's role is generally not that of a front line soldier, although he had a number of close calls and he was certainly courageous. The Noville passage is of interest and the action against the Tiger tanks is amazing but it is delivered in a fairly straight forward manner. I think this reflects the down to earth nature of Addor himself. He doesn't let himself get too carried away and this unflappable manner holds him in good stead during the difficult months of his rehabilitation. This is not a 'combat' book in the ways that many others on my list are but it does tell a very necessary story of what the outcome of battle frequently is."},{"Title":"We're Global Citizens: Conversations with Tomorrow's Leaders","review":"This book contains highly condensed stories based on 4-hour-interviews with students from all over the world.

Latis, an attorney) is a second-rate mystery involving murder at an eastern Long Island hospital.The glue that holds this book more or less together is Emma Lathen's series \\"detective,\\" John Putnam Thatcher, a New York City banker. Although Thatcher often is working behind the scenes without readers being fairly informed, and although his subsequent explanations of his deductions are not entirely persuasive, A STITCH IN TIME does provide some enjoyment when the murderer is caught in the act of committing another violent crime.For the most part, the large cast of characters at the hospital and in the surrounding town are developed adequately as individuals, but Thatcher's own personality and mentality are far too sketchily presented in this book. Perhaps Lathen assumed that Thatcher, being a series character, was already a fixture in readers' minds like, say, Sherlock Holmes or James Bond. Only during a shopping expedition, does J. P. Thatcher, briefly, really \\"come to life\\" in this volume - and it turns out that the shopping episode is a digression invented solely to set up a humorous biblical allusion in the final sentence of the book.With two major exceptions, the writing is generally quite slack and uninteresting in most of the chapters, although at distant intervals either some character or the omniscient narrator throws in a clever or insightful remark. Two chapters, however, serve readers much better. In one, an outraged doctor takes charge and, \\"representing ... Justice or Nemesis,\\" berates the hospital's Board of Trustees like an Old Testament prophet for their \\"laxity [which] has permitted theft\\" and their \\"sloth [which] has invited greed\\" - and then he sets them the task of rectifying the situation, which will coincidentally help bring the murderer to justice. In the other good chapter, intense suspense is tightly created for the first time, as a person who would be able to break the murderer's alibi is being stalked in the hospital at night.All factors considered and weighed, I would give this mystery a \\"B-\\" grade"},{"Title":"Our Sisters in the Bible","review":"I really enjoyed this book and think that most people who read it will agree.

I can't help you with the German text (I'm not very fluent in German myself). However, it is very easy to take the text below the photos and copy it into a language translator. ... It works great, but sometimes the translation doesn't work too good for technical terms (a little interpretation is needed on your part).Now for the best part of the book.... I am into R/C model U-boat building and belong to the \\"Subcommittee\\" web organization. The photos in this book are of the best quality that I have ever seen of German WWII U-boats. Many of the photos were stamped for official German Kreigsmarine documentation. If you need good clear photos of the Type-II or the Type-VII, then this is the book for you. The author even has drawings of the Control Center and listings for all the levers, and gauges, etc. There is even a detailed document on the toilet. Now, that's getting down to the basics!

Included tales are: How Some Wild Animals Became Tame Ones, Story of the King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate, The Mermaid and the Boy, The Sister of the Sun, Which Was The Foolishest?, and many others. I always enjoy the illustrations, too, although some children are disappointed they are black and white drawings."},{"Title":"The Brown Fairy Book","review":"A Beautifully illustrated collection of fairy tales from different cultures, its refreshing to read tales that aren't just european. When I first bought it I was very disappointed that they weren't the traditional French, German, and English fairy tales but after reading them I found them to be compelling and beautiful. These tales are imaginative, strange, beautiful, wistful, and gorgous. The illustrations are wonderful, they stand in a class of their own. Modern illustrators should use them as inspiration."},{"Title":"The Brown Fairy Book","review":"For some odd reason, this has to be one of my favorite editions of Andrew Lang's collection. I'm not sure why. But as always, we get a good, varying dose of excellent fairy tales from different countries, bettered by the fact that these tales are little known. So, yep, I recommend this for all collectors and those who just plain love a good fairy tale."},{"Title":"The Brown Fairy Book","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."},{"Title":"The Brown Fairy Book","review":"Andrew Lang (1844-1912) wrote a number of books of fairy tales and differentiated each from the other by color; for example, this one is green, another is pink, another is blue, and others yellow, grey, brown, and lilac. The book contains 32 tales from many lands. He states that many of the tales were told by grandmothers to children who never went to school and who, unfortunately, never will, children in India, Africa, Persia, South America, Australia, and other countries. The stories, he writes, show the advantage of good manners and pleasant behavior. He admits that some stories were revised to omit elements that the \\"outlandish natives\\" liked, to make them palatable for \\"white people.\\" This prejudice was shown in other Lang books.Although from many foreign lands, the stories contain many of the same ingredients in all fairy tales. What the Rose did to the Cypress? is an example. There is a king who has three very handsome sons. The magic numbers three and seven occur frequently in the tale. One of the sons meets a mysterious man who had seven sons. He tells the prince how each of his sons in turn heard about a very beautiful princess who agreed to marry the man who could answer her riddle, \\"What the rose did to the cypress?\\" If the suitor fails to answer the riddle correctly, he is beheaded. Each of his seven sons tried to answer the riddle, failed and was killed. The man said that he has mourned them ever since their deaths.The prince, as happens in fairy tales, falls in love with the princess, even as the seven sons did, without ever seeing her. He goes to the princess, offers an answer, which is wrong, and is beheaded. When his second brother hears what happened, he also falls in love, with the same result. Then the third brother also falls in love, goes to the princess' palace, but decides not to try to answer until he is sure he knows the real solution.The rest of the story relates his many adventures during his search. He encounters many beautiful women, including magicians, who fall in love with him because of his beauty. He promises each that he will marry them if they help him. Each offers some help.

For businesses to succeed, they can't just publish a business plan with vague and quickly outdated flow charts of a technological society that is passing them by; instead they should plan to implement upgraded technology and hire professionals who exhibit skill rather than just a resume of golden parachutes; this highly targeted, personalized, value-added approach will guide otherwise graying companies out of the internet colorbook phase and into reading whole business sentences with ease.

While no one will be surprised that interactive technology will allow companies to supplement products with value-added services and better delivery, Brown explains that personal community is now more, not less, important than before the Internet emerged. For businesses to succeed, they can't just float a technology out there and hope that people come to it (a la Amazon.com, Dr. Koop.com, and Boo.com); instead they should bring upgraded technology to an existing community and entwine that community in highly targeted, personalized, value-added services which today's technology can now deliver with such ease.

Keith T. Brown's &quot;The Interactive Marketplace&quot; is just such a book.

It's a very sweet, charming love story set in a small Texas town. Lee drifts into town and meets Anne and romance and true love follow. What lifted this above the rest of the pack was the genuineness of the characters, their problems and how they overcome them. This story felt so real and the secondary characters were all excellent. And who doesn't love a happy ending?"},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"First published in 1936, this mystery is just a bit dated, as one might expect. It is a little too polite by today's standards: the detective and his confidants are never in jeopardy. There is but the one murder and no real foreshadowing of another possible homicide. The plot might well have been improved by more action or at least the threat of something dire. Despite this, the ambience and characterizations are superior to most present-day whodunits. The only flaw in the characterizations is in Ms. Marsh's attempts to write grating American slang. If the reader likes Agatha Christie and the novels that are more puzzle than danger, this is a very good choice."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"This is one of Ms. Marsh's earlier mysteries and it shows in how soon into the novel the murder occurs as opposed to the mid-novel murder that takes place in later efforts. As usual, it is well written and this time has a rather exotic beginning as action opens in the confines of a cultish \\"church\\" where strange goings on occur.The start of the story is seen through the eyes of Nigel Bathgate, an up and coming journalist who became friends with the lead character, Inspector Alleyn, in Ngaio Marsh's first novel, A Man Lay dead. His presence adds \\"fresh\\" eyes to the investigation as opposed to the efficient and logical views of Alleyn. In other words, Nigel plays Watson to Alleyn's Holmes.A strange ceremony in the above mentioned place of worship, involves the communal drinking of a sacred mixture by a select few congregants. This leads to the poisoning of the Chosen Vessel (the last to drink from the cup). The cast of suspects are pretty varied including some spinsters, a young couple facing problems of their own, a stereotypical (from the then British point of view) American, a rather slimy leader of the congregation and Frenchman with refined tastes.As always, all the loose ends are neatly tied up. If one concentrates, one can usually solve a Ngaio Marsh mystery as all the clues you need are placed before you. Her style is not of the Agatha Christie, shock twist, but rather relies on a careful examination of the facts by a likeable lead detective of perfect manners who has a keen insight into people. Her later novels reveal characters of greater depth, but for all the briefness of this novel, it is still a pleasant read as we can take pleasure in the sparkling prose of Ms Marsh and tickle our minds with a neat little mystery."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"Not my favorite Marsh, but still very good. Nigel Bathgate (AKA Inspector Alleyn's &quot;Watson&quot;) is simply a bored journalist looking for something to do on a rainy day. He spies the mysterious &quot;church&quot; across the street from him, sneaks in to a secret ceremony, and quite by accident, ends up witnessing a murder. Who does he call but his own favorite Scotland Yard detective, Roderick Alleyn. An interesting blend of spiritualism, money, drugs and murder."},{"Title":"Death in Ecstacy","review":"Great book from the 30s.

In particular, the suggestion that Verulamium was sacked before London makes good sense, and a much more convincing location is found for Suetonius' final victory than the west midlands one generally advanced.I'm sure some commentators will pick on some dubious passages, and the overall style, to dismiss this book, and one fears that the key arguments will probably be ignored until presented by someone eminent.Overall it is a useful contribution to the debate, and should be given serious consideration alongside the other books on the subject."},{"Title":"Queen Boudicca's Battle of Britain","review":"Disappointed by the end of the second chapter, I sent this book back to Amazon. The writing style reminded me of that of a freshman year college student trying to stretch her measly research to fill out a ten page paper using the sort of logic that is generally limited to those newly entering the world of academia. (To wit, I have a fact: it could mean one thing, it could mean another. Or perhaps a third.)The premise of the book is an excellent one: a sort of verbal archaeological exploration of ancient events. Instead, it read as if the author discovered he lacked the sources to make that exploration, but decided to go ahead with the project rather than attack differently or scrap it altogether."},{"Title":"Lulu's library","review":"I've just finished reading one of Louisa May Alcott's lesser-known titles, \\"Lulu's Library (Volume 3),\\" first published in 1889.\\"Lulu's Library\\" is a three-volume set of short stories that were originally told to Alcott's young niece as bedtime stories; as such, they are written at a slightly younger reading level than the author's more familiar children's novels. The tales fall into three categories: traditional fairy stories (of the \\"little beings living down at the end of the garden\\" type), stories in which the characters have magical adventures, and more realistic stories set firmly in the real world.It doesn't really matter in what order the books are read, so for some reason I began with the last one. Unlike the earlier books in the series, this one is almost entirely composed of the the more realistic type of stories, with only one being an outright fantasy.I did enjoy the book, though I'll admit that it will primarily be of interest to those who are already admirers of Alcott's work. If you've never read any of her books, I certainly wouldn't start with this one.I suppose I'm a bit defensive on the subject of Alcott's writings; I appreciate her talent, but it's true enough that her work has a certain sort of old-fashioned piety that has long been out of fashion in children's literature. And as such, it is very easy to make fun of, or be sarcastic about, this style of writing. And goodness knows I've mocked other examples of mid-Victorian children's lit; for instance, I've had great fun poking fun at the horrible Elsie Dinsmore books! But I don't have a similarly low opinion of Alcott's work, for the following reason.There's no question that her children's novels and stories are very sentimental, and in most cases contain a fairly clear moral. But she doesn't go about making her points in an objectionable way. The lessons she imparts to her young readers aren't particularly religious in nature (unlike the content of the works of many of her contemporaries). And the morals espoused time and time again in her books are quite simple and basic. The points she tries to get across?Work hard in whatever field for which you display some natural talent. Be kind and generous to those less fortunate than yourselves. You have the power to make other's lives more pleasant---no matter how narrow or limited your sphere of influence, a positive attitude in your daily life will help lift the spirits of those around you. And finally---treat others in the same way you wish to be treated.All sounds pretty simple, yes? But man, I have to think that about 95% of the problems in this world would be solved if everyone took those lessons to heart very seriously.So, I do appreciate Alcott despite the sentimentality of some of her writings. I've been collecting some of her lesser-known titles these past couple of months, and I'll no doubt mention a few of them on this thread at one point or another.My own set of \\"Lulu's Library\\" is a reprint published in 1919 by Little Brown and Company. The books have plain red boards, but nicely decorated spines. And each story is illustrated with a half-page illustration at the beginning of the chapter---very attractive.This 1919 edition was the very last time these books were reprinted, as far as I am aware. (Apart from any modern print-on-demand editions, I mean.) After that time the 32 stories that made up the set were edited down to only 9, which were then published in a single volume in 1930 also using the title \\"Lulu's Library.\\" So, any copies of this book from 1920 onward are likely to be the edited version.I was incredibly lucky to find this set; a quick search shows that these books just are not very easy or inexpensive to find nowadays; I don't see any other sets for sale anywhere, in fact."},{"Title":"Kamchatka","review":"I sincerely do not know whether this review is for everyone. You HAD to have lived certain circumstances and experienced some events in the late seventies in Argentina to enjoy this book.First, I saw the movie \\"Kamtchatka\\" (based on this book) in Buenos Aires a few years ago and loved it deeply and painfully. Masterfully, Marcelo Pereyra (the movie director) camouflaged the real meaning of Kamchatka (yes, the remote Russian peninsula) until the very end. As a result, people stayed in the theater just a little bit longer to clear up their throats and dry up those imminent tears.Just a few weeks ago I got this book as a gift, a great one. Naturally, the book expands and intensifies the feelings, the mood and the tempo of the whole story. Harry, his young bother (tenderly yet sarcastically called \\"El Enano\\", i.e. the midget) and their parents become a family on the run in the middle of the most atrocious military dictatorship Argentina underwent last century. A shabby summer chateau becomes their safehouse for a while. To fight boredom, Harry (who is also the story narrator) plays with his dad (and loses everytime) a board game popular in Argentina in the 70s: TEG (Wargame Tactics and Strategy). The board had a whimsical world map which included non-existant countries located on real geographic regions, like Kamchatka. Strategy and tumbling dice sealed the outcome of every battle.While the ominous atmosphere created by the ongoing military repression trickles in into Harry's life, the family sticks together. Each member faces this reality in different ways. For instance, father and mother form an indivisible team ready to face death to save their kids. Then the connection between both brothers is one of the highlights of this story, a masterful painting of human relations where family blood runs deeper than anything in the face of hardships. And above everything there is this omnipresent tenderness that the author uses to provide a special glow to this book.You have to find on your own the reason for such a capricious title \\"Kamchatka\\" and the title of this review. Then, if you did live under (and survived) a repressive, asphyxiating environment you will feel like crying \\"Kamchatka!\\" as in \\"We shall overcome!\\""},{"Title":"Beaches II: I'll Be There","review":"After seeing &quot;Beaches&quot; and reading it, it only came to reason to read the sequel.

Not having been spoiled on any plot points, but still with mental pictures of the characters, I could easily imagine the action as a movie unfolding. However, I was frustrated with the focus on Cee Cee's parenting of Nina, and how the book ran through sevenyears showing us only snippets of their lives. More attention could have been paid to Nina's thoughts and struggles than their search for a school or Cee Cee's continued attempts to force Michael to acknowledge his daughter.The writing style is dramatic and soap-opera-ish, and if you thought Beaches was written with screenplay in mind, I'll Be There definitely is.

Does that make them substantially different from the &quot;original&quot; Centcom sets? The answer is in the eye of the purchaser. Unless you can pick up a set of cards that were actually distributed to the troops in Iraq and prove that detail to your satisfaction, this set of playing cards will certainly suffice.I collected the &quot;trading cards&quot; that were put out by a couple of companies duirng the Gulf War, and while there is something to be said for having cards of Colin Powell and a Stealth Bomber, there was always something odd about having Norman Schwarzkopf being displayed next to Michael Jordan in card shops. You also only have to make one reasonably priced purchase to get the entire deck, instead of having go through pack after pack. I would be curious to know if the profits from these cards are going to some sort of relief effort or something somewhat laudable.Ironically, my only complaint is that while I appreciate having the Jokers and the camaflogued pack, it would be nice if there was a checklist, just like you get with baseball cards. Of course we do not need a checklist since you get the complete set of playing cards. But if would be helpful for checking off which cards have been captured. As of today half of the most wanted have been captured. For the record:Spades: Q, J, 8, 6, 5Hearts: 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2Clubs: Q, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2Diamonds: K, Q, 9, 8, 7, 2So, the total is currently at five face cards, but no Aces, with three of a kind for Queens, 9s, 8s, 6s, 5s, and 2s. By the time you read this there might be four of a kind. If you do not put the cards back to back in sheets in a binder, which is the obvious way to display them, you can come up with some sort of arrangements, such as putting the captured cards face down, so distinguish them. The key card is the Ace of Spades: Do you want Saddam Hussein face up or face down?

Thus, although he developed a number of &quot;bits&quot; they were seldom performed the same way twice. And during each evening's show Lenny would discuss a number of topics. This book consists of transcriptions of some of his sets, cut up and re-grouped by topic, thus creating chapters on topics such as black-white relations, The Church, obscenity and obscenity laws, etc.. The result is that quite a bit of the humor is lost, as excerpts from one night's set do not necessarily flow smoothly into excerpts from another night. But the overall effect is powerful: Bruce's humor ranges from scathing (as in his 1960's &quot;Typical White Person's Idea of How to Relax Your Colored Friends at Parties&quot;) to psychologically insightful (as in his - refreshing in this era of PCspeak - explanation of why everyone should use all the racial epithets as part of their daily vocabulary - so that they become just ordinary words and eventually 'won't have the power to hurt a six-year old kid on his way home from school.')

In addition there are comments based on experience such as: \\"Few people ever file form 5213 (Election to Postpone Determination that Activity is for Profit), and for good reason. It draws the IRS's attention and may invite an audit.\\" This kind of advice is hard to find in real life, but here the author has enough experience in the area to make such statements.Most of the book is on the standard kinds of accounting records you'll need to keep, the limits and philosophies that the IRS follows, etc."},{"Title":"Tax Savvy for Small Business: Year-Round Tax Strategies to Save You Money","review":"I'm a nervous business owner, and I tend to worry a lot about the things I don't know that will cause barriers to my success. I am particularly concerned about taxes--how much to pay, what exemptions are correct, ad infinitum. Thankfully, Nolo's excellent \\"Tax Savvy for Small Business\\" is there to provide a fairly comprehensive review of the issues and concerns most small business owners face every year as we struggle through the burden of calculating and paying our fair share to the IRS.Granted, \\"Tax Savvy for Small Business\\" doesn't cover everything, but it nails the core topics that we all face, like how to...--deduct current and capitalized expenses--write off up to $108,000 of long-term assets each year--compare different business structures--take advantage of fringe benefits--keep records that will head off trouble with the IRS--get tax breaks from business losses--deal with payroll taxes--negotiate payment plans for late taxes--handle an audit--get IRS penalties and interest reduced--maximize retirement fundsIn my opinion, a smart overview of any of these topics is worth the price of the book. Think about the value of your time, and how much you're spending to have a distracted, overworked tax specialist help you--with dubious results.

I wish I had read this section BEFORE setting up my business as a Sole Proprietorship.Most of the book is a thoughtful, thought-provoking exploration of the specific pros and cons of starting a business--then also what happens when you decide to sell it, what happens if you're audited by the IRS, and so on.I have a small business and found this extremely useful.

As Daily points out in this book, your goal as a business owner is to maximize your profits, by maximizing your deductions. And, both these books are awesome at that.Taxation is a dry topic, but both these books are written at a high enough level to allow you to skim across topics that don't apply to you, and to dive into areas that do matter.In particular, this book treats Section 179 expensing in painstaking detail, and has awesome details on each type of entity that you might set up - LLCs, S- and C- corps, and sole proprietorships each get their own chapter. Another area of depth is when discussing employee taxes; i.e., payroll tax withholding, obtaining an EIN, FUTA, filing deadlines, and IRS forms such as the 940 and 941.The downside is that all the forms in the book (1120S, 940, 941, etc.) are simply samples, without any real explanation. Since these forms are readily available on the IRS site, these samples did not add much value at all for me. The section on accounting software is also a bit less than adequate.However, neither should be a deal breaker for those who are working with competent accountants, and really only are using this book to get comfortable with tax jargon.In conclusion, you can't go wrong with this book - but I'd highly recommend supplementing it with Fishman's book as well.If you have an older edition (I also have the 11th), then the 14th edition had updated numbers (such as the 401K limits) but did not pop with a lot of discernibly new material.Happy Reading!~Damodar"},{"Title":"Tax Savvy for Small Business: Year-Round Tax Strategies to Save You Money","review":"Note: I read this book for continuing educational purposes.

This quote on p 281 \\"The IRS wins over 80% of all audits\\" in chapter 20 is why I would take such measures.Trickled throughout the book are recommended reading materials along with tips that pertain to a particular subject in a chapter. Finally, It can not be said enough p 318 \\"the more you know, the better you can judge a tax pro's capabilities.\\" The author provides a link to important tax changes in the front of the book.Other items worth mentioning:-Chapter 6 Tax Concern for Employers is a powerhouse of informative especially if you are unfamiliar with legal requirements of payroll taxes.-Filled out form examples of SS-4 Application for Employer Identification number, W-4 Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, 941 Employer's quarterly Federal Tax Return, and 940 Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return.- A HOT piece of information in this book is on p 93 \\"the IRS does not always stop with the head people. Non-owners employees, such as a bookkeeper or office manager, can also be held responsible. Even outside accountants, and attorneys for the business can be targeted.\\" Several questions on p 93 are listed by the author of questions that the IRS may ask to blame who is going to be on the hook.

For example, he discusses the advantages of hiring your (even very young) children to do some work for the business. This can give them a way to have responsibilities and earn some money (so long as the amounts aren't large they'll generally have no tax liabilities) while giving you some tax advantages as well. The author very clearly lays out what you need to do and consider to be sure that you do it without breaking any rules.Given that tax laws are complicated and dense, the author did a really impressive job of breaking it down into plain English. It's still probably a good idea to get some professional advice in dealing with your taxes if you can possibly afford it, but I think this book is well worth its price for anyone who's running a small business. It can save you money by helping you to do part of the work for yourself so that you don't need to use as much of an accountant's time, it may give you some good ideas for strategies you can pursue, and at the very least having some background knowledge will make you a better judge of whether you've hired the right financial professional to help you.My copy of this book was given to me for the purposes of writing a review.

It explains a Law/Rule, shows how it is applied using examples. Next they tell you about the various ways it is used and how you should adjust to the various uses. Then it gives some tips on how to avoid trouble with the IRS.The book breaks down very complex rules and IRS jargon into easy to understand terms.

Tax preparation for business is incredibly hard. This book tries to cover all the important issues while being approachable for laypeople. It succeeds as much as humanly possible. None of the sections are impossible to comprehend, but with 300+ pages of solid information, it will still take a week of hard study to get the feel. When one actually tries to fill out the forms, referring back to the book is still a frequent necessity. In all, this is the best substitute for a real accountant, if one is able/willing to put in the effort."},{"Title":"Tax Savvy for Small Business: Year-Round Tax Strategies to Save You Money","review":"Kudos to Nolo for putting out a series of informational books that are so well-organized, easy to read and contain such valuable information. Tax Savvy For Small Business is no exception. If you are a small business owner or are thinking of starting one, the relatively minor investment to purchase this book is a no-brainer. Each chapter has a useful topic, one that is written in understandable English with plenty of examples and charts, and is presented in a logical order. Even if you use a CPA to do your taxes, it is worth your while to read this book (or at least have it on hand as a reference) so that you will have an understanding of the the issues and how the tax laws apply to your business. Despite what they may try and have you believe, CPA's don't know everything (they are on a bell curve when it comes to competency and knowledge,just like anyone else), plus why go to them for every little thing and pay an hourly rate that for one hour is way more than the cost of this book? The information gleaned from the book will be very useful in helping one to make business decisions, or to at least know the tax consequences of the decisions that are made."},{"Title":"Tax Savvy for Small Business: Year-Round Tax Strategies to Save You Money","review":"Okay...I've owned a business for nearly 20 years and have an accountant...but I figured I might as well educate myself a bit and WOW...this has been a revelation.

Picked this up over the holidays and couldn't put it down. As a physician I was as excited as the novel's protagonist in piecing together the puzzle, and just as afraid of the implications of what he might find.Like the previous reviewer, I found the vaccine issues prescient and had it not been for the real events w/ the flu vaccine I would have dismissed this as improbable. Makes me a bit wary of the as to how other events in the plot might unfold in real life.Also paints a lovely picture of a part of the NE USA that is probably not well known in most of the country.Captivating, educational, and foreboding."},{"Title":"Biohazard 9-1-1","review":"A gripping, realistic tale of a mysterious viral outbreak in the era of 9/11...is it bioterrorism?

I look forward to a sequel!"},{"Title":"Biohazard 9-1-1","review":"DISCLAIMER: I only heard of this book because I was introduced to the author and someone whispered that he'd written a book.That being said, after reading countless novels with semi-scientific plots, this is one of the few that seems to contain REAL science. The author is an MD and has spent his entire professional career working with diseases like the one featured here. To dispel any thoughts that the story is founded in sci-fi, he even adds a brief history of the disease and an overview of some of the book's themes at the end of the book.As far as the actual writing goes, it's good, enough that I got lost in the story and readily recommend it.Probably the best aspect of this book, and the one that pushes it ahead of other books in the same vein, is that this book seemed appropriate for both the layperson and scientist . The author doesn't steer clear of jargon, but attempts to explain it in a plausible (to the story) way. For example (and don't quote me on this), the main character mentions PCR to another character, and adds, \\"You know, polymerase chain reaction, how we can quickly clone some DNA,\\" or something to that extent. It could easily have been written without the technical term, but adding it seems to give a little more value to the book.Anyone looking for something like \\"The Hot Zone\\" will surely enjoy this.Oh yeah, I like that this book was written in 2004, but makes a cursory reference to the swine flu problem in the '70s, which seemed interesting given all the H1N1 talk these days..."},{"Title":"Biohazard 9-1-1","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK, MEDICAL SIDE OF STORY ACCURATE GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WOULD LIKE TO READ MORE BY THIS AUTHOR AND SEE THESE CHARACTERS AGAIN"},{"Title":"Biohazard 9-1-1","review":"An absorbing medical thriller.

While a couple of the essays are indeed educational and enjoyable to read at least one is a display of insane academic jargon that defies serious efforts at understanding. Of particular interest is an essay on the nude performance pieces of the '70s, where for example, a nude woman would come out and kill a chicken as a symbol of opressed womanhood. One comes away however wondering if the author really understands how ridiculous this sort of thing is to the ordinary person.Lacking is any explanation of how the paintings selected for reproduction were chosen, or how they fit into the authors explantions of how the genre of the nude has evolved in the last century. The reader is left with a sense of how much the artistic poetry of the nineteenth century has been lost, but no closer to understanding how this loss happened or what might be done about it. Of course there are always those who see the 20th century as an improvement, but looking throught the selected paintings its difficult to come away without a sense of loss at recent history."},{"Title":"Horrors of vaccination exposed and illustrated,: Petition to the President to abolish compulsory vaccination in army and navy,","review":"This book is a fascinating look at our constitutional rights and the current medical trends that are taking those rights away. We have a right in this country to decide what is best for our bodies whether nutritional or medical. However, the FDA, AMA and other groups continue on an every growing basis to take these rights away. Whether through forced vaccination programs, limiting food labeling (so we don't know if something is genetically modified or radiated, etc.) or making it harder to seek alternative medical treatment, our government is closer every day to controlling our very bodies. Conspiracy theory? Not this time."},{"Title":"Reconstructive and Plastic Surgery of the External Genitalia: Adult and Pediatric","review":"good book on subject...very clear and good if you are a plastic surgeon."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"First published in 1901, this apocalyptic novel has been reissued as a \\"forgotten classic.\\" While the \\"classic\\" label may be something of an overstatement, it is important as one of the first science fiction novels, and the first \\"last man alive\\" doomsday novel. In addition, it is great fun to read.The plot is segmented into three distinct parts:*The first part covers an expedition to reach the North Pole, a feat which had not been accomplished at the time the novel was written. It climaxes with only one man, Adam Jeffson, left alive.*The second part follows Adam as he makes his way back to habitation, only to discover that a mysterious purple cloud has covered the rest of the earth, seemingly leaving him as the only human alive. Slowly sinking into dark madness, he unleashes his own destruction, burning the great cities.*The last segment cannot be discussed without becoming something of a spoiler. Suffice it to say, it includes Adam's return to sanity and to belief in the future of the earth.The pre-apocalypse first section is actually the most suspenseful and well written, conveying in frenzied language the mystery and actual horror aroused by the frozen Pole region. Of his race toward the Pole, Adam relates, \\"...I sped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and eyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had its hand of ice upon my heart....\\"The second section unfortunately drags somewhat as Adam relates with numbing detail of his search of town after town and of underground caves and mines for survivors. Only when Adam begins his frenzy of burning does the narrative again come alive, as he watches the burning of London while smoking opium, drinking wine, and playing the harp.The last section features an entirely different tone, as Adam progresses toward reason and hope. Although the story line is more than a bit illogical (if that can even be said of this kind of novel), the ending is very satisfactory.This novel cannot be judged by modern standards, certainly, but it can be judged as a product of its time. Those who appreciate H. G. Wells, H. P. Lovecraft, H. Rider Haggard, and others in this vein will really appreciate this \\"forgotten classic.\\""},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"Started out pretty interesting. Middle was a little drawn out. Ending was a head scratcher. I was looking for a interesting ending to make up for the slow middle and,,,,,nothing.Keep in mind that this was written at the turn of the century so wording and writing style are consistent with that time and takes some getting used to,"},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"After reading the reviews on this book, and learning what the plot was about, I was excited to give this book a try.Unfortunately, I really got bogged down in the details as the author describes the main character's journey to London. He could have tidied that part up a bit, perhaps shortening it dramatically to give the story the opportunity to breathe. Instead, it became such a chore to slog through each page that I finally just gave up.Disappointed...should have been a much better book."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"Early on, this story impressed me. Well written, good story line, good syntax, minimal expletives,courageous main character--all features of a good read. When the protagonist and the reader realize that he (we) are it, the last guy, the Lone Ranger, the only chip left in the bag--then it falls apart. He begins to dither. The author starts writing the same thing in different ways. It's like he had to fill his quota of words for the book. Other reviewers describe him as going crazy, but I think he just went boring. Anyone can write bad stuff (like this review?) but I was expecting better."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"I had trouble with this book at first. If it were printed today, it would be a very fat book. It's printed with a tiny font [most editions] and written in very formal English. It reminded me of Jules Verne. It should be on every science fiction fans list of read books.The story is basically post-apocalyptic, with spiritual undertones. No zombies or roving bands of starving people, more psychological. The main character is tormented, inventive, destructive - engaging."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"Like many a reviewer above, I found this book to be totally word-tasty and directly emotional. I described it to a friend as \\"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY.\\" I hadn't finished the book at that point, so, maybe I'm just one of those people who got to the end and just went, \\"really, is that all?\\" I like to think of this as \\"Lost before Lost.\\" That might be kinda cheapening the talent that is gushing from this novel, but the two do share a few things.Without spoiling it for you if you haven't read it, the writer introduces rather a few exciting mysteries and possibilities and just lets them hang and die \\"back on page 33\\" or whatever/wherever that I found most depressing, unsatisfying and kind of lazy. Anyway, in between you get some of the most intelligent, informed and yet absolute stream-of-consciousness writing I've parsed in my years. And although I share THE OBSERVATION that most \\"creative writing teachers\\" would bitch about his \\"run-on sentences,\\" I could not put the book down sometimes-- as it kept me plugging away at the poetic, juicy verbage and stayed with my mind as though -I_ was the one thinking these thoughts. Am I nearly as intelligent as the character/writer=== heavens no, but did that matter=== most certainly not. Although Sheil's passion to tell and describe can get dense and close to entangled, for me anyway-- he never lost my interest or connection with the character and his mindset, despite there being more than a few topics discussed that I am not well-versed in or possess the vocabulary to quite grapple with (bedside companion every tenth page for this novel: a dictionary, and, if you're really committed, have internet accessibility for some of the geographic, literary and historical musings).Anyway, worth reading--- resounding YES. Disappointment--- ditto. Maybe, like one reviewer said, it was 1901, and he was writing for an audience of sorts, so, I dunno... Anyway, pick it up. Read the \\"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY\\" for the first 170 pages or so, and then get out one of those handy \\"Choose Your Adventure\\" books from being a kid and enjoy your probably more satisfying ending, although, I doubt you'll be able to couch it in the superior and worthy language of this ridiculously gifted master.By the way, wondered if maybe this was the book that Jimi was reading when he wrote \\"Purple Haze,\\" as I had always heard it was partially inspired by the sci-fi that Hendrix liked to read. Of course, I willingly applied this book to New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" meanings also, probably to my detriment. Maybe, Barney, \\"Purple Monday\\" instead? I guess with Prince on the horizon that was a no go-- heh heh."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"Most of the text of this fascinating novel involves the adventures of one man who is absolutely alone in the world. It is not everyone who can handle a novel with only one character, and this a character who of necessity must be insane. Shiel manages to deal with this very well. He mitigates the horror by having the millions of dead bodies fail to rot or stink. The ending is rather sentimental. It might have been more effective if Adam had not met his Eve."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"I ordered an old paperback and was delighted to see it was in good condition. It was as described by mab1218 and the price was very good. I was especially pleased with the service of mab1218 because I received my order in a matter of days. So it was beyond my expectation and I am a satisfied customer."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his \\"Supernatural Horror In Literature\\" essay, and had good things to say about it. The novel deserves the good words. The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark. A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him. I think that would send me \\"over the edge\\", too. Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well. Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the \\"romantic\\" ending. At least the human race will not die out. This is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"I call The Purple Cloud a fantastic fossil because that's what it is. That is not a criticism. I gave it 5 stars. It's simply that the fact it was written in 1911 shows -- both good and bad. Some of the science is off the wall, but I assume accurate for the day. The novel has a fantastic, hypnotic beginning set in the arctic. Like the jungle of Tarzan (written, I think, about the same time), this arctic landscape never existed, but it's a fantastic place of torment for the hero. Why is this book worth reading? The writing is hyptnotic. They don't write like that anymore. Dense, lush with an incredible poetic language, we follow the hero's solitary wanderings across an empty earth. This is a story of the last man on earth. This is a fossil, an archetype for all the later stories about the last man left alive on earth. A purple cloud came by and killed all while the hero was racing to the North Pole. What carries you along is the hero's interior as he undergoes one slow painful change within himself after another as he searches for another survivor, Does he find anyone? That's for the reader to learn. When you see the movies The Omega Man, The Quiet Earth, The Night of the Comet(this is a comedy) and all the other last man on earth movies, this was the great granddaddy of them all."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"A cloud of gas that smells like peach blossom kills nearly every everyone in the world. Adam Jeffson is the only man left. He spends years looking for other people, wandering through the remains of civilization.One of the benefits of being the last man on Earth is that you would have the freedom to do whatever you want. The planet would be literally yours. Adam takes advantage of this. He becomes more and more eccentric, travelling around the world, burning cities to the ground. He wants to wipe out all trace of humanity, to make it look as if the human race had never existed. This could be put down to a symptom of Adam's growing madness - a madness caused by enforced solitude.The premise is a good one. &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; sounds like an HG Wells novel in style. The language is a bit flowery, but I didn't mind that. (The book was published in the early 1900's after all.) When you read this book you travel around the world with Adam and find the same thing - emptyness, stillness, silence. How would you cope?In 1959 a film called &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; was released. It was supposedley based on &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot;, but it had nothing to do with MP Shiel's story."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"No one has yet succeeded in reaching the North Pole, and a new British expedition is mounted. As our protagonist, Adam, returns from the arctic, all the humans and many of the animals he encounters are dead. Adam travels all over the world, looking for other living people and, understandably, going kind of bonkers.I wanted to like this book more. Early in the book, Adam finds himself in many morally challenging situations, but he has these voices in his head that more or less compel him to act in certain ways, so the reader is prevented from really entering into any moral struggles with him. I liked the writing, but each place Adam goes is essentially like the rest--everyone's dead--and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Near the end, something finally did, but then I mostly wanted to slap Adam around for being so dense.Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many post-apocalyptic stories and that's why I'm not more enthusiastic about this book. If you're new to this sort of story, you might find this book to be a powerful exploration of loneliness and the meaning of human society and human life. A similar but much better post-apocalyptic novel is Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road.\\""},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"This is the first and best science fiction book I read. I searched for another copy of it for 20 years until I found one on Amazon.com. I read it once again and loved it just as much as the first time. It takes you on a most fantastic voyage, never to be forgotten. Full of great adventure and excitement, I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"This is the typical English disaster story in its earliest stages. Think John Wyndham, John Christopher, J.G.Ballard -- maybe the average English sf writer is a total loner and what he's really writing is wish-fulfillment!.... This book does have a quality all its own, vaguely reminiscent of William Hope Hodgson and I enjoy the old-fashioned textures. If you're at all interested in the origins of the genre, this would reward you on that score alone."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"I got halfway through this book some six months ago and then just put it down for a while. Finally picked it back up and finished it today, and I must admit, for being an ancestor of the post-apocalyptic, last-man-on-earth genre, it carries some unique qualities.On the downside, this was just a difficult read, period. The prose was incredibly dense: sometimes an entire page was but one run-on sentence! No paragraph breaks, few semicolons, and even fewer commas. I tried to make an audio version of this book, and found I could not pitch the sentences properly, since I could not see their end!I'm quite practiced at reading, writing, and speaking, always at the head of my class even into the graduate level. That being said, this book almost *wasn't* English, not as modern-day Americans understand it, at least. I have a rather sizable vocabulary, but this was the first book to leave me hard-pressed to determine what he was talking about half the time:\\"I paced between the oak pwes of the nave - massive stalls they are, separated by Corinthian pilasters ...some little angels with strangely human faces, Greuze-like, supporting the nerves of the apse\\" and so on.Honestly, I'd swear he was making up the words half the time. Sentences ran far too long to keep the thread of things easily; I took to scanning over his florid descriptions but cautiously, for the most obscure little phrase within any block of text could trigger something that I would then be unable to understand.That being said, I really liked the book. Along with \\"Earth Abides,\\" these are the only two books that take their time looking at a world where man just... disappeared. Most post-apocalyptic stories talk about some war-ravaged earth, or one wherein civilization had been thousands of years ago. In stories like that, Earth might as well be Mars for the reader.Contrarily, \\"The Purple Cloud\\" and \\"Earth Abides\\" allow the reader to leisurely stroll through a world that, in one sense, looks exactly like always, yet in another, feels inverted, nightmarish in such ordinary alienness. An emptied - yet undamaged - world always feels far more gripping and interesting to me. In this, Shiel most certainly provides.Like I said, getting through his wording is like jogging in sand, and the guy he describes is pretty bizarre, wacked, and selfish, but I still find it a beautiful book, especially as the reader is slowly drawn from the lifelong nightmare of the protagonist's depravity into a beauty he'd never have guessed, let alone dared believe in.Definitely a must-read, a keeper, and a read-again."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"make this book really worth reading. I find the descriptions of an empty world chilling, the familiarity with some of the places(in England) making the story at once believable yet terribly strange to me. Shiel is a romantic, bringing the story to an optimistic end for our poor protagonist (hasn't the poor guy suffered enough...!), even though it seems like Leda gets the short end of the stick once more(Victorian women were made of stern stuff!).In the end it is Shiel's rich and unusual descriptive style that really made this book stand out for me and I look on it as something original, captivating and totally refreshing compared to the lame language used in a lot of modern fiction."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"It's an experiment that can never be performed, but it's worth thought anyway: how would a man act if there were no one to answer to? Adam Jeffson is that man, and this is his world.Back in 1901, when this was written, parts of the earth's surface remained unmapped, including the north pole. Jeffson is part of the expedition to reach that pole - as sole survivor, he finds it (an actual upright pole, it turns out), and struggles back to civilzation to claim his reward. No one is left to give it, though. During the months of his trek, catastrophic volcanoes unleashed poisonous gasses that cover the world, killing off every bird, beast, and man, except for him alone. At first, he scours the globe in search of other survivors. After years of solitary confinement in the world-wide jail, his civilized spirit fails. He turns to the decadence of drugs and pointless wealth. Decadence turns to active nihilism, a self-declared mission of arson and destruction, a modern Nero who blasts and burns entire cities for his own amusement. Then ... well, I'll try to avoid spoilers, but his name is Adam and 1901 was not an era that tolerated wholly unhappy endings.Just reading history books won't tell you how nervous that era was. Political tremors were building up to the quake that triggered the first world war. Medicine hadn't made the inroads against disease that modern generations assume, as the 1918 Spanish flu would soon show. The earth itself could turn against mankind, as the 1883 explosion of Krakatoa had shown. Sheil captured that sense of fragility, and his words preserve that sense for today's reader.This book also preserves the style of writing that prevailed back then, something that might be even less familiar today. Think of the effort that moviemakers put into the special effects of today's media, then realize that writing was that era's medium. The pyrotechnics are all there, but in the florid vocabulary of the writing.The story is a fair one, and could work well if recast as a modern adventure movie. More than that, though, \\"The Purple Cloud\\" records the fears, the values, and the literary style at the turn of the last century. It succeeds at many levels.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"This book indeed establishes the \\"Last Man on Earth\\" genre. The main character had an encyclopedic knowledge which seemed a bit of a stretch at times; he was a scientist who had an amazing ability to sail the seven seas alone. He was also an architect who managed to build a palace all by himself. His grasp of world cultures was astounding. But, aside from that, the book was entertaining, along the same lines as Robinson Crusoe."},{"Title":"The Purple Cloud","review":"This book explores the effect of an apocalyptic event on the mind and behaviour of an individual symbolically named Adam, who is literally the \\"last man on earth.\\" Written in 1901 by an author only recently rescued from obscurity, the novel tracks the deterioration of Adam's psyche after the poisonous purple cloud of the title wipes out all other members of the human race while he is conveniently away on an expedition to the North Pole. Adam gradually comes to the realization, after arriving back into warmer climes, that he is the sole survivor of the purple cloud. He now has unfettered freedom to do as he wishes without any restraint, but to what purpose?We follow Adam's attempt to cope in these circumstances as he experiences over a 20 year period alternating bouts of depression, euphoria, despair, megalomania, madness, and perhaps final redemption. He is now the master of the world, but alone, and he demonstrates his powers by torching all the world's great cities and undertaking other grandiose projects. All this is told in exacting detail.If an opportunity were to present itself he could be the \\"new Adam\\", starting a revitalized human race, but he recoils, not wanting to perpetuate what he believes is mankind's failings. Such an opportunity does present itself, however, and without ruining the ending, he faces the dilemma of balancing his principles against love (and lust). That aspect of the story adds some most needed dramatic action.The writing is representative of that era, with long sentences stuffed with dependent and independent clauses and numerous references to ancient historical figures and mythology. Also, get out your dictionary! I found it a bit of a slog to push through the middle part of the book after his initial searches for other survivors proved unsuccessful. After all, how hard is it to convince us that a person in that situation will go crazy?This book is recommended for sci-fi fans curious about an important historical rendering of the \\"last man\\" sub-genre and who are curious about an author who apparently was an influence on Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Haunting of Suzanna Blackwell","review":"This is a very good book, with an excellent ghostly story. Suzanna Blackwell returns home for her father's celebration of his military service promotion, but this time maybe for good. In her return, she is reminded of her distance from her father, and vows to strengthen that bond... but still living in the memory of her own mother, who died when she was a child. In addition, Suzanna meets and begins a relationship with Michael - a member of the press, much to her father's disgust. Michael and Mr. Blackwell have their own deep rooted feelings for each other, that cannot be hidden, due to their own painful past experiences. All consequences and relationships of the current characters are influenced by past wars, and their actions in those wars. If the relationship struggles were not enough to make an interesting story... the ghostly encounters will definitely intrigue you and pull you in. While the living are trying to forget the past, the dead have their own agenda, and are not ready to be forgotten. I found this book very interesting, however, it did drag on for most of the book. Towards the end, it accelerated at a very fast pace, that proved exciting and frightening. The closing was excellent, but left me with a few minor questions that were not quite cleared up. Richard Setlowe proved to be an excellent writer, and my only complaint would be to spend a little more time on the characters emotions and thoughts... but I find most male authors provide more adventure and intrigue, and female authors tend to provide more emotions and deeper thought processes... not that I haven't found authors that were capable of both. I would recommend this book to anyone that finds the topic of ghosts a little intriguing... there's no technical mumbo-jumbo here... well maybe a tiny bit in some explanations, but you won't notice as they are fit in perfectly. If you give this a try... finish it! You'll be glad you did... when you find it a little long and tiresome, stay with it.. it DOES get better!

I was just in Jr. High...and had joined my first book club and found this book. Loving to be scared even back then, I couldn't put this one down. And even though I forgot so much from that time, this book I always remembered as one of those few of the hundreds I devoured that scared the begeebers outta me ... Although to this day I never remembered what happend to my copy that I tried to save for years...I do remember that the book made an impresison on me. Enough so that I came online looking for it for my kindle....but found it. And even after all these years....the fear, the ghosts the story lines still hold up. Always thought it would have made an excellant movie back then and still do. Hollywood? You keep going back and remaking bombs...why not try this gem of a tale?

Its innovative suggestions for enhancing the writing assignments in English class are state-of-the-art and will excite both students and teachers. I have tried several of the writing projects with my students, and I enjoy the enthusiasm with which they have been met. The variety, freshness, and appeal to adolescent interests of Bohemian's writing assignments should make it a staple in language arts classrooms."},{"Title":"Going Bohemian: Activities That Engage Adolescents in the Art of Writing Well","review":"GOBO rocks.

I am also not a teacher, though education has long been an intense passion of mine. For ten years now I have been a member and officer of SEAL (Society for Effective and Affective Learning). I have always admired Lawrence's many creative pursuits in music and art, and have long wondered just why he had decided to lend his great passion and enthusiasm to traditional education. The answer is that the field of education in which he works is a long way from traditional education. He is a revolutionary who continually seeks to bring that, perhaps, childish delight and joy of learning back into the classroom. Going Bohemian is a delightful collaboration of a group of very competent and passionate people who are all committed to empowering education and to making it more efficient, effective and fun for all concerned. There is no dry education theory in this book. It is a collection of very compelling ideas to fire and hold the attention of student and teacher alike. As I read it, I got excited as I turned page after page which I could vividly see transforming the boring thing which I have long considered traditional education to be. You can't go wrong. Buy, read, and use this book.

Eastman's book, &#34;The Soul of the Indian,&#34; is an extremely valuable insight into the Native American world view, especially since he was a Sioux Indian himself. This book is valuable for anyone who will be involved with people of other cultures. It is a caution to take the time and effort to learn the other man's culture and world view in order to communicate meaningfully. While Eastman was fully conversant with both Indian an American culture it is doubtful that he ever found an American counterpart who knew and respected his Indian culture and without placing it in judgement. Therefore, as Eastman grew older he was inexorably drawn back to his original Indian world view and values, being increasingly disappointed with American culture and values. He attempted to reconcile his Indian culture and world view with biblical values and teaching. However, I think this attempt was not successful. One is left with deep respect for Eastman and sadness for the tragedy of the Native American."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Indian: An Interpretation","review":"A must-have for anyone who is curious or wants to learn about Native American culture and how we, as white men(or women) have changed and shaped their culture to suit ourselves.

A storm delays her departure for several days and they discover they still are attracted to each other. Craig claims he only wants sex after being without for so long, but Chelsea wants his love again. The sexual fireworks are like the 4th of July.

I believe in a few years Ashley may just hit it right."},{"Title":"DISTANCE FROM THE HEART CL","review":"Ashley Warlick's novel is delicately written with the touch of a poet. She creates characters who are cleanly drawn, but ceaselessly complex beneath the surface. Her themes resonate Southern, and while the plot may be downplayed, what rises up is a subtle, effective probing of young Mavis' psyche. The problems this family encounters are relevant and realistic; the Blacks are dealing with true Southern themes: family dynamics and attachment to land. The setting, the southern cadences, and the interior landscape create a mosaic in the reader's mind that begs return again and again. Warlick is writing cutting edge literary fiction; she makes me think. I look forward to the second novel immensely."},{"Title":"DISTANCE FROM THE HEART CL","review":"The Distance from the Heart of Things is a wonderful novel full of beautiful turns of phrase and sensuous descriptions. Warlick's poetic language guides us through the lives of characters who are reckless and reserved, generous and cruel, unfaithful and forgiving.

Readers who let the author's early success tinge their ability to enjoy this story are truly missing out."},{"Title":"DISTANCE FROM THE HEART CL","review":"I loved Warlick's style and her description of Mavis' connectedness to the earth.

The characters are weakly drawn,the story wanders and meanders with no satisfying climax orending, and the protagonist is just too sophisticated (andpretentious) for her so-called 22 years. The author usedannoying literary devices to portray a supposedly-Southernvernacular (her incessant use of &quot;'round&quot; and &quot;'neath&quot;quickly became tiresome), and it was quite obvious when shewas trying to make a &quot;point&quot; about the eccentricities of life.Her editor needs to tell her to &quot;get real.&quot;"},{"Title":"DISTANCE FROM THE HEART CL","review":"Some of Ms. Warlick's writing is better suited for the short story form.

At that time it was easier for me to buy an illicit packet of cigarettes than to get hold of 'The Ginger Man' or 'Lady Chatterley's Lover'. However, I succeeded in getting all three! Donleavy lived, as I believe he still does, in a tiny cliff-top village on The Isle of Man. As my school friend and I were smoking our illicit cigarettes behind the village shop, Donleavy appeared. My friend knew who he was, and we approached him. Iris Eyes were smiling that day as he took us to his home and gave us both a copy of 'The Ginger Man'. I wonder if he remembers the incident?And so began my love of books. Having read 'Lady Chatterley' the week before, I became convinced that all literature was something naughty that would activate my new-found hormones! And even though that turned out not to be the case, I still took to reading like an eagle takes to mountains.Having many years ago lost my original copy of 'The Ginger Man', I recently purchased this latest reprint and revisited the novel. Of course, I found a lot more to it now that I've used up most of my hormones! This is a lush, daring book about the misadventures of Sebastian Dangerfield, a young American ne'er-do-well studying at Trinity College in Dublin. If you've an ounce of humor in you, you'll chuckle at his outrageous antics. But more than that, you'll see a reflection of Sebastian's immoral, belligerent lifestyle, wherever you look. He's real and he has little regard for others or for himself. The guy's an out and out moron (and how many of those do we know?) With his drinking, idleness, womanizing, lack of guilt, you'd think you would hate him, but Donleavy has cleverly woven a character that's larger than life who we can't help liking - even if it's just a little bit. (Think Malachy McCourt if you don't believe me)I suspect that the character of Sebastian Dangerfield was based on J.P. himself. If so, god help his wife! But this book deserves its place on the Modern Library's top 100 list of the 20th Century. It's wildly funny, picaresque, and a classic novel in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I'm into THE GINGER MAN right now, and enjoying it tremendously. I wonder if John Updike read this book before he wrote RABBIT, RUN. Rabbit and Sebastian have similar qualities; they are both scoundrels to love.

There are so many lessons imbedded in this hysterical text. This book has been an inspiration to my family and me throughout our battle to avoid suffering indignities and pay proper respects to the Blessed Oliver."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Donleavy's prose in this, his first novel, is great: Joycean and, at the same time, entirely his own. Unfortunately, the wonderful descriptive passages, the stream-of-consciousness (very well-done), and all the lyricism add up to . . . nothing. Or almost nothing. A few humorous scenes but nothing really memorable. So why all the acclaim? At the time it was published (mid 60's), The Ginger Man probably looked pretty daring, because it's full of sex, drinking, and generally dissolute behavior. But you can see that stuff on prime time TV now and it's not only not daring, it's become boring. Also, back then, I'm sure this was looked at as a very promising first novel. We know now that Donleavy never lived up to that promise. He's continued to publish, for decades now, basically writing this same book over and over again (Balthazaar B and Darcy Dancer are just avatars of this book's protagonist, Sebastian Dangerfield) but never with the same panache. If you're going to read one Donleavy book, this should be the one. And if you go into it without having heard or believed the hype, you'll probably enjoy it more."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"... you can't catch me, I don't get the humor of this man!Number 99 on the Modern Library's top hundred books is J.P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man. It took me a month to finish The Ginger Man is that after while I really had no desire to pick it up and finish it. I've read other reviewers calling it a comic masterpiece, but for the most part, I just didn't get it. A lot of negative reviews focused on the reader's dislike of the main character's debauchery and low moral conduct. This is not what turned me off to the book...The fact it had no real central narrative is what did it for me. For the first few chapters, The Ginger Man was an interesting read; however, after a while I became bored as the plot simply went nowhere. The story is about an Sebastian Dangerfield, a broke American veteran in Ireland who is studying law at Trinity College. He is married with a small child and basically spends his days drinking and cheating on his wife.The story is a rinse, wash & repeat of Dangerfield drinking to excess, racking up massive debts, pawning possessions and then being left/leaving the woman he is currently with.There are admittedly a few funny scenes which come to mind: an indecent exposure in a train, an attempt to buy condoms, his first encounter with a shy girl at a party who turns out to be a bit of a nymphomaniac. However, these scenes are far and few between and all we're left with is a boring narrative of an unappealing main character who really doesn't do much of anything. In the end, perhaps the most humorous part of the book is the striking resemblance the man on cover art looks like Conan O'Brien. I ended up buying a physical copy just for the posterity.Save your time and money on this one."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"It took me a while to get into this book.

Many of his later novels, however, improved upon the themes he brought out in his first book and from which he drew out many of his later characters.

It's almost like a 300 page comedy routine. Hours of chucks.Dangerfield himself cannot be dismissed as a mere repropate - He has some fine redeeming qualities - although he is far from perfect - as all of us are. But lines like &quot;Jesus was Mick and Judas was a Limey&quot; which he yells at a crowded New Years Eve Party in London clearly show his sense of honor - always defending the underdog Irish - although he himself often acts on a sense of English superiority. Clearly, a flawed man --- with a sense of what is right --- but unable to always act on it. The great human paradox.I suggest we all hoist a Guiness in rememberence of Sebastian Dangerfield - who like the rest of us lives a life of turmoil - but unlike many of us - manages to carry it off with a bit of diginity -- which sometimes - especially on the British Isles - is all you can cling to for respectability."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"A welcomed departure from everyday life.

A right-handed pitcher for thePhiladelphia Phillies, Duggleby made his major league debut on April 21, 1898. In his first atbat that day, Duggleby came to the plate with the bases loaded and promptly smacked the ballout of the yard; thereby becoming the first, and still the only, player in major league history to hita grand-slam in his first plate appearance. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there for\\"Frosty Bill\\"; he finished his eight-year career with a .165 batting average and a total of 6 homeruns. He wasn't much of a pitcher either, compiling a lifetime record of 92 wins and 102 losses,with a ERA of 3.18, during the most pitching dominant era in major league history (hisapparently impressive 3.18 ERA is not as good as it looks: it would be the equivalent of alifetime ERA over 5.00 in today's game.) But because of his spectacular debut, Dugglebycontinues to serve as a superior example of a \\"one-shot wonder\\"; that is, a man who achievesgreatness in his chosen field with his very first effort, and never again comes close to repeatingthat achievement. Such a fate is likely to make one rather, well, frosty, and so it was withDuggleby: he is said to have come by his nickname \\"because he spurned the companionship ofhis teammates, and wore a heavy black suit, even in summer.\\" No wonder.To my mind, there are three Bill Duggleby-like figures in post-war fiction: Joseph Heller, StevenMilhauser, and J.P. Donleavey. Each of these gentlemen made a Dugglebian debut in the worldof letters by publishing a first novel that was the literary equivalent of a grand slam, and each ofthem never again wrote anything nearly so good. Regarding Joseph Heller, this opinion is nowan established fact, as no sane person will dispute that \\"Catch-22\\" is immensely better thananything else Heller managed to see into print. With Steven Milhauser the Dugglebian natureof his career is not so apparent; in fact, most of Milhauser's published work is quite good - farbetter than Heller's pitiful post-\\"Catch-22\\" output - and one of his recent novels, \\"MartinDressler,\\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (historically, it should be noted, a very dubioushonor.) But upon close examination one sees that even in Milhauser's case the unhappy patternholds: despite the generally high quality of his work, nothing else Milhauser has published isremotely as good as his first novel, \\"Edwin Mulhouse.\\" This is not surprising, as \\"EdwinMulhouse\\" is that truly rare thing: a work of genius. Unique in conception, brilliant in execution,\\"Edwin Mulhouse\\" set an almost impossibly high standard for Milhauser, or anyone else, tomaintain. After opening his career with that tape-measure shot, Milhauser has settled down tobecome a singles hitter, with occasional flashes of power. Kind of like Bill Duggleby.Which brings me to the third member of my melancholy triumvirate, J.P. Donleavey.Donleavy's first novel, The Ginger Man, would be a grand slam in anyone's literary ballyard.Not because of Donleavy's technique, which is boring and derivative, and not because of thebook's \\"frankness,\\" which is boring and not all that frank, but because: (1) it is one of thefunniest books ever written; and (2) its hero, Sebastian Dangerfield, scoundrel, drunk, liar, andwhorehound, is one of the great comic characters in 20th century literature. There is really nodebating these points. One either recognizes them instantly when first reading the book, or onedoes not. If one does not, then \\"The Ginger Man\\" is likely to be a grave disappointment; but ifone does, the book is a dream come true: a formless, plotless, pointless, Rabelaisian rompthrough an imaginary Ireland in the company of a minor demon out for mischief and a good time.Sebastian, drunk, dancing the goat dance and attacking his pillow with a hatchet; Sebastian,drunk, manhandling the horse-cab driver he's just stiffed for the fare, and demanding from him:\\"Where's your love . . . I'll throttle you if you don't show me some love\\"; Sebastian, drunk andconcealed in a kangaroo suit, laying waste the City of London with red-bearded MacDoon andthe black brute Parnell; Sebastian, sober, pawing his infant's pram so as to be drunk within thehour; Sebastian, drunk or sober, lusting and whoring and lying and brawling, professing hisfaith: \\"If there is illusion, live it with a flourish.\\" \\"God's mercy on the wild Ginger Man\\"? Yes,indeed.However, whatever magic Donleavy had when he wrote \\"The Ginger Man\\" was spent by thetime he finished, and he has never recaptured it. Lord knows he's tried. Donleavy has publishedmany novels over the years, some obviously modeled on \\"The Ginger Man\\" - right down to thehaiku-like doggerel that ends and summarizes selected chapters - but none of these bookssucceed nearly as well. No matter. One masterpiece is more than most men can achieve in anyfield, and, unlike \\"Frosty Bill\\" Duggleby, Donleavy has kept his high spirits and good humor: noheavy black summer suits for J.P. When he wrote \\"The Ginger Man\\" Donleavy took a big cut,made solid contact, and cleared the bases; and if he's been swinging and missing since, well, he'sbeen fun to watch. As Sebastian Dangerfield himself might put it:JP only hit it onceBut he hit itHard."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"(Two-and-half-stars) There are moments in Donleavy's \\"Ginger Man\\" where his prose sings. The last chapter is absolutely beautiful. Too bad it is not representative of the rest of the book. I have no quibbles with the morality (or immorality) of Sebastian Dangerfield; great literature shouldn't be judged according to its moral content, anyways, in my opinion. My problem is with what I perceive as a lack of any point or purpose in the narrative. Donleavy does a fine job of parroting James Joyce's style, but the freshness, ingenuity, and underlying human compassion that makes \\"Ulysses\\" such a wonderful novel are severely lacking here. Dangerfield is pathetic, just pathetic. I felt no compassion for him. Donleavy does not attempt to draw his character as anything more than a lazy, womanizing drunk. The humor inherent in his situation and character is fully mined in the first few chapter. That leaves 250+ pages of rambling stream-of-conscious prose which adds little or nothing to the character or the story. So the book is well-written. Fine. But in the words of the Burger King lady, \\"Where's the beef?\\""},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"At 368 pages, this book is 368 pages too long. I see it is number 255,203 on Amazon Best Sellers and that just about sums it up.I read this book about 15 years ago and I am still amazed that I finished it. I remember thinking, it can't be this bad when so many people like it and say it is funny. Well, it was that bad and I don't know what they were thinking.It certainly isn't funny. Nasty, stupid, boring are the words I would use.On a scale of 1 to Catcher in the Rye overrated, I would give this a Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"CAUTION: This book is not for everyone (ie--if you expect your reading to provide a strong moral and ethical paradigm, might as well skip this book). If, however, you can enjoy a book about a boozing expatriot in Ireland who disregards all responsibilities (including his family) and owes money to everyone he has come into contact with, then read on. This is not to say that Donleavy necessarily endorses a life of drinking and whoring, he is merely writing about it (more drinking than whoring). Fans of literature, this book cannot be ignored. Donleavy breaks every rule in the book with his poetic sensibilites. He writes with a flourish and a sense of imagery that is both uncommon and incredible. I cannot say that I have much regard for the modern library or their lists, but I can see why they included this book in their &quot;Top 100 Books of the 20th Century in the English Language.&quot; This is a book I will not easily forget."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"JPD launched a storied literary career with a masterpiece in The Ginger Man. Sebastian, which means \\"venerable,\\" is a man perpetually on the brink of utter madness brought largely upon himself. He is a Trinity College Dublin man whose condition is given to \\"staving off starvation\\" and whose only option when things always get worse is to \\"cheer-up or die.\\" When you consider that JPD was first a painter, it's understandable that his writing style is pointillistic. The syntax like Dangerfield is non-traditional presented like life itself in fragments of which to make sense. His little lines of stacked type at the end of each chapter are works of art in themselves: \\"All the way/From the land/Of Kerry/Is a man/From the dead/Gone merry./ This man/Stood in the street/ And stamped his feet/ And no one heard him.\\" Here the work winds from prose to poetry to create an endearing human quality and even tenderness that enables us to forgive the ginger man for his outrageousness. What would he and his poor as Pozzo crones do with a lot of money? Drink at every pub from College Green to Kerry over the course of a year and then \\"I'll arrive on Dingle Peninsula walk out on the end of Slea Head, beat, wet and penniless. I'll sit there and weep into the sea.\\" Very Dylan Thomas. A touch Kafkaesque. Joycean. JPD's Ginger Man is worthy of a higher position on Random House's \\"Best Novels of the 20th Century.\\" His body of work, including \\"Darcy Dancer,\\" \\"Balthazar B,\\" \\"The Singluar Man,\\" \\"The Onion Eaters,\\" \\"Wrong Info at Princeton\\" and \\"Samuel S.\\" is astonishing in its lyric virtuosity, power and originality. When will the mavens of Hollywood treat us to tales by JPD that shimmer and dance upon the silverscreen? And when will the good people in Stockholm see the light on JPD's vast, rich, enduring, literary legacy?"},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Quite simply, one of the five funniest books of all time, I rate this alongside Confederacy of Dunces, Catch-22, Bombardiers, and Vonnegut's best work. It tells the story of an usually drunken American, Sebastian Dangerfield, studying at Trinity College, Dublin, and his trials and tribulations of him, his wife and friends, colleagues, and fellow drinkers. Written in 1965 and hailed as &quot;A triumph of comic writing...&quot; by The New Yorker it is crying-out-loud funny. The scene where Sebastian tries to buy condoms in 1960s Ireland is alone worth the price of the book. Friends raved about this for years, and I'm still kicking myself for waiting this long to read it. The best story I've ever seen about contemporary man trying to find pleasure in life without working in any sense of the word. I am more apt to give comedies a one, but this is definitely a ten"},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Donleavy breaks every rule of writing and comes up with masterpieces; been doing it for fifty years. In the \\"Ginger Man,\\" one of his best, he dissects the mind and spirit of a rogue, dragging the reader in and out of Irish saloons, through troubled affairs,into hot water and nasty entanglements, and, despite the decadence of Dangerfield, you enjoy the scamp's company.It's the best trip you'll ever take to Ireland."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"The Ginger Man is funny--in fact hilaious at times, it is well written, and it moves relatively quickly. Those are all excellent qualities that I love in a book, but sadly this story also just never really moves. The characters aren't particularly engaging, even Sebastian Dangerfield who is the focus of all the action in the story. He is certainly infuriating as a lazy, abusive, self centered, morally corrupt person, which is not a problem for me since some of the best chracters in fiction share these qualities, but I don't care about his flaws or the people who he manipulates and disregards throughout the book. The book is not particularly memorable and never made me stop and think or particularly care what it was saying, so as I see it the book fails in the end. Many critics and well respected authors love this book, who I assume appreciate its unique (for the 1950's at least) free-flowing style and graphic depictions of various types of debauchery, but as a casual reader it was no better than average."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I read this book in awe, my jaw hitting the floor with each beautiful sentence that went by. Donleavy was a master wordsmith, who created an amazing character in Sebastian Dangerfied. He's pathetic, he's horrible, he's a waste of space, and yet Donleavy somehow makes him kind of likable, and finds the beauty in this very human story."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I do admit to being surprised by the rash behavior and lewd thoughts of the novel's main man, Sebastian Dangerfield. Unless beating women and neglecting responsibilities are acts you consider virtuous, of course you will be appalled by what he does and thinks, and maybe by what his friends do and think as well. If you are easily offended by crude language, insensitive drunks, and the satisfaction of carnal wants in written form, then save yourself some frustration. Don't read the book.But I never felt Sebastian was lacking in morality. He is often clearly unable to act in a way that parallels his conscience. He treats his women poorly and violently, but he cares for them in his simplistic, misguided way, and they do come back to him in spite of his flaws. It is not expected that the world of fiction should reflect our idea of an ideal world. And Donleavy doesn't satisfy that popular desire.Instead what he does is to explore a man who is unrestricted (to an extreme) by the mores of the status quo. He thrives on chaos and does not hesitate to create it (consciously or not). He cannot help but gratify his immediate and basest needs, and so is motivated by sex and drink, and obsessed with fantasies of wealth, all the while neglecting relationships and his law studies.I found the book quite funny, but humor is relative and depends on the interpretation of meanings. Sebastian, like Melville's Bartleby, declines to accept what the world tries to make him do. He avoids restraints like bills and rent, work and raising children. But unlike Bartleby, he is full of life, violent and sexual, active and daring. Sebastian's flaws may be inexcusable, but Donleavy lets us step out of a world that would ordinarily be horrified by such people, and shows us the possibilities of pure, delicious disorder."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Wow, what a dichotomy! Part of me is repulsed by this amoral mass of human flesh called Sebastian Dangerfield. A womanizer, a drunk, a man one step ahead of the bill collectors, living with and off of the other characters that he draws into his life. On the other hand, I was drawn to him and his story. First, because the narrative style is engaging. A mix of descriptions, thoughts, bits of thoughts, parts of dreams blended in with the usual expectation of one character talking to another. I have not seen writing like this. However, how can I be interested in this human refuse called Sebastian Dangerfield? The answer, for me, is that he does things and gets away with things that I think deep down, if we are honest with ourselves, we wish we could get away with. For those that see no value to this story, I think it is necessary to separate the morals of the character from the interesting way that the author tells the story. In doing so, I think he brings us face-to-face with the notion that such evil lurks in all of us and that is what may be unacceptable for some. On another level, we are presented with a much more interesting life, albeit despicable, than maybe most of us lead and that too may be unacceptable for some. If you look at this book solely based on the lack of scruples of the main character, one could call this a disgusting book. However, put that story in a different narrative style than most of us expect and have a character that is more alive than most of us will ever be and you have a compelling novel."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Donleavy is indeed the most obvious progeny of the Great Joyce. The Ginger Man fits well alongside Kingsley Amis's hilarious &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; and other midcentury farces. Although Donleavy is a native New Yorker, his descriptions of and ear for Ireland are poetic and endearing, despite the scurillous nature of Sebastian (not Rodney) Dangerfield. To those reviewers who have to love and/or picture themselves as the protagonist of each book they read, I extend my pity for the self-deprivation they surroud themselves with, not allowing enjoyment of truly great writing for fear of having someone think they approve of drunken wife-beating rotters. The Ginger Man is a beatifully crafted work of social commentary, as well as being able to elicit belly laughs while being read on a city bus. Of course you're much more likely to sympathize with Sebastian's misanthropy if you are riding said bus with your tackle exposed."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Anybody who likes his protagonists to be paragons of virtue will be sorely disappointed with this book, because Sebastian Dangerfield is the most archetypal of antiheroes. He is so depraved, so immoral, so belligerent, and has so little regard his family, for humanity, and for himself, that this novel can only be understood within the realm of the comically absurd.Dangerfield is an Irish American living in Dublin with his long-suffering wife and baby daughter, both of whom he physically assaults when he is irked. He is supposed to be studying law at Trinity College, but accomplishes very little of it what with all his drinking, loafing, extramarital affairs, and general womanizing. He hangs around with several loser friends, one of whom is another American transplant named O'Keefe who is so unlucky with women that he retreats to Paris to dabble in homosexuality and pederasty, and then returns to Ireland to try to lie his way into a job as a chef. Much of the narration is an erratic mix of sentence fragments and complete sentences that alternate freely between first and third person and present and past tense, echoing Dangerfield's cluttered, harried, and often drunken thoughts.So why read a book about such a moron as Dangerfield? Because he has a unique perspective on his life and his surroundings, there is depth to his thoughts, there is spice in his speech; his commentary on Ireland, its people, and Irish-English antipathy (&quot;Jesus was a mick and Judas was a lime&quot;) is interesting if not enlightening. What makes this novel succeed as an unlikely comic work is that Donleavy writes with an ironic levity that suggests Dangerfield is more to be pitied than censured, even during his cruelest moments. The world would be a kinder, gentler place without its Sebastian Dangerfields, but it would also be more boring. And somebody has to wear the kangaroo costume."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I'm not a fan of this book. Too much drinking, too much sitting around, too much unfocused. I grew frustrated early and never recovered because I had a hard time relating to the main character and his laziness, which ultimately made me question Donleavy's own view of the world and ability to propel his subjects forward."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Critics quoted on the back of this book called it a comedy. But I saw nothing funny about the scenes where he mistreats his wife and child or any of the other people in his life. Do not understand at all how this book made it on the Modern Library's top 100 list."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"For the life of me I cannot fathom what others who rave about this book find the least bit engaging or inspiring. The story revolves around one Sebastion Dangerfield, an alcoholic, congenital liar, irresponsible debtor and adulterous wife abuser with no moral values whatsoever. When not engaged in the physical and emotional abuse of his wife and infant daughter he's either getting drunk and commiting adultery or getting drunk and feeling sorry for himself. He has no redeeming characteristics whatsoever. Moreover, if there's any humor in this book it's being kept well hidden. While I have read several books lately by such authors as Christopher Moore, Tibor Fisher and Louis De Bernieres that often had me laughing out loud, I barely even managed a chuckle through this pointless text. It was only my rigid adherence to a policy of finishing every book I start that got me through this. Without doubt, this was the absolutely worst book I have read in several years. Don't be suckered by the fales hype for this abominations. Give it a pass. Reading the want adds in your local paper would be far more enlightening and, likely, far funnier as well."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Yet another book about drinking,fighting,and whoring in Ireland. Author is a good writer, but uses a &quot;poetic&quot; style that is not always effective. A rather bleak book with little comedy.I really would not put this book in the top 100,no matter what Random House thinks. I suspect the book is somewhat autobiographical, which would explain why it has such a weak plot. If you must read it, I suggest speed-reading ;if you invest too much time you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"If there isn't a little Ginger Man in you, you're a bore."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Simply atrocious. The stream of consciousness style of the book is inaffective and obnoxious. Donleavy makes no attempt to develop any of his characters, Dangerfield included. I didn't laugh a single time, found no compelling traits in any character, and found myself dreaming of the day I would be finished wasting my time on such a terrible book."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"A college professor once told me a profound truth that is very pertinent to this work: Art Doesn't Have to be Pretty. This novel certainly isn't! I think I could have enjoyed this novel, but I kept on waiting to be amused. Unfortunately, I didn't find Dangerfield very funny at all. The author presented the character in a fairly sympathetic, yet not pathetic way. I especially enjoyed the stream of conciousness writing technique.In the final analysis, I just couldn't overlook the fact that I thought that Dangerfield was a poor excuse for a human being. I will be very dissapointed if &quot;Ulysses&quot; focuses on a character just as dispicable."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I found this book to be a complete waste of my time. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry - I just didn't care about whatever it was the author was trying to convey. Who wants to read about the crap between his character's toes, not I, and I am not easily disgusted. If you want something funny read Confederacy of Dunces or David Sedaris' stuff."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Donleavy's masterwork that is The Gingerman is not for the faint. When all the false prompts and pretenses are stripped, we are all Sebastian Dangerfield. This tome does no less than confront the reader with his very essence. If one reads and is dissatisfied it is because he cringes at his own image. Dangerfield may, to some, be the most dispicable creature to grace ink. But his image is merely a reflection that Donleavy was bold enough to focus. The brilliance of content aside, The Gingerman is to be undyingly praised for its commitment to painstakingly concise, poetic verbage. Donleavy's pure and imitable style captures all that was good and has been lost."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"This is on the Modern Library panel's list as the 99th best novel in English in this century. It is an awful and nauseous book, telling of Rodney Dangerfield, an American in Ireland and England, who is immoral, blasphemous, and extremely uninteresting. I was sure glad to get to the last page. The blurb on the jacket from Time says Donleavy makes the reader love Dangerfield for his killer instinct, flamboyant charm, wit, flashing generosity--and above all for his wild, fierce, two-handed grab for every precious second of life. This is all false, IMHO--I despised him and thought he was a stupid, asinine bore who did revolting things."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Three hundred forty seven pages of mayhem. About the moral degradation of one Sebastian Dangerfield, a rake from hell and St. Louis, who is supposed to be studying law in Dublin, on the G. I. Bill. He is a a cad with women, a con artist, deadbeat, philanderer, boozer and brawler--not a very likeable bloke.This book is an entertaining read and very funny at times, but a bit low on redeeming social value. Stream of consciousness, with occasional lapses into surrealism."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"But nonetheless I go away with a high opinion of The Ginger Man. For the first 150, 200 pages the rollicking adventures are a great deal of fun and told in a unique, very original style, more of a flourish of drunken pride than a tale to tell. The events of the book aren't really necessiary to relate: self-absorbed rich kid who's honestly quite intelligent but such a lazy wastrel he imagines his charm will keep him functioning throughout life. Take that and make Sebastian's charm manifest and you have a fine little read you can burn through quickly.The real problem I encountered was that events seemed to keep repeating themselves. Now this is not to say I am criticizing the character's inability to learn from his mistakes--no, it would be inconsistant if he did--but that after a while there is only so much tripe one can swallow and the antics turn stale--or flat in the case of this particular tale. By the time Sebastian winds up in England to basically start all over again and pray for his father to die so he can have money to continue to do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over again I frankly lost interest.Again, the language of the book is wonderful, a glorious and inspired style that winds you around and around until you, the reader, begin to feel a little hung over. In essence the story is a long drunken stupor with memories vague and reality no longer of issue in re-telling."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Donleavy is one of those rare authors who bring the modern world back into focus. The writing is intelligent and immediate, shifting easily between first and third person, present and past tense. The Ginger Man is sometimes derided, by people who don't understand that it is actually a tragedy, for glorifying alcoholic adventurism. Recall Dangerfield's stack of unread business magazines the next time you have trouble reconciling your professional facade with your more immediate urges.I've read this book several times and on the last couple go-rounds I got about three quarters of the way through and went back to page one. It's impossible to finish a book this brilliant, for author and reader. Unsure ending aside, this remains the only book in my library that I often pull and open to a random page for a taste of exceptional prose."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"This was an almost incredible, maybe even impossible character and story if it wasn't for the fact that I've actually MET people like this -many were my friends... and me!People going nowhere, people setting up scams to make the next meal, people not having a plot to their lives -even if they do they may as well not have one, and trying not to die with their pants down in the process. And in all this one has got to laugh at the preposterous hot waters they find themselves in; case in point, one Sebastian Dangerfield (the protagonist). Harsh situations that are all the funnier because they are creatures of the protagonist's own creation; not only making his own life but the lives of others miserable. He admits this himself throughout the novel and doesn't care to let one know, for he is the \`ginger man'.Sebastian Dangerfield is not completely callous, however. He is a complex individual; similar to the hero of 'The Catcher in the Rye'; that is if the latter were more... inclined toward whoring and boozing it up (my hero!). There are moments of deep feeling and even shock at the way the world has been let go to the gutter, and of course the culpability is on everyone. There are instances of very human qualities in the heart of this character -at least a longing for these, for despite it all things like love, warmth, friendship, simplicity, true joy, are all things awfully hard to come by... one has to wonder how true these are in our own lives. The author skillfully portrays it all with brilliant sentences that swing effortlessly from powerful poetics to sports-bar speak to choppy machinegun descriptions of inner and outer worlds (my hero!). All this is quickly missed if the reader is unimaginative, \`slow', moralistic, and insensitive.Nevertheless, none of the above should detract from what is the main feature of the novel: it is funny as hell!!!

He lies, cheats, steals, beats his wife, neglects his infant daughter, and otherwise makes an ass of himself. Yet, in the end, the reader can not help but love this guy, who never once whined about his sorry condition. When he was on the street, homeless and broke, he just carried on until the next person came along who would freely save him from starvation and a sordid death in the gutter. He survives, on his own terms, and it is this perverse honesty that makes him, well . . . admirable? How the author does this is the mark of a true artist."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"The Ginger Man is perhaps the most eloquent portrait of debauchery ever painted in the English language. And it may just be the greatest American novel that no one has ever heard of. I can only barely read in any language other than English, so I don't really know what they have to say about hedonism. But it's hard to imagine anyone weaving an uglier tale in more beautiful language.Sebastian Dangerfield is a bad man and behaves accordingly. Shortly after World War II, he finds himself studying at the prestigious Trinity University in Dublin, Ireland. Having squandered his GI Bill money and being miserably wedded with child, he does what any rotten human would do: he abandons his dependants and embarks on a journey of decadent self-indulgence.Yet, he is a strangely-compelling character who appears more principled in his wickedness than perhaps even the Pope in his righteousness. He is a wastrel of the highest order who at first appalls but soon has the reader weeping in sympathy as his uncompromising mission to find beauty in this life--on his own gluttonous and lusty terms, of course--is revealed.He takes advantage of women, he steals, he lies, he drinks too much, and he possesses every conceivable carnal vice. He is a person of huge appetites that devours life in breathtaking gulps and gives nothing in return. Yet to a man like Dangerfield these imperfections are what make him beautiful and somewhere along the line Dunleavy seduces us into sympathizing with this with rotten character; more than just sympathize, Dunleavy even brings us to champion this swine for some of the very same reasons we find him so distasteful at beginning of our voyage.With such a beautiful gift of verse many readers may wonder why J. P. Donleavy didn't devote his powers to do good. Rather than chronicling a beast of a man on his hilarious journey to purgatory, why not use his gift to pen a serious and profound piece--perhaps the next Great American Novel some might ask.Well, in my mind he has. And that book is The Ginger Man."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"This book is great! My book club decided to read it because we wanted a good Irish book to review on St Patrick's Day. We were sold on the book when we read a review on Amazon comparing it to Catch 22 and Confederacy of Dunces...two of my favorite books of all time.The Ginger Man is nothing short of wonderful. It's a hilarious romp through the streets of Ireland all seen through the eyes of Sebastian Dangerfield. Sebastian is an American living in Ireland post WWII, and he will stop at nothing to bed women, drink booze, and not pay his bills!! Sebastian has absolutely no desire to find a job or settle down. He always ends up on his feet, and his view of the world is smart and poignant.JP Donleavy's writing is brilliant. He doesn't spoon feed the story to us, he writes with a combination of 1st Person and 3rd Person point of view and he switches between the two in the middle of a sentence sometimes. This book is a piece of literature and should be enjoyed by future generations to come"},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Let us all join with Sebastian Dangerfield to rear up in horror at the abominable way in which society treats its antiheroes! Such a rascal is Dangerfield - a drunken womanizer, a leech and a lech, a brilliant schemer, self-righteous prude, a man in decline, yet rising up, each time, from the bowels of hell through a catharsis of his own wit and imagination. J.P. Donleavy is brilliant. This picaresque novel, written in a modified style of stream of consciousness, is constantly moving, giving the reader little time to ponder a moral or ethical dissection of Dangerfield's antics.Dangerfield is, after all, a manifestation of human desire in its physical state. He desires, and attains, the finer things in life; yet, each attainment is followed by his own predictable calamity of foibles and follies, through gluttony and his own rapacious wolfishness. Mr. Donleavy is masterful in his choice of every word. Short phrases, separated by periods, create a visual world in full bloom, while pulling the observer (you, insatiable reader) through the emotional rollercoaster being felt by Dangerfield's soul. Such a scoundrel deserves hatred and banishment. In our own observance, we become the enablers of Dangerfield's unconscionable acts, finding ourselves, (surprisingly), unwilling to give him his deserved punishment, forgiving him his transgressions as swiftly as his Mary does. He is, after all, a sensitive soul. Who could argue with that?J.P. Donleavy's prose dances on the edge with his poetic verve and descriptive style.

Sebastian is embittered by his own father's cutting him off from the family fortune and angry at his wife because her family did not provide him with a dowry.What money Sebastian is able to lay his hands on he spends partying rather than on proving for his family. The wife eventually as enough and leaves and Sebastian feels no remorse.Sebastian and his party going Irish friends are entertaining but the brutality in which he treats his wife and mistresses are not funny at all. The satire of the Catholic Church and Irish people in genaeral is the best part of the story as Sebastian succombs to his own self detructive behaviour."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Sebastian Dangerfield and his cronies - impossible to like, but perhaps just a little too easy to identify - struggle to make their way in a world where blue blood is not the end all. As the book meanders on, the reader painfully starts rooting for the despicable protagonists. Is it because of identification? Or maybe the recollection that the people they are using are actually using them in return? Or maybe it just is not so black and white.The book has been hailed as a modern classic. I'm not sure it did that much for me. There are lessons in responsibility, changing times and personal weakness that are enduring. Perhaps it is the style of the book, written in a Kerouac style - an Irish \\"On the Road\\". It's a worthy read, in an interesting (even delightful) style, but I struggle to find the greatness to which it's been ascribed. Maybe when I understand the greatness of Sir Vidia, I'll understand this as well."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I'm reading this horrid book because my professor requires it. While he warned us before we began, I guess I didn't fully understand precisely what his warning meant. I was expecting a comedy with a few crass jokes - I was expecting it to at least follow some comedic line. Instead I've trudged through a few hundred pages of utter garbage. Any comedic value it may have is completely drowned out by the blatant vulgarity that permeates every facet of this waste of time.I know what Donleavy is trying to do - create very unlikeable characters - but his approach is one of the worst I've ever come across. There are much more creative ways to make a reader hate a character than this.As for style, the word choice and descriptiveness are excellent. My only complaint about the style is also one of my favorite parts about it: the perspective-swapping style. While a fascinating stylistic choice that is very interesting, it can become tiresome for the reader to track at times.Verdict: the negatives of this atrocious book so drastically outweigh the positives that I cannot bring myself to give it any better than one star."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Ireland (and Irish) are primarily related to drunks, lazy and famished. Although we like to quench our thirst with a Guiness now and then, this is not really so, Nowadays, Ireland's economic growth is one of Europe's highest, its social life is booming and, yes, Dublin is a beautiful city.But why does Sebastian abuses his wife, forgets about his daughter, and romps around. Do we smell a stereotype? Having said this, JPD offers us a fully entertaining experience, a road movie of a life.Why, then, with so a &quot;Unpolitically correct hero&quot; we feel attracted to him. I confess that for a few seconds (taking away his marital situation) I would enjoy being Dangerfield: Peter Pan syndrome, adult that never grows up, he does not care for anything, expect for finding a pub that will offer him credit.No steady job, no responsabilites whatsoever just be honest for one second: doesn't it sound truly appealing.JPD brings to life a book that can be read like a trip on a calm river, it justs flows gently, without noticing it, till you come to the end, and, sure, you regrett it a little.Go for it: be Sebastian for a while and then take a look at your life: benchmark, close your eyes and then decide, but only for a few seconds"},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Let's just say I finished the book only to find out what happens to the character. I was sorely disappointed. Where was the development of the character? I kept waiting for a change in his outlook, hope of things to come - anything - it never came...

What's the matter? Dangerfield just a bit too much the real thing for your flimsy, artificially secure world?OK. Look. Dangerfield is an ANTIHERO. Get it? That is, he is the only sort of hero that can, with any amount of validity, be called such in today's homogenized, prepackaged realm. He is a drunk, womanizer, leech, spendthrift but with an ineffable lyrical charm by which he just manages to get by in scrape afer scrape. The fellow has a tender heart beneath it all.

Not so with &quot;The Ginger Man.&quot; I honestly don't understand why this book is so praised by the literary establishment. It doesn't break any new ground stylistically (in fact, I think J.P. Donleavy's writing is pretty anonymous) or thematically. The description on the book's back cover would have you believe this is a rollicking farce about a lovable cad---don't you believe it. This book isn't funny. The &quot;lovable cad&quot; is actually a jerk and by the time he'd gotten drunk and abusive for the thousandth time, I had made up my mind that the literary establishment that loves &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; must have all been drunk themselves when they decided this book is a must read.It's not difficult, but neither is it in the least bit interesting."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"The Ginger Man definitely fits the category of comedy in the classical sense, with the main character beginning in dire straits and ending with an uncertain but optimistic future. Uncertain here is a key word, because Dangerfield only thrives in uncertain, chaotic circumstances. When he is able to contemplate, he usually tends toward melancholy. This melancholy provides some of the novel's best writing, but is a mood the hero escapes whenever possible, by getting drunk or otherwise stirring things up. It is in this latter mood that the most hilarious episodes occur, but there is entertaining wordplay as well in the most casual observations. Dangerfield has no ambition, only dreams. Real life can only sporadically supply what he requires, so he is constantly moving from one uncertainty to the next. He experiences rare moments of true joy; boisterous camaraderie, sanctuary after a violent episode, forgetfulness in a woman's arms (to put it in a cliched form quite at odds with the tone of the book itself), an occasional epiphany of the poetry of Ireland that led him there in the first place. He reacts with violence to violations of his sovereign right to do what he pleases, or when he feels personally slighted - there is a feeling that he considers himself a keeper of the flame, with a necessary cross to bear in order to tend it, which sometimes manifests itself as an elitist belief in his own righteous passion, at other times as base snobbery, or again as maudlin self-pity. This is one of the endearing aspects of his character. The women in his life generally want something from him that he is unable and unwilling to provide; constancy. The men he relates to don't demand this, so many of the best moments in this book and in Dangerfield's life consist of banter with these men wherein his wit is revealed and distant vistas of unconquered territory momentarily glisten. In these conversations the commodities he provides become clear - raw energy and the feeling that one can act on his impulses and realize his dreams. His saving grace from a reader's point of view is his being true to his own inconstant, selfish self. He's his worst enemy, and woe to those who are attracted to him - but many are."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"This book was a mixed bag for me. It is obvious that J. P. Donleavy is a major literary talent, and it was certainly on display in this book. However, I read an old 1965 paperback addition, and it was hard not to read the reviews on the cover. I was looking forward to loving to hate Sebastian Dangerfield (the book's main character) as he romped his way through Dublin and London. I was even willing to unwillingly like the guy. But in fact I got neither . I didn't much care one way or the other what happened to him, though I suppose that is a reaction too. One review called the book &quot;lusty&quot; - that was true, &quot;violent&quot; - a little, and &quot;wildly funny&quot; - for me this one was way wide of the mark. Another review called it &quot;a wild and unpredictable outburst&quot; - it was pretty wild, but it wasn't overly unpredictable, and &quot;powerful and original&quot; - that was accurate. In the end I was not sorry I read the book, but I didn't love it."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"I think this book breaks just about every rule in the book. Treating grammer and convention with superb disregard, the frantic narrative continues to shock you and keep you 'on your toes'. At the beginning I assumed Dangerfield was being presented as the hero of the book, only to witness him punching his wife and threatening his child a few chapters later. He is almost an anti-hero.The book is at once sad, optimistic, violent and serene. Most of all though, it is entirely memorable. Go in with an open mind and you will realise why it has been so consistently praised."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Some books follow the careless and despicable character - usually male - who somehow warms the reader even after hundreds of pages of rotten behavior toward his best friends. Other great literary characters who follow this mold include Dean Moriarity (On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)), John Bickerson (The Moviegoer), and Harry Angstrom (Rabbit, Run). This book introduces us to Sebastion Bullion Dangerfield.An American in Dublin, his life is anything but glamorous. He loses all respect from his father and wife, chases every woman he can, and lies In order to gain the conquest of all, and ends up with little. The author, who writes in specific terms, had the book banned in the Republic of Ireland and the United States of America for obscenity. So the cover of my book proudly claims in large print, \\"The only complete and unexpurgated edition.\\"His insight of Ireland may be better than even produced by the Irish, Some pithy remarks include, \\"I have discovered one of the great ailments of Ireland, 67% of the population have never been completely naked in their lives.. . . There are many things wrong with this country but I must leave them wait for they are just developing in my mind.\\"\\"The Irish feel that Children are brought down upon them by the wrath of God for screwing,. All you hear is that if it weren't good for kids life would be rosy and we could have a good time.\\" But, the fallout he witnesses among his closest friends convincer him that all are up to no good. And, ultimately the only success is a pornographer who makes money by acting upon the dream worlds the others cannot seem to escape.He admits as an American he failed. \\"I went to the proper preparatory school, preparing for college. I never felt that these schools were good enough fo me . I was aloof. Never seeking friends.... I even worked once, . . .But, when you have so many problems it's not easy to be distracted into the past.\\" In essence, he confesses this fault was that \\"I was a spoiled child I suppose.\\" And, boy is he.But, like Moriarity, Angstrom and the others, such characters make good reading. They pontificate with silver tongues, which may only occasionally turn to lead when poverty and occasional conscience overwhelm them. He has overzealous urges to deliver his greatly opinionated version of the world about him, but such opinion is genuinely fun for the reader. And, like Moriarity or Angstrom or the others, this is probably deeply rooted with autobiographical experiences, which help us to understand the pains and confessions herein are deeply delivered with poignant concern.This is a fun book about a not-so-fun person. If you cannot treat this as a fictional account of a bad person with a class A character, stay away. If you accept the fictional account, you'll love this novel."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Published in 1955 this was the first work from J P Donleavy ( James Patrick) and hasn't been out of print since and has been described as a classic by others.Its the mis-adventures of Sebastian Dangerfield, an American living in squalor in Dublin.Dangerfield is a drunken, lying, wife beating waster who to me has no charm whatsoever.The initial part of the book concerns us with our 'hero' stealing the house keeping for drink,running up huge unpayable bills for drink and totally neglecting his family while doing so. Call me strange but I didn't see any hilarity in this.Later he seduces a boarder who he uses for her money and then a younger woman with whom he settles down with somewhat. Although I don't feel there is any redemption, he just gets more cunning.For its time it was considered risque and was initially banned in the U S and the Republic of Ireland; - because of its 'startling nature'.Dangerfield comes across as just a sad,desperate individual and empathy I have none.As far as characters in literature go, Dangerfield ranks up there with Ignatius Reilly from - A Confederacy of Dunces - as totally loathsome.It may be just me though who lacks the sense of humour because I have seen - A Confederacy of Dunces - referred to as a comic masterpiece as well.The character Dangerfield was evidently based on a friend of Donleavy's when he first moved to Ireland after the Second World War. This friend Gainor Stephen Crist died young of alcoholism.Now, not liking the character does not mean this isn't really well written, it is and Donleavy has gone on and written hilarious novels. He is kicking along at 84 and gives the impression of being a very naughty boy still.If starting to read Donleavy I would recommend the Darcy Dancer trilogy; no where near as depressing"},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Donleavy's main character is the type of Teflon-coated ruffian that we all sometimes wish that we could be. Shrugging off threats, poverty and sadness for the sake of another drink or a roll in the hay, the main character, whose name escapes me and yet isn't important, continues through life with a joie de vivre that few of us can honestly say we possess. This book reminds us that we all have to deal with the ebb and flow of life, and more often than not, it's the ebb and not the flow that presents us with more opportunities for to laugh."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"John Donleavy's \\"The Ginger Man\\" is an engaging, sometimes funny and often infuriating novel. Well written in its way it tells the story of the dissolute, self absorbed life of Sebastian Dangerfield, an American expat in Ireland.I didn't find much comedy in Ginger Man although there are some perfect lines within it. One especially comical line is in response to the nature of morals and Catholicism, to paraphrase: Jesus is a good idea but they're killing him with publicity. Ginger Man also contains some- for the time- graphic scenes of sexuality that resulted in its being banned in the US for some years.There isn't a lot that I found funny in the way Dangerfield approached his family or other women. He's generally drunk, on the prowl and out of money. But JP Donleavy is a good writer and there is something in his style and the story that keeps the reader engaged. I guess it's similar to watching a train wreck, you're sorry it had to happen but you can't take your eyes off of it.I did enjoy Ginger Man but was at a loss to figure out why there really wasn't much in the way of resolution. If you're looking for a story of redemption or a Saul on the road to Damascus epiphany from the main character you'll be disappointed. Perhaps that was Donleavy's intent, that sometimes there isn't resolution.All in all The Ginger Man is a well-written and engaging story which will delight some readers and disappoint those looking for a morality tale."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"Ever since the publication earlier in this centuary of James Joyce's ,Ulysess, the question to the Irish literary mindset has been, &quot;Can the national character ever span the gap between their dry intellectual pursuits as personified in Stephen Dedalus and the earthy ramblings of Leopold Bloom. Happily with the creation of Donleavy's Ginger Man, the now infamous, Sebastian Dangerfield, the answer is a loud and bawdy,&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;oh, yes&quot;. Donleavy has introduced onto Irish soil the answer to Joyce's earlier posed dilemma, &quot;how to bring the Irish intellect and physical love of life together in one character.&quot; Donleavy has provided the answer by introducing an Irish America, Sebastian Balfe Dangerfield, back to Ireland. Here he can study law and women with equal ineptitude, while the reader gets his/her laughs at poor Dangerfield's expense. This book stands with the best of the &quot;Black Humor&quot; novels of the '50's such as Cath-22 and Terry Southern's Candy. It is satire, humor and a morality tale rolled into one. This is a book that will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The Ginger Man","review":"A great big stream of consciousness slice of life book about the boozing, lazy, nasty, cruel, selfish Sebastian Dangerfield, and American in Dublin who is supposed to be studying law at Trinity but instead drinks all day, chases women and exchanges abuse with his wife. All the negative reviews here center of Sebastian's moral character. To be sure, Sebastian is an unpleasant character, but that doesn't bother me. I was simply bored by the events of the novel. I didn't find it, as all the blurbs promised, an exuberant, witty, wildly comic escapade. Donleavy's writing style is good and his langauge is rich (and the book contains amazingly graphic sex scenes for its time), but I wasn't interested in what was happening to this drunken fellow. And, as with another Irish book with a scoundrel hero, Joyce Cary's The Horse's Mouth, the same nothings seemed to happen again and again: Sebastain avoids creditors. Sebastian beds women. Sebastian gets drunk and waxes outrageous and lyrical.

(Rossum's universal robots);: A play in three acts and an epilogue,","review":"and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. Hamlet, Act iii, scene 2.The ultimate problem in Karel Capek's extraordinary play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) is that the robots created by humanity's journeymen imitated humanity so abominably well.Written in 1920 and first produced in 1921 RUR opened to critical worldwide acclaim. Although RUR is best remembered for introducing the word robot into the lexicon (the word was coined by Karel's brother and some time collaborator Josef Capek) it is more a somber reflection on humanity than on the emergence of robots.The play opens on an unnamed island at some point in time after 1920 where lifelike robots are being produced by Rossum's Universal Robots. The officers of the corporation meet a young lady, Helena, who has come to the island on behalf of the League of Humanity, determined to help liberate these robots from the inhumane working conditions that confront them. The executives fill Helena in on the history of the company, particularly the father-son team of Rossums that developed the first robots. Capek makes it a point to describe the difference between the father and the son. The father was a \\"scientific materialist\\" whose desire to create an imitation of man grew out of his wish to prove that God was unnecessary. The son thought this was both silly and inefficient and sought nothing more than to produce robots capable of working non-stop.Each of the following scenes takes place at some unspecified point in the future. The millions of robots produced take on all the industrial and agricultural work performed formerly by men and women. This leads to unintended consequences. First, the lack of necessity (the need to work) in everyday life leads to a few worker revolts. This causes various governments to arm the robots to quell the resulting riots. Further, these governments decide that all future wars will be fought by robots. As one might imagine, a well-trained robot-militia is not conducive to the future health and welfare of the human race. Second, the lack of work and the general lack of purposefulness of life render humans incapable of reproducing.As the play nears its end, the robots have united and have set out to destroy the human race. Clearly, the robots have learned to think for themselves and as such they have taken on (or evolved into) something that more closely resembles the human race. The fact that the robots behave so abominably does not belie this similarity to their human creators. The problem the robots face is that they do not have the inherent capacity to reproduce (they have a shelf-life a bit shorter than is average for humans) and they have inadvertently destroyed those humans that know how to create more robots. They are faced with extinction just as surely as the humans they have destroyed.As the play concludes the sole remaining human, Alquist, spots two robots whose clear affection for each other indicates that the robots are about find a means to reproduce without the assistance of the humans who gave them life. This pleases Alquist no end and as the play ends, he \`anoints' the robots with his blessing. It is a poignant, jumbled mixture of the creation story (and on the sixth day) and the Song of Simeon (Let us now thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.) The rich irony in this biblical blessing of the new, robotic Adam and Eve brings us to a place dramatically different from the elder Rossum's stated desire to create robots to disprove the existence of God. Alquist's benediction shows man at the height of his humanity and speaks directly to Alduous Huxley's dictum that \\"the humanity of men and women is inversely proportional to their numbers.\\"R.U.R. was written at a time when the world was still reeling from the horrors of the First World War, which horrors were magnified by technological advancements that made the killing industry far more efficient than it ever had been in the past. Capek's pessimism must be viewed through that prism. However, it must be noted that &Egrave;apek's pessimism was not directed at technology itself. I think his concern was with the unchanging human nature of those who think they control the technology and who direct, for good or ill, its use. In some respects this harkens to the political slogan that \\"guns don't kill people, people kills people\\". In this instance and in view of the horrors Capek witnessed first hand, it does not seem inappropriate.It should be noted that R.U.R. was written 85 years ago and the words Capek wrote were meant to be heard by an audience and not read.. As such, some of the dialogue will sound a bit stilted or dated to the reader. However this bit of apparent aging should not diminish the enjoyment to be derived from reading R.U.R. R.U.R. and Capek' other great dystopian work, War With the Newts are a must read for those interested in some of the early 20th century's most compelling fictional looks into the heart of darkness that is mankind. The introduction by Ivan Klima, a biographer of Capek is noteworthy and adds a great deal of illumination for the reader."},{"Title":"R.U.R. (Rossum's universal robots);: A play in three acts and an epilogue,","review":"This science fiction play by the Czechoslovakian writer Karel Capek (1890-1938) introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; (from the Czech word &quot;robota&quot; for work). Any serious student of science fiction should read this play. A factory on an island produces robots (actually, in today's terminology, the products being made by this factory are androids, not robots) to do man's labor and to grow his food. But, as the years go by, governments misuse the robots, having them replace soldiers. Robots begin to be used in wars everywhere. They rebel and man is exterminated. However, the robots don't know how to build new robots and discover that they are doomed to extinction as well. But, the sole two robots of a later model discover beauty, compassion, and love. They become a new Adam and Eve. Interestingly, one of the characters in the play builds robots so that man won't have to work. Yet, he doesn't build any to do his work since it is something he enjoys doing."},{"Title":"R.U.R.

The author died in 1938 at about the time Turing was &quot;inventing&quot; the Turing Machine. Perhaps the author intended this work as a parable about Bolshevism, but the steady growth of the computer makes it read today like a straight-forward prophecy which will come true in about 50 more years.

(Rossum's universal robots);: A play in three acts and an epilogue,","review":"Most 20th century plays are focused on the exploration of characters, not ideas. Karel Capek's R.U.R. (short for Rossum's Universal Robots) explores instead ideas, leaving character to one side. The character in this play are somewhat beside the point, irrelevant. The ideas about human beings, about the centrality of labor to give their lives meaning, of the pressures of modern capital to strip workers of their essentially human characteristics are what the play is all about. The robots are emblematic of what, Capek believes, modern capital want to do to workers, taken to their logical extreme.The play is, therefore, a profoundly political play. Capek's own politics do not fit comfortably on the current political grid. He could properly be called conservative, if one could recover an older conservative tradition that was not linked so powerfully to business and corporate interests. Historically this was not always so. John Adams, for instance, the second American president, wrote passionately about the need for the executive branch of government to stand between the greed of the economic elite and both ordinary Americans and the republic. This tradition in American politics was transformed earlier just after the half century mark in the 20th century, much to the chagrin of traditional conservatives like Russell Kirk. Capek shares much in common with this earlier tradition, seeing the greed of corporate interests, which would reduce workers to mere machines if they could. But Capek also shares with this older conservative tradition a fear of technological development. He does not believe that much genuine good will arise out of increasing technological development.The play is perhaps most significant for having popularized the use of the word \\"robot,\\" a word coined by Karel's brother Josef. The robots of Capek's play have far more in common with what we would today call cyborgs or androids, being apparently human creatures made by humans. I find it fascinating that this, the first truly important SF play, focuses on robots. The novel that is usually considered the first SF novel, FRANKENSTEIN by Mary Shelley, also is about an artificially constructed human being. The first SF feature length film, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, also had a robot as one of its major characters. Capek's particular version of the robot has many connections with subsequent depictions of constructed people. To take merely one instance, there are many parallels between Capek's robots and the Cylons in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new version, not the 1978 one). In both versions the robots were created to undertake work for humans to make their lives easier. In both versions the robots or Cylons turned against their creators. In both versions the robots or Cylons are obsessed with replicating themselves, though in BSG the Cylons are capable of laboratory reduplication, but aspire to procreation sexually. Clearly Capek anticipated many ongoing questions in SF.This remains one of the important works of SF of the 20th century as well as one of the most crucial works in the history of imaginative explorations of what it means to be human through the creation of artificial people."},{"Title":"R.U.R.

With the title taken from the traditional gladiators' greeting, &quot;Hail Caesar! We who are about to die salute you!&quot;, this book traces the history of the Roman games from Anchises' funerary games in Vergil's Aeneid to the inevitable coarsening and excess of Imperial Rome. Along the way, we learn about the engineering of the Circus Maximus, the training of the gladiators, the orgiastic response of both plebs and patricians in the audience, and even the horrific cruelty inherent in such a scene. Mannix' &quot;Those About to Die&quot; provides tremendous insights into a cultural and sociological ritual the likes of which have never been seen before -- and, hopefully, will never be seen again."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"I read this book over a decade ago and even today, now that I do not have the copy anymore, I still remember the title and the impact it had on me then. It has been on my wish-list for years and plan to order it again soon. I have had many occasions to refer to it in conversations with friends and aquaintances, be it toward politic themes, animal training, or in college. This book gives a fascinating insight into mankind, the beast."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"Probably the most provocative work of historical fiction published this century,&quot;Those Who Are About To Die&quot; is pure Mannix at his best. A uncensured exploration of what likely took place in the circuses of ancient Rome. Filled with all the bloodshed, sadism, torture, sex and beastiality that Mannix could reasonably document. Just as fascinating today as when it became a cult classic thirty years ago. Mannix is the only author brave enough to make a career out of documenting man at his most inhuman. Hard to believe he also wrote the story for Disney's &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;! If you liked &quot;Caligula&quot; you'll love &quot;Those Who Are About To Die&quot;!

Daniel Mannix has done an excellent job of bringing dimension &amp; depth to a subject that few of us really understand.

I now watch 'SPARTACUS' from a totally different perspective!"},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"This is an update after actually receiving the book. Read first, then go to the end for the update.Almost 50 years have passed since I first read this shocker and I've found it again. Before pushing \\"go to checkout\\" this is my memory:Absolutely incredible book on Roman life. By \\"incredible,\\" I really do mean \\"unbelievable\\" details of Roman excesses, not just in the killing arena, but in raising and eating rare foods: hummingbird tongues, fish that changed colors as they were boiled alive, unborn calves and other animals cooked inside their mothers, and on and on.In the arena, there were specialists in animal as well as human destruction called \\"bestiarii\\" who could kill a lion with their bare hands. The author said the bestiarii hated and feared only leopards because of the animals' blinding speed.The Roman Colosseum arena could be flooded in minutes, not only for mock sea battles, but for imaginary paradise islands populated by luscious women and handsome men singers and musicians--who were fed to crocodiles to the delight of the crowd.So out of hand did the \\"Bread and Circuses\\" of Rome become that shipments of sand for the Colosseum floor were given priority over shipments of food, according to that author.I read this shocking book as a very young teenager--it was a paperback book belonging to an uncle. If I can remember this much after nearly 50 years, this is a book that stays with you--whether totally true or not.UPDATE---Well, I was half right, because this is about half the book it was. Not Amazon's fault. The book arrived in less than a week in surprisingly good condition for a paperback.No, the 1960 publisher \\"reverse Bowdlerized\\" the original I read. Thomas Bowdler gave his name to heavy editing by taking out \\"indelicate\\" parts of Shakespeare for a family edition.This publisher left all the indelicate parts in, resulting in 153 pages of blood, guts and sex.My guess is that 100 pages of the original are missing. Nothing on the raising and eating of rare foods except a brief mention of thrushes' tongues (not hummingbirds)and baby mice. Very little on the daily lives of Romans and the rich. Probably considered too boring.Still a helluva read by Daniel Mannix. He put together an exciting and only partly imaginary account of the horror and spirit of the \\"games\\" of ancient Rome. Today's \\"Mortal Kombat\\" types of computer games and popularity of \\"reality\\" TV shows are a perfect reflection of old bloodlust, proving Mannix right in saying in 1958 that America would revel in actual fights to the death today.But I wanted more than blood and guts, and miss the \\"boring\\" parts. Instead of Bowdlerized, the original was disemboweled--with glee."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"I recently finished Daniel P. Mannix other book, The Hell Fire Club. Could not put it down! Downed it three days. Was curious about \\"Those About To Die\\"--what a topic!From the ad in the back of the 1958 paper-back copy of \\"The Hell Fire Club\\" reads:The Full truth of the sadistic Roman \\"games\\", where two armies of 5,000 men fought to the death, girls were thrown to crocodiles, leopards and bulls were taught to ravage woman. The wildest public massacres in history.-- The author shows how the \\"public entertainment\\" escalated over a period of a few hundred years, the grand economy which was built up around these events. This is definitely a piece of history we want to be aware of as so not to repeat. This was also a quick, smooth, easy (but intense) read. Good writer."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"Unfortunately, I am not a historian of Ancient Rome but this unforgettable book hammers away at me to try to determine its accuracy. If the book is even 50% accurate, historians have missed the boat completely on Ancient Rome. According to author, Daniel P. Mannix, this is a history of the games. These games commenced with the almost innocent, annual competitive, athletic rituals held at the Circus Maximus. They ended in the development and unfortunate daily operation of some kind of blood lust theater, including the construction and operation of the Flavian Circus, today known as the Coliseum of Rome, with gladiators, animals, bestial sex and other extreme perversions in almost every municipality of the Roman Empire. The games continued until this addictive social disease nearly wiped out the wild life population of Northern Africa and went on to devour deeply, fatally, into its fiscal and human resources. When it was over, there was very little left of what once was Empire. It all happened from within. The author's highly detailed; beguiling descriptions seem too strange to be fiction. The book compels the reader to read it repeatedly. We are constrained to draw upon today's parallels of ultra violent, inhuman Hollywood films and continuous wars that have no rhyme nor reason or purpose."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"I read this book some years ago now when I was quite young. It struck me then as bizarre, as you can imagine it would to a teenager in the early 70's. Having perused it again it still strikes me as ghastely and unimaginable but strangely compelling. I believe it to carry a strong message, a warning no less of the traps and pitfalls of human excesses and how lusty, violent tendencies can overwhelm even apparently ordinary people should they succumb to the hysterical abandonment of decency and proper civil norms and behaviour. I marvelled at and was appalled by this book simultaneously."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"This is a timeless story,starting from ancient rome leading us to contemporary american society.The romans had their coliseum and circus maximus,while we have our television radio,movies and tabloid newspapers to articulate in sight and sound examples of depraved entertainment for the gullible masses. This is a great book to encourage you to look around you at what passes for innocent entertainment,but really functions as a scintillating distraction to take our minds off the decline of the american economic and social structure."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"I read this book when it first came out. I had already developed a passion for history as a child, and had become fascinated by gladiators as a result of seeing a couple of movies on that theme. For those teenagers who complain that the study of history is boring, try Mannix and you'll never see history as dull again. This is as exciting as the best historical novel."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"Those About to Die by Daniel P. Mannix came out in the mid to late 60's. I recall reading it while I was still in high school. At that time, the book had considerable success and I think the reason for that was due to the dark subject matter it covered, and the unbelievable statistics that the author put into his research. Now, exactly where he obtained \\"those statistics\\" remains to be seen. I don't believe he had access to a Roman \\"butchers bill\\" but...who knows?Mannix combined some real historical information, some projected ideas, and some literary freedom to merge everything together. Much of his research was taken from the modern day circus and animal trainers.Despite some of the questions regarding his research, the book gave the reading audience a much more realistic account of the gladiatorial games than ever before. The cinematic \\"sterile-ness\\" of \\"Spartacus\\" and \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\\" was definitely, not present in this book!This was a classic in it's own right and if you have an interest in Roman history then you should buy this one just for the sake of ...having it."},{"Title":"Those About To Die","review":"I read this book as a teenager many years ago and assume it's been out of print for many years.

I think that the book was written as a rather pulpy, purient interest, Historical faction. There are very graphic scenes of sex and violence and an over indulgence in the sadistic rituals of the games. I would question the accuracy of much of this book. BUT the writers talent is in a wonderfully vivid prose style that has to be read to be believed.I don't think that it is particularily contrived either. Mannix is just a natural.

I am a beginner and have used Keith Wyatt's Acoustic Guitar Basics to start. I moved to his Blues Guitar Basics and found it a little too difficult. This one seems too start at a better level for me. Explanations are great and the book is easy to follow. It's great when after a lesson you can play what you have been taught and feel like you have learned something.

Wyatt has a great acoustic style, a great instructional style and a wealth of bluesy guitar ideas in this volume!!Lots of variations on the 12 bar blues with beginner to intermediate licks, riffs and fills to keep the guitarist engaged and the audience listening. Wyatt incorporates and intertwines fills and ryhthmn parts in a very cool, fluid style. With just a little practice many of the examples are quickly mastered.The book breaks down the parts into easy to learn chunks and then gradually adds fills and licks and bass runs until you have a tiny little blues masterpiece, easy to follow well worth the $$"},{"Title":"Acoustic Blues Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This is a OK book although its a little difficult to follow at times. It's like a lot of instructional books, I doubt its understandability was tested by giving it to a couple dozen new struggling guitarists to try out, and then take note in gaps in logic and instructional gaps etc. That would have helped in this case. If you know a topic really well, sometimes its hard to imagine how someone would not understand your explanation. Still its got a lot of good stuff. This particular incarnation has the audio cd which at times is not that great a help. I would buy the version with the DVD."},{"Title":"Acoustic Blues Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"Great book. I have been playing for a couple of years and found that I really like acoustic blues e.g., Robert Johnson, etc. I would look at the sheet music on these guys and not have a clue as to where to start. This book allowed me to at least get some pleasant sounds out of my box and progress past simple strumming. I picked up this book and learned some of the basics and cliches that are always used in blues. I have another of Wyatt's books and also find it a good start. I have gone back to this book now that I have studied more music theory and that has made it easier to understand without simply memorizing the excercises. Now that I have a better understanding of the theory I am getting as much out of the book as I did the first couple of times-so you can grow with it. By the way, you can use a lot of the excercises on electric as well."},{"Title":"Acoustic Blues Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book is not terrible for what it is, but beware: this is NOT useful as a guide to the actual method of playing acoustic blues guitar.The reason being is that pretty much all pre-electric blues, whether Delta or Piedmont or the urban style of Lonnie Johnson, is FINGERPICKED blues. This is essentially what most people mean by acoustic blues guitar as distinct from the single-note, plectrum-style characteristic of electric blues.This book is simply not an introduction to acoustic blues guitar in that sense. There is a brief section on alternate-bass fingerpicking toward the end of the book, but it's really too brief and perfunctory to be of much use to anybody.In terms of a general abstract introduction to blues guitar in general, it's not a terrible book. If you don't know anything about the I-IV-V progression, seventh chords, shuffle rhythms, or the minor pentatonic scale, then this is an OK book, but that is extremely basic foundational stuff, which is applicable to both electric and acoustic blues guitar.If you're actually looking for an introduction to acoustic blues guitar, i.e. the fingerpicked style of Robert Johnson, Gary Davis, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Memphis Minnie, Lonnie Johnson, Blind Blake, etc., then stay away from this book, and instead go pick up Beginning Fingerstyle Blues Guitar by Arnie Berle and Mark Galbo, which is an actual proper method book on acoustic blues guitar."},{"Title":"Acoustic Blues Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I would not recommend this product for someone just learning guitar, but if you already have the basics and want to learn a different style, this is just excellent. In no time, you will have the basic rhythm and feel for the blues. The accompanying CD helps you get the beat and feel of the blues. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Ancient Greek Athletics","review":"Everybody knows that the Olympics started in ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago, but nobody seems to know much about those games. Well, the author of this book really knows his stuff. He gives lots of detailed information, and answers lots of questions that you never thought to ask.My personal interest in the subject was not so much about the sports aspect of the ancient games, but more about how those competitions illuminated the Bible's use of athletic metaphors. The Apostle Paul used a number of them. I have gotten some insight on the metaphors, but I've also been drawn in to the workings of the games, the contestants, the officials, and, of course, the games themselves.The author uses many Greek words in his writing, but explains each one when it is first used. (I wish I could remember them all). Having some knowledge of the Greek language is not necessary, but will make some things easier to follow.The book is lavishly illustrated with dozens of pictures of Greek vases and inscriptions that depict the ancient athletes performing in their events - most of the time, completely naked. Modern readers (especially men) will find it surprising, I suppose, that for most events, this was exactly how it was done (I guess that motivated them to run really fast). And the gymnasium was the place where they practiced and performed naked. And that is the meaning od the Greek word, gumnos.I think this book will set the standard for information on the ancient Greek games. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ancient Greek Athletics","review":"very satisfied with this item arrived on time condition was good as it was described on the description. happy with the book. would recommend it to anyone"},{"Title":"PASSION'S WEB","review":"Passion's Web is a very hot romance - if you can call that a romance !!

Does he (or she, as Poirot often points out) murder for fame or perhaps for some other sinister reason?The joy of this novel is more than unraveling the mystery. The real heart of the story is tagging along with the ever-witty and always self-assured Hercule Poirot as he \\"exercises the little grey cells.\\" Watching the local authorities rush to judgment while Poirot seeks a deeper truth never fails to delight. And the brilliant Agatha Christie seems to give the reader that one missing piece of the puzzle, at just the right moment, to find out whodunit."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"The ABC Murders from Agatha Christie is unique from many of her other mysteries in that she uses a \\"serial killer\\" nature to the crime. Hercule Poirot receives a mysterious letter prior to the murder of Alice Ascher of Andover, and has a bad feeling that these two things could be connected. When a threatening letter arrives before the next murder, it is pretty much game on for Poirot, who also has Arthur Hastings and Inspector Japp to help him. The murderer also leaves an ABC guide for the railway system next to each victim, and this appears to be the clue in trying to stop the ABC Murderer. Most of the novel is written from the 1st person point of view of Hastings, who is a bit perplexed with the logic and detective skill of Poirot. At various points, the novel shifts to a third person \\"outside\\" narrator, which is interesting, because you can see the story from a different perspective. The killer taunts the sleuths before each successive murder with a letter with an ambiguous clue. But, the most important thing for Poirot to uncover is motive for these murders, and with so many suspicious characters in the book, it will be a challenge for Poirot.The unraveling of events in The ABC Murders towards the end was amazing and ingenious. Some reviewers say it was obvious, but I thought the book keeps you in suspense until the very end. There's a twist that may lead you astray as you try to play detective along while reading.Definitely one of Christie's best mysteries!4 stars"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"It is frustrating the way you look at a review for a product and there are reviews for other products of the same title. It is the equivalent of looking for a review of a pizza at one restaurant and being listed prominently is the review of a pizza from another restaurant. Anyway...I find Agatha Christie interpretations to be the same way. Some (especially newer productions) totally miss the mark in terms of the classic cozy mystery feel. Not so with this version.If you like Poirot, and have never heard John Moffatt in the part, give this a try.Moffatt personifies Poirot as well as anyone else can. He does as well in Audio as Suchet does on video (not to take away from either).I have enjoyed many of Christies stories with Moffatt staring as the main character, even going back to before the internet and the limited availability in the 90's on cassette.These radio interpretations through BBC Radio are top notch, and are great to listen to while doing chores.I would also suggest if you like this to try the BBC Ian Carmichael Dorothy Sayers Mystery Dramatizations."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"I needed an entertaining and quick mental challenge. The 12th Hercule Poirot mystery does not disappoint. There's no good reason to give you the gist of the plot. Why spoil your fun? All of Ms. Christie's books are crisply written whodunits. No humor or colorful characters (outside of M. Poirot, of course) grace these pages. But the late author sure knew how to build a good puzzler. Most of the book is narrated by Captain Hastings, Poirot's good friend and confidant. Hastings is much like Sherlock Holmes' trusted sidekick, Dr. Watson. There are not a legion of suspects to sidetrack the reader. Ms. Christie was so good at her craft, she only had to wave a handful of possible candidates in front of the reader's face to keep you guessing. Yet, despite such an advantage, chances are that you'll still be stumped. I was. Written in 1935 and \\"The ABC Murders\\" is still a fun read."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"This woman is a killer in murder stories. She has no complex with Sherlock Holmes always in the wings and she is able to do things differently and yet in the tradition. The tradition here is of course the revelation of the real culprit in a conference by Hercule Poirot in the last five pages of the book. The tradition is to use Hercule Poirot's brains more than his magnifying glass. Already a difference in this similarity. But then everything is very different, is in a definitely more modern mood. Hercule Poirot is looking for the psyche of this serial killer and the motivation he has. He follows the line of a madman on the loose and yet keeps his awareness open to facts that could lead to a completely different solution, and sure enough it is the psychology and motivation necessary for these crimes to appear logical that enables Hercule Poirot to tell the name of the killer. This is more important than real evidence which can always be collected afterwards when the mystery is cleared. In other words Agatha Christie is already in 1936 on a profiling line that will appear in the world as a standard method only in the 1980s in the FBI to answer the challenge of serial killers. She is in other words postmodern when everyone is nothing but premodern. She is ahead of her times and by at least one if not two generations. The story itself is fabulous in the way it is organized and told. Suspense is perfect. The mystery is dense and dark. The solution is clear and logical. There is only one difficult element : two girls, two victims have a birthday before their murders and their parents or relatives buy them silk stockings for this same reason. This is a little bit coincidental. But apart from that everything is clear, except why Mrs Malbury's daughters call the suspected criminal to warn him that the police is coming. That sounds both fishy and strange, and is definitely not explained in the story. But what a good detective story-teller Ms Agatha Christie was and still is and will still be for quite a while. In other words she is a classic in the genre.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"This was one of the first Dame Agatha Christie books I ever read, and also one of the best. I read it in about twenty-four hours. It was spellbinding. I love Christie's books because the conclusion is always so unexpected. The murderer never turns out to be one of the prime suspects, sometimes not even a suspect at all, in this case. I didn't even like mysteries before I started reading Christie's books. I recommend this to anyone, even someone who doesn't like mysteries. I think you'll love it!"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Poirot has gotten a letter challenging him to stop a murder. He is given the date and location, the letter is signed ABC. The police dismiss the incident as yet another harmless crank letter - until a murder takes place on the day and time stated in the letter and an ABC railway guide is found on the scene. More letters arrive and a pattern begins to form, the killer is working his way through victims and towns alphabetically - Ascher in Andover, Barnard in Bexhill, Clarke in Chruston... Poirot and the police are in pursuit but always it seems a frustrating step behind. Ultimately Poirot is successful of course. The solution to the crime is clever and original, even by Christie standards.This is a departure from the usual 'cozy' style that is more typical of Christie (ie confined location, murderer and victim know each other, motive clearly established, little focus on the crime itself). This is darker than her usual work, the victims are seemingly chosen at random, the entire country is threatened, and the messages from the killer are reminiscent of Jack the Ripper.Poirot gives a description of the killer based on the letters and evidence collected at the crime, in a manner that is very like a modern day profiler. Keep in mind that this book was written nearly 80 years ago.If you are a Christie fan this is definitely a must read but if you are looking for a more comfortable 'cozy' you may find this one a bit disturbing."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Agatha Christie's A.B.C Murders that has a very interesting plot. In it, a series of murders occurs that have several things in common. First, every murder has a note preceding it that is sent to Hercule Poirot, the heroic detective of the book and the main character in many of Christie's novels. Each note contains the location and date of the next murder. Each note is sent by a man calling himself A.B.C. Second, the murders are all committed in alphabetical order. For instance, Mrs. Ascher was killed in Andover and Betty Bernard was killed in Bexhill. Third, each of the bodies had an A.B.C railway guide lying near or on it. These guides were open to the page containing the town where the murder had been committed. Using clues and connections that the reader will probably not realize exist until the conclusion, Poirot finds the true culprit.A.B.C Murders has both advantages anddisadvantages. One of the most important advantages is that it has a story line with many plot twists and a net of intrigue. Just when you think you know who did it, evidence proves otherwise, which is one reason why I liked it. This kind of twist keeps on happening until the story is resolved. Another good thing about this book is the vocabulary, which is advanced; a dictionary can come in handy while reading this book. Poirot's witty comments in French are both funny and insightful. I only had a few problems with this book. First, Christie presents the material in such a way that it is sometimes confusing to read. Second, Poirot sees the smallest detail, which is a bit unlikely because in this respect he seems a bit superhuman. Third, the murderer always leaves a clue that no one seesexcept Poirot, which is again very unlikely. All in all, I would give this book three stars and saythat if you are looking for a good mystery book to read on the proverbial &quot;dark and stormy night&quot; you might want to pick this up. However, if you are looking for detective fiction with a more realistic plot, I would search for greener pastures."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"The A.B.C. Murders strength is also its weakness. It has a very unusual twist. That is typical of the Agatha Christie of the superb Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Murder on the Orient Express. The only problem in this mystery is that, for once, the twist seems a lot more forced, with a group of suspects that are not particularly unique or interesting. It still is alway good to read about Hercule Poirot and Hastings has returned for this adventure. And, of course, for those desiring a higher than usual Christie body count, this mystery provides a healthy dose of dead bodies. It makes for a pleasant summer read but is not up to the usual Christie standards and does not bear up to repeated visits unlike many of the Christie classics."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"The exciting mystery The ABC Murders written by Agatha Christie has a well thought out plot and good character development. The writing does not have a noticeable style, like The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, but when Christie writes a mystery there is not much need for a literary style. The book keeps the reader thirsting for more and always has some clues that keep you from not ruling anyone out as a suspect. This detective fiction novel uses Hercule Poirot as the detective and his faithful yet not so bright sidekick Hastings who also narrates the book. The two team up with Scotland Yard to try to solve a mystery to find a murderer who goes by the name ABC. He writes Poirot letters as clues to the next murder he is going to commit. The first victim is Mrs. A. Ascher in Andover, then Ms. Betty Barnard in Bexhill, Mr. Charmichael Clark in Churston and finally a murder in Doncaster. The book is fun to read because of the side relationship between Hastings and Poirot is out of the ordinary. Hastings is blindly stupid yet by stating the obvious he makes this mystery clear to Poirot. A little passage from the book clearly shows the relationship between the two, &quot;... But it does not satisfy me. There are things I want to know. Why did he commit these murders? Why did he chose those particular people--?&quot; &quot;Alphabetically-&quot;(Hastings) I began. &quot;Was Betty Barnard the only person in Bexhill whose name began with B? Betty Barnard-I had an idea there.... It ought to be true-it must be true. But if so-&quot; He was silent for some time. I did not like to interrupt him. As a matter of fact, I believe I fell asleep. I woke to find Poirot's hand on my shoulder. &quot;Mon cher Hastings,&quot; he said affectionately. &quot;My good genius.&quot; &quot;it is true,&quot; Poirot insisted. &quot;Always-always-you help me-you bring me luck. You inspire me.&quot; &quot;How have I inspired you this time?&quot; I asked. &quot;While I was asking myself certain questions I remembered a remark of yours-a remark absolutely shimmering in its clear vision . Did I not say to you once that you had a genius for stating the obvious?&quot; P 157. This passage from the book is the Hastings Poirot relationship in a nutshell because Poirot is using his scholarly mind to twist and turn what really happened into something very complex while Hastings simply re-states the facts and makes it all quite simple to Poirot. Sometimes the two remind me of little kids playing cops and robbers. Poirot is well described. Christie focuses on his mustache and his hair dye which Hastings cleverly notices in the beginning of the book. Poirot often says little French phrases because Christie wanted to make that one of Poirot's noticeable characteristics. The reason for the confusion about who the killer is, is that Poirot knows nothing of the motive, personality or appearance. All he has are some letters and an ABC (a railway guide) found by the bodies of all the victims. The murderer has left no other clues besides those showing that he is not just killing out of rage and that he is carefully planning the murders out. He even plans the best time of day to commit the murders. Even though Poirot picks through every little piece of the case over and over trying to find a clue, this book makes clear that he needs Hastings and some luck to solve the mystery. People who have read lots of Agatha Christie books will tell you if you like one, chances are that you will like them all. The combination of the character development, a tricky plot and lots of suspense makes for a good mind crank. If you like good detective fiction stories, then Agatha Christie is the author and Hercule Poirot is the detective (and Hastings is the story teller) for you. Good job Agatha Christie!"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"This book by Agatha Christie was fabulous!! The entire book I was thrown off. The ending was such a surprise. There was always an element of suspense. I just couldn't put it down! I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading mysteries. It was very twisted and unexpected. You THOUGHT you knew what was happening, but in reality you didn't. 5 stars for Agatha Christie!! A job well done!"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"It is the Poirot Mystery I like best. There are few whodunits I want to read again, but this book is the exception. I read this book second time and I love it again. It is not only an excellent mystery, but also an excellent suspense story. The battle against the fiend who commits murders alphabetically is thrilling, fast-paced and highly enjoyable.Reading whodunits, I rarely feel sympathy for victims nor hatred to murderers. This book is the rare case. The murderer is really a cold-blooded fiend. Even affable Poirot expresses a cold rage to the murderer."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"If you are a fan of Agatha Christie's, as I am, you may think that you've read all of the clever plot twists that there are, but this book has a real gem of a twist. Hercule Poirot begins to receive letters that predict future murders which occur in alphabetical order with regard to the victim and the town. Poirot uses his friend Hastings, the narrator of this book, as a sounding board and begins to try out his theories on him. While the official inspectors are carried away by &quot;evidence&quot; which they discover, Poirot tries to use his &quot;little grey cells&quot; to deduce the identity of the killer. This is a definite &quot;must read&quot; for Christie fans."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"\\"The ABC Murders\\" by Agatha Christie features Hercule Poirot being challenged by a seemingly insane murderer. It features all of Christie's trademarks - especially those of early Poirot works where the murderer and the detective are somehow intertwined - and that essential twist that makes a Christie mystery better than the rest. \\"The ABC Murders\\" offers readers unique insight into the mind of the supposed killer as the famed detective and his pal Captain Hastings try to bring him to justice.This novel sees the return of Captain Hastings from South America, arriving just as Poirot receives a mysterious communique from an A.B.C. - a letter announcing a crime in Andover on a certain date. Poirot fears murder, and is proven correct, yet before the search can truly begin, another letter arrives, with the town announced starting with a B. Could it be that this madman intends to make his way through the entire alphabet? And why is he challenging Poirot? For publicity? Because he dislikes foreigners? Just because he's plain crazy? There are so many questions that Poirot has no answers for, and as more murders occur, fewer answers announce themselves. Readers, however, are given narrative into the proposed murderer's actions as he kills his victims and leaves his calling card - an ABC train schedule - at each crime scene. With Captain Hastings, various police squads, and an amateur team of sleuths made up of those affected by the murders, Poirot races against the clock to solve the mystery before too many more innocent people are murdered.Christie was at the top of her game with \\"The ABC Murders\\". It is a fast-paced almost frothy read that will leave readers uncertain, especially since it seems like too much about the killer is revealed (even if offered by Hastings in hindsight). It is always delightful when the great Hercule Poirot is stumped, but even more enjoyable when he uncovers the truth behind the great mysteries."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"I tried reading the book and it was really slow in the beginning so I didn't want to.

The problem is in the superhuman nature of her characters.(Warning: Plot Spoilers Ahead)Take the solution to the ABC murders, for example. Somehow, Poirot managed to figure out that Cust was innocent, and unravel an extremely complx murder/frame up plot by one of the victim's family members. Very clever, but by the logic he used, ANY NUMBER OF OTHER SOLUTIONS WOULD BE EQUALLY POSSIBLE. The way he arranges what scant clues he has into this elaborate solution is kind of like trying to solve the New York Times Crossward puzzle with only the clue to 43 down.And not to mention the fact that her books are so mind-numbingly boring! Absolutely nothing in the way of solving the case happens in between, and the reader finds themselves propelled through the plot by only the curiosity to know the outcome. And sometimes that isn't enough."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"OK, I may only be 12,but I have been reading novels since I was six, so don't jst skip this review! Frankly, I though that Christie's characters were stiff and boring. The plot was actually pretty predictable for a book by Christie.

The low rateing i gave this book is not because it is a bad book, in relation to most mysteries this one would be rated highly, but when put up against other Agatha Christie books its pretty crappy.I get the idea of the plot, the numerous murders keep the action going throught the novel to lead the reader on, which was a good thing to try because i know the most common complaint with agatha christie is the boaring investigative part in the middle. My problem with the book is with the way it is constructed, several interludes happen in the book that come from the (so called) killer. This makes the reader feel like they already know the answer to the problem and makes the reader wonder why the book continues.So after i got half way through the book i was wondering, why should i continue with this book if i already know who did it, i think that kind of takes away from the story. Although the ending comes togeather and is pretty good (not her best). I think this uncharactoristic give to the reader, in the middle of the book is what really hurts the story in the end.Id say read the book for sure, but dont let the interludes push u to lose interest, its never as simple as she leads you to believe"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"This book was listed in \\"Good condition\\", but actually arrived in \\"Fair condition\\".

I know, you could argue that people don't read murder mysteries for emotional depth, but regardless, this book lacked it. it's just junk food. no substance. well, though not entirely, because she does give out some insightful philosophy near the end, all about intuition versus experienced reasoning, etc., and about really understanding WHY a person does what he does, what really motivates someone.my question: why, deep inside Agatha Christie, would SHE write a book like this, and I'm convinced that she did because she was brilliant in the emotional sphere she ventured into in her life, but that she was so utterly blocked off from other parts of herself that she was unable to venture into them in her writing. the result: she wrote these kinds of books (well, I've only read one, but I'll assume they suffice for the rest) that looked at just a very SLIM part of the human experience...also, I think psychologically this book is all unconsciously about the child overcoming the parent, which is a complete fantasy, the child in this case being Poirot and the parents being so many people - the deceptive murderer, the fancy and arrogant police. it's a big ol' grandiose fantasy, and that, I think, is why so many people are drawn to it. I admit, I liked it, and I felt pretty omnipotent reading it and identifying with Poirot...one other point that irked me: you know the real way this Poirot guy could have circumvented all the murders, and stopped them before even the first one happened? (and this won't ruin the plot, because I thought of it at the very beginning of the book.) he could have made a big publicity stunt about leaving the country and stating in the papers that he would not be working on the ABC murder case. by declining to enter the contest he would have failed to take on the grandiose challenge, would have not engaged the murderer, and would have utterly foiled the murderer's plan, because it was clear from the beginning (EVEN TO POIROT!!!) that the murderer needed Poirot himself to be involved in the case to be able to DO the murders.so my question: why didn't Poirot back out?answer: because Agatha Christie was too grandiose to dare back out of such a challenge. it's her unresolved grandiosity that's motivating her to write such books in the first place!!!"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Wanted so much to put this down - coz the hour on the clock was silently accusing me of being up still - but this story just wouldn't let go.Which may sound strange, considering that the plot is pretty straightforward - a letter challenging Poirot's sleuthing capabilities tells him to watch out for an immanent event (of course it's a murder...this is Poirot we're talking about). The letter is tauntingly signed, A.B.C.Sure enough, a murder is committed in the quiet little town of Andover. And a well-known railway guide called \`A.B.C.' is found near the corpse.As with the town's name, the victim's name begins with \`A', and the most obvious person who could have done it cannot be accused, as the letter, the scene of the crime, and the whole dynamics of the murder do not fit with the possible motives. Poirot is left stumped.Fast-track to 2 more letters and 2 more murders...of persons and towns with names beginning with \`B' and \`C', respectively. Everything appears squeaky-clean, and yet kinda weird. The victims do not have any palpable connection with each other, and it becomes more and more evident that Poirot and the police are dealing with a coldly calculating and dangerous \`madman' - one that is ostensibly bent on showing off his skill of being 2 steps ahead of the detectives. The public is stirred into a furor.But way before that (practically at the beginning, as a matter of fact), the reader is already given a glimpse of one Alexander Bonaparte Cust. A reserved, unprepossessing man who is shown ticking off someone's name in his copy of the A.B.C. railway guide.By that point, the most obvious reader reaction would be to think, \`well, then, that takes care of the suspect's identity' and then just sitting back and letting the scenes unfold as to when and how Poirot catches this Mr. Cust.As I've said, pretty straightforward, right?In fact, halfway through the novel, I felt that Poirot was not up to snuff. There were barely any deductions and clever observations being made. And, to be honest, I was starting to feel a little let down by our resident Belgian detective.And this is where the brilliance of Agatha Christie laughingly poked fun at this gullibility of mine.It's as if the author knew 5 chapters back how the reader is going to react as the narrative progresses. Knew it, and yet is rubbing her hands together in glee.Just when she knows that the \`thrill' of mystery is beginning to leech off...she breaks down practically all \`comfortable' assumptions being made by the characters and the readers and shows that the murders actually conceal a vastly different motive.Poirot's signature explanation near the end of the whole event reveals that everything is not as it appears to be. And no, he has definitely not lost his touch.Things are simpler than the reader is led to believe (hence my 4 stars). And yet is still more complex than the average in-your-face murder (hence why I'm still loving it).What I'm saying? This cat-and-mouse game is one that kept me on the edge of my...uhm...sofa.And when I finally turned the last page, I had a well-satisfied, yet sheepish, smile on my face.Christie has done it again. Darn it!"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"The A.B.C. Murders was an average mystery, which is to say that is was good, but not Agatha Christie good. It had the possibility of great excitement and tension due to the notes Poirot was receiving before each murder but failed to capitalize on it. There was no real thrill.Poirot is known for using his \\"little gray cells\\" instead of doing typical physical detective work. A reader is used to seeing Poirot ponder while others scurry looking for \\"real\\" clues. In this novel, everyone seemed to ponder, with no real action of any kind. While the killer was surprising, if perhaps a bit improbable, the book itself was ultimately forgettable."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"It's trickier than most of her mysteries but not necessarily better. Poirot begins receiving anonymous letters informing him that murder will be committed. The first is successfully carried out. The victim has some crazy name like Abigail Anathema of Absconde, Ayreshire. That the letters are not from a crank now sends Poirot and Hastings scuttling around, especially after the next one, which foretells another murder in Brixton or someplace. It shapes up that the murders are being carried out in alphabetical order, except for the last, in Doncaster, in which the victim seems to have been mistaken for someone whose last name begins with D.A good deal of time is spent interviewing witnesses and relatives. The police are heavily engaged. The conclusion by everyone is that the killings are committed by a madman with an A.B.C. obsession. And there are occasional cutaways from Poirot to a mousy character named Alexander Bonaparte Cust. Boy, does HE look suspicious.Eventually, Cust collapses in a police station, where he has gone to turn himself in. He's an epileptic and has had seizures frequently, leaving him with lapses of memory. Yes, he probably did it alright.But did he? Poirot has been fretting over the discrepancy between the obsessed madman evidence and the fact that the murders are so assiduously arranged.Medical discretion forbids further revelation of the plot, but if you have figured this one out before Poirot's usual summing up, I personally will send you a cashier's check for fifteen cents."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Agatha Christie, the most popular mystery writer of all time, recognized that crime is a very romantic topic.

I was all set to give this book only a couple of disappointed stars, but the twist at the end made it all worthwhile.

The book was published in 1936 when Christie and her Belgian police genius Hercule Poirot were at the top of their incredible careers! This is a clever book which will keep the pages flying through your hands as you peruse a very intriguing novel!The title is taken from the ABC Railroad Guide published in Great Britain. The guide contains an alphabetical listing of all the railroad stations in the kingdom. The serial killer takes the guide as his compass in his gruesome journey through the alphabet. The first murder is of Mrs. Ascher whose name begins with A. She is killed in Andover. The woman is a lower class store owner who is bludgeoned to death. The second murder is that of the fetching and amorous waiteress Betty Barnard of the seaside resort town of Be-on-the-Sea. The third murder is that of Sir Carmichael Clarke in Churston. This reviewer found it interesting that the first victim was poor; the second middle class and the third was wealty. Barnard and Clarke were both strangled.

Murders\\", Hercule Poirot receives a letter from a Mr ABC who taunts Poirot with the claim that he will be committing a murder at a certain place & date. Police think it is a hoax, until Alice Asher in Andover turns up dead with a copy of an ABC timetable nearby. This becomes the mark of the serial killer, with copies of ABC turning up with more dead bodies (all of which were pre-announced by letters addressed to Hercule Poirot). The whole things turns into a media sensation, with Poirot puzzled and seemingly balked by the mysterious ABC.Meanwhile, we the readers, are apparently spared from being puzzled, since we are introduced early on to the so-called killer, Mr. Alexander Bonaparte Cust. There are several segments in the book that breakaway from Colonel Hasting's narrative where we see Mr Cust's viewpoint. I found that very odd, since Mr Cust just seemed to me to be a terried poor old man and not at all like what Mr ABC should be. I pretty much just felt sorry for him all throughout the book.Since this is an Agatha Christie novel, there is a twist in the end that I never expected, and to be honest, I couldn't make myself believe how Poirot was able to figure it out. Ms Christie was being a bit too clever again, thus, losing me at the end.There are other way better Agatha Christie novels out there that a new reader should check out first.

It is my favorite."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"In this novel, Poirot is rejoined by his old, marvelously obtuse friend Hastings (whom we haven't seen since Lord Edgeware Dies, four novels ago, since when he has been at his ranch in Argentina). A serial murder goes on the rampage, sending challenging letters to Poirot in the process, and Poirot and Hastings are on the trail!Hastings hasn't gotten any smarter, but that's not particularly unrealistic; I'm not sure that hanging out with a great detective would make me any more of a great detective myself, either.One thing I really enjoyed about this book was the intertextuality. I'm a total sucker for references, even if they're fictional - I loved the references in Marisha Pessl's Special Topics in Calamity Physics and still loved them (albeit less) after figuring out that most were invented. Hastings comes to visit Poirot, and Poirot suggests that it would be very nice to have a really interesting, challenging murder to solve together. Hastings talks about how multiple murders would be better, as having one murder at the beginning followed by a long ruling out of suspects can be tiresome (which seemed a reference to the recent and lovely Death in the Clouds). At some point Poirot mentions that he recent almost got killed himself (an allusion to Three Act Tragedy), Poirot reminds Hastings how love can be found in the context of murder (an allusion to Hastings' finding his own wife in Murder on The Links), etc.A minor annoyance is that Christie tries so hard to make Hastings the real narrator that she has a big explanation at the beginning about how it is that Hastings is narrating certain things he didn't observe; I think it'd have been better simply to drop Hasting's role (or leave those things out), but it clearly wasn't my call!I found the ending a little unsatisfying although I cannot put my finger on way. Christie had me completely fooled as to who the murderer was, multiple times, but somehow the final identity left me less convinced than some, like the last book (Death in the Clouds). But it was an entertaining read for my hotel in Tanzania.Next comes Murder in Mesopotamia, but I think I need a little break from Poirot."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie story I have read, although I am familiar with the Hercule Poirot series on television. This was also my first foray into this genre; most \\"mysteries\\" I have read are actually gory crime thrillers. It was refreshing to have a main character, the dapper Poirot, instead of some gritty detective with emotional problems. Poirot is brilliant, polished, and funny. He's even well-adjusted. I also appreciated the fact that the story was told from the perspective of Poirot's friend, Captain Hastings, meaning that I was left out of Poirot's thought-processes, so every twist and turn was a surprise.The story starts out with the arrival of a teasing letter at Poirot's home. It warns of something happening in Andover on a specific day. When Alice Ascher is found dead, it's obvious that the murderer is engaged in a lethal game with Poirot. The cast of characters keeps expanding as more murders occur, including family members and distraught boyfriends. Although everyone is a suspect, there are mysterious chapters interspersed throughout the book that feature a strange man named Alexander Bonaparte Cust...A.B.C. Who is this man? What is his connection to the murders?As the police are scrambling to try to find A.B.C. and to prevent these murders from happening on their appointed days, Poirot is using all his mental powers to try and figure out why these murders are happening. Even when it seems that the case is all locked up, Poirot still tries to understand the underlying reasons behind the crimes. It is this reason that finally blows the case wide open and provides a stunning twist at the end.This book is a classic of Christie's and really demonstrates her skills as the premier mystery writer. It will obviously appeal to all mystery fiction fans, but also to anyone who is curious about this classic genre. I am looking forward to reading more of Christie's books, and especially those featuring this comically brilliant detective."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"When I started this book I thought it was going to be a long summer.

He and his friend, Hastings, enjoy solving mysteries together. One day a letter comes in the mail forewarning the murder of a person in Andover. It was mysteriously signed by A.B.C.

Alexander Bonaparte Cust is his name, everyone believes he is the killer but Poirot is not as quick to assume that.This book is not for people with a small vocabulary. At some points the characters use French or Latin, I am not sure but still as confusing. The story line was great at first you don't have a clue to what is going on, but as the book progresses you start to understand the characters and who may be the murderers.All in all this is a great book, but as I said before is a hard to book to comprehend.

It was smart and an unexpected ending. I would never have guessed it would turn out this way! Thrilling and scary, it shows just how twisted yet sane a mind can be.

And don't let Christie fool you. She's always got another trick up her sleeve!"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"I really enjoy Agatha Christie books.

There appears to be no connection between any of the victims other than that the first letters of their names form an alphabetical sequence. Can the killer be a madman and what is the reason for his fixation? Poirot as usual is the middle of things, since the killer keeps writing him taunting letters before and after each crime. But that is where the murderer has made a mistake because Hercule Poirot is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery...An excellent book that is well plotted and pulls the different threads of the mystery together much more logically than in some of Christie's other works. Another nice touch is the return of Captain Hastings from South America, just in time to help solve the mystery.

Christie relies to heavily upon the charm of her detective to keep the reader interested, hoping they won't notice the slow, rather dull plotline. The characters other than Poirot are paper-thin.

Will Poirot, with the help of Captain Hastings, be able to stop this madman (or woman) before he/she gets to Z??Agatha Christie is an absolute genius when it comes to writing murder mysteries. She somehow manages to stump me every time. Sometimes I manage to luckily guess the murderer, but I'm clueless to the why. This isn't because of my own inability to guess the murderer. Trust me I have fairly good success record, no it's Agatha Christie herself. She is such a great author, that has the knack of throwing red herrings in the way and leaving me clueless. This was exactly the case with The ABC Murders.In The ABC Murders she does something unheard of. She gives the point of view from the supposed \\"murderer\\", and after all is said and done she says \\"well maybe that is not the murderer\\"!! This is clearly the work of someone that is not only a genius crime writer, but knows exactly how to keep her readers hanging off.I have not read a Agatha Christie mystery that I haven't enjoyed and this was the same with The ABC Murders. I listened to this one on audiobook, and I absolutely couldn't wait to the whodunit was solved.My love/hate relationship with Poirot continued on in this mystery. He is SO vain (and actually professes that he has the best moustache ever) and at times can be so mean to Captain Hastings, but oh he is brilliant!

This particular book is not a standout among Christie's work, but makes for nice entertainment. Very good narration as well."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"I'm a big Christie fan and have read and reread most of her books. Her tactics are usually subtle enough to not be in your face, but in this book, she really outdid herself... The good old trick of creating false suspense and making Poirot seem smart by making everybody else in the book absolutely stupid is especially apparent here. Usually poor old Hastings is the tool used, but in this book it seems like everybody is stupid and missing all the hints, asking obvious questions, and Hastings himself is just hopeless. By extension, it seems like she regards the reader as stupid as well, expecting him/her not to get her hints and breadcrumbs and just beating him/her over the head with things the reader is already a couple of steps ahead with. Feels like a cheap trick, and an insult to the reader's intelligence. To some extent this happens in most of her books actually, which is why I think they are just better suited to a younger and less experienced audience. There are a few absolute gems, of course, like And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express, but once you've read those, it will never be the same again; they just set the bar too high and the rest are plain disappointing by comparison."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Hercule Poirot is not having fun at this party.Our favorite little Belgian detective's little gray cells are most offended by the actions of the ABC killer. Why? Because this is, to use his term, a \\"public\\" murder. Messr.

In Mr. ABC Poirot encounters his first serial killer, and he is not happy. Freaked out is more like it, actually.ABC is following the train schedule (the \\"ABC Guide\\") and committing murders in cities starting with A and working through the alpahebet. The victims are random (perhaps?) people whose last name starts with the same letter as the city. Oh, and he taunts Poirot by telling him in advance the name of city and the date of the killing.

When an elderly woman, named Ascher, is found murdered in her little newsagent shop, Poirot and Hastings become involved in a case which is different to any they have faced before. It seems a homicidal maniac is striking victims at random, based only on the first letters of their name and the place that they live. An ABC railway guide is always placed on or near the vitim. As the bodies mount, the families and friends of the victims propose working with Poirot, to help solve the case.This novel shows why Agatha Christie is still the best crime writer of all time. The book may be set in the 1930's, but she has such an understanding of human nature and her plot and characters all stand the test of time. Her books never drag, are always immensely readable and Poirot - well, he is simply the best fictional detective ever created.

The second forecasted murder is of a waitress named Betty Barnard from Bexhill, and the third is Sir Carmichael Clarke from Churston. Gracious! Where will it all end? Will we get to Zachary Zimmerman from Zanzibar? Has Dame Agatha written the first serial killer novel?To say the least, Poirot is troubled. The little gray cells are working overtime.

His typewriter was used to type the insulting notes to Poirot. Open and shut? Poirot is not satisfied.\\"A.B.C.

She has some insights that would do a modern day \\"profiler\\" proud when Poirot speculates upon the nature of the murderer. The denouement is intricate, so much so, some readers might find it too clever by half (to quote our British friends).

One of his first stops is to see his dearest friend Hercule Poirot. The timing is perfect, as Poirot has been presented with one of his most unusual cases, a supreme exercise for the little grey cells.Apparently, a homicidial maniac is terrorizing England as he taunts Poirot with advance notice of the time and place of his next murder. Because the victims and towns they live in occur in alphabetical order (Mrs. Ascher is killed in Andover, Miss Barnard in Bexhill, Mr. Clarke in Churston, etc.) and because the killer leaves an ABC Railway Guide at each murder scene, the case becomes known as the the ABC murders.The set-up of this novel deviates from the normal Christie in that while Captain Hastings narrates the story as it has occurred, the reader is also privvy to the comings and goings of the rather strange Mr. Alexander Bonaparte Cust (notice the initials).The humor is rampant as Poirot and Hastings chide each other over Poirot's dyed hair, Hastings uncanny ability to see the obvious without realizing it, and the unabashed appreciation both men have for a beautiful woman. And even in the midst of murder and mayhem, Poirot has time to do a little matchmaking on the side.A box of hosiery, a dying woman's grasp of facts,a private murder concealed in a string of unrelated murders, and a meeting with the accused all climax in one of Poirot's most clever deductions as he solves this one and proclaims to his friend Hastings, \\"Vive le sport.\\""},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"The detective fiction book A.B.C.

Christie's book is such a thrilling and exciting book for many reasons. First, her writing style is unique, in that it excites you from the beginning of the book until the very end. Her style is wonderful because she writes with enthusiasm to keep you interested throughout the book. She grasps your attention in different ways and makes you keep on reading until the very end. Secondly, Christie describes the characters to the last detail, making sure every detail has importance in the conclusion of the murders. These facts tie together at the end, concluding the mystery with great strength and reassurance to the reader. Lastly, the atmosphere of the book is outstanding. Christie absorbs you into the book so well that you want to talk over the mystery with Poirot, as if you were there solving the case right along with him. This book is great because it makes you want to keep on reading and reading, with no end to the book. With absorbing writing, great characterization, and encouragement to read on, Agatha Christie has written yet another outstanding detective fiction."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Christie's A.B.C. Murders is a nice, readable, read-while-you-travel sort of mystery novel. It probably won't leave a lasting impression on you (I had to reread it myself before I wrote this review), and it doesn't stand out among many other other Christie books. If you're a Christie fan, as I am, you'll get to this one in due course. If you're new to the world of Agatha Christie and are looking for a first taste, I recommend \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" or \\"And then there were none\\" first.Still, there are a few nice little novelties in the plot and book that give it some character over other Poirot stories: First, the murderer sends a warning letter to Poirot before each murder, as a sort of challange to the detective to see if he can prevent them. In addition, the narration is different - jumping back and forth between Hastings telling the story first hand and occational third person narration. Another small point I found amusing is the Sherlock Holmes reference - possibly a small attempt by Christie to compare herself with England's other master mystery writer.Unfortunately, all of these devices have a limited impact on the plot. Christie throws a red herring at the reader that is so emphasized and overexposed that it has very little credibility and loses its effectiveness. Also, it seems as though much of the narration is filler, waiting for the next murder to take place. Characters spend way too much time talking about thinking about the murders, rather than actually doing any thinking about them. You get the sense that Christie is stalling, because she can't have any meaningful occurences between the murders, and she has to write _something_ or the book would be too short.Still, it's a Christie novel, so it can't be truely bad (ok, there's \\"Third Girl\\", but let's not talk about that). The story roles out nicely, the end is rather difficult to guess, and Poirot is Poirot, of course. As I've said, it's a nice read.

And so the murders follow. How do we know the crimes were comitted by A.B.C.? Because an A.B.C. railway guide is placed beside the corpse, opened up to the page of the towns where the victims were murdered. What is the motive of the crime? Is it simply a clever maniac who wants to get attention? Or is the murder carefully plotted with a reason behind?The A.B.C. was a very good book. The plot was exciting, and it keeps you turning the pages. I read this book in one day dying to find out who did the murder.But somehow the book seems unreal. And the ingenius theories of Hercule Poirot was always so hard to get. And Poirot never explains why he asks certain questions until the very end and sometimes the book was slow-going.

The plotting is even more ingenious than is usual for Christie; the story itself is a wonderful human drama about a lonely epileptic who is suspected of being a serial murderer.

The plot deals with a series of murders which seem to have a specific and clear pattern to them. The incredible thing about this book is that the reader is quite convinced that he knows what is going on and where the case is headed, up to about the halfway point, where the entire plot twists itself into a pretzel, and the reader is completely lost for a while (as is Hastings), until the shocking conclusion.

There are many funny moments with Poirot, Hastings, Inspector Japp, and another cocky inspector whom Poirot is forced to work with.

A.B.C. declares his intent to begin a series of killings and dares Poirot to stop him. Unbeknownst to Poirot, Alexander Bonaparte Cust ticks a name off a list and heads for the locale of the first murder. Poirot's &quot;little grey cells&quot; work overtime as the victims fall in alphabetical order.This book seemed a real departure from Christie's formula for Poirot mysteries. &quot;Ah, I thought, Christie is anticipating the 'Columbo' format, where the murderer is known from the outset.&quot; Another departure for Christie was the fact that three of the four eventual victims were nobodies. Christie's victims usually come from the elite upper crust.I followed the story with much interest. I have been involved in a number of serial homicide cases, and several plot themes rung true. The interminable &quot;task force&quot; meetings. The media frenzy. The warring egos of the investigators. Several things didn't ring true, however. The almost antiseptic nature of the murders. Serial homicides are usually messy. The varied modus operandi of the killer. (Blunt trauma, strangulation, knife). Most serial killers find a method that works and stick to it. For most serial killers, murder is a sort of hobby. There was no indication A.B.C. was deriving any sort of pleasure from the killings (other than the pleasure of thwarting Poirot).Alexander Bonaparte Cust is finally laid by the heels, and an airtight case is made against him. Poirot visits Cust and obtains a confession, then he gathers the friends and relatives of the victims to explain the murderer's motivation. One thing that the modern media loves to emote over is the motivation of the various serial killers they have glamorized. To me the explanation is simple enough, they enjoy killing. I therefore took a deep breath and waited for Poirot to give a psychobabble explanation.Boy was I surprised. You will be, too. A.B.C.'s motivation was astonishing.

I think it's because Poirot seems to finally met his match and was clueless even up to the second half of the book!

This one is excellent.Poirot and Hastings are back together in this mystery. The book starts with Poirot receiving a note indicating that something will happen to someone whose name begins with \\"A\\" in Andover on a given date. The something of course is murder and the chase is on as the murderer proceeds deeper and deeper into the alphabet.Atypical of Christie's works is that the murderer calls his shots in advance. As can be expected, there is the typically fine sleuthing. Unexpected, however, best describes the ending.A fun read and highly recommend. Poirot is at the top of his game and is his usual immodestly engaging self."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"The mystery suspense novel the A.B.C. Murders, written by Agatha Christie, isa well-rounded book. Her ability to make you want to keep reading the book makes you not want to put it down. She forms the characters in great detail, never giving you too much or too little information on any one character. Agatha makes the books environment such that it feelsas if you are right there, trying to solve the murder's mystery right along withHercule Poirot, the great detective portrayed in the book. She can at times write in a way that may get you confused but her realism makes you press on because its so interesting. First, her writing style isunique, I cant really describe it i just know i haven't ever read another book written in this style. Her style is enthusiastic and keeps you interested in the book. She catches your attention in differentways and makes you keep on reading until the very end. She also describes the characters to the last detail, making sure every detail hasimportance in the conclusion of the murders. All the seemingly unnecessary character details seemlessly tied together at the end concluding the mystery with great strength and reassurance to thereader. Lastly, the atmosphere of the book is really great. She makes it seem very realistic and when the story is over you feel as though you should be able to turn and talk to Hercule about the mystery.The ABC Murders is great because it makes you want to keep on reading and reading, with no skimming to the end of the book. With interesting writing, great detail, and enthusiasm to read on, Agatha Christie has written yet another outstanding detective fiction to add to her collection"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"Hercule Poirot, the famous detective, receives letters which warn of a coming murder. The towns and last-names of the assasined are arranged in alphabetical order. First, a merchant, then a maid, and then an archaeologist, are killed.

The characters are well-rounded, and the threads of the plot lead through the mystery until ends meet at the end. Good entertainment."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"&amp;#65279; Alex Folkenflik. THE A.B.C. MURDERS.I found the A.B.C. murders to be interesting and enthralling. The ending had a definite surprise ending. It was definitely interesting because of the interesting point of view she creates from the \\"Watson\\" wanna be Hastings who continually gives signs that he has a crime hungry personality when he is with his friend, the great detective Poirot. He has come back to England when thedetective is near to retiring but he won't get to without one more homicidal maniac, who is on the rampage gets put behind bars. At the news of this psychotic yet flashy killer Hastings is ecstatic but as the case rolls on, he gets somewhat discouraged. The way the author uses the literary devices of a red herring are ingenious while the murderers motive is one of the most well thought of in detective fiction the many suspects and acts of the police and Poirot fool you to put that possibility away. Then there's the way the author keeps you interested in the book. By using a homicidal maniac, you're always reading for the next murder while the questions of who, when, why, and how are constantly surging through your head. Then when the detective starts to accuse the murderer it doesn't stop there you want to hear the details. Was the victim old and defenseless or young and struggling? One more interesting factor is while you wait for the next murder, you get to hear the thinking process of Poirot which sounds much like Sherlock Holmes. The analysis of the criminal's mind and features just from a few clues and victims are amazing. I would give this two bloodied thumbs up."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"A Hercule Poirot mystery, murders are being committed in alphabetical order by name of the victim and by station stop according to the alphabetical listing in the Guide to British railways. Poirot's faithful partner Captain Hastings provides the narrative of the case, with additional chapters included containing information Hastings wouldn't know about. Fortunately the case is solved by Poirot before the killer can get beyond the letter \\"D.\\" The case is a good one and has everyone stumped for quite a while. Alexander Cust, who becomes a prime suspect after being seen washing blood from his sleeve, is an interesting character. A movie of the book, which took many liberties and poked fun at Poirot, appeared in 1966 starring Tony Randall; it got only fair reviews."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"It is difficult to write a review of Christie's work, as any hint of the plot could give away a clue. So I'll just say that this is one of her best. I liked it better than &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; but not quite as well as &quot;The Clocks&quot;. This book didn't have as much suspense as that novel; there was quite a bit of lag time. Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot, is annoying until you get used to him, which I am starting to, so first time Christie readers may like to start off with a non-Poirot novel.I read Christie hoping to really unravel the mystery everytime before it is revealed. Once again, Christie beat me to it!

Or is your favorite game of all time Clue? Well this book makes you feel like you're the detective. A series of murders occur and no one knows who the series of murders, so you get a good idea of what it is like to be at the crime scene.This book is filled with suspense and all different kinds of surprises. Hercule Poirot receives a letter in the mail from a person by the name of ABC telling him that there is going to be a murder in Andover. So Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings head off to Andover to see what they can do.The victim's name is Mrs. Asher. The murder weapon is unknown but they know she died form a hard hit to the head. The only clue left behind is an ABC railway guide on top of the counter with the page opened to Andover.A second letter arrives to Hercule Poirot on the 23rd, saying that there is going to be a second murder in Bexhill on the 25th of the month. So Hastings and Hercule Poirot are off to try and see if they can stop the murder from occurring. Apparently they are too late. \\"The body of a young girl has been found on the beach at Bexhill. She had been identified as Elizabeth Barnard waitress in one of the cafes, who lived with her parents in a little recently built bungalow. Medical evidence gave the time of death as between 11.30 and 1 Am\\" said Hercule Poirot when explaining the murder to Capatain Hastings on the morning of the 25th. Yet again another Railway guide is found at the crime scene but this time it is under the body. The page is opened to the place where the crime happens, just like the first murder.The detectives get suspicious about the ABC patters and then they talk to someone who gives them a clue on who the murderer might be. His name is Alexander Bonaparte Cust (ABC). His name fits perfect into the pattern of alphabet occurring murders.The next few murders throw an exciting twist into the story. And there turns out to be a very shocking ending. If you want to know who the murderer is and if these crimes will end you will have to read the book to find out the rest!by:jena herner"},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"One of the foremost rules of the prestigious Detection Club (to which Christie later became President, following D. L. Sayers) was that there should be no copying of other authors' plots - actually, both Christie and H. R. F. Keating (both Presidents of the Detection Club) used plots from other authors - e.g. &quot;Is Skin-deep, Is Fatal&quot; ... and this one. While the book is not badly constructed and is amusing, it is definitely uninspired. There is a book by Anthony Berkeley entitled &quot;The Silk Stocking Murders&quot; (1928) in which Roger Sheringham (c.f. &quot;The Layton Court Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Poisoned Chocolates Case&quot;, &quot;The Second Shot&quot;, &quot;Jumping Jenny&quot;, etc.) solves the murders of a group of prostitutes and society beauties, all of whom have been hanged by a silk stocking (hence the title). The main gimmick in each book is virtually the same - I will not ruin it, but it may be said that the use of the framed/obvious suspect, the group of victims' relatives trying to find the killer are all the same. And what is more: in Christie's book, there is a character with the name of Alexander Bonaparte Cust (Anthony Berkeley Cox...), who has something to do with silk stockings. My verdict: Avoid this one, and read Berkeley's novel, if you can find a copy."},{"Title":"THE ABC MURDERS.","review":"I think that this was a good book.

My personal favorites, though, are Murder on the Links, Five Little Pigs, and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

To me, Hastings really represents the reader. He is baffled by certain clues and always assumes the odvious while Poirot always looks for the details in things. Although this is not my favorite Agatha Christie, it keep me on the edge of my seat. I especially like the narratives of ABC.

I think he is the best turf writer alive today. I would never have guessed that he had anything to do with this book. There isn't any Steve Haskin in this book and that may be good because that means this book is Bob Baffert. Also it isn't written like most biographies I have read.

To see what Baffert accomplished there is a list of Baffert stakes winners in the back of the book going back to 1984 that blow you away. I'm hard to impress but was by this endless list of winners. This astounding success over many years (and one could argue an unmatched record) implies someone particularly good in his field. Or, is he? Dissapointingly, there is very little in \\"Dirt Road\\" beyond a smidgeon as to how Baffert actually trains, feeds, shoes, vets, exercises and conducts his horses. There is so little of this in the book you wonder if the fellow ever actually goes to the barn.Instead this story seems more the boon on hobbknobbing with the wealthy and selling horseracing to susceptible marks, useful talents to be sure, but what does this have to do with training horses? I was unable to escape certain sections of the book in forming opinions on Baffert--his father always under the influence of alcohol, a trait seemingly passed on to the children; social skills evolved as a boy selling door to door his father's eggs, but, never blinking an eye that the money came from chickens imprisoned in tiny cages in the Baffert backyard. Though Baffert professes attachment to a horse or two here or there, treating animals as livestock backgrounds this whole saga. Animals as a means to an end, ignorning basic animal needs while using those animals for their own self-promotion and profit is difficult to ignore in the story of Bob Baffert. We may take our hats off to Baffert's success but his book fails to answer the question whether the success is horse training or salesmanship."},{"Title":"Baffert Dirt Road to the Derby","review":"Thank goodness the author didn't fill this book with a bunch of useless data...there's plenty of that in most other books on thoroughbred horse racing. My favorite parts were when Mr. Baffert opens up and tells the stories of his misadventures growing up and the adventures of today. Another reviewer complained that the author used the \\"I\\" too much, but considering that \\"BAFFERT\\" is in the largest type on the dust jacket, I would expect the book to be about him.

What was frustrating reading the book is that the too few examples and anecdotes don't really clarify and strengthen the author's arguments. As a clinical psychiatrist John Ratey uses real-life examples, but often these individuals suffered from so many issues that Ratey's narrative and diagnosis felt too simple and lame. Moreover, Ratey could have explained real world applications for his insights and explanation of the way the mind works. In the last chapter, he does offer constructive advice (exercise, be passionate about what you do, etc.), but by then the advices feels trite and not relevant. Some of Ratey's suggestions - have babies listen to Mozart -- are not grounded in scientific fact. His suggestion that children who are exposed to more vocabulary do better in school shows his sometimes sloppy, unscientific reasoning (scientists know that stimuli is like vitamins - you need a certain amount of it, but too much of it will do you no good).The book was first published in 2002, and since then many better neuroscience books have entered the market.

It seemed interesting, my dad was footing the bill, i bought it. The next few pages caused me to realize that it was actually a book with plenty of scientific facts. And they were freaking interesting. Did you know, that the reason why americans advertise ICE COLD beer is because they wanted to numb your taste buds so that the beer would taste good? Warm beer sucks, doesn't it? Did you know, that things with motion need brains? That's why there's this squid, that has a brain and vertebrae when it is younger and in a tadpole state. Once it matures and attaches itself to something, it quits moving and self digests it's own brain. This book is filled to the brim with facts. It shows, through plenty of real life examples, plenty about specific parts about the brain. And as the title states, it really is a users guide to the brain.

Perception as a reward and the nature of that process is covered in detail. Though there is no 'alcohol' gene, there has been research that implicates an area in the brain called the nucleus accumbens. Scientists label the low dopamine condition in alcoholics, ADHD, Tourettes and OCD as 'reward deficiency syndrome.' As such we come closer to understanding and treating compulsive drinking, speeding and other drug addictions. AA's have always said that certain people are born \\"a pint short,\\" and the current theories substantiate that metaphor.The taste sense, we are told, is highly dependent on smell and the taste buds are within the realm of evolutionary biology. They enabled survival because they inform the condition of the food. Bitter, for example, tells whether the food is rotten and if, therefore, it could sicken and kill the eater. Sound and vision are more interrelated than is commonly considered- try playing ping pong without hearing the sounds that name the game.The other areas of the book, the theaters of the mind, etc. were less striking for me, but also important to anyone attempting to integrate all of these findings into their own conceptual meaning. The last part on nourishment and exercise as integral to maintaining the physique of the mind is also repetitive but validating to all the admonishments to exercise and eat well. Ratey's book is clear, informed and worthwhile. It lacks what I found impressive in LeDoux's The Emotional Brain, and that is a theme that runs almost like an uncovering, a plot, that was true but spellbinding. Still, the 'tidbits' were new to this reader at least and as such, I will reread this volume, perhaps several times."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"&quot;A User's Guide to the Brain&quot; dwells on two main themes about the brain. The first, 'use it or lose it' is familiar to most people. The second, that virtually everything the brain does can be related to bodily motion, is intriguing, and is supported by example and analogy. Sadly, it is supported in this book by little else. There is no documentation included here, and Ratey frequently makes important statements without supporting them with examples or research. Regardless of the quality of the ideas, this makes much of the book suspect.In the introduction, Ratey writes:&quot;Although metaphor and analogy are unconventional in scietific circles, I am firmly convinced that a more nonlinear kind of thought will eventually supplant much of the logical reasoning we use today...Our troubled world, too, is becoming too complex for logical argumentation, and may have to change its thinking: real trust, when emotions are running high, is based on analogy, not calculation.&quot;Ratey is right to recognize the importance of emotions in our lives and in society, but hundreds of years of scientific research have shown us the utility of logical reasoning. Metaphor and analogy are useful, but they need to be used as a complement to logical reasoning, controlled studies and peer-reviewed research, not in their place.Despite the book's obvious flaws, the last chapter, &quot;Care and Feeding&quot; provides advice on nurturing one's brain that is probably valuable. The concepts are not complex: stay active mentally and physically, maintain a healthy diet, and provide new challenges and stimulus for your brain throughout your life."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"Having a profound interest in the brain and its development, I picked up this book expecting to learn some about the brain and its incredible capabilities. I came out with more knowledge out of this book than I could have ever expected. The author covers so many different topics and is able to simply explain all of them so well that I had trouble putting the book down.The book was a great read from start to finish and does a good job of keeping the reader interested using little facts and tidbits that make the reader want to turn the page to find out more. From these tidbits, the author usually progresses to real life examples to better make his point. This helped for me to be consumed by the book as I read it and wanted to read more to keep learning more.The book has 10 chapters: Development, Perception, Attention and Consciousness, Movement, Memory, Emotion, Language, The Social Brain, The Four Theaters, and Care and Feeding. Each chapter has its own descriptions, analogies and case subjects. The author does of good job of progressing through the brain from the beginning of the book, but if the reader chooses to skip any section, they will not miss any important concepts that will impair the reading of the rest of the book.The author organizes the book into several different functions associated with the brain and goes through and talks about the main concepts related to those functions. The author gives many examples of problems associated with these neural concepts and how they are based in the brain's biology. Although there is some biological descriptions throughout the book out of necessity, the book is geared towards the average reader. The author explains from the introduction that the language and terminology associated with neuroscience can only be understood by a certain few individuals, and because of this, he tries to \\"dumb down\\" the language in the book in order to allow the average reader to understand all of the new and exciting findings in the field of neuroscience.One of the most interesting chapters of the book was the first chapter: Development. From the start, I was shocked to learn how plastic the brain can truly be. Learning about how an autistic woman was able to teach herself how to be more socially \\"normal\\" was an incredible story in how knowledge and hard work can help overcome even the most challenging of tasks. The author goes on and describes the challenges encountered throughout the developmental process of the brain and how many of these disrupt the brain and help in the creation of neural disorders.The chapter about perception was an incredible eye opener into how our brain can dictate our lives, even if all of our other organs work perfectly. \\"Every Psychology 101 course begins with a chapter on perception, which usually mystifies freshmen. \`Why study how information enters the mind,' they wonder, \`when we are really interested in what happens to it afterward?' The young, introspective, answer-seeking students in search of self-discovery get pretty turned off by lectures about pigeons' and rats' vision and hearing. Instructors even apologize for having to teach perception in the first place, and ask students to be patient while they rush through it so they can get to \`the good stuff' of psychology, like Freud and sex, drugs, ad rock-\`n'-roll.\\" Page54 The example of how a girl's life fell apart and was diagnosed as schizophrenic only because her vision was distorted was an amazing story of how something as simple as a slight distortion in vision can completely change a person's life.In Attention and Consciousness, the author takes a little more in depth view into the brain and how many different structures work together to help you stay alert throughout the days. He explains how and why the mind is able to filter different stimuli depending on what you are paying attention to in order to focus on certain things rather than having to digest the entire world around you at one moment. \\"Reaction to stimuli, ongoing talk between neurons, and predictive maps of the world all work together to create consciousness. Before we can be conscious of something, however, we have to pay attention to it.\\" (114) Movement goes on to describe how intricately intertwined movement is to all the other brain functions and how it isn't a \\"lower\\" brain function at all. Movement itself is entwined with certain brain disorders that are caused not by normal mental dysfunction but by problems with movement circuits in the brain.From there the author moves on to Memory and Emotion chapters. In Memory, he describes how memories can be very subjective depending on how the person experiences them, and that when two people share different sides of the story, it isn't that one is right or wrong, it is that both experienced the event differently. He goes on to explain how the storage of memories is affected and how memories can actually be \\"falsified\\" if the person can truly imagine themselves having done the action. In Emotion, it is described how a person's state of being and emotion can completely consume their entire lives. Those with highly active emotions can react abnormally and extremely to normal stimuli that most would not even notice.In the Language chapter, it is described how the acquisition of language can affect the overall development of the brain and how we learn things. The debate over whether language is \\"born or bred\\" into our brains at is addressed and how there is no accepted answer to how language came about. Language leads to the development of The Social Brain, where brain injuries that lead to decreased social skills are addressed. It is examined how certain cases had brain injuries where normal body function was retained, but due to damages to social function, the subject was unable to function normally in society and normally ended up jobless and alone. The author talks about the different sections of the brain and how the development of each leads to success for humans as social creatures.The book ends with two chapters that first represent \\"thoughts developed over many years and contributed\\" by two of the author's associates and finishes with a chapter of tips and tricks of how to keep your brain active and healthy and explains his \\"use it or lose it\\" philosophy behind the brain.I recommend this book for readers looking for an interesting view into the human brain and the many wonders associated with it. The book does a good job of covering a broad range of topics and explaining them well and in simple enough language for those not learned in neuroscience to understand. For those looking for an in depth biological explanation behind the disorders, this is not the book for you. All in all, I recommend this book as a good read to those interested in neuroscience."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"Making yourself more aware of the brain will expand your capabilities in using it.

It doesn't go into details about how to cope with these kind of issues, but gives a great understanding of the \\"how\\" it was possible for these issues to be derived in the first place. It is not a book for disorders nor does it give advice. It simply helps you understand how the brain works from infancy onward.

I was excited to dig in to this book but keep wondering when the concepts (The &quot;theaters&quot;) would develop into a cohesive thesis. The level of detail of brain anatomy detracted rather than aided the presentation. I also found the copious analogies to be somewhat digressive and awkward.

I barely got past the introduction. While the book is advertised to present the latest finding the author decides that most current brain models are too influenced by cognitive science and determines that the brain is &quot;analog&quot; by which he means it works in analogies! His introduction says he will therefore talk about the brain largely in analogies and metaphors. The author even claims this type of discourse will replace much of the logical reasoning we use today. The few sections I looked into are full of loose language and a singular lack of scientific rigor.

The old paradigms are crumbling under the onslaught of a new understanding of how the brain really works. Harvard Medical School psychiatrist John J. Ratey's \\"guide\\" (it's more than that) is an admirable exercise in bringing us up to date on what is happening in brain science--what we suspect, what we know, and how this knowledge is affecting clinical practice.In a sense Ratey's book is a report on a new paradigm. It is biology-based and relies first and foremost on the physiology of the brain and body as they have developed over time. Gone are the artificial constructs of Freudian psychology and the very limited black-box psychology of behaviorism. The new psychology is based on opening that black box and looking inside. Of course what we find there is enormously complex, and we are, to use Ratey's expression (p. 124), \\"still on the first step of a very long staircase.\\" Yet, because of the growing power of neuroscience to study and access the living brain in ways that were impossible just a few years ago, we are entering an exciting time, full of hope and wonder.As Dr. Ratey explains in \\"Acknowledgments,\\" this book began as a cooperative research effort by many people toward writing a \\"primer on the brain for mental health professionals.\\" Then it was suggested by Pantheon editor Linda Healey that a smaller version \\"that would try to instruct the public at large\\" be written. A professional science writer, Mark Fischetti, was hired and schooled. The result is a book written in an engaging and very readable manner. However, its organization--neat and reasonable as it is--actually detracts from the book's effectiveness because the most interesting and helpful chapters are near the end. I realize that Ratey and his editors and writers came to the conclusion that the material in the last three chapters, \\"The Social Brain,\\" \\"The Four Theaters,\\" and \\"Care and Feeding\\" could be better appreciated after having read the more fundamental material in the first seven chapters. Nonetheless I believe that a lot of people who would benefit from this very fine book will not get to those chapters. Too bad. Ratey's metaphor of the four theaters is a powerful tool for incorporating and understanding the new paradigm, while the final chapter gives us some very excellent advice on how to live fully while keeping the brain and our systems healthy.Consequently I would propose that when Dr. Ratey updates this book (and I hope he will; there is so much happening in neuroscience that some of the information here will be dated in just a few years) that he structure the book so that it begins with Chapter 9, \\"The Four Theaters,\\" followed by Chapter 8, \\"The Social Brain,\\" and then the first seven chapters, concluding with the advice in Chapter 10, \\"Care and Feeding.\\" For the reader, I recommend reading Chapter 9 first so that you can immediately share in the excitement that is at the heart of the book.The \\"theaters,\\" by the way, should be understood as \\"theaters of operations\\" and not theaters where movies might be shown. (Originally Ratey had used \\"kingdoms of the brain\\" as his metaphor.) The theaters are (1) perception; (2) attention, consciousness and cognition; (3) brain function (memory, emotion, movement, etc.); and (4) behavior and identity. He sees a flow of consequence (like a river) from perception to attention to function to behavior. He argues persuasively that the brain is a holistically operating entity that is constantly being changed by its interaction with the environment, a dynamic organism that is forever learning, making new perceptions and adjustments. Things can go wrong in any one of the theaters and what happens in any theater affects the other theaters down river (and even up river). What I found particularly interesting is the new approach to diagnostics and therapy this understanding affords. A good example is on pages 347-349 where Ratey tells the story of Theresa who was slow to learn, unsocial and awkward in sports. Instead of some disorder out of DSM-IV being plastered on her forehead, Ratey found that she had a perception problem, and he demonstrated how her social and functional problems stemmed from that \\"first theater\\" problem. Ratey emphasizes freeing the patient from self-doubt and personal blame for whatever the problem may be, and always looks for a biological cause first. Some bits of wisdom from the best chapter in the book, from pages 353-355:\\"Modern medical practice tends to regard patients' self-evaluations as too tainted by subjectivity, but this is a grave error.\\"\\"It is quite beyond the average patient's ability, within the framework of...insight-oriented therapies, to pinpoint the true source of unhappiness and frustration.\\"\\"Prozac is hardly a remedy for the self-blame, lost opportunities, and intellectual insecurity of a lifetime compromised by unrecognized perceptual and cognitive deficits.\\"\\"We have to begin to think of the brain as a self-organizing ecosystem, one of such staggering complexity and delicate balance that almost any aspect of a patient's life may be relevant to a diagnosis or essential to treatment.\\"\\"[T]he clinician's duty...includes devoting more time to looking for what is good in patients' lives, for the strengths and talents that are not yet being fully realized, and for the secret pleasures and sources of happiness that they have never allowed themselves.\\"\\"We in psychiatry continually risk mistaking our labels for the disorders themselves.\\"\\"The brain's processes can be utterly transformed by self-discovery and the right pursuits in life.\\"--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\""},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"Do yourself a favor and read this book.

Another example, Rickie, is the daughter of an eminent psychiatrist who was frequently hospitalized for schizophrenia until it was discovered that this diagnosis was simply incorrect. Instead, Rickie suffered from an unusual perceptual problem which could be sufficiently remedied with special glasses so that she could begin a career as a rehabilitation counselor and also marry and raise children.

Let's face it: for such a dynamic organ, most of the books written about the brain tend to be better at curing insomnia than at providing useable information. &quot;I have decided,&quot; writes Ratey in the introduction, &quot;that I will have to replace much of the technical language about the brain with a language more akin to what the brain itself uses.&quot; Ratey should be commended for his ability to translate. The book is still full of technical information, presented in analogies and metaphores that are easily understood. Personal stories provide a very human feel.Ratey divides the brain into four theatres: Perception, Attention/Consciousness, Function, and Identity/Behavior. Each of these are explained and illustrated, with attention given to each areas specialty. Most interesting is his pairing of Attention and Consciousness. According to Ratey, these two are intertwined and may actually be the same thing. This is remarkable because we don't know that much about consciousness, yet understanding it is essential to understanding ourselves. &quot;After all,&quot; Ratey says, &quot;without consciousness little else that the brain could do would matter.&quot;As a person with ADHD, I found this link between consciousness and attention very interesting.

This is a very dense book, yet it is not boring. The author, a Harvard psychiatry professor, states at the beginning that he is writing this book for everyone and that everyone will be able to understand it. He does a good job of explaining all of the complex concepts, of which there are many in connection with the study of the brain.The book is an up-to-date explanation of the current knowledge and research about the brain. The new knowledge deepens our understanding and adds insights into brain function and its affect on our lives. The more we know about how the brain works, the better we can understand the problems caused by malfunctions in the brain. Numerous case studies are presented to show how new knowledge has helped us better understand specific brain problems that might have been previously categorized or \\"lumped\\" into some almost unrelated illness. In some cases, new knowledge helped the patient to solve debilitating problems and lead a much improved life.Ratey goes into a lot of detail. In the chapter on perception, he explains that the nostrils are placed above and close to the mouth to help us avoid eating poisonous things, even if we don't realize the danger until the very last possible moment before putting the item into our mouth. He includes lots of similar little tidbits of information that seem like standard knowledge but are new; I know I never learned them! We should all know everything in this book! A new finding about learning can help everyone. Researchers at Johns Hopkins recently found that learning a new motor skill is solidified best if the skill is learned and then practiced again after 5 or 6 hours, with no further new skill learning in between. I sent this bit of news to my college daughter who is learning to play the piano!Ratey seems to cover all the newest studies on a wide range of aspects of the brain. He goes into detail about the parts of the brain responsible for various functions. The major sections of the book are development, perception, attention and consciousness, movement, memory, emotion, language, and the social brain. There is a lot of discussion about the amygdala in the sections on emotions. I feel that I would need to reread some of this to understand it thoroughly, as parts of the brain are mentioned which I previously knew nothing about, ie, the anterior cingulate gyrus, which plays key roles in emotions. The neurotransmitters are given their due, too, though medications are not discussed in detail.Ratey stops short of chemical terms with subscripts (those gamma chemicals), which is where I usually become overwhelmed. I can absorb the information in this book with effort. I think that a psychiatrist would find this book a useful way to glean a summary of the current status of the research on the brain. I think a psychiatrist should want to know everything in this book! Some sections and even some short passages might be of particular interest to some patients, too. For someone with a strong medical/psychiatric background and interest in the subject, this well-written book might be a worthwhile page-turner, with important new information and clarification of emerging concepts."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"Just shy of 400 pages this is a book I want the smart women to read. Yes, men should read it to, but I simply feel that as a woman some people, often other women are put off by women with great brains.Ten Chapters that cover Development, Perception, Attention and Consciousness, Movement, Memory, Emotion, Language, The Social Brain, The Four Theatres, Care and Feeding.And his notation beginning on page 114 about the Triage mind as medical professionals often say we (we who are in the circle of friends and colleagues) have, is about Arouse, Orient, Detect, Execute is utterly engrossing. And on page 251 where he speaks of the popular fad of Emotional intelligence as an attract concept because it can provide a convenient scapegoat for today's epidemics of violent crime, marital strife and teen age drug abuse as a start, is wise and telling.On page 274 he gives a simple lateralization concept test that the reader can take to see how the right and left brain react differently to action combined with verbal work. Was happy to see that the suggestion of a trusted friend that I was equally righ-left brained was true (laughing) and that yes, I am linguistically ambidextrous as well.In discussing the Four Theatres he also reminds the reader that it is regaining popularity amongst medical professionals. The First being Perception, the Second is Attention and Consciousness and issues involving Cognitive issues like survival skills. The Third is Brain Function and the Fourth is Identity and Behavior.In Care and Feeding he speaks about the real importance of reading to children at an early age and continuing to read books etc that challenge the brain and not simply fill it with mush.And exercise! On page 359 he gives some excellent insight into how important exercise is to a healthy min. And as he notes &quot;Obviously, exercise improves the body, but some of the most exciting new findings point to the positive effect exercise can have on mental health. First of all, it increases the amount of blood that gets to the brain. And it has been shown that it can augment the number and density of the blood vessels in the areas that need them the most: the motor cortex and cerebellum. Thus, in addition to its well-known effect of increasing blood vessels and improving circulation in the heart, it seems that exercise or activity has a similar effect on the brain.&quot;Better self-esteem he notes is also a known effect of exercise and that females of all ages who regularly take part in sports and exercise have a more positive self image and less depression as well.He then notes there have been more than 1,000 studies on the effect on mental health. That short sessions of vigorous aerobic exercise, usually lasting for several weeks seem to have the most helpful effect on moderate to mild forms of depression. He notes a 1994 Harvard study that found men who burn 2500 calories a day in aerobic activity which can be running walking fast, etc., were 28% less likely to develop clinical depression than less active men.He also notes that vigorous exercise also involves learning complex movements that also challenge the brain. And then on page 316 he speaks of the importance of movement in general, and how it effects motor skills. And that inactivity and stagnation can hasten the decline of mental abilities.And lastly he speaks of mental work outs and how important it is to think outside the box and read things that are different and that will cause the neurons to work. That people who are doing new things and trying new things, constantly reading and not watching TV or staying in ones comfort zone are the ones who live the fullest and mentally healthiest lives."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"Before reading this book I did know not very much about the brain. Dr Ratey's analogies and metaphors were very well thought out and helped me to understand the brain and the way it works in a way I had never understood it before. Thanks for making such a difficult and complicated subject so clear!"},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"\\"A User's Guide to the Brain\\" is an intriguing essay on the mind, as the subtitle implies: Perception, Attention and the Four Theatres of the Brain. Written in 2001, the 401 pages over ten chapters is more of Dr. Ratey's personal memoirs and anecdotes written in the first person than a medically written essay without any interjected opinions or afterthoughts, which is more of what I was hoping to find. Dr. Ratey, however, makes several claims and refers to several papers without the much needed citations that allow the reader to follow in the doctor's footsteps.For example, on page 109, Dr. Ratey states, \\"There are countless reports in history about people with an extraordinary ability to know where they are going: pathfinders, guides, mariners, pioneers...\\" Being more of a general statement, it would not be reasonable for the reader to expect the author to cite the \\"countless reports,\\" but in the next paragraph, Dr. Ratey states, \\"Joseph Kirschvink and researchers at the California Institute of Technology have identified the same kind of magnetite particles in human brain tissue.\\" At the end of this statement, a footnote or an endnote should follow immediately, or at least an APA reference that allows the reader to investigate the claim further. It seems that the author's unwillingness to cite his sources means he expects his readers to believe whatever he says, and I understand I make take a few unhelpfuls for that, but when it comes to making a claim about a study, find or statistic, professional writing demands that such claims be backed up with a footnote, endnote or bibliographic reference. For general knowledge, a writer could do it all day long. But with medial science, no way.Another example of a missing citation: page 263, paragraph 2. \\"Researchers Jenny Saffran and colleagues at the University of Rochester reveal a study showing that infants' learning ability may greatly exceed previous expectations.\\" Which study? No reference, no citation, no follow-up possible.On page 373: \\"One recent advance that seems straight out of science fiction is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)...Twelve patients diagnosed with OCD were given the stimulation at several different points on their skulls. The patients found that stimulation to the frontal lobe on the right side of the head resulted in a reduction in compulsions and an improved mood.\\" Right there, at the end of that sentence, there needs to be a citation or link to the aforementioned \\"transcranial magnetic stimulation.\\"--otherwise, as the author states, it might just _be_ science fiction. It's not? No? Then cite the source. In the very next statement, Dr. Ratey even mentions indirectly that his omissions are intentional: \\"More research needs to be completed before we truly understand the possibilities of this new technology.\\" Dr. Ratey, it is your job as the writer to do that research. The reader's job is to be excited with your presentation and follow your work, not to do your work for you.The missing citations are more of the fault of the editors at Pantheon books. I'm surprised the manuscript ever got past the senior editor. Until the myriad of missing citations are put into a revised first edition of \\"A User's Guide to the Brain,\\" unfortunately, Dr. Ratey's work here cannot be accepted as conclusive. To avoid work, Dr. Ratey included a \\"suggested reading\\" list in the back, which conveniently frees him of his responsibility as an author. This type of text would be much improved and vastly more accepted if it were strictly a third person narrative. Otherwise, it's mostly hearsay, although we would like to believe Dr. Ratey has no intention to deceive his audience, credibility demands that no non-general claims are left unsubstantiated."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"Honestly, I expected a dry, but informative book. John J. Ratey takes on neuropsychology with stories and examples that anyone can understand. Diversity, folks, includes more than just race, gender, and age.

If you took a course in perception or physiological psychology or physiology - or if you did self-study in these areas, skip this book and go on to something less broad.

The brain has many parts which work together in changing combinations to perform various functions. The book has many diagrams explaining these facts. Many similarities of other animals to humans are explained. Also, how the brain affects behavior and is affected by it.

This book is awe inspiring when talking about the marvelous mechanisms at play and the grandeur of our brains.This was the first book on neurosciences that I read and it proved a very good and complete introduction to the topic. The book is extensive and covers a wide range of aspects. I would not regard it as a user's guide to the brain, since it definitely is not a \\"How to use your brain...\\" book. Advise and recommendations for the care of your brain are scarce and only to be found in the last chapters.I would say that it is a comprehensive science book that outlines and summarizes the investigations done in neurosciences. I know too little on this subject to say this, but the topics that I have read in other books are covered at least briefly in this one. Starting with this book, you can read more detail on any brain function or process that you are interested in.This book introduces perception and the 5 senses, attention and consciousness, memory (long and short lived), motion, mathematical and musical abilities, language, emotions, etc. along with several clinical cases in each section which lead to a better understanding of how the various parts of the brain work and interact.It is a long and sometimes difficult to read book, but every bit of it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"This book is EXCELLENT!

Thanks, Dr. Ratey!"},{"Title":"A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain","review":"This book is a fascinating insight into how the brain is elastic and its constant need to be stimulated. Unfortunately the author probably left out some important details on recent scientific discoveries in terms of how our brains can be further nurtured.An example of this is no mention of the Omega 3 nutrient which scientifically has been documented as being an essential fatty acid for the brain from the beginning of our lives to the end. The notion that eating fish is brain food has been around for centuries.There also have been other interesting studies done such as the stimulation of the brain during pregnancy and the fact that child bearing mothers have a dramatic increase in their IQ after giving birth, probably as a natural defense mechanism.Although the author touches on the relationship between exercise and healthy brain function, in my opinion there could have been more data included.However this was a very intriguing book, and very hard to put down.

It reads smoothly--much like Seidensticker's translation of The Tale of Genji, and strikes college students as even more compelling. I have used it in classes on Japanese History through literature and Gender and Sexuality in Japanese History with excellent results; students find it hard to put down once they understand the basic plot. The two siblings Chunagon and Naishi no kami are respectively a female who conceptualizes herself as male, and a male who thinks he's really a girl. Born to an artistocratic family in the capital of Heian, they receive the sympathy of their parents, who attribute their sexual orientation issues to their accumulated karma from past lives. Chunagon is allowed to enter courtly society as a male, while her brother enters the service of an imperial princess as a lady-in-waiting. Misfortune strikes when Chunagon, fighting off the homosexual advances of a male friend, is exposed as female--a surprising but not unpleasant development so far as her bisexual friend is concerned. She becomes pregnant and must hide out until she can give birth before resuming a male identity. Meanwhile the princess is with child by her lady-in-waiting. The tale is deeply pyschological, lacking the element of farce in Shakespeare's plays about sexual identity; one genuinely feels for the plight of Chunagon in particular. Classical Japanese often omits the subject; Willig necessarily must provide it. She chooses to refer to Chunagon as &quot;he&quot; through most of the text, and to Kami no Naishi as &quot;she.&quot; This is a brilliant touch, hightening the reader's awareness of the tragedy of the siblings' plight. Unltimately the plight is resolved in a thoroughly unexpected fashion. The Changelings is a window into ancient Japanese sexuality. It would be improved, perhaps, by some pages of footnotes explaining aspects of Heian society; but if read alongside a work like Ivan Morris' The World of the Shining Prince, provides invaluable insight into the history of gender and sexuality."},{"Title":"The Changelings: A Classical Japanese Court Tale","review":"The Changelings is a 12th century novel in a style popular after The Tale of Genji, yet is a unique work in spite of its derivative origin. Unlike other examples imitating Genji, The Changelings still exists, which is a tribute to its superior qualities compared to other examples of the genre.Yet for the reader who has slogged through the more than one thousand pages of The Tale of Genji and wondered if it really deserves its reputation as the best of Japanese classical literature, holding up The Changelings next to it makes apparent the superior virtues of Genji. But while The Changelings comes off second best against such competition, it is not a bad book, quite the contrary, it is an entertaining work with a certain amount of psychological sensitivity about subjects which are usually taboo to the modern reader. Regrettably, they apparently became taboo to the Japanese audience as well, for as the notes in The Changelings tell us, there were two versions. The older version, no longer extant, had the brother and sister living out their lives in the genders of their choice, but the later, surviving edition 'fixes' the gender 'problem.'The matter of gender is at the heart of the story, for Chonagon grows up as a tomboy, better fitted for male life than her brother, who grows up as a sissy, and prefers to live a female life. The parents, deciding to raise their children according to their personalities and desires instead of by their genitalia, introduce the female to male (ftm) brother to Court society as a young man, and the male to female (mtf) sister as a young woman. Most of the book centers on the ftm brother, and rings with authenticity; modern female to male transsexuals will recognize a number of the problems experienced by Chonagon as being similar to issues they also face. It is fair to say that The Changelings is the world's first transgender novel.Chonagon is victimized by a male lover and becomes pregnant; he is trapped between the necessities of his masculine role at Court and trying to deal with the importune advances of his lover without exposing himself and thereby bringing shame to his aged parents and mtf sister who is employed as a lady in waiting at the Court. How the original text solved the problem we will never know; the 'repaired' version features a rather hamhanded insertion in which the mtf sister is suddenly filled with manly vigor, casts off women's garments, and strides around in men's clothes, setting every thing right. This ending is not very satisfactory from either a literary or psychological perspective. That the original permitted the brother and sister to live out their lives in their chosen gender roles sheds light on the attitudes of the Heian period regarding gender; and that a mere two centuries later an editor felt compelled to erase the gender variation and restore 'normality' likewise tells us about how attitudes towards gender and sexuality changed in the later period.As such, The Changelings, aside from being an enjoyable work of fiction, raises important questions about the diversity of Heian era literature and sexuality, and also about the nature of gender and censorship in the past and present. The casual reader will enjoy the story, but the thoughtful reader will be provoked to think more deeply about things he or she has taken for granted."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Poetry, Volume I: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode (Belknap Press)","review":"I love poetry. Books like &quot;History of Modern Poetry: Modernism and After&quot; fill my bookshelves. I eat this stuff up. But one thing a lot of poetry books do is mush up the sense of it all in the hope of appealing to the academics. Since most regularly published poets are professors in English departments, it works out, but it creates a great divide between the laity and the academic.What David Perkins has done is explain the basic chronology of poets periods. This is neither an encyclopedia of terms nor an anthology of great poems. Instead, Perkins takes a period, affiliates the poets major within that period and explains their context and importance.He keeps it simple without talking down to the reader.Essentially, it is a collection of intelligent essays. Some are topical, like &quot;The Postwar Period&quot; while others are poet-specific, like &quot;W. H. Auden.&quot;Perkins writes clearly. It isn't trying to impress you, but he is trying to help you understand Eliot and onward.I read it for personal growth, but it would make a solid textbook, in tandem with Perkins' other volume covering the previous eras.I fully recommend &quot;History of Modern Poetry: Modernism and After&quot; by David Perkins.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Poetry, Volume I: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode (Belknap Press)","review":"David Perkins's &quot;History of Modern Poetry&quot; gives the reader the essentials of the modernist movement, from its beginnings as a reaction against the outworn Romantic era to the poetry of Ashbery, Ammons, and Merrill in our own age.

Lots of problem solving of the perils as they cross the sea and total devotion to them when he is exhausted until they finally make it.

I was amazed to see how well Garcia Marquez could write from a woman's perspective.The book is very short and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the only copy of the book I've seen was in my university's library. I've tried for a long time to find this book on a bookstore, but have been unsuccessful. If you see this book and you're a fan of Garcia Marquez, don't hesitate to buy it! It's a really good short story and you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"FileNet: A Consultant's Guide to Enterprise Content Management","review":"I've worked in the Document Management, Image Management, Knowledge Management and Content Management world as a project manager working to implement technologies for various teams. I've worked with Microsoft, FileNet, IBM, Novell, MarkView and Documentum products. I've lead the implementation of systems in Europe, North America and India. I'm a consultant that works to bring together the business and technical sides of a project through the communication of each team's needs and restraints.I own the book and have loaned it to team members, I have found it to be packed full of information about FileNet products, concepts of system architecture, ideas for getting a project off the ground in your company, negotiation tips, and tons of descriptions of technical concepts tied to content management in general.I found that where Groff and Jones' book lacked very specific technical detail, it made up for it with discussions of using FileNet to architect solutions. This is an area of information that is sorely lacking.I found that the FileNet terminology was accurate and even though some of the names are dated through FileNet's constant renaming (all of the above companies do this), my technical team understood what the components were.This is not an end all book on FileNet products, but it is an excellent tool for educating business teams as to what is possible when using workflow and a document repository. It is also the only independently published book on FileNet that I've found.I recommend this book to anyone that is working on a DM, KM, CM or imaging project for the first time."},{"Title":"FileNet: A Consultant's Guide to Enterprise Content Management","review":"I found this book to be a valuable overview of one of the top products in the document imaging and content management market. Not only did it lay out the common implementation strategies and architectures, it's scope went beyond FileNet's own very pricey training programs. In addition to technical details like setting up offshore indexing centers, the book covers topics like how to ensure sustainable funding for imaging and KM related projects, knowing which FileNet product suites you may need, best practices for negotiating with Filenet corporation and how to set up and manage centralized document capture operations.For me, the book was the only alternative to completely relying on vendor supplies training alone!"},{"Title":"FileNet: A Consultant's Guide to Enterprise Content Management","review":"I purchased this book and yes it does have many, many truths, like there fact that there is little available information on FileNet's products.However, while this book has some insights into FileNet the company and certain esoterics, it completly misses the mark regarding Enterprise Content Managment from FileNet.The book seems to be a rehash/update of a white paper focussed on the FileNet Imaging Product, formerly Image Services now Image Manager.When they discuss management tools and clients it a discussion of FileNet's legacy applicationos XAPEX and IDM Client. There is absolutely no discussion of the current FileNet P8 ECM suites other than some overview, nothing on the ECM Enterprise Manager, Virtual Content Manager, eForms for P8, etc. etc.They complete miss so many basic details, key critical details in the FileNet ECM suite, such as the Application Engine, Routers, etc. that this isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I am so sorry I bought it!As someone who has worked with the FileNet products for over 10 years and former FileNet \\"Sales Engineer\\" (they are actually Systems Consultants) I must warn you that if you try to apply 80% of this book to FileNet's ECM products you will appear a 100% idiot!"},{"Title":"The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Conflict","review":"As a beginning mediator, I found this book very detailed and theoretical. I am sure that I will return to it again and again as I gain experience. I found \\"Basic Skills for the New Mediator (2d edition)\\" by Allan H.

Also, a lot of repetition is involved, chapter by chapter. The mediator separates the chapter by topic but revisits the same cases. It would have been more logical to dedicate a certain case to a certain chapter even though that particular case involves different facets of mediation theory. I would grab the most important issue to a certain case and dedicate it only to one topic/chapter. This will be a lot more instructional and easier in the reading. Also, I found there to be some grammatical errors."},{"Title":"The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Conflict","review":"Great price. I can't believe the price for this book.

I received it at a fast pace.Thanks."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Complementary Medicine Hb (Encyclopaedia of)","review":"At last count there were more than 500 different forms of holistic medicine. Unfortunately it is often very difficult to get impartial advice about what approach may help you personally. Many articles, books and websites simply extol the virtues of one or other form of treatment and it is not uncommon to see people who have traipsed from one therapist to another in the hope of finding help.If you are looking for a reliable and informative overview of some of the major therapies and some of the ailments that they might help, this is a good place to start. The book is beautifully produced and must have taken an enormous amount of effort.It begins with an overview of many of the forms of holistic therapy. Most aim to treat the whole person, though some do that more than others. It also tries to indicate how much evidence there is to support the therapies. There are sections on general well-being with a short self-assessment questionnaire. There are then sections on sleep, diet and exercise, stress and emotion.The book then presents an overview of over 90 widely used complementary therapies with information on their history and methods, philosophy and key principles and something about what to expect during a visit with someone trained in a particular modality.The final part of the book is very good. It offers a guide to choosing therapies for over 200 health problems and is cross-referenced with the earlier art of the book. There is also a list of potentially serious symptoms where a doctor should be consulted immediately. This is something that is rarely addressed in books on holistic health. Within the last week I was contacted by someone who had some odd symptoms and wanted to take an herbal remedy and stay at home. Fortunately the person took my advice and went to the local emergency room, where they found that she had indeed had a heart attack.The one weakness in this otherwise excellent book is the evaluation of the evidence for particular therapies. As two examples use of biorhythms and iridology are discussed and it mentions that the evidence for each of them is thin. That is an understatement: sad to say there is empirical evidence to show that each is ineffective.Even with that small quibble, this is an excellent book that I recommend highly."},{"Title":"Practicing Physics for Conceptual Physics","review":"This workbook was sold in \\"good\\" condition.

Alfred, lord Tennyson (The Augustan books of modern poetry [ed. by Edward Thompson])","review":"I cannot think of a better way to introduce the poetry of Lord Tennyson than this small volume. The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Alford, Lord Tennyson,much less read their poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school. For the most part, when I really get to discussing the work with them, they enjoy it. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"... Alfred, lord Tennyson (The Augustan books of modern poetry [ed. by Edward Thompson])","review":"I have found no better way to introduce young people to these great poets than through this Poetry for Young People series. I highly recommend it! The poems are well chosen, and by reading through these books the children will easily be able to see a variety of writing styles.

These are just all around fun learning!"},{"Title":"...

Alfred, lord Tennyson (The Augustan books of modern poetry [ed. by Edward Thompson])","review":"I'd like to preface my review with 2 facts it would be prudent to remember while reading this review:1. I am by no means a poetry expert or professional. At best I'm a poetry enthusiast.2. I have not written an amazon review in 5 years and I buy 50~ items from amazon each year.This CD is a complete and utter atrocity.It is vicious death to the works of an exquisite poet who in my opinion - deserves better.My fascination with Tennyson is a pretty straightforward one.Tennyson muses on concepts like honour, truth and duty.Being an ex-soldier myself I find it easy to relate to those concepts.And Tennyson's writes so superbly one must be stupefied when first reading his works.I've been eagerly expecting a collected audio CD of Tennyson's works for years now.When I got this CD I was excited as a 6 year old would be on Christmas/Hanuka/whatever morning.However, this CD butchers Tennyson's works so cruelly I cannot remain silent.It is by far the worst reading of Tennyson's works I've ever heard.I gargle things when I brush my teeth that sound better than this.Reading poetry is more than just about having a good projective voice and a British accent.It's about providing the listener with an experience, an understanding of the text, of a shared voyage.Tennyson's poems are being read like one would read a restaurant menu.The pronunciation is abysmal, the pace of reading is atrocious and I just can't relate to it on a personal level.Honestly, I've listened to every online reading of Tennyson's works.All of those free youtube videos far surpass this audio book.My recommandation to you is to avoid buying this CD.And if you do buy this CD - make sure to burn it once you're done. Otherwise you'll be tempted for a replay and than the true horribleness of this CD really sinks in.I've never imagined anyone could actually demolish \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" or \\"Ulysses\\" like this CD has."},{"Title":"Texas History Movies - Collector's Limited Edition","review":"I remember two abridged paperback versions of this book in elementary school back in the 1950s. For some people, history is dry (not for me!), but this book helps bring history alive, along with some humor along the way. The cartoons and captions were originally published in the 1920s in a Dallas TX newspaper. Because they became so popular, they were compiled into book form.No doubt original copies of this book are extremely rare, but this 1970 reprint is faithful to the original, and I have now seen some of the \\"episodes\\" for the first time because of the abridgement of the ones I read previously. I still have the old ones after 50+ years.Some people might find certain parts of this book objectionable because of racial and ethnic stereotypes, but it is important to remember that in those days, such things were considered acceptable. Today, it is highly unlikely that such a series would handle these topics indelicately because of changed attitudes and acceptance of those who may be considered \\"different.\\" Putting aside such objections, readers should be delighted with this book. Even people of \\"Anglo\\" ethnicity as I am are lampooned from time to time, and we need to be able to laugh at ourselves.In all fairness, though, the book presents Texas history in a way that can help everyone enjoy learning about the Lone Star State."},{"Title":"Che: The Photobiography of Che Guevara","review":"Absolutely Fantastic! The quality of the photographs and their subject matter are first class. Not only was I able to find out more about Che's life as a revolutionary, but to read about his childhood aswell was fascinating. I was especially intrigued to discover that the Cuban Secret Service actually disguised Che as a middle aged man so as to ensure his passage to Bolivia. Pure Brilliance! A powerful piece of work which gives a detailled insight into the life of one of the world's greatest men. Well worth a look!"},{"Title":"Che: The Photobiography of Che Guevara","review":"Che Guevara was one of the greatest man to hit this earth. His influence has touched millons of people worldwide. This photobiography shows the respect due to a man that of his statute,&quot;the Jesus Christ of his time&quot; only in a guerrilla costume. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, well this is book is worth a lifetime and a half worth of words. Without photography it would be impossible to know how idles such as CHE himself would have lived. Words only begin to describe a person and his personal lifestyle, but when you see it throu pictures is like you live that life. Till this day Che is the only man that makes me get goosebumps everytime i see the picture of him lying there, dead, with his eyes open."},{"Title":"Che: The Photobiography of Che Guevara","review":"Tired of reactionary propaganda? Want to see the Che that we know? The Che that cared in a world dominated by corporate interests that didn't care whatsoever? Than this book is for you. This looks at Che the human, not just the legend we have come to know and love. Che working in the fields with the common man, (Can't picture good ol Dubya doing that, can you?) These pictures exemplifies what El Che cared about: US! The people ignored by governments and their corporate backers. The people in Latin America where a MAJORITY of which were poor. In many countries even today in Latin America, that is still the case. A great look at those that know and love Che Guevera and those that still need to be introduced to the legend that cared."},{"Title":"Che: The Photobiography of Che Guevara","review":"This is a beautiful book of never seen before photos of Che Guevara.

There is an example of his first writing as a child, and also a copy of part of the infamous letter written to Fidel, and even the photo that appeared in the newspaper about the two \\"Leprosy Experts\\" during the Motorcycle Diaries period.This is all very tastefully presented, but is done as a memorial to Che so does omit darker aspects to his character. A beautiful item for Che fans..."},{"Title":"Che: The Photobiography of Che Guevara","review":"What about the dozens of people that Guevara put to death? Where is the mention of Guevara's wife and toddler who were left to fend for themselves whie &quot;El Che&quot; adventured in the mountains?

This is a book of exceptional photography but by no means is it a complete, accurate portrayal of Che Guevara."},{"Title":"Household Discoveries and Mrs. Curtis's Cook Book","review":"It's rare for Amazon to make such a mistake; however, the pictures and book titles are swapped between the 1909 Household Discoveries and Mrs. Curtis's Cook Book and 1914 Household Discoveries (encyclopedia)if you compare them against the product description. I ordered the tan Household Discoveries (encyclopedia) and got the black 1909 Household Discoveries book. I'm not unhappy in the least since the black 1909 book was the one I really wanted. Pay attention to which one you really want and check with the seller before you buy it.The reason I wanted this book is we're losing the skills and the knowledge of times gone by. This \\"modern\\" book of 1909 wanted to be of practical use to every household in the United States. More than 25,000 people contributed recipes and suggestions to the Success Magazine to be considered in the publication. All contributions come from the old way of women sharing favorite recipes among friends, men swapping ideas on carpentering, painting, tinkering, and odd jobs not only from neighbor to neighbor; but, from country to country.A valuable part of the entire sharing process is eventually the good ideas rise to the surface and those are the ones that get repeated. The first part of the book is about practical aspects of living in a home. Page 34 \\"furniture should be chosen for simplicity and durability\\" and the expanded description talks about quiet and subdued colors and furniture in harmony with the room. This book was doing Feng Shui long before that name was attached to the process. The book knocks cheap furniture as well as antique furniture (\\"the craze is rather absurd\\".)The book has an interesting format. It's two books in one: Household discoveries is the first 744 pages (including an excellent detailed index) and the Mrs. Curtis's Cookbook is the last half of the book - the page numbering starts all over and has its own index. This section is 280 pages.The Household discoveries section is the epitome of the How-To book. \\"If a moving-picture machine could follow a good housekeeper from morning until night, seven days in the week, and fifty-two weeks in the year, and then throw the series of pictures thus taken up on a screen, the result would be similar to the contents of this volume.\\" (Page 25). It goes through a days' work and has pictures and descriptions of the different processes from kindling the fire to cleaning lamps, and other tasks done during the day. Then it goes through the weeks' work - wash day, making soap, mending, etc. The next section is the year's work - spring and fall house cleaning, fighting household pests, and even how to pack for travel or moving.Chapter 12 starts with the workroom - working with different adhesives, paints and varnishes, metal work, working with leather, and other skills. Not to be outdone, there are sections on teeth (cleaning, toothache), hairdressing for both men and women, making candy, preserving meat and vegetables, and weights & measures. The last chapters are health hints and what the home nurse \\"ought to do\\". (Page 654 - rupture of varicose veins - elevate the limbs, loosen garters, and apply a bandage below the wound and over it.) One important note was \\"Whiskey of a good quality is valuable for many conditions, especially in case of snake bite, when it is a specific. Care should be used to giving it to children.\\" Page 648. It's not clear if you drink the whiskey or pour it on the snake bite.Some of the health hints, such as sucking the venom out of a snake bite, just isn't done any more. However, a lot of the things done back then are still relevant today.The Cookbook is full of plain old good cooking (as my grandmother would say). Almost every section has a commentary on why you do what with that particular food. This is the basic cookbook for every person who wants to learn to cook. It assumes nothing and walks the reader through how to make a sandwich, how to make different kinds of eggs (poached, scrambled), how to make cereal (don't laugh - these folks had wheat germ they boiled instead of store-bought Wheaties) and Hasty Pudding, how to make all kinds of soups and broths, how to choose a fish and cook it, shellfish and meats, recipes for beef leftovers (hashes, deviled dishes), lamb and mutton (and leftovers), pork ,chicken, as well as sauces for the different meats. There are sections for vegetables, potatoes, leftovers, salads, puddings, deserts, \\"puff paste\\" cakes and cookies. There is even a section for favorite dishes in famous homes (recipes from Mrs. Taft, Mrs. Sherman, the wives of US Senators and Governors from various states). For the record, Mrs. Taft submitted a Sponge Pudding recipe while Mrs. Sherman (wife of the vice-president) submitted a recipe for Saratoga Pudding.Not to be outdone is the last chapter: Some Kitchen Kinks. These are the little things you never knew. \\"Instead of shelling peas, throw the pods and all into a kettle of boiling water, after washing and discarding all spoiled ones. When they are done, the pods will rise to the surface, while the peas will stay at the bottom of the kettle. Peas cooked n this manner have a fine flavor.\\" (Page 252). Page 253 - how to keep lettuce fresh if \\"the refrigerator is stored away and the cellar is warm from heating plant there....\\" I'll leave you in suspense with this one.....I am so pleased with this book. The publishers felt strongly about \\"a universal necessity for Household Discoveries...\\" and they made it practical and affordable so they \\"put the price so low as to bring it within the reach of every family...\\" I'm going to take it to the local librarian and ask how to keep it in good shape since I'll be using it a lot."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Battle: Overloon and the Maas Salient, 1944-45","review":"THE FORGOTTEN BATTLE: OVERLOON AND THE MAAS SAILIENT 1944-45, tells the extremely interesting story of the battles adjacent to Arnhem, Hell's Highway, Aachen, Huertgen, and the Ardennes. Even some of the best military history narratives available today would give you the false impression that after British XXX Corps cut a swath through to Nijmegen that the remaining Germans disappeared from the Netherlands. FORGOTTEN BATTLE completes this long overdue chapter of the battles along the Maas.The initial setting is September 1944. The German front has collapsed and the Allies are simultaneously pushing the Germans back in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In an attempt to level a death blow to Nazi Germany, British Field Marshal Montgomery pushes his plan forward to seize a series of Dutch bridges and wheel into Germany. A combined paratroop and armored assault slices into Holland, only to be stopped at the Neder Rijn. In the meantime, the Germans rush to reinforce their bridgehead along the Maas and cut the Hell's Highway corridor.Meeting with only limited, and short-lived, success, the Germans pull back along the Maas and rebuild a cohesive front line blocking the Allied advance into Germany until 1945.FORGOTTEN BATTLE is very enjoyable reading. Personal accounts are interwoven with meticulous research. The military operations along the Maas have never really had an official name. \\"Overloon and the Maas Salient\\" fits perfectly. Indeed, the present day military museum at Overloon, a superb facility, is often overlooked by military history tourists.If you are a student of the period of time between the Arnhem operation and drive into the Reichswald, this book is for you. The only recommendation I have is that it is helpful to have a map of the Netherlands handy. There are map graphics scattered throughout the book, but sometimes the author sprinkles geographic names about so casually in the narrative that you might find yourself confused as to the location and direction of the action."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Battle: Overloon and the Maas Salient, 1944-45","review":"The Maas salient is truly a forgotten battle. With responsibility of the sector switching from British to US hands, it fell to the Dutch to write the book about the battle. As you might expect, they focus some on the hardships undergone by the Dutch civilians in the area. The book keeps a fairly tight lens on the battle, but it sometimes looses perspective. It's easy to get lost and wonder &quot;why are they attacking again?&quot; All in all, it's an interesting book, and recommended for the WW2 history buff who needs another book."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Battle: Overloon and the Maas Salient, 1944-45","review":"I purchased the book for my father-in-law who is Dutch and was living there at the time of the battle. To have a book written about the events that happened at that time was fantastic and gave valuable insight into what was happening in the surrounding areas."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Battle: Overloon and the Maas Salient, 1944-45","review":"Good account of a forgotten battle (due to Oper. Market and Battle of the Bulge), which I found that my Father and uncle participated in. Learned of the battle by accidently going to the Overloon Museum in Overloon Netherlands in 2006. One of the largest in Europe with one of the most impressive collection of military fighting vehicles from WW11 to present."},{"Title":"Pastoral Care in Historical Perspective","review":"This book revolutionized my thinking about biblical counseling. It provided me with the historical matrix of sustaining, healing, reconciling, and guiding. Clebsch and Jaekle write convincingly that any model of pastoral counseling worthy of the title, must include these four elements (sustaining, healing, reconciling, and guiding).After several well-written chapters that overview the nature of these four tasks, the authors then provide historical samples upon which to feast--samples illustrating the four tasks in historical perspective. Find it. Read it. Implement it. Let it change your thinking about biblical counseling then and now.Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of \\"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" and \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\""},{"Title":"Pastoral Care in Historical Perspective","review":"This is a very well written book, with a great introduction and then period pieces from a broad range of those ministers and therapists who have sought to help others through a variety of means. The pieces begin pre-Freud and continue post-Freud. Situates our own pastoral care, for those of us who are pastors, within a broader historical perspective."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Having read just about all of the Nero Wolfe series, I have to say, this one contains all of the elements that make Rex Stout's detective novels wildly entertaining, without most of the elements that make some of them maddeningIn this mystery, the utterly unswashbuckling Wolfe is revealed, in his younger, svelter days, to have been quite a romantic. Not only did he fight on the anti-Imperial side in Montenegro during the Great War, but he adopted and may even have actually sired a young girl.To his shock, this young Yugoslav maiden--whom he had lost track of--reappears in his life, up to her neck in a particularly messy, intricate affair that may or may not include missing diamonds, a dead body or two, international intrigue, and a bellboy's uniform. For all of the peeks into Wolfe's previously unsuspected soul, he remains as crumudgeonly and as immovable as ever. Archie Goodwin, of course, remains the wisecracking, milk-drinking sidekick, flirting with anything in a skirt and even giving a Nazi agent a black eye just for the fun of it.The joy of these books is their marriage of the American gumshoe attitude and the British cozy focus on character. Where they generally fall short is their plotting. This entry in the series is, without a doubt, the most successfully rounded out of the lot. Stout manages to keep the mystery truly mysterious, and yet never manages to confuse the reader so thoroughly that s/he can't find the exit. The plot actually ends on the last page--many of the Nero Wolfe mysteries fizzle out, wrapping up a chapter or two before the end, leaving nothing but rumination and grumbling for the final pages. Others seem never quite to wrap up all the loose ends. Here, the conclusion is both inevitable and unexpected--utterly satisfying."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"'Over My Dead Body' finds a young lady who arrives at Wolfe's door claiming to be Wolfe's daughter. Wow! What a way to start the book! Things begin to heat up even more when the young lady is suspected of a murder in a fencing studio.This is the seventh entry in the Wolfe series, and it is an entertaining one. Wolfe is in his usual beer-drinking, orchid-loving form, using that brilliant mind of his to sort out any difficulty. In this book, we begin to see a little more depth in two of the recurring minor characters in Wolfe's employ: First, Fred Durkin, the lumbering, bumbling guy who is not too bright, but is always there when Wolfe needs him. Second, Saul Panzer, who is probably just as good a detective as Archie (well, almost), but is completely no-nonsense. (And Archie thinks he's better looking than Saul.)I'd give the book 4.5 stars if I could. The only problem is Wolfe says a few words and lines that really aren't in character for him. This would only distract readers who have read a lot of the books. Since this book is still fairly early in the series, Stout can be forgiven. 'Over My Dead Body' is definitely a Wolfe book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Very smooth, fast paced, one of the top ten of the Wolfe opus"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"This book hits on all cylinders.

I'm at a loss as to what else to say about the book except, \\"Read it.\\"A Britsh undercover agent is murdered at a Manhattan fencing school, skewered by an epee with a gizmo attached that turns it into a weapon sans blunt end. Yugoslav women who are instructors there are possible suspects, one of whom is Nero Wolfe's adopted daughter from his days as an ill advised Austrian agent in the Balkans, pre World War, before we started numbering them. This alone is a startling revelation about Wolfe. Wolfe slender? Youthful? Abroad, outside, involved with people? I was astonished.As usual, the beer drinking, orchid collecting, erudite, corpulent food lover Nero Wolfe declines, under any circumstances, to leave his brownstone abode with a greenhouse rooftop for his rare flowers. Using Archie, his assistant, as legs, Wolfe solves the baffling case. I knew he would. He's solved all the other mysteries in the Nero Wolfe books I've read.Mystery fans who have not read mysteries from the golden age (pre-1950) do not know what they are missing. There is no sex to lure the lascivious reader, very little violence, no profanity. What there is (and this book is an excellent example of the sub-genre) is intelligence.That's a rare commodity in most modern mysteries."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"This is, at once, one of the best books in the series and one which translated brilliantly to TV on the A&E; series.Rex Stout decides to deal us a little shock in this one: Nero Wolfe, woman-hater, has a daughter he's not seen since she was a baby. She comes from Yugoslavia to New York, unknown to her pops, and gets into a real tight spot involving murder by \\"coldymort.\\"When Archie learns this, he considers resigning on the basis of his boss's morals. You just have to read this one to find out.Or, again, buy the A&E; series - they did a great job here."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Formatted nicely for the Kindle, this is one of the classic Nero Wolfe stories, written when Rex Stout was in his prime. A girl comes to his office seeking help for her friend accused of stealing some diamonds from a clients coat at the fencing studio where the girls work. But what starts as a simple case of forgotten diamonds ends in international intrigue and the appearance of Wolfe's daughter.Please, more Nero Wolfe for the Kindle!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Over My Dead Body is the seventh in the Nero Wolfe series. A young lady claiming to be Wolfe's adopted daughter from Yugoslavia asks for his help with a charge of stealing diamonds but this quickly evolves into a situation where she is suspected of murder. The case frustrates Wolfe no end, it gets more complicated all the while, but of course he manages to uncover the solution by the end of the story.This book is a prime example of a Nero Wolfe novel. Archie Goodwin is in top form as a wise cracking pain-in-the-neck. Inspector Cramer is present more than a lot of stories giving Goodwin plenty of opportunities for zingers besides the ones he routinely fires at Wolfe. Wolfe himself is definitely out of his comfort zone dealing with the situation of his adopted daughter and this also adds to the potential for laughs.This is a very entertaining book and I would recommend it for readers unfamiliar with Nero Wolfe as a great place to start or for established fans."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Imagine having Nero Wolfe as your dear old dad. That's one of the delicious premises of this book. The mystery is a very good one. But even more entertaining is the glimpses into Wolfe's early life, when he was \\"lean,\\" and his long-ago adventures in Europe. Archie is terrific, as always. The police go from adversaries to allies, and there's plenty of action to keep us on our toes."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Great read. The whodunnit keeps you guessing. And Archie Goodwin's never been funnier!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"This book begins with the astounding revelation, to Archie and to the reader, that long ago, in his native Montenegro, Nero Wolfe had adopted a daughter. That daughter, now in New York City, is in trouble and comes to her adoptive father for help. But Nero hasn't seen this daughter since she was an infant. She has a piece of paper that she says \\"proves\\" she's the daughter he adopted. Is she?Of course there's murder in this book, more than one. Somebody is killing the students at a fencing studio (frequented by Wolfe's daughter), running them through with a lethal epee (a deadly point is attached to the epee). And: somebody is trying to frame Archie Goodwin for these murders! Not only that, but Archie takes the evidence that was planted on him at the fencing studio and brings it home, where Fritz hides it in a loaf of bread.Inspector Cramer is baffled and spends time at Wolfe's brownstone, waiting for something to happen. Government agents make demands, which Wolfe ignores.This is a fun read, as is almost every Nero Wolfe title, but the ending is a bit busy, hasty, and confusing, almost as if Stout couldn't think of a really perfect ending. Nevertheless, worth reading."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"It is all about wise-cracking by Wolfe's protege/assistant Archie Goodwin. I am not at all impressed, may be it shouldn't be the first book to start with but... I wouldn't buy another book by this author in the near future!!! Trash...."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"\\"...Wolfe sipped the last drop of his luncheon coffee, put down his cup, and made two distinct and separate oral noises. The first was meant to express his pleasure and satisfaction in the immediate past, the hour spent at table; the second was a grunt of resigned dismay at the prospect of the immediate future, which was embodied in the bulky figure of Inspector Cramer...\\"Well, they just don't write like that anymore. If you're like me, you'll read with Webster's on hand as Wolfe and his assistant Goodwin carry on their 'persiflage' amidst the current investigation. Wolfe calls for his beer, his leftover roast duck, his orchid files, and all of his witnesses because he doesn't take walk-ins, he won't suffer fools, and he never leaves his house.This was my first pass at the Rex Stout mystery library, and I'm definitely signing on for more!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"One morning in 1939 a young woman appeared at the brownstone, seeking Nero Wolfe. Archie Goodwin was hopeful that the meeting would lead to a case but he never expected the surprises that would soon follow for shortly after Wolfe entered the office the young woman proclaimed herself to be Wolfe's long lost daughter. As if that statement was not shocking enough Archie was further stunned when Wolfe acknowledged that she could very well be his missing child. After these stunning revelations the dead bodies, semi clad women, horde of NYPD detectives and persistent FBI agents are almost anti climatic.Fans of the Nero Wolfe series will not want to miss this introduction to Wolfe's daughter (she also figures in THE BLACK MOUNTAIN) and learn a bit more about Wolfe's mysterious past. Those who are new to the series could begin with this one, even though it is the seventh in the series. Archie is at his devious best in this one as he manages to stay one step ahead of both the police and the FBI in this one.Serious Wolfe fans might be able to catch Wolfe in a lie to the FBI if they read carefully....happy hunting!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"In this Nero Wolfe mystery-one of the earlier episodes-we encounter Wolfe's adopted daughter, who is in a bit of a fix. Wolfe comes to the rescue and along the way, shares little glimpses into his past: his tumultuous youth in Europe; the origins of his suspicion of all women; how he came to adopt a child. In this book, probably more than any other in Rex Stout's series, do we see the effect that women-especially those from the former nation of Yugoslavia-have upon Wolfe's psyche. It's a good read-a good mystery with a great plot-like pretty much all of Stout's works."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Prichard has done unabridged audio tapes of a whole series of Nero Wolfe novels and he is ideally suited for the task. You could find no better way to experience Stout's work than these audio tapes. He has a fine voice and his performance is excellent."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"After Wolfe has met with an attractive Montenegrin woman a G-Man arrives at his office to question him. No, he's not acting as an agent for any foreign person. But the G-Man starts asking questions about Wolfe's youth in Europe culminating with:\\"What about your wife? Weren't you married?\\"To which Wolfe replies \\"No. Married? That was what--\\" and then as good as tells the G-Man to go to hell.Is there a more frustrating unfinished sentence in all of detective fiction? \\"That was what....\\" WHAT!?!? We know that Wolfe was once young and romantic is not completely immune to the charms of the opposite sex. I have spent far too many hours concocting scenarios, an exotically beautiful spy who lures him into marrying her and gets information from him. Only too late does he find the marriage is invalid and she disappears...perhaps carrying his child? But enough of my flights of fantasy.\\"Over My Dead Body\\" is a intriguing read, cerebral and action packed as well. It's a stand out for the glimpses it provides us into Wolfe's and Archie's characters. Give it a read, you won't regret it! I've read it more than once and I'm certain I'll read it more than once more."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Love Rex Stout. Got hooked on Nero Wolfe when I saw the two seasons of Nero Wolfe on A and E. Have read all the Rex Stout books that have been written. What a master writter he was. If you have a Mystery/Detective novel reader in your family, this would be the writter to read."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Strange concept. The detective never leaves his office-home. He sends some assistants out. The case involves a strong personal angle, and you cannot be sure who is who. But this withdrawn self-centered blob of a man nonetheless manages to perceive the world outside and challenges our notions of how to solve problems. Strange enough to intrigue me. Keeps moving enough to keep my interest."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"This book has so far been my favorite if only for the risqu&eacute; scene of the drunken women hardly clothed, and occasionally not, making passes at Archie.

Now that I've grown up, I thought I'd give them a go to see what I thought as an adult. Short version: not my style.A big roadblock to my enjoying this more than I did is that my tastes have changed: if I want to read a mystery, give me a Chandler or a Hammett. This was a little too close to the \\"sealed room\\" style of Christie, which I actively dislike. Another negative was the similarities to Doyle: if something's described for over a couple of sentences it *must* be important, and if Wolfe asks a question about something you know it's key. Wolfe is a little too \\"super-sleuth\\" for my tastes.That said, Stout's a decent writer -- except his attempts at a Slavic accent, which I found embarrassingly bad-- and there were a couple of good lines peppered throughout this. Each chapter ends on a sort of cliffhanger (I'm assuming it was serialized when originally published) which was a good way to keep me reading. The book held my interest, though the ending was a seriously contrived affair that my calling a \\"let-down\\" under-describes my disappointment by a couple orders of magnitude. If it had been handled better, I would have given the book 4 stars.If you're a Stout fan, you'll probably like it, but a novice coming in cold might have some problems."},{"Title":"Warrant discs of the Gestapo & Kripo, 1934-1946","review":"Don Bible has the best and most comprehensive book on Gestapo Warrant discs.

Even the enhancements of the 8052, i.e. watch dog, counter timer 2 etc, are covered well. I thought this maybe a bit too much for a beginner. I would recommend a beginner to get &quot;8051 Microcontroller&quot; by Ayala before getting this book. Then everything in this book would probably make more sense. Unfortunately it doesn't cover worst case analysis of voltage output to input, fanout, timing etc etc. Maybe because there is no external device interfacing. I would prefer the author talked a little about PLD. But this may be beyond the scope of the book. So this book will not replace the good engineering housekeeping. Maybe that's why he stayed with Atmel's controller, cause it is selfcontained. For a hobbyist, this book does the justice.

On the other hand, the text contains a lot, really A LOT, of unnecessary talk and stories, and just isn't straight-forward. Searching for the relevant points is hard...Anyway, good things are the well written introduction, a wealth of different beginner projects and how-to's and code snippets, and a very good appendix (100+ pages) which contains plenty of useful code and info for those who just want to quickly look up on how to do something. The book also contains much info on hooking things up to a 8051, aka interfacing.The programmer tool part is highly disappointing. It is maybe the shortest chapter in the book. The schematic and PCB of the programmer - and actually of some other circuits in the book, too - are of totally useless print quality, and not even on the CD! There's no programmer software included. The demo version of the UMPS program on the CD is ok, but that doesn't make up for the lack of uC programmer infos and alternatives.The printed source code snippets contain some errors that prevent them from getting compiled at all. It seems like some were written out of memory, and were not even tested. Luckily this is the case for only a few of the code snippets.LCD interfacing could have been described more deeply.

Our language is called English, and most publishers can afford a copy editor.On top of that, and particularly painful, was a hilarious misunderstanding of the history of the von Neumann architecture for computers, about which he apparently has only a smattering of confused hearsay---possibly a dimly remembered class. He has it begin in a competition between Harvard and Princeton Universities (actually Princeton University had absolutely nothing to do with it, nor did Harvard) to improve naval artillery (pure fiction), a project of which a man named von Neumann was chief scientist. In fact (I was there) von Neumann was one of the world's greatest mathematicians (not a functionary running a minor Navy program), the project was at the Institute for Advanced Study (which is housed in the town of Princeton, but has nothing to do with the University), and the work there was aimed at weather forecasting. I won't even touch his confusion about the architecture itself. None of this disqualifies him as an 8051 guru, but it sure does detract from his credibility.

However, I think he treats 8051 as PIC, which is not the objective of the 8051 book. The projects included in this book are more like PIC project, where small memory, I/O circuit is needed.However, the programming portion in this book gives rather simple and not bad explanation to assembly language beginner like me. I think that is the only useful part in this book."},{"Title":"Michelin Battle of Alsace Map No. 104","review":"If you want to do research using old maps, this is helpful. It is a 2 dimensional map.I wanted it for a wall-hanging (e.g. mounted in a frame).The Michelin map is folded, but a little steam \\"work\\" flattens it nicely.If you are not interested in the historical view of Alsace, this map probably has little value to you.I am an amateur military historian and found the map very useful for reference against various regimental histories (available via the San Jose, CA library).It is an excellent historical check-and-balance map (e.g. some town names have changed, road names, etc. from the mid-twentieth century).Although I have not used it in this way, it is probably very useful as an overlay of modern maps, if you are doing a WW2 tour. It is, of course, a map from that time period, so you would have to cross reference memorials and monuments from a modern map and then find the associated reference on the Michelin map.Pete"},{"Title":"Jackie (Ariel Books)","review":"the biography is fairly good, and there are a few rare pictures.I suggest it to all people who want to know a little bit about Jackie Kennedy.

His vivid imagination generally amuses the class and teacher, but his latest stunt, involving purple people that only he can see, has raised the ire of Mary, one of his classmates.Kline, a teacher, has painted a realistic portrait of classroom dynamics. You can tell her characters are drawn from real life, even if her scenarios seem a bit unreal and sketchy. The conclusion is a bit hasty, and we never find out whether the purple people are real, or why Mary is behaving like such a pill.

I did, however, color over one of the lines which really bummed out my karma, I can tell you."},{"Title":"Unfinished Business: America and Cuba after the Cold War, 1989-2001","review":"Morley and McGillion, two Australian academics, have produced a very useful account of the US ruling class's unremitting hostility to the Cuban revolution. They show that the US government is not seeking democracy or reforms in Cuba: its sole aim is to destroy Cuba's social, political and economic order.Clinton was even more anti-Cuba than Bush Senior. Clinton signed the notorious Helms-Burton Bill, which illegally imposed the US's embargo on the whole world. At the UN, only the USA and Israel oppose resolutions calling on the USA to end the embargo.Since 1994, the State Department's annual studies of \`Patterns of Global Terrorism' have found no evidence of Cuban \`sponsorship' of terrorist activities. Yet the US government lists Cuba as a \`terrorist state', but not Afghanistan when it was under the Taliban! Cuba denounced 9/11 as an \`atrocious and insane terrorist act', and offered to cooperate in the global war on terrorism. Bush rejected the offer.Cuba has every right to act decisively to deter terrorists who hijack planes, bomb hotels and fly over Havana. Those who criticise its actions on \`human rights' grounds assist the terrorists. The US government funds and supports these anti-Cuba terrorists. In 1999, the Clinton administration passed the Cuban Internal Opposition Assistance Act, providing extra money for \`dissidents'. The US state funds the Cuban American National Foundation, the European Coalition for Human Rights in Cuba, and the Cuban Dissidents Task Force. Of course, \`dissidents' is too polite a term for those who consciously act as paid agents of a hostile foreign power. In 1994, the State Department could find that there were only six alleged political prisoners in Cuba, somewhat fewer than in the USA.Senator Helms and his cronies allege that Cuba trafficks in drugs, yet the USA's own Drug Enforcement Agency, after repeated investigations, has reported that there is no evidence of Cuban involvement in drug smuggling, and that Cuba has been singularly cooperative in working with the US Coast Guard to prevent drug smuggling. The annual State Department reports on drugs control have never listed Cuba as a major drug transit country."},{"Title":"The Red Guards' Path to Violence","review":"I will leave a quick note here just as a courtesy. This is an academic volume. They obviously printed few copies, and that's why the price is prohibitive. I have been reading this text in the library recently. It's quite good in its attempt to get at some of the questions behind what may have motivated seemingly normal Chinese teenagers to commit atrocious acts of violence and indignity against their elders and peers. Recommend spending an hour or so on it in the library, and taking a few notes. Not so important as to warrant a purchase, but worth checking out."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"I am a layman who has been praying the office for about three years now, and have found that it does help you establish a prayerful rhythmn throughout the day and keep you mindful of God and your fellow Christians.This book has morning, daytime, evening and night prayers, with a compressed Office of Readings (you'll need the 4-volume Breviary for the full Office). It can be a little hard to get started with the Liturgy of the Hours, and some people may get frustrated. I'd suggest finding someone to help you get started--priests, deacons, and religious (e.g., nuns and brothers)all say the Liturgy, and some laymen too. Keep in mind that the Liturgy of the Hours has its roots in the Hebrew tradition of praying seven times a day, so this is a way to pray like Jesus and the earliest Christians.While traditionally the Liturgy of the Hours has been considered more the domain of priests and religious, I think it can help satisfy a much wider need. A lot of people (including myself) have a lot of respect for the rigorous prayer life of Muslims, who pray five times a day--and I think many want to imitate that discipline as well. This is a very old Christian discipline that may help people satisfy that desire, and I hope that more people will discover the Liturgy of the Hours."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"There are two one volume versions of the office, this one by the Daughters of St. Paul (DSP) and one by Catholic Book Publishing Company (CBP). How to choose? Let me go through evening prayer on Tuesday of the 12th week in ordinary time comparing both volumes. CBP publishes an annual booklet that tells you what day it is liturgically and where to find the different parts of the prayer. There is nothing comparable for the DSP but I have never felt the need for it. DSP prints one hymn without music at the beginning of the office. CBP offers two hymns with music but you must go to the back of the book to find them. Usually people say the office alone and do not sing the hymns. As another reviewer states the DSP prints the antiphon before and also after the psalm. CBP does not. The psalm can continue onto a second page so if you repeat the antiphon (optional) CBP may require flipping back. Finally, for the Canticle of Mary CBP requires going to another page in a section called the Ordinary. DSP prints the Canticle of Mary right where you need it.DSP has the psalter and a selection of readings of the Office of Readings. At least you can try out this particular office. The patristic second readings are worth browsing through on their own right. They used to sell a one volume office of readings which is now very hard to find.I prefer the stiff binding of the DSP to the vinyl covered paperback style of the CBP.Overall, the CBP may be a little easier for a person who is new to the liturgy of the hours or who prays it intermittantly because of the annual guidebook. If you want the music it's definitely the way to go. A person who pays close attention to the liturgical year anyway and wants to pray the office regularly may prefer the DSP - as I do."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"I have often admired the committment of Muslims, whose religious practice gives them a framework through which they pray five times a day, combining their scripture with prayers to God. They stop whatever they are doing, and whther alone or with a group, they pray and they know that everyone within their time zone is conversing with God at the same time each day. I only learned about a year ago that this ancient tradition is inherent in all Abrahamic faiths, originating with Judaism (being the oldest of the three faiths). The Liturgy of the Hours is the Christian format and tradition.I prefer the Pauline format used in this book to that offered by the Catholic Publishing company, because I better understand when to include the antiphon. I found the book relatively easy to use for the prayers, becuase I acquired it within the Ocatave of Easter. But I don't know if I would have found the correct week if I purchased it outside of a holiday.There is much information in this version as to how to pray the liturgy of the hours, but I have not figured out how to incorporate the non-biblical readings. I am sure there must be more information somewhere, but I can't grasp the chart, as there are not enough days for it to be one reading a day during the Easter season, and somehow they must repeat themselves.That being said, I looked at the other one volume version (be Catholic Publishing Co.) available and this version is more user friendly. Still, I recently ordered the guide \\"Lord Open My Lips,\\" hoping that it will enlighten me as to how to use the nonBiblical readings for the full devotion.I feel as if the book has greatly enriched my prayer life. It did not take long at all to recognize the format for the prayers, and the daily selections are a good combination of petitions for help from and praise to God. I highly recomed that anyone interested in praying with scripture try this method of prayer. There is a comfortable feeling from knowing that when you pray these prayers, even though you may be alone in your room (but many Catholic churches offer the lauds prayers before mass each morning, so if you live near one and want to join in - ask they'll be thrilled to have you there), many, many people are praying them with you each day at the set times."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"For those who are absolute beginners to the Liturgy of the Hours, this is perhaps not the most helpful text, though I happen to think the difficulty of learning how to pray the prayer of the Church is exaggerated. Yes this, the Pauline edition, does have an Ordinary, as the Catholic Book Publishing Co. version does. And yes, it does come with a leaflet guide. However, this particular guide does not have the daily detail of the C.B. Publishing one that comes out every year. Also this book has no supplement for recent additions and changes in the Church calendar. That being said, for those who might be familiar with the look of the Cath.Bk.Publishing version (you know, those books in the vinyl reddish covers that wrinkle when you stuff them into bookcovers), this edition gives a different look to the same old US official ICEL text. I myself miss the two color print and the Virginia Broderick symbolic illustrations, but I do NOT miss not having the antiphon printed both before and after a psalm. (the \\"red book version\\" generally only prints the antiphon before its psalm, so page ruffling becomes a distraction.) This edition includes more information on each page by varying fonts, sometimes half a dozen different typefaces per page. This gives a busy look to things but I have found in the few days that I have owned this edition that I have done much less page ruffling and find the 4 (not 5) sewn-in ribbons quite adequate for reference. It has a smaller \\"handprint\\" than the red book version, more like the fattest volume of the 4 volume LOH edition and it boasts a very study hardcover. Not a very elegant hardcover, much like what my old town library used to get when they sent away soft books to be treated to hardcovers, but it has a great heft. I have felt no need to buy a spiffy zipper cover for mine yet. If you think such considerations are unimportant, try the large print red book version. UGH! I gave that one away. In short, RECOMMENDED, with the above qualifications. PRAY!"},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"This is a great book to help improve and deepen one's prayer life. However, if one is unfamiliar with the Liturgy of the Hours, there is little instructional material here to help get started."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"I own this version, Shorter Christian Prayer, and another version of Christian prayer published by Catholic Publishing. Each has its strengths. The one published by the Catholic Publishing company definitely has the more attractive typesetting with different colored inks and decorative illustrations. It also has the music to the hymns, which this one doesn't have. However, this presentation is easier to use (you don't have to flip to other sections of the book to find the daily hymn or the canticle, and the antiphons are written out at the beginning and end of each psalm. The Catholic Book Publishing version requires more page flipping. I prefer either of these versions to the \\"Shorter Christian Prayer\\" because I like to include the office of readings in my daily routine, which is not included in the shorter version. But if you just plan to do morning and evening prayer, the shorter christian prayer is a portable alternative that does very nicely. In the end, it comes down to personal preference."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"I have been reading the Christian Liturgy of the hours for the past seven years or so. The morning prayers with the scripture readings are simply unique and calm your inner soul. It brings out charity and love towards one another and those whom we encounter either at work or as a traveller. It inspires me to do what is right and not wrong and live in an austere manner concerning treatment each human being. Knowing that God loves us unconditionally regardless of all our iniquities, If one has the time to complete all of the parts of this book, such as, morning, midmorning, daytime, and evening, then, your life will be completely changed. Try to read the psalms and scripture lessons slowly. It is a very good book for young and old, the lonely who are in despair, and anyone really. The night prayers are a blessing and making peace with God and man as we retire from our daily duties. It also contains the prayers for the dead if one is interested which is very important. Reading about the saints is remarkable in learning from them and what they can do for us, especially, if one has carried that saint name. You can also find the Christmas and Advent prayers and other feast days which is breathtaking. I wish you happy reading and do enjoy what God has given to us."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"I have this edition and agree with the other reviewers about what makes it superior - the antiphon printed at the beginning and the end of the psalm and the binding.

There is an annual guide available from Our Lady's Missionaries of the Eucharist to help with finding the pages to use."},{"Title":"Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hours (Prayer and Inspiration)","review":"This one volume edition of the Liturgy of the Hours has everything you need to celebrate morning and evening prayer (Lauds and Vespers) and night prayer (Compline). While it has a few selections from the Office of Readings (Matins) it does not have the complete office for the whole year. This is why the previous reviewer did not know what to do with the non biblical writings; these are mere fragments of Matins. If you want to celebrate Matins, you'll need the four volume set.Since the Office of Readings is my favorite hour, I was disappointed with this edition, especially since it became redundant once I bought the 4 volume set."},{"Title":"Study Power: Study Skills to Enhance Your Learning and Your Grades","review":"My 2 star rating is based entirely on the typography used for the book.

I have been looking at different sources of information on study skills for quite some time. I have found some help on the internet and some not-too-useful books. I found &quot;Study Power&quot; by Luckie and Smethurst, and it was the complete source I had been looking for. They are very logical and sequential in setting up the premise for the three major areas of study skills, and the book is full of HOW's - How does one study, How does one make note cards, How does one do well on an oral or written presentation. The only minor disagreement I have with them is the size of the notecards. They suggest 3X5 cards, which are too small. That would be OK for learning vocabulary or something simple. I suggest to my kids that they invest in 5X8 cards, which are big enough to draw more complex systems, cycles, etc. that are necessary in Biology. Other than that minor point, I think the book is a close to perfect as one can get. I especially like the small piece at the end about mental attitude and how to determine what is &quot;true&quot; with regard to what others say about you. This is a hard concept to understand when one is young. I heartily endorse this book for ANY student starting at about 5th grade to and through college. It will be money well spent!

This writing, using historical illustrations, gives chewable thoughts for those who question the reasoning - the existance - of the Master of the Universe.

I highly recommend giving this book to those still in the thros of deciding on the existance or lordship of God."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"I Was Just Wondering is a collection of essays that Phil Yancey wrote for Christianity Today; he still writes the essays for the magazine. While I haven't read all of his books, I have read many. I read this book on my first sitting because I could see the genesis of his ideas for his other GREAT books (What is So Amazing About Grace, The Jesus I Never Knew, Where is God When it Hurts, etc.) So if you haven't read his other &quot;true&quot; books, read this book first. If you have read his other books, read this one as well. One sees that Yancey's ideas and theses are consistent, uplifting and God-inspired. I enjoyed the book and I am looking forward to reading Yaney's new book (The Bible Jesus Read)."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be totally different. As a matter of fact I considered returning it upon first flipping through. I'm really glad that I didn't send it back. It was the most thought provoking book I have ever read. It totally challenged my Christian attitude and hopefully has made me better."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"Philip Yancey does an awesome job at answering many of today's common questions. With every question, he finds a story or idea from The Bible and relates it very well. I liked it so much that I'm reading it again and taking notes.I have found that this is a tough book to read straight through. It is divided up into many 'chapters' of 3 or 4 pages. I think it would be useful if used as an everyday devotional book and only one section read at a time."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"While I enjoyed reading Yancey's columns here in book form, I have to disagree that this book rates as a 5. If it does, does that mean that &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; is on the same caliber of book? Hardly possible.Mr. Yancey himself states that he really isn't all that interested when he sees a book of previously published material because they are simply not as good as a whole book devoted to a central theme. I have to agree that this book is far less than his other books because of that limitation, but I concur with other reviewers that this is a good book and well worth reading.It is perhaps the kind of book best suited for waiting rooms, bus rides, bathroom reading and the like because each chapter is short and devoted to a concise topic. Also note that if you were a faithful reader of his columns that you'll probably be disappointed in this book as the subject matter isn't written in great enough depth to rehash it.I am not much of a magazine reader, so most of this book was new to me, but some of the chapters included basic thoughts that were expounded on in full books by Yancey. I was able to read quickly through those parts without too much trouble and I didn't find them too much of a distraction.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone new to Philip Yancey, it's an easy place to see if you like his style and take on life, Christian living and the church. If you enjoy this book at all the next thing on your reading list should be one of his best sellers. I have read &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; a couple of times and it really is a great work and &quot;What's so Amazing about Grace?&quot; should be required reading for all."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"First of all, I must confess that I am a fan of the author. Despite the title of my review, I didnt expect this book to give me solid answers to theological questions that only God Himself can reply. However, I couldnt stop myself from expecting much from the same author who gave me divine experience with his classics like \\"The Bible Jesus read\\", \\"Finding God in unexpected places\\", \\"Where is God when it hurts?\\", \\"The Jesus I never knew\\", \\"Soul Survivor\\", and my all time favorite \\"What's so amazing about grace?\\".Some reviewers comment that this is a very deep and difficult book. However, I really think that the author has been improving himself so much over time that his recent works are much better than this one which is a collection of his essays first published on Christianity Today before 1989. In this respect, I should congratulate the author and thank God for using the author to preach His messages so well. However, as a consumer and a common christian, I am obligated to recommend the author's other books (like those mentioned above) instead of this one."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"Not an easy read.

I read the first few pages and it went home with me. Again, I liken my past to that of Philip Yancey and can empathize with the feelings, thought processes and transformation of leaving a legalistic religion, often asking myself similar questions to eventually find the truth so often misinterpreted by those who were trying to \\"raise us right\\". My quotes, not Yancey's. Another one of his books that comes across like a conversation with a close friend."},{"Title":"I Was Just Wondering","review":"I loved this book until the last quarter when I felt that Yancy began preaching and teaching.

The first three-quarters of the book were fairly provacative, but if I wanted to read the standard evangelical point of view on issues like \\"Whatever Happened to Heaven\\" or \\"Job and the Riddles of Suffering\\", I would have bought books under those titles. I would have preferred that Yancy play with the ideas -- not ennumerate them."},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"This book is the sequel for \\"The Evil Twin\\" It's about Margo's twin sister Nora who comes to Sweet Valley at first to search for her twin and then she realizes she is actually dead, but by some reason, that can only happen on books and movies, Margo is really alive and they both plot to take over both of the teens lives!This book was okay not as good as the original, though plus there was too many plotholes from the first book:1. This is really 2 years after the Margo thing, not one year, last year was the year Jessica was engaged to that Jeremy guy and he tried to kill her or something.2. Even if this book takes place one year after the Margo thing, why are the twins still 16 year old high school juniors??3. When Nora's stepmom is telling her the history about her and Margo, she says Margo was given away when she was 3 or 4, but in the original book, it states Margo was abandoned as a baby.4. Since Nora is supposed to be just 17, wasn't it illegal for her stepmom to throw her out the way she did?5. If Margo could have survived the way she did, which in reality is not possible, where had she been the past year(s)? That wasn't explained at allOther then that the book is not bad, but not up to the original either."},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"Margo\`s twin Nora is coming to Sweet Valley to revenge her twins death and trees to kill Jessica or Elizabeth.While she\`s doing that her twin is still alive and she contacts her .Will the evil twins succeed in taking the Wakefield twins lives."},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"Ok, I could buy that there was a girl that looked like Jess and Liz and wanted to kill them. But that SHE has a twin too AND that she lived through that New Year's Eve? Uh-uh. Sorry, but that's just too farfetched, even for Sweet Valley. Once you get past the initial disbelief though, it's a great book. It's almost as exciting and suspenseful as the Evil Twin, although once again, it's unrealistic about why the twins are fighting. Right. Like Jess and Todd are going to get together. (Only in a diary!) I loved it anyway though. I practically ran to the back of the bookstore when it was supposed to come out. Even though, it's kind of unbelievable, it will probably remain one of my favorite books, after the actual Terror series"},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"The Return of The Evil Twin is great!! It sounds similar to The Evil Twin, but a bit more twisted. I like the way how the author has portrayed the Wakefield and Chapelle twins so differently. Some things I think are a bit illogical, such as why would the Chapelle twins say nasty things about the Wakefield twins (in the story) when they want to be them? And why would Margo suddenly appear? Despite those things, Sweet Valley fans will love this book!!!"},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"I was actually surprised at the negative reviews for this book. Yes, I will admit that 'The Evil Twin' was definitely the best of this entire story arch. However, I really enjoyed this book. I thought that it was a great closure to Crazy Margo. I mean, what is better than one Crazy Margo? TWO Crazy Margos!There are some plot holes-- like even though it is supposed to be one year later, the girls are somehow still sixteen (?). Also, I personally thought that the explanation for Margo's escape from her death was weak. But let's be honest here... what else do you expect from a SVH novel? The books were written more for entertainment value, not for literary excellence.One thing about this novel that I thought was particularly entertaining was the way this ghostwriter kept playing on Southern stereotypes. Even back when the novel was first published, that really cracked me up-- especially since Nora's stepmother busted out the line \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\\" HA!I also really appreciated that, for once, ELIZABETH was the jerk. Sometimes, I think Jessica was always portrayed in a negative way, while Elizabeth was Miss Perfect. It was nice that for once Elizabeth was the jerk twin."},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"This is probably the best Sweet Valley book ever!

When I read the others in the mini-series, I was dying to read #100. Althought many say it was too farfetched, I have to disagree. OK, a girl comes from across the country, searching for a better life then the one she left behind. On her way to California, she kills quite a few people to reach her destination. When she arrives in Sweet Valley, she plans to take over an innocent girl's life. It's not farfetched at all, because our world has it's fair share of wackos. Anyway, I thought this book was downright fantastic. It kept me in suspense the entire time. There was one problem in the book, though. It was pretty obvious that Margo wouldn't succeed. I mean, if she did end up killing Elizabeth, what would happen to the series? It couldn't end that abruptly. Other then that, I loved this book. The plot was so complex, I often wondered how the author thought it up. Finally, I would recommend this book to any SVH rea! der who loves the series and hasn't read book #100.

Apparently our evil twin has her own evil twin! Campy, sure, but fun nonetheless.One thing that really did bother me was the fact that Margo and Nora's father gave up one of the twins for adoption. For a father who loved his daughters so much, I found it ludicrous that his new wife was able to force him to give one of the girls away. That was the only part of the story that did not really work for me.The rest of the story, despite its twists, was rather enjoyable. I won't give away anything else, but I will say there were a couple of shockers in here. If you enjoyed the first evil twin story, you should enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"Return of the Evil Twin (Sweet Valley High)","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I loved it!

It was really exciting and amazing how Margo could have lived through the accident from last New Year's Eve. It was a great plot, how Margo's sister came back and joined forces with her, but how did Liz really believe that Jess was going out with Todd. Also, if Jess was going to die, how could there be the rest of the series and SVU. I kind of knew that Nora was killing Margo because no one could have lived through and who else was left who looked like her besides Margo if Liz and Jess were gonna stay alive?

There are wackos and maniacs. It was so unbelievable how Margo could have survived the last New Years. I was sure Jess couldn't have died in it, but the suspense was exilerating! I just couldn't believe it when I saw it! Margo and her OWN twin. I thought return of Margo was weird how she stayed and hid. I think Kate William is a great author for dreaming up this great plot!

He, however, follows the recent trend in biography by feeling it necessary to retail every tiny tidbit he has discovered about John. Long letters are printed, for example, when the relevant information could be capsulized in five words. The reader is finally distracted by the sheer volume of inconsequential material and the overwhelming feeling that the author doesn't believe that the reader can follow where he is going without constant, constant reinforcement. The book edges toward a sixth grade account of the summer at camp in which logical development is snowed under and beautiful writing obscured by detail."},{"Title":"The Will and the Way: Paul R. Williams, Architect","review":"This book, written by Williams, tells a story of a quiet, deliberate, tenacious, focused, genius of a man who should join the likes of Martin Luther King, Paul Roberson and Jackie Robinson during Black History month. &quot;The Will and the Way&quot; is inspirational and filled with how-to's that overcame obstacles he encountered time and time again. His story is one of a gentle man who took a natural talent (drawing) and became an amazing architect. An orphan who didn't let adversity hamper his progress or thwart his dreams. His work ethic and preparedness are unmatched by anyone past or present. He defines &quot;Success&quot;.This is a story of a man of honor, dignity, integrity, superior intelligence and impeccable taste. His life was rich in extraordinary experiences and his public relation skills were stunning. His ability to draw upside down is the most amazing thing ever!The common sense displayed by Williams and the maintenance man at the cotton mill are comforting.

It helped rally the Jewish world in support of the emigration movement. And eventually it helped in the liberation of the Soviet Jews from their prison. Over one million were to come to Israel in the decades ahead.It is rare that a book has so much influence. A courageous witness like Elie Weisel deserves great credit for this historical ' miracle'."},{"Title":"The Jews of silence;: A personal report on Soviet Jewry (A Plume book)","review":"This book, is a classic testament to the brutal persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union during the dark days of Communist opression.With both poetic and potent eloquency Wiesel describes the atmosphere of fear and silence, that reigned among Soviet Jewry during the 1960's when this book was written. The attempts to force Jews to abandon their faith and identity, and to cut ties with their brothers and sisters in Israel, by the malignant and brutal Communist tyrants. then there was the daily disparagement of the State of Israel and the maligning of Zionism by the State Media (something we see in may countries around the world today).Indeed even though Communist tyranny in Russia has collapsed, the crusade of hate by the Left, formulated by Soviet propagandists has only got more vicious and irascible, in recent years.In South Africa, for example, a hard-core Stalinist Cabinet Minister, (of Jewish descent) trained and educated in the old Soviet Union, daily comes up with venomous and ruthless attacks on the Jewish State and it's supporters, and is directing a campaign of ethnic hatred against Israel and it's Jews.But the Jews of the Soviet Union refused to forget who they were, or to give up their faith or their love for the State of Israel.Reffering to the violent anti-Israel propaganda formulated in the Soviet Union, the author explains : \\"The purpose of such propaganda is to make Israel seem hateful to the general populace but to the Jews as well, to undermine the esteem in which they hold the Jewish state, and to convince them finally to relinquish an idea which has failed, a vision of redemption which has somehow been made profane...\\"But this form of psychological warfare, directed against the Jewish dream, and designed to divide Jews of the diaspora from their own people in Israel, failed in Russia.Jews all over the world need to reject it, wherever it raises it's ugly head.As Wiesel describes 'there are Jews who will under no circumstances let themselves be severed from their people'."},{"Title":"The Jews of silence;: A personal report on Soviet Jewry (A Plume book)","review":"very concise and well written .Quite amazing how he was able to meet with the various people who even though they were scared still wanted to talk"},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"This is one of my favorite plays. While Anouilh made Becket a Saxon (historians say he was in fact, a Norman), and that a decade's time is compressed to make a two plus hour play or movie, the fact is that &quot;Becket&quot; is a fast moving, epic saga which dramatizes one of the most heartbreaking episodes in English history.Ignore the negative reviews here. I highly suggest you go see the play if you're lucky enough, or rent the movie with two superb performances from Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton.One last note. While plays tend to suffer when just being read and not performed, &quot;Becket&quot; is a glad exception. It's superbly written and it goes by briskly."},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"Becket is a marvelous dramatical production. Often, it's deep and complicated nature does not entertain average audiences. However, the play deals with the drastic conversion, already brewing within Thomas, spurred by a childish king. Henry is truly the most remarkable character in the play to portray. His childishness and regality class in a torent of anguish with his best friend, and worst enemy, Thomas Becket! This play is a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"I love this play! It's one of my favourites and a wonderful complement to Eliot's \\"Murder in the Cathedral\\". The movie with Richard Burton as Becket is also outstanding. I always carry it along with me when I go in a journey along with Eliot's \\"Four Quartets\\". It shows the humane side of Becket, it is a great study on the human soul. I cannot reccomend it too much. This is the stuff heroes are made of...."},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"First of all, I just want to say that this was one of the greatest books I've ever read. It was fascinating and original. A powerful account of the relationship between two friends. A stunning story of a man who finds honor in the last place he thought he would, and the pain it causes when he is forced to defend it."},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"A terrific read. I agree with most of the reviews here. The story is about two giants of their time, who turn on each other through folly and necessity. That mythological study alone makes this good. Add onto it the scope of a king and an archbishop, a man looking for advise and power and another looking for a purpose in life. Anouilh's stage directions also add an excellent imagery to the story, stark and minimal that evokes an emphasis on the relationships between Henry and Becket. This is a great companion to The Lion in Winter and A Man for All Seasons. From an actor's point of view both leads are attractive, one being furious and physical and the other an internal ball of conflict and spiritual discovery."},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"I don't know what the English translation is like, but the book was great in the original French. Anouilh does a wonderful job with the psychology of his characters. It's not for historical purists, though, because there are several historical inaccuracies. (For example, Thomas was not a Saxon; this is a persistant legend but he was actually a Norman. Also, his personality was somewhat different in real life.) This play served as the basis for the 1964 movie Becket."},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"Historically inaccurate as it may be, this timeless work is at once entertaining and heart wrenching. I have seen negative reviews of this work elsewhere that seem to miss the point. This book is not about a man changing completely overnight; it is about a man who finds an outlet for the honor that was always there. Becket has always done his job perfectly and meticulously, according to him for the sake of \\"aesthetics\\". A lover of only life, he has always been empty, a result of his honor being in conflict with his desire to live well and having to compromise his honor in order to achieve that; his birthright being a lifetime of servitude and poverty otherwise.When his best friend (who happens to be the King) asks him to assume the mantle of Archbishop Of Canterbury he literally begs him not to force the appointment upon the church, foreshadowing the truth Becket already knows deep within: That his honor will no longer be in conflict with his duty should he be appointed to lead the Church Of England (which at that time was still in communion with the Pope). Eventually Becket must chose between his role as Chancellor Of England and Archbishop Of Canterbury, opting for the latter. The choice between the two titles, in itself, was not hard. What was difficult was coming to the realization that he could not serve in both capacities.Aside from missing the truth that Becket did not \\"change\\" in the story, but that he actually was freed to be what he always was (Becket himself actually points out in the story that the \\"change\\" is far too easy, almost enjoyable), it is my feeling that those who do not enjoy the book are also missing the entertainment value. Despite it's deadly poignant nature, the story does not take itself too seriously. The author has admitted it's historical inaccuracy, and the book is rife with comic relief; subtle and otherwise. The story is meant to be simple (as in straightforward and compact), potent, and entertaining on every level. It succeeds on every count.Just be aware: This is actually the play manuscript published in book form. If you are expecting the format of your typical novel, you are in for a bit of an adjustment. Yet, having made the adjustment, it is actually a bit of a refreshing change. Well worth a read!"},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"&quot;Becket&quot; does rise an interesting question about honor, but I didn't enjoy it too much. It was interesting though, how Thomas's instincts, beliefs and morals change when he is appointed archbishop. I don't think there is any possible way that he can change so drastically overnight. Sure, he could have become a religious man, but his WHOLE life changed so quickly. Who knows?"},{"Title":"Becket; or, The honor of God","review":"This book is not very good.

Besides being sexy (they are all sexy), this one was also very funny. Most people will agree that sex is psychological.

There's plenty of thinking about the things that the author is interested in thinking about (the nature of society and the relationship between men and women) but it's not so pontifical as it gets later in the series. And there's just any amount of the preposterous, Burroughs-like fantasy opera, and accompanying dialogue. This book contains probably Norman's single best humorous scene ever. (It starts with one of the characters saying, \\"I chanced by,\\" and ends with him saying, \\"I too had a plan. A counter-plan.\\" It's just hysterical.)Although the philosophizing contines, the books do get more fun again toward the later end of the series (say starting at about book 20.)

To this point previous locations were only variations of the \\"High Cities\\" of Gor. But the Wagon Peoples were a whole new society with customs and mores of their own. This is what intrigued me to the book.The introduction of Elizabeth Cardwell was also a plus. As a kid when reading the book for the first time I could only imagine how beautiful she was. There were honorable allies such as Kamchak and Harold as well as evil villains like Saphrar of Turia. Then there was the neutral and amoral mercenary Ho-Hak.

Without a doubt Nomads of Gor is the best book I have ever read. The characters are full and richly developed, the hero is a hero's hero and the action is practically non-stop. While all of the Tarl Cabot Gor books are exceptional, &quot;Nomads&quot; is the pinnacle of the series. The story is expertly laid out with more twists and turns than OJ's alibi.As the story opens Tarl Cabot, earth born visitor on the Counter-Earth known as Gor, is on an errand from the Priest Kings, the strange rulers of Gor. Tarl's quest is to locate the missing 'egg' of the Priest Kings in order to save their race from extinction. The egg is rumoured to be in the hands of the Nomads of Gor - 4 wandering tribes roaming the plains of Gor.

Unfortunately, the Wagon People are probably the most xenophobic on Gor and will not take kindly to Cabot just walking up and joining them.\\"Nomads of Gor\\" has two great strengths, both of which are rather unique to the series. First, Norman does a masterful job of creating the civilization of the Wagon People, which consists of four tribes. I suppose he might be basing his research on some nomadic tribes of Earth, but I did not sense any strong parallels as I did, for example, with the \\"Viking\\" like \\"Marauders of Gor.\\" We get a sense of the culture of the Tuchuks, one of the four tribes that Cabot stays with as he searches for the egg, which goes well beyond what we have seen up to this point in the series. The customs, especially the competitive games the Wagon Peoples play, are much more detailed than what we had seen in the towered cities of Ar and Ko-ro-ba.Second, this is the funniest of the Gor books, with the humor coming mostly from conversations that involve the character of Harold the Tuchuk, although Kamchak, also of the Tuchucks, has his moments as well. It is not far fetched to say that these are two best-developed supporting characters in the Gor series, and I would contend that this is due in large measure to their sense of humor. But the humor is clearly Norman's, who has this style of using short sentences to develop his droll wit. This is character driven humor, where who says what in which situation makes all the difference; none of the lines that tickle your funny bone would ever evoke a laugh by themselves, because context is everything in Norman's humor.I always wondered why Norman did not return to the Tuchuks later in the series, but maybe he did not think he could pull off a return visit that equaled the success of this effort. This is also the novel that introduces Vella, the former Elizabeth Caldwell of Earth, who becomes one of the key continuing characters in the Tarl Cabot novels. Of course, this opens up the giant can of worm regarding Norman's Gorean philosophy that \\"slavery\\" is the natural state of women, who can only be truly \\"free\\" when they totally submit to a master. I have to admit that I never took this idea beyond the fictional level and that as the series progressed I flipped through the long philosophical discussions between masters and slaves in later novels (Norman is the pseudonym of philosopher Professor John Lange). I also know that there are people who take the Gorean lifestyle very seriously. I could quote Abraham Lincoln in response to this topic, but I would probably be closer to the mark if I just said different strokes for different folks and went my own merry way.The bottom line for me is that I enjoyed Norman's early Gor novels in the seventies the same way I had enjoyed reading Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars novels in the sixties (when I discovered them). The first six novels of the Gor series standup well against the Burroughs novels that obviously inspired Norman in part (there are strong parallels between the first work in each series). If you find the philosophical aspects of these books offensive, then do not read them."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Tarl Cabot, warrior and tarnsman, left the forbidden Sardar Mountains on a mission for the Priest-Kings of Gor, the barbaric world of Counter-Earth. The Priest-Kings were dying, and he had to find their last link to survival. All he knew about his goal was that it lay hidden somewhere among the nomads. There were the Wagon Peoples, the wild tribes that lived off the roving herds of boskm fiercest of the animals of Gor. But still more fierce were their masters, the savage Tuchuks. All men fled before them when they moved. All except Tarl Cabot, who stood alone, watching the oncoming clouds of dust that might bring him death."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Nomads of Gor is the fourth installment in John Norman's series about Tarl Cabot, the professor from Earth who is now a warrior on the planet Gor (the Counter-Earth). In the last book, Priest-Kings of Gor, Tarl was instructed by the Priest-Kings to find their egg -- the last hope of the insectoid Priest-King race. The egg is in the keeping of the wagon people, a fierce group of nomadic tribes. Tarl needs to find these people, infiltrate their society, get the egg, and escape.Gor is an impressive world full of diverse and fascinating geographies, races, languages, cultures, and economic systems which John Norman describes in loving detail. This world-building is the best part of the Gorean Saga. But amongst all this diversity, one thing (surprisingly) remains the same wherever Tarl Cabot goes: every society he encounters captures pretty girls and uses them (branded, chained, and collared) as pleasure slaves.John Norman's favorite trick is to turn a beautiful, independent, and feisty woman into a slave. At first she'll resist and scream \\"Never!\\", \\"I hate you!\\", etc. Then she is subdued by her master and made to learn her place. Soon she is happier than she's ever been in her life because she's learned to give in to her natural desire to be dominated by a man. (Yet, if she's so content, I'm not sure why she still has to wear a leash.)This is my fourth (and last) Gor book and I've had an epiphany. All this time I've been wondering why these \\"spirited\\" women don't get together, rise up, and revolt. They walk around doing chores together, so it'd be easy to plan a night where every fiery female slave stabs or poisons her master. Now, I've finally realized what their problem is... they're all idiots.This is how it goes:Man: You are beautiful and feisty so I want you to be my slave, wench! I will have you!Stupid Wench #1: No way! I am a free woman and my birthday is in a few days. Then I will get my inheritance and become the richest woman in the country. I will never be your slave! NEVER! NEVER! I hate you! NEVER!Man: Stop kicking me and punching me with your tiny fists, feisty wench! You will be my slave!Stupid Wench #1: No! Never! And just to show you how much I hate you, I will now ask this other warrior to challenge you in a duel and I will make myself the prize. You will never have me! NEVER!Man: Actually, I changed my mind. You are not worth fighting for.Stupid Wench #1: What? Am I not beautiful? Don't you want me?Man: No, not really. I've got Stupid Wench #2 over there and she's way better than you.Stupid Wench #1: What? She has fat ankles!Man: Her ankles are sturdy. See how well she runs next to me when I'm riding on my horse.Stupid Wench #1: I am better than her! Fight for me!Stupid Wench #2: I am first girl, you stupid wench! We don't need any other stupid wenches around here. I can do all the washing, cooking, cleaning, animal grooming, poop scooping, kneeling, groveling, and man-pleasing all by myself. You will not outrank me! NEVER!Stupid Wench #1: I am prettier than Stupid Wench #2! My ankles are not fat. Don't you think I'm pretty?Man: You are not worth much.Stupid Wench #1: Fight for me! Fight for me! Put your collar on me, Master!So Man wins Stupid Wench #1 (who loses her inheritance since she's no longer free), outfits her in shiny new handcuffs, ankle rings, and collar, drags her by her hair, throws her across his saddle, and rides off. Stupid Wench #2 is trotting along at his side, sweating and resting her head on his thigh occasionally. Once Stupid Wench #1 is branded and settled in, she and Stupid Wench #2 jealously jostle for position -- taunting each other, sneering, calling names, and sometimes even kicking, biting, and pulling hair... And yet, according to the Gorean philosophy, they're now complete women because they have submitted to a man and are in their proper place...This is just insulting. Not the part about women being willing to submit to men, but the fact that these women are valued only for their beauty and \\"spirit,\\" are so easily beguiled by these men's transparent manipulations, and then are encouraged to jealously compete with each other for the man's affections. Norman wants us to believe his women are wonderful because they're fiery and spirited. But no, they're not. They're all just a bunch of idiots. I say they got what they deserve."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"I want to make it clear that I am reviewing the older version of this book, since it's clear that John Norman changed a lot when he revised his novels. I found Nomads of Gor to be a fun read, with lots of exciting adventure in the vein of Edgar Rice Burroughs and his Mars series. There is more sex in Gor, including sexual slavery, but in the early Norman novels like this one that sort of thing is kept in the background. The hero, Tarl Cabot, repeatedly saves Gor from insidious, hostile aliens, and does so with daring swordplay, witty lines, and stalwart friends like Harold and Elizabeth. It's all good fun and quite frankly the early novels like this one and Assassin of Gor are far more titillating than the later, more explicit ones."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Jumping right into action, the reader may be a little confused for the first page or two, but this is short-lived, as John Norman supplies abundant descriptions and footnotes to edify the reader. The book follows a great story plot of the Wagon People of the great prairies of southern Gor.Tarl Cabot, main character in most of the series, visits the Wagon People, who bear some historical paralells to the Mongol tribes under Ghengis Khan in the early 1200's, questing for an item for the mysterious Priest-Kings. In the course of this search he helps the Thuchuk tribes in a war forced upon them by their neighbors.Of all the books of the Gor series, this is the one that probably has the greatest fan following. I have personal knowledge that at least two groups, with around 300+ members between them, have existed since the 1970's as fans of this book only, ignoring to some degree the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"This is a fine book, which precedes Norman's slide into slave and male vs female gibberish. I do not think it his Gor pinnacle. Marauders is my favorite; if you read all the novels from Tarnsman through Explorer (save Kajira) you will be well rewarded. Also, Nomads makes no sense plot-wise unless you read Priest Kings first. Nomads can be read over and over (I have) with great enjoyment"},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Tarzan this is not. Tarzan spoke multiple languages, and was a very Victorian kind of fellow. There was never anything improper about his conduct. This is the world of teenage male fantasy, a world where they have power, and can follow their hormones, you might say. I read this in high school. I think a movie was actually made of this. I did go on to research the history of cultures, to find out what Norman used in his pastiche, and the book is useful for that. Parents who want to keep their teenaged boys sheltered may not like this book. I have a cousin who kept his sons sheltered, even home schooled them. One of them went into the Army last year. I suspect he is in an unpleasant situation, which his life experience did not prepare him for. High school is painful for teenaged boys, escapist stuff like this is one way to escape the pain, without using addictive substances. The Dept of Justice estimates that 80% of American high school students regularly use drugs, alcohol, or both. My daughter agreed with this, for her high school. Now that is just not healthy. If you need addictions, the printed word at least doesn't cause physical damage. One outgrows this sort of thing, eventually. One moves to books likeThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy;The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original),Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),Redneck Shaman,The Tracker, andUltimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods. Still, books like this made high school bearable. The basic story is our hero goes to a counter-earth, which has a culture any high school male would enjoy. It is swords, action, women, rather better than the Forgotten Worlds series my nephew enjoys, to my mind."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"This is the fourth book in the Gorean Saga. Tarl Cabot lives with the wagon people who roam around Gor on wagons driven by animals called Bosks.The book has a fulfilling adventure and you get to learn in depth about the culture of the nomads of Gor. They are similar to the other Goreans in their culture but they are not as civilized. The book has lots of action and the bad guy is really bad. It also has an appropriate monster for a book of this sort to have."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Not ever being a gor fan I really enjoyed this book. Infact its been very helpful to me in my research to better understand gor for roleplay purposes in secondlife gor. I am fond of the warriors of the wagon peoples and enjoyed this adventure with Tarl Cabot. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Gor."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"It's so hard to know how to review this book. Does one appreciate it for being an antiquated relic of SciFi-Fantasy? Or boggle at the mind-blowingly bad writing so dreadful that it not only sweeps past the So-Bad-Its-Good category but moves right on over to self-parody! Finishing this book left me with so many feelings it's hard to address them all. As I sort through the chaos one thing becomes clear---there is simply NO WAY this series would have been successful had it been published in the modern era. Sure there's lots of violence--- but all of it is bloodless and non-graphic. Not exactly shocking to a public who watches snuff films like the \\"Saw\\" series for fun. The sex is barely alluded to and altogether tame to tastes jaded by Starz's \\"Spartacus\\" and other fantasy sexploitation shows. In fact, it seems positively prudish, even quaint. It is hard to imagine that this is the series that sparked Feminist protests and got the author banned from SciFi conventions in the 80's. Mr. Norman should write Gloria Steinem a thankyou note for without the all the \\"controversy\\" I doubt the series would have had the staying power it has enjoyed. I suppose we owe the author our gratitude for bringing Middle America's naughty little SnM fantasies out of the closet and into our living rooms but other than nostalgia or a glimpse of pop culture history I can't think of a single reason to read this book. I guess ultimately the only measure of a book like this is \\"Were you entertained?\\" I must admit I couldn't put this book down--if only to see how much more ridiculous it could get!A note on the Star Rating: I really don't know how to give this rating either. One Star for the terrible writing? 5 Stars for the entertainment value? Heck with it! FIVE STARS Because writing this bad takes a special talent."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"So far, the best in series. This book has some very humorous characters and lots of action and detail about the world of Gor. The Wagon Peoples are described to perfection. There is only one boring chapter concerning Tarl and Elizabeth in the wagon but other than that, the story was fantastic."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"This is easily my favorite among the earlier Gor books. It is the most action-packed and exotic, in terms of the locale of the setting. The friendship between Tarl and Kamchak came off as the most genuine of all the his \\"running partners\\".This book gets to the essence of what Gor is better than any of the early books. If Tarl had already made the transition from soft Earth man to true Gorean, it would have been perfect."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Actually, I liked this one the best. Good, well told advneture story. Norman Continues his actions story in good form in this one. As with the other books in this series, you probably have to take the politically incorrect relationship between men and woman for what it is here...a story. Our hero, as one reviewer put it, comes up a bit short is being a \\"Good Old Gor Boy,\\" but that is understandable with his not being from that planet to begin with. All in all, great adventure, well written and if you are looking for a bit of John Carter of Mars, who is a bit over the edge, this is for you. Recommend this one and this servies for the more mature reader."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"disgusting ideology, such as claiming true love between woman and man could only be found if the woman is a true slave to the man, under fear of the whip. Women are abducted, forced into slavery, and risk their lives if they try fleeing. They are slept in chains and kept in very harsh conditions."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"Definately the best of all the John Norman books. The characters leap from the pages into your heart and the heroes tear cheers from your lips! Without doubt, the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's. IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - in my copy, a 1975 reprint, the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange. Makes me wonder if Norman isn't a pen name.2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, which sort of tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.11.) Slave Girl... - 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman John Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.15.) Rogue... - 1981. John Marshall wanders free on Gor.16.) Guardsman... - 1981. John Marshall earns a homeland.17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.18.) Blood Brothers... - unread. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. I read Savages and was bored when it just petered out at the end with no dramatic climax. So I didn't buy Blood Brothers. Now I hear that this book has all that and more, oh well.19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival.21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again.22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.23.) Vagabonds... - unread.24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus (or possibly Tarl?) with amnesia, told by a slave girl.26.) Prize... - unread. It seems that this is not yet published, but forthcoming."},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"I have always considered &quot;Assassins of Gor&quot; to be John Norman's magnum opus in his Counter-Earth series, but there is no more enjoyable novel than the novel that comes before it &quot;Nomads of Gor.&quot; After bonding with the Priest-King Misk, Tarl Cabot is sent from the Sardar Mountains to find the last egg of the Priest-Kings, which has been hidden among the Wagon People.

I cannot imagine $25 better spent.

I truly enjoyed the first 6 novels, both as entertaining science fiction, and as mild erotica. (being female, I found the whole \\"women are natural slaves to strong and sexy men\\" aspect of the books intriguing in a strictly playful sense)\\"Nomads\\" is my favorite of the series because the characters are so enjoyable and the humor is a strong component of the story. I have read that others thought the series didn't really take off until later. Personally, I found that after the 8th book or so, the author seemed to get bogged down with the psychological, sexual, and philosophic ideas portrayed in the novels, and it just wasn't fun anymore.I have the first 10 books with the old cover art. I just noticed that the new covers have lost any hint of \\"this is science fiction\\" and only portray an actual photograph of a naked woman in chains.

The strong point of Priest-Kings was the depiction of a truly alien culture. The culture in this one is not quite so alien...the lifestyle of the Wagon Peoples is based on that of the Mongol hordes of the 13th C. In all other respects this book is even better than the first. I'd even go so far as to say that it has all one could ask for in an action-adventure story: plenty of action, delightful characters (especially Kamchak and Harold), a richly detailed society, humor, intrigue, surprises (but I did guess most of them before they were revealed), and even one of the most bizarre monsters I've ever read about. Particularly delightful was the sequence where Tarl Cabot and Harold go to the walled city of Turia on their separate missions. Fast-paced and humorous, it reads like something out of the Arabian Nights. There is one other aspect of the book that needs to be addressed: the issue of slavery and abusive behavior towards women. It's much more prominent in this book than in Priest-Kings. There is no doubt in my mind that the kind of actions depicted here happened in the real world of the Mongols but I don't think he has quite gotten the psychology of the situation right, at least for most people. There are three women in this book who come to be dominated: Aphris of Turia, Hereena of the First Wagon, and Elizabeth Cardwell of New York (yes, New York!). The first two are haughty, even arrogant, and despise the men who come to dominate them, the third is simply terrified of the situation she finds herself in. Yet, when given the opportunity to escape slavery and go back to their former lives of power and luxury, they choose not to because they have become so fulfilled by the domination of their Masters. Nonsense! Well, there are submissive personalities out there (male and female) and if that is what they want for their lifestyles who am I to say no, but that certainly does not fit the profile of Aphris or Hereena. Norman seems to be saying that slavery is the &quot;natural&quot; lifestyle for all women and that is just wrong. So here is my dilemma: John Norman is obviously a master storyteller but if the reviews of his other books on this website are any indication, he hasn't even hit his stride yet on the slavery theme. I feel conflicted. There are lots of Gor books out there that I would probably enjoy immensely if it weren't for the gender issues but then they wouldn't really be Gor books without the gender issues, now, would they? I like what I've read so far but don't like where I think this series is headed. What to do, what to do?"},{"Title":"Nomads Of Gor","review":"NOMADS OF GOR is one of the most beloved entries in the chronicles of Counter-Earth. And why not? NOMADS' colorful characters and dizzying invention, slapstick humor and pulse-quickening high adventure make it a fun and uncomplicated read. Even as a teenager I was struck by the Yin-Yang quality of Love War, a clever duality and even more poignant to Americans in 1969. To this day that chapter title comes to mind whenever I think about NOMADS. And let's not forget the man you dare not bet with, Kamchak of the Tuchuks, a brutal, violent killer painted in soft hues by Norman into an avuncular, cuddly rogue reminiscent of Fleming's Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. No spoilers, but Kamchak tests Cabot's friendship in the beginning, and his patience throughout. In one revealing scene in NOMADS Kamchak compliments Cabot on how well he reads Gorean after judging his response in an awkward situation potentially lethal for newcomer Cabot.There's not much to say about this superb adventure novel that's not already been said, so I won't. Although I will mention a criticism Amazon reviewers level against author John Norman (Lange) frequently in the reviews of his books. And that is his writing is bad, ungrammatical. What are these critics talking about anyway? Norman is a masterful prose stylist. Not many modern authors write in such an attention-getting grand style anymore. Nowadays most opt for a clean-cut pared-down prose, a non-style if you will. Among many current mystery novelists this dearth of style is almost interchangeable.Norman is playful with words, toying with them endlessly more than other scribes. And his playfulness stands out, threatening at times to impede the sentence flow. Never does he go over the top with his literary conceits enough to interrupt the forward narrative drive. Sentence by sentence the syntax, punctuation, double negatives, the High Speech cadences with lots of commas but never an apostrophe, and the uncommon word choices Norman employ are the heart and soul of the Gor books. It is simply the perfect vehicle in which to authoritatively roll these stories out in.Forging a style as recognizable and effective as Norman's is innovative on his part, original and definitely not easy. Add his powerful imagination (equal to or greater than the mighty Robert E. Howard's) and you get tales that resonate with courage, loyalty and love played out against a most convincing high fantasy backdrop. That's not called bad writing, my naysaying friends, those are writing chops."},{"Title":"Happy Trails: Bloom County Selections","review":"Bloom County's departure from newspapers on 6 August 1989 was met with only moderate sadness, as within a very few weeks most of those same papers would begin carrying Breathed's follow-up strip, the Sunday-only Outland. But it was still a very sad event for those of us who had followed the strip from its earliest days as a &quot;rural Doonesbury&quot; to its emergence as a surrealistic, fourth-wall breaking, somewhat sentimental, and delightfully askew look at the follies of the world we all share, as seen through the eyes of Opus the penguin, arguably the Pogo of the late twentieth century, and his friends at the Bloom Boarding House.This last collection of Bloom County takes us from January to August 1989 - the last seven months of the strip - and includes some parting shots at Donald Trump (whose brain somehow finds its way into one Mr. Bill D. Cat), Mary Kay cosmetics, 1-900 phone services, runaway consumerism, and the questionable nature of what humanity considers &quot;progress.&quot; Opus pens his autobiography (which Milo extensively rewrites and sells off as a Movie-of-the-Week), Rosebud (recently &quot;outed&quot; as a female playing a male role) gives birth to 63 &quot;jackabasselope&quot; offspring, and Steve Dallas returns to he &quot;Neanderthal&quot; roots... just in time for the Trump-brained Bill to buy the strip out from under everyone. The last few weeks of Bloom County show the cast moving on - Steve tries to get into action comics, Oliver's transferred to Family Circus, Portnoy and Hodge-Podge end up cleaning up after Marmaduke, and so on. As for Opus himself... well, you'll have to read the book to find out. Suffice to say, the final six dailies serve as a suitable transition from Bloom County to Outland.Highly recommended to Bloom County and/or Berkeley Breathed fans. It's not the BEST book in the series, but that doesn't make it any less of a must-read."},{"Title":"Happy Trails: Bloom County Selections","review":"I remember reading this book early 90's and it literally made my stomach ache with sadness to read the final 10-15 pages.

So much emphasis is placed on his plays, however, that it is easy to forget that Williams--poet, novelist, essayist--was a true man of letters. While it lacks the intensity of &quot;Streetcar&quot; or the heartbreaking tenderness of &quot;The Glass Menagerie,&quot; &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; is vintage Williams just the same. Williams once said that he was interested in characters who &quot;were frightened of life. . .who were desperate to reach out to another person.&quot; Karen Stone, a lonely, fragile woman who is desperate to &quot;stop the drift&quot; following the death of her husband and her own fading youth and beauty, is such a character. It will never be considered one of his masterpieces, but it will touch your heart in a way that only Williams can."},{"Title":"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone","review":"Two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Tennessee Williams abandons his southern roots by setting his fascinating first novel (1950) in Rome, just after World War II. An American actress, recently widowed, decides to live in Rome after retiring from the stage. Karen Stone, now in her fifties, is still nursing her ego after attempting but failing to be a convincing Juliet, the critics having cruelly pointed out her advanced age. Sensitive about the loss of her beauty and her plummeting career, Mrs. Stone plans to lead a less visible life in Rome.Making the acquaintance of the Contessa, a friendly but cruelly manipulative and impoverished woman who introduces her to a series of beautiful young men, Mrs. Stone allows herself to be escorted but refuses the young men's other favors. Even with Paolo, the most attractive of her escorts, she maintains her dignity, until, after a particularly bitter argument, she realizes that she can use him for sexual pleasure, without guilt or remorse, since there is no possibility of unforeseen biological consequences.As Mrs. Stone explores her sexuality in an effort to prove her desirability, Williams is remarkably candid about the characters' relationships. Sensitively, and with an expert eye for the vulnerability of women of a \\"certain age,\\" he explores Mrs. Stone's relationship with a long-time female friend, her seemingly passionless marriage to Tom Stone, her budding sexual liberation, and Paolo's relationships with other men and women. Gradually, Mrs. Stone becomes more dependent on Paolo for emotional support while Paolo demands more of Mrs. Stone's financial support, until they both reach breaking point.Williams's vibrant dialogue successfully reveals the tensions and expectations of Mrs. Stone, the Contessa, and Paolo through their conversations, but Williams is also startlingly adept at incorporating symbols which add to the intensity of the internal action. The seasons, the imagery of birds, and even Mrs. Stone's name enhance the plot and themes, while the action ironically mimics the Romeo/Juliet tragedy. Small details add to this irony--a handsome young man follows Mrs. Stone, and as she gazes at him from the top floor of her apartment near the Spanish Steps, the Romeo/Juliet balcony scene comes to mind. Though the novel is sometimes melodramatic, it never becomes maudlin, and the conclusion, totally different from the two films based upon it, involves an emotional resolution, rather than dramatic action. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone","review":"Mr. Williams has managed, yet again, to create a tragic, flawed and brave heroine who stands unique amongst his other memorable female portrayals.Newly widowed, the over-indulged and aging socialite Mrs. Stone travels to Rome where, amongst her circle of charmed and wealthy peers, she discovers truths about her own inner life as well as the seedy underbelly of the society in which she'd til now played a prominent and sneering role.A developing, doomed relationship with a young Italian call-boy (controlled by an equally memorable female pimp) uncovers Mrs. Stone's latent passion and lonliness, leading ultimately to a melodramatic submission to the nihilism of anonymous sex.The depth of Mrs. Stone's passion combined with her reserved dignity represent (to me) the singular beauty and subtle power increasingly inherent in women as we grow older. A beauty and power that are still tragically devalued and discouraged by our society today, more than 30 years after this timeless prose was written.Read this book for yourself, and for all of the women in your life."},{"Title":"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone","review":"This small gem of a book is a brilliant study of an ageing star living in Rome after world war 2. it tracks her gradual decline as her sense of herself is deteriorates through a sad set of circumstances .It is absolutely beautifully written and unforgettable .It is a pity Tennesse Williams is so little read these days . The collection of short stories is also brilliant .

It has a kind of perfection he seldom achieved in his short stories. The latter are often marred by verbosity, obscurity or plotlessness; and sometimes the poetry in prose doesn't fit very well. But here, for once, everything just goes swimmingly from beginning to end.Comparisons with Somerset Maugham's Up at the Villa (1940) are difficult to resist. But they should be resisted! There are countless similarities between the two works but they are entirely superficial: both are something in between novel and short story (called \\"novella\\" for the sake of convenience), both are superbly written and both deal with widows who have some remarkably meaningful adventures in Italy. But that's all. The writing styles, the characters and the main themes couldn't have been more different.Spoilers aheadThe plot is very simple and very naughty. Karen Stone is an aged and faded actress who quits the stage only to have her husband die of heart attack during their extended holiday. She settles in Rome trying to burn as many bridges with her past as possible. But being notoriously wealthy, she becomes a prime target of the old Contessa, a female pimp who lives by offering gigolos to rich American ladies and sharing the profits. After several abortive attempts, Paolo finally succeeds in breaching Mrs Stone's formidable defences. A passionate but predictably doomed romance ensues. That is all.Well, almost. There is one mysterious stranger, a beautiful but very poor young man, who follows Mrs Stone everywhere she goes, occasionally accompanying his presence with obscene gestures. When she is at home, he hangs on the Piazza di Spagna below, keeping an eye on her terrace. Day and night, sun and rain, he is always there, generous offers by homosexual tourists to relieve his destitute condition notwithstanding: \\"for when a man has an appointment with grandeur, he dares not stoop to comfort.\\"As you have rightly guessed by now, the greatness of the book is not in the plot. It never is. It's in the characters. Even the minor ones are drawn with spectacular vividness. The Contessa, for instance, appears but seldom yet her \\"artificial but convincingly effusive warmth\\" is wonderfully conveyed by her elaborately formal speech - and so are her gluttony and her rapacity, both obviously endless. Even the lesbian Meg Bishop, a childhood friend of Karen and now a successful journalist who plays a very minor role in the novella, jumps from the pages, both physically and psychologically, with startling brightness:\\"Meg Bishop was a woman journalist who had written a series of books under the basic title of Meg Sees, all dealing with cataclysmic events in the modern world and ranging historically from the civil war in Spain to the present guerilla fighting in Greece. Ten years of association with brass hats and political bigwigs had effaced any lingering traits of effeminacy in her voice and manner. Unfortunately she did not choose to wear the tailored clothes that would be congruous with her booming, incisive voice and her alert, military bearing. The queenly mink coat that she wore, the pearls and the taffeta dinner gown underneath, gave her a rather shockingly transvestite appearance, almost as though the burly commander of a gunboat had presented himself in the disguise of a wealthy clubwoman.\\"Just for the record, it should be mentioned, again as already obvious, that the writing is ravishing. What other writer would describe menstruation as \\"those red tides that bear organic life forward\\"? Or an airplane as an \\"incredibly soaring but lifeless bird\\"? Such poetic flights may sound pompous out of the context. Oddly enough, they never do on the pages. At least I find the prose, not just smoothly readable, but evocative and affecting. But I guess somebody less enamoured with Tennessee's writings might find it affected and long-winded.The Roman spring of Mrs Stone is a cathartic experience in many ways. For the first time in her life Karen is free from the hectic pursuit of her career, from learning new parts, from the tension of first nights, from the competition with her colleagues, from noisy parties and never-ending hypocrisy. For the first time in her life she actually has some time to think. Since she is by no means stupid, there are many hard truths to accept: her mediocrity on stage, the extreme emptiness of her life, how big a loss the death of her husband really is. Most of all, being a woman of peculiar sensitivity who is exposed to the disturbing influence of the Roman spring, Karen Stone is horrified by \\"the drift\\":\\"There are intervals when a life becomes clouded over by a sense of irreality, when definition is lost, when the rational will, or what passed for it before, has given up control, or the pretense of it. At such times there is a sense of drifting, if not of drowning, in a universe of turbulently rushing fluids or vapors. This was the condition that Mrs Stone had lately been conscious of...\\"[...]\\"The drift was everything that you did without having a reason. But was there a reason for anything at all? Oh, you could invent a reason, and some were plausible. Some were plausible enough for being accepted the way a polite excuse is accepted for convenience or social policy.\\"[...]\\"In the last year or two, the time since the death of her husband and the abandonment of her career, there had been a great but soundless and invisible collapse of barriers in her mind, a great entrance and blowing through of candid acknowledgments, but these did not have to be inscribed on the walls of her rooms. They could be known without even saying, I know them. The drift had direction, if it did not have purpose, and sometimes direction is all that we know of purpose.\\"It is at such moments, when she tentatively discovers herself and questions the meaninglessness of the world, that Karen Stone becomes a heroine I can easily identify with and care a good deal about. So, no doubt, could Tennessee. He unfolds her past life and describes her present spiritual quest with great sensitivity and with great sympathy. It is beyond me how some people could see \\"cruelty\\" in the portrayal of Mrs Stone. (Actually, not least of the book's merits is that even disagreeable characters like Paolo and the Contessa are presented without even a hint of empty moral indignation.) As always in his works, Tennessee takes the trouble to extrapolate from the personal experiences of his characters to some truths of universal significance.The love affair with Paolo is Karen's way to stop the drift, or at least to give it some sort of direction if not purpose. But it also helps that her Roman spring should neatly coincide with her sexual awakening. She's fifty? Well, it's never too late. Though she was devoted to her husband and he simply doted on her, Karen had married Tom Stone - in Meg's blunt words - \\"to avoid copulation\\". Now he is dead and she is menopausal. So she can satisfy her carnal appetites without pangs of conscience and without fearing some conceivable problems. But she needs more than sex and that's all Paolo can offer. In fact, in the end he takes more than he has given:And yet even Paolo, with his minimal perception, had noted in Mrs Stone the existence of a certain loneliness, unusual in kind as well as in degree, which a young adventurer no more encumbered by scruples than himself could turn to his great advantage once he got past her little wall of proprieties and defenses.As both parties were aware that \\"to become the aggressor in a relationship is to forsake an advantage\\", it took some time to walk the short way from the table to the bed. For a while Karen was blissfully happy and Paolo acted being in love very convincingly. Occasionally he came with a revelation that's almost too perceptive for his stupendously superficial mind, all of it virtually concentrated in his groins. Here is one remarkable example of his insight into intimate human relationships:And besides, when you love somebody, you mustn't listen to what they say. They say things to hurt you because they're afraid of being hurt themselves. You must look at the their eyes, said Paolo, and feel their hearts.It's difficult to say how much of that he really meant, though he was probably sincere at the moment of speaking. He even defended Karen against the vitriol of the Contessa who urged him to get as much of her money as possible, arguing that there is \\"no such thing as great American lady\\" because great ladies do not occur in country less than two hundred years old. European snobbery is the least of the Contessa's defects. Whether because of the dreadful poverty, whether because of other reasons, she has lost much of her humanity; only an outer shell of aristocratic elegance has remained. Her assertion that Mrs Stone had no dignity turned out to be quite wrong.Paolo is merely a \\"marchetta\\", as derisively referred to by the Contessa, a boy on the market. Behind his dashing looks and his phony title, below his sleek hair and smooth skin, he is as fickle a creature as there ever was one. Whatever the intensity or the sincerity of his feelings towards Karen, they were soon burned out. Perhaps the Contessa had more to do with this than it seems at first glance, for she played masterfully on his vanity by accusing him of being infatuated with Mrs Stone and by offering him new opportunities. However that may be, when Karen's residual dignity asserted itself, the dreadful end finally came.In her desperation and humiliation, on the spur of the moment, Karen did the only other thing she could to stop the drift again: she admitted into her house the mysterious stranger who had followed her everywhere. Knowing Tennessee's passion for symbols, it is pretty clear that this youth, this constant in a world of drift, is a symbol of death. This forms the tantalising ending of the novella. What is he going to do with her? Rape and kill her? Perhaps. Become her despotic lover and ruin whatever is left of her dignity? Maybe. Turn out to be everything Paolo was and yet everything he could never be? Equally likely. That's something every reader should decide for himself.\\"The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone\\" is an extremely powerful and disturbing work. For mere 116 pages, loosely printed and easily read in a single sitting, it delivers superb characterisation and provokes serious reflection on several not entirely unimportant issues: from personal revelation and sexual obsession to social vacuity and (lack of) cosmic purpose. Essential read for all fans of Tennessee Williams. Not suitable for prudish readers."},{"Title":"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone","review":"The Roman spring of Mrs. Stone is a well crafted short book and an easy, engaging read. Williams finely portrays the mindset of an aging actress that would be applicable to any modern celebrity, male or female, today. We see the maniacle focus on career and staying on top, the disdain of other people, the internal fear and desparation that ultimatley leaves Mrs. Stone completely adrift and ruderless. The setting is post-war Rome where all Romans, aristocratic or otherwise, are poor, and all Americans are rich. Williams is a great wordsmith. His language and story flow nicely and his insight is very good. There was a particular loose end that didn't seem to get tied up.

This is extremely illuminating, and makes the reader think of new things -- an alternate reality for many male viewers. There is an important message here: when we do not include the feminine perspective, we miss seeing part of reality. The author mixes philosophy, science, and feminism in a very readable way, filled with anecdotes and conversations with both women scientists and men who are not afraid of their feminine sides."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil: The Feminine Face of Science","review":"This is a wonderful book that details the difference between how men and women approach science. It demonstrates those charactoristics that women can uniquely bring to science. As a mathematician I was impressed with Dr. Shepherd's rigorous scholarship and enjoyed her interviews with living women scientists. I'm a father of a teenage girl who plans a career in science, and I appreciate the author's efforts to highlight the special ways that women contribute to the scientific effort."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil: The Feminine Face of Science","review":"Although there are many excellent books and articles covering particular aspects of feminism and science, finding a comprehensive text is difficult. I was delighted to discover _Lifting the Veil_ a few years ago, and have been using it ever since as a text in a class I teach, &quot;Feminist Perspectives in Science.&quot; It is written with great sensitivity, insight, clarity, and conviction. Shepherd advocates for greater gender balance in the ways science is conceived, practiced, and taught. Specifically she imagines a more inclusive science--inclusive not only of women and people of color, but also inclusive of certain qualities customarily associated with women and customarily undervalued in Western science. Each chapter features one of these qualities: feeling, receptivity, multiplicity, nurturing, cooperation, intuition, relatedness, and social responsibility. Her writing style is engaging and enjoyable to read. Endnotes, bibliography, and commentary within her text are exceptionally illuminating guides to the literature, and inspire and facilitate further reading. Especially important to me as a teacher is that my students like the book, and read it--even the most skeptical males.Shepherd exposes male bias in science not in an accusatory way but simply by proposing a positive and appealing alternative-- &quot;more creative, more productive, more relevant, and more humane&quot;--noticing how a more &quot;feminine,&quot; inclusive science is emerging already in a thousand different ways, and unveiling the places where it has all along been present but unseen. Her book seems to take into account, as if by design, most of the complaints about science voiced by my students. They find in this book a new face of science to which they can relate."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil: The Feminine Face of Science","review":"Linda Shepherd's book is a must for those seeking to understand why science has such a hard, &quot;macho&quot; edge and why it seems so divorced from wanting to look at the impact on society and the environment.

This book does not strive to bring science down to the reader, instead it seeks to illustrate the beauty and complexity of science and asks the reader to come up. Shepard illustrates her points with allusions to Jungianism and her own personal experiences as a scientist and as a woman (and proves they need not be separated). Shepard examines the effects on science being funded and conducted almost exclusively by men and the changes brought about by the inclusion of women into it at (almost) all levels. She discusses why many scientists are finding their way away from Baconian &quot;rip from nature's breast what you will&quot; philosophy to one more holistic, nurturing and sustaining. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to fall in love with science or understand why scientists act the way they do. Finally, Shepard shows us why the true scientist need not be the cold, unfeeling demagogue society tells us they should be. I would advocate strongly any young woman looking to go into the science read this. Not only would it give her a sense of her past, but a good guide for the present and possible future."},{"Title":"The Body Principal-The Exercise Program for Life","review":"I used the isometric exercises in this book after having my first child in the 80s and my second in the 90s.Easy exercises target almost every problem area without alot of jumping around.Great moves to add to any exercise routine if you want a really nice figure.Had to repurchase because my friend I lent it to can't find it,but oh well it's a good price :)Victoria needs to update this book and republish it or turn it to DVD"},{"Title":"The Body Principal-The Exercise Program for Life","review":"I really like this excersize book I have curvature of the spine and it has helped my posture alot to where I stand up better. the excersizes makes you feel good.

Schopenhauer avoids the use of pretensious &quot;philosophical&quot; jargon and writes in a predominantly literary fashion.The main value in this book is its ideas. Its basic premis is simple, yet the range of topics that Schopenhauer delivers treatises on is quite astounding - art, gambling, contract theory, sexual love and ascetic renunciation, to mention but a few. Only a man of his genius could have found a thread to link these diverse topics together. One does, however, sense at times that he distorts his philospophical beliefs in order to express his revulsion about his least favourite types of human activity.I found the discussions on art the most insightful and rewarding. The book is a good dissection of the blind striving and willing of our world and has the potential to alter the way you view the nature of things."},{"Title":"The world as will and idea","review":"This is a really excellent and readable version of Schopenhauer's seminal work. Any abridgements are very judiciously made, so that none of the essential ideas are left out. The introduction is excellent, and the translation very coherent and easy to follow. It is one of the most engrossing of philosphical primary texts, much easier to understand than Kant, and the presentation and translation are excellent. Anyone with an interest in philosophy, especially in the period of 19th Century philosophy from Kant to Nietzche, will find it indispensable."},{"Title":"The world as will and idea","review":"Truth be told, I came to Schopenhauer's work reluctantly, having been put off by Nietzsche, who - despite an early infatuation with Schopenhauer - later turned against his \\"mentor\\" (of sorts) claiming his work lacked any ethical applicability.Yet, as an avid reader of Buddhist and Western philosophical texts, I found myself repeatedly drawn towards Schopenhauer through various resources. So after putting my prejudices aside, I went to the text itself, and I have to say, I consumed this volume with great enthusiasm: I find Schopenhauer to be one of the clearest, most articulate philosophers in the Western tradition (not unlike a Zen master). His work is, in a word, genius.OK, sure, the \\"Buddha of Frankfurt\\" (his nickname) was no saint, but then again, who is? If you ask me, Schopenhauer's thinking is not to be \\"followed\\" as such, but rather, \\"understood,\\" as I find his quiet reserve inspirational and his attempts at personal fulfillment through ART to be wise and sagely advice.Personally, I found that The World as Will and Idea reminded me of Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene. We are, it seems, reproduction machines. (I also think the fledgling terms Id and Ego might be brought into play as well.)Finally, I must concur with Schopenhauer's university philosophy professor, G.E. Schulze, who told the young thinker to stick with ONLY Plato and Kant. But to that small list I would now add one more name: Arthur Schopenhauer, as he brilliantly merges the thought of Plato and Kant to form a truly original philosophy - and he does so in a much clearer way than, say, Hegel or any other German Idealist might have. That said, I think it is helpful to have read some Plato and Kant before dipping into this text, as I found - and perhaps this is a petty gripe, I dunno - that the introduction by Dave Berman was, unlike Schopenhauer's fine prose itself, dull, unhelpful and, ultimately, uninspiring.I highly recommend this text for both beginners and experts in the field -it is THAT good...and it just might change your whole perspective, if not your way of life. Amazing!"},{"Title":"The world as will and idea","review":"I have returned to this everyman edition of this book many times over the years...nearly every passage is underlined in a different color pen.

It is very readable, and the introduction by David Berman is *wonderful*...it concisely puts Schopenhauer's ideas in context, and it also provides an enlightening introduction that will inspire you to read on, augmenting the accessibility of this already very accessible version.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The world as will and idea","review":"This \\"translation\\" of The World as Will and Idea printed by General Books LLC is terrible.No translator is listed.

It may be a way to find the volume I of this series.G"},{"Title":"The world as will and idea","review":"--Just don't get caught by the precursor hooks on the backmatter.Schopenhauer's significance transcends mere 'anticipation of the discovery of the unconscious by Freud' or existentialism. Hegel, Schopenhauer's arch-enemy and favorite object of contempt, was not widely regarded in his own time; and his influence did not last long beyond his death, --the fascination in more recent times has been due to the recidivists of state capitalism and socialism (Because of Marx's intellectual progeny, in short.) Freud as much borrowed from Spinoza as from Schopenhauer, and to call either of them predecessors in any sense is a debasement, since they are original thinkers in their own right, whereas Freud emphatically is not. Kierkegaard said Schopenhauer was probably the most significant writer of the times and held him in high regard, as Nietzsche would later on. And most, if not all, of Freud is 'precursed' by von Hartmann -one who, by the way, maintains greater credibility as a political thinker than Freud's manic Lacanian ilk.As the greatest student of Kant's thought in the 18th century, Schopenhauer continues to demand the attention of philosophers, among them most recently Ludwig Wittgenstein. If you are considering this is as your first taste of the man's thought, this reviewer would recommend picking up \\"On the Basis of Morality\\" and his Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will, for a sound introduction to this abridgment to his life's work (and Kant's for that matter). As far as it is concerned for the pleasure of lay readers, Schopenhauer is one of the most readable philosophers of modern times (unlike his master, Kant, whose Critique of Pure Reason he had at one point, planned on translating into English.) His forays into music and the arts are of special interest: he played the flute with virtuosity, and was something of a Don Juan; once saw Lord Byron riding a horse on an Italian beach, when his lady gushed over spotting him, he continued walking instead of stopping to chat, humorously enraged by his lady-friend's childish paroxysm of *willful* sycophancy; also- a woman, who may have forced the incident to exploit his wealth, stood outside his apartment speaking at deliberately loud levels. Schopenhauer stepped out to politely ask her to cease and desist as it was early in the morning and he was attempting to write. The second time, the woman finds herself at the mercy of his raging will, --thrown down the flight of steps in a fit of righteous rage (will)! (All this, by a man who owned and dearly loved his poodle.)-- Schopenhauer will not disappoint.[Note on the translation: it's sprightly. Not as exacting as Payne's, and not as humorously faithful to Teutonic syntax as Baily-Saunder's. Quite readable.]"},{"Title":"Henry Ward Beecher,","review":"Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887) was a prominent Congregationalist clergyman, social reformer, abolitionist, and speaker; Lyman Abbott (1835-1922) succeeded Beecher at editor of the Christian Union, and also took over the pulpit of Beecher's church after Beecher's death. Abbott wrote this book in 1903. Abbott suggests, \\"The theological movement which had radically changed the character and spirit of the Church had in America many leaders; chief among them I count Horace Bushnell, Charles G. Finney, and Henry Ward Beecher: the first, the prophet of faith; the second, the prophet of hope; the third, the prophet of love.\\" (Pg. 10)Interestingly, he observes that \\"The doctrine of the abolitionists, summarized in the last four clauses of the platform published in 'The Liberator,' Mr. Beecher never accepted; he was not an abolitionist... he believed that this cause of freedom was best subserved by remaining in the Union, by sustaining the Constitution, by treating slave and slaveholder alike as brother men... and by trusting to the moral influence of persuasion to bring about [slavery's] gradual abolition in the states where it already existed.\\" (Pg. 154-155)Of the infamous accusation that Beecher had an adulterous relation with a married woman, Elizabeth Tilton, \\"nothing of a suspicious character was proved against him, except certain letters written by him... counseling the permanent separation between Mr. and Mrs. Tilton... Mr. Beecher gave both verbal and written expression to the poignancy of his regret, in language which was subsequently distorted into a confession of crime... That he kept silence concerning these charges, until they were given to the public in a form which made silence no longer possible, was in accordance with Mr. Beecher's lifelong principle, to pay no attention to slanders against his name.\\" (Pg. 292)He notes, \\"Mr. Beecher was one of the first ministers in the Christian Church, if not the very first in this country, to advocate the doctrine of evolution as a doctrine which, so far from being inimical to the cause of Christ, was certain to prove its friend and supporter.\\" (Pg. 317)He admits that \\"one important exception\\" in the topics for Beecher's sermons was the absence of even one sermon on the crucifixion: \\"'We cannot find,' say the editors, '...that Mr. Beecher ever preached directly on that subject; on the contrary, he often said that it was impossible; the subject was too awful and sublime.' With this exception, Mr. Beecher was, in the strictest and most primitive sense of the term, a preacher of Christ.\\" (Pg. 347)This sympathetically-told biography is of great use to anyone wanting to know more about this important American religious figure of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Wild Spain","review":"I may have been the first peacetime American to ever be totally unexcited about visiting Europe. I was writing a book that featured adventures on all seven continents, looking for rare and interesting wildlife. Of all the continents, Europe gave me the most trepidation. Where would I go to get away from humans and get closer to animals?When I read the most popular travel guides, all I could find were tips on touristy locations--the exact opposite of what I wanted. Eventually I discovered the \\"Wild Guide\\" series, put out by Interlink Books. Perfect!By using books in the Wild Guide series, such as Wild Spain, my wife and I were able to explore great out-of-the-way places that featured stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife. The end result was an outstanding adventure that became one of my favorite chapters in my book (which I appropriately titled \\"Surprisingly Europe\\").Unfortunately the Wild Guide series has not been updated, and books such as Wild Spain are likely in short supply. If you have interest in the natural side of Europe, snap-up these guides as quickly as you can. Fortunately, most of the places featured in these books should be quite similar to how they were when the series was published.Marty Essen, author ofCool Creatures, Hot Planet: Exploring the Seven Continents"},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"My Freemason book was given to me by my grandma, who's grandma gave it to her.

It's also disturbing that the things that we as Masons hold so sacred (not secret) are available for everyone to see, without strict trial, and due examination, to see if you are worthy of this information. As someone mentioned earlier not every affiliation uses the Duncan, but some do, along with our guide and rule the Holy Bible. Most of us as Masons never was privileged to this information when we decided to join, nor during our travel in search for more light in the higher degrees until we got to that degree, and only then were we able to see the information pertaining to that degree, and no more. So I truly hope that with this ritual being available to everyone, it helps destroy the bad claims about our organization, and get good men to continue to join, to become better men.

Each jurisdiction promulgates its own ritual, but this one's pretty close to the way a Lodge and Chapter operate in New York. So, what's the secret?Just because you know what's in this book and can forge a dues card doesn't make you a Mason. And when you get into the Lodge, you're going to probably be disappointed. It's what's inside the individual that makes him a Mason. I once had a Past Grand Master of Japan tell me that the true secrets of Masonry aren't the grips, words and modes of recognition. There are only two true secrets of Masonry:First: how an organization that's almost 300 years old can bring men of different colors, religions and opinions together in a neutral place and call each other \\"brother\\" and really mean it? It's the original centipede's dilemma.Second: the one thing that cannot be bought, sold, reported, written, or told to anyone inside or outside the Lodge. In fact, it's a masonic offense to do so. It's how you vote on a candidate. it takes a unanimous vote of the lodge for a candidate to be elected. One \\"no\\" vote and he doesn't get in. This is done at the ballot box. How you vote is between you and G-d.This book is a good reference, and anyone who really wants to know just what goes on inside a Lodge during the degrees will get a good idea. Conspiracy theorists and religious zealots will never believe anything other than their own version of what they consider truth. However, if you're a good man and true and believe in the existence of a Supreme Being, then the best way to understand how this all works is to ask at the door; it shall be opened to you."},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"I was looking for a book like this.

The degrees are Mark Master, Past Master, Most Excellent Master, and The Royal Arch. As for me I'm on the Scottish Rite side of masonry, so the additional information is of no use to me, but it's still good information to read.If you want to try and fool somebody by saying you are a mason, with this book you might can pull it off.

On the surface, Duncan's rendition may not appear much dissimilar from other rituals, but it may contain subtle and cryptic clues to Freemasonry's origins and true nature where others don't. (Maybe that's not something to imply here. But it's something for Freemasons to consider.) In my empirical opinion: if earnestly contemplated, Duncan's ritual will help the diligent Freemason unlock the \\"secrets within the secret.\\" Of course, there is ultimately much more to Masonic practice and ritual than what meets the blindfolded eye.The book's illustrations, rendered quite generously throughout, often gives lay readers an invalid impression that they finally know all about the goings-on in Freemasonry. Therefore, for non-masons who are simply curious about Freemasonry (as they so often are), there is a lot here to entertain the eye and bedazzle the mind. But nothing here is a substitute for actual lodge experience. My advice for non-masons: Don't try this stuff at home! And I doubt if most Freemasons realize that the parade of illustrations, while for the most part do accurately depict some Freemasonic lodge activity, may also be the author's cleverly placed distractions-- for the profane (non-masons)-- from what he is really putting down in the book. For instance, not only do I find clever clues and key words with cryptic connotation in the text, I also discern inscrutable configurations in the illustrations.Am I a loon? Maybe. But then, Freemasons are accused of discerning Masonic symbols in the layout of Washington, D.C.. Now I'm not suggesting anyone enter a matrix and swallow a red or blue pill before doing so, but for Freemasons who want to know how deep the rabbit hole really goes, this could be a place to start digging. This book is a real gem, almost more of a reference resource than a ritual, and that is perhaps why it's still around."},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"This variation on Masonic monitors was dated even for its day, and is most interesting for the inevitable differences found across geographic areas at that time.

At the same time I was impressed how the overall feel has been maintained over time. Even more valued to me is that the reader is given the opportunity to understand the reasons for the symbols and ritual.For the interested non-Mason I think you'll find interesting insights into ceremonies that are intended to bring men together for common cause. It's easy for many to focus on the details of the ceremonies as outlined in Monitors like this.But do some comparative reading with this text and you'll appreciate the psychology of self-discovery through fraternity with good people. One good subject for comparative reading is Simon's Standard Masonic Monitor.I very much encourage casual readers to this text. Scholars are encouraged to seek out original editions provided by credentialed antiquarian bookdealers."},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"An excellent reference manual for the Brothers. This is more of a textbook of Masonic Practice, than anything. This is not a read for those who are not Mason's, but more of a general textbook for the Fraternity. Non-Mason's will not get much out of it, but the Order will enjoy this as a culmination of Monitors."},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"I can neither validate, nor deny the voracity of this monitor in good faith. I can tell you as a Mason that I use Duncan's Ritual and I highly recommend Duncan's Ritual. Moreover, when I meet someone who shows an interest in or proclivity for The Craft I always leave them with Duncan's Ritual.I can also tell any non-Mason in good faith that Duncan's Ritual does not misrepresent Freemasonry.The only thing that Duncan's monitor fails to do is inculcate the deeper meaning and ultimately the value of Masonry, to the individual and society. That can only come from participating in the search for \\"light,\\" and through the ministration of Brotherly Love."},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"This compilation of rituals is basically intended for those duly initiated into the so-called \\"York\\" or US free-masonic rite. This rite much resembles the \\"Standard Rite of Scotland\\" (not to be confused with the so-called \\"Scottish Rite\\"!). Given the purpose of the book, this reviewer does not find it appropriate to criticise the US Rite as such in this context.Of course the reader should be aware that there are several rites and variants thereof practised in Freemasonry, some, e.g. the Emulation Rite practised in England and the French Rite, more \\"adogmatic\\"; others, e.g. the Scandinavian and Rectified Scottish Rites, on the other hand even more closely frameworked to the Christian Tradition than the \\"York\\" Rite.Those who are adherents to others religious Traditions than Christianity will find that this Ritual leaves out pre-Abrahamic references contained in some other rituals, for example to the \\"Morning Star\\", and in footnotes e.g. on page 147 often \\"bends\\" the explanations to make them conform to exoteric Christian theology. It thus simply misses a vital point that Hiram Abiff was a \\"pagan\\", honoured beyond any Israelite by final burial nearest to the Sanctum Sanctorum.The size, quality, typeface, paper, binding, etc. of the book are simply excellent for the stated purpose. The explanations and comments are very useful and well balanced.Problematic may well be the availability of this book to the general public. It is not a substitute for proper initiation and cannot, as can no book, convey the real essentials of Freemasonry."},{"Title":"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor","review":"For us coming from Emulation Rite in Europe, this book shows that we share 99% of the rituals described!

It is full of practical advice about how to turn knowledge into learning. Cavaleri and Seivert recommend that we experiment with our behavior to generate concrete experience which we think thoughtfully about before deciding what is the value of what we have learned. Then we can apply our knowledge to take effective action to solve problems and make decisions.This model is dynamic and meant to be acted upon continuously throughout our life. Knowledge is always provisional; that is, meant to be tested by some new experiment which generates experience that may or may not confirm what we think we know. By the way, what we think we know is often wrong. Cavaleri and Seibert convincingly demonstrate the power of our biases to lead us astray. Constant feedback from the environment and from those we work with is necessary to provide truth value to our knowledge.I must admit, I loved this book and recommend it highly. Clearly written with many useful examples, Knowledge Leadership will help the reader to practice taking an active approach to learning that builds on constant experiment to deepen understanding of an ever changing world. This is not simply a book to be read and thought about; it is a call to action. In Knowlege Leadership Cavaleri and Seibert give us the tools to turn action into useful knowledge.Buy this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Knowledge Leadership: The Art and Science of the Knowledge-based Organization (KMCI Press)","review":"\\"Stimulate passion for (knowledge) exploitation &aacute;nd exploration !\\". That's the message Steven Cavaleri and Sharon Seivert offer us in this thoughtful new book. Organizations can create more value when the innovative knowledge leadership principles, described in this book produce results that are difficult to imitate. Knowledge leaders can discover unique ways to use knowledge to realize sustainable competitive advantage. But what does this really mean in practice? How do we get there? How can we become more pragmatic in using knowledge to improve performance - both as individuals and organizations? What can we learn from theory, science, business practice (companies as Toyota) and history ? These and many other questions are clearly answered by the authors all in the context of the intriguing process of what they call knowledge leadership.Cavaleri, one of the founding fathers of what has come to be known as The New Knowledge Management (TNKM) and Seivert suggest to leaders that it's time to shift their perspective toward envisioning how knowledge can be used to drive performance to higher levels. And that knowledge in organizations is better led than managed. The book reflects this theme using the eclectic and inclusive thinking of its authors throughout all 359 pages of the book. For example, the authors use strict dichotomies between various learning styles, personality types, and organizational systems. And through their delicate balancing act, they always lead the reader to higher levels of synthesis, balance, and harmony in envisioning a new role for knowledge in companies. This book is aimed toward all levels of knowledge-workers, including everyone in a company from the CEO on down. Everyone can become a Knowledge Leader. The authors focus early in the book on the importance of Personal Knowledge Development - something that is missing from most conventional Knowledge Management (KM) approaches.Knowledge Leadership is a rare book in that in builds on a deep philosophical understanding to explain how learning, knowledge and action can be united in the form of a practical knowledge strategy. The authors describe a new and wonderful unified Pragmatic framework with converging concepts from KM, OL, TQM and action learning, all based on the conceptual foundations established by renowned American intellectual, Charles Sanders Peirce. The authors use Peirce's philosophy of Pragmatism to intricately weave an approach that links knowledge to business performance by building upon the scientific method of experimentation.The first six chapters deal with explaining a pragmatic approach to knowledge leadership, while chapters seven to eleven deal with using pragmatic knowledge to improve performance in both personal and corporate settings. Chapters twelve to fifteen describe the normative model of a pragmatic FAST-Knowledge-based Organization (FAST is an acronym that describes knowledge that is Functional + Timely and Adaptive + Sustainable). Finally chapter sixteen puts it all together providing a meta-framework using 5-Point Dynamic Mapping.Knowledge Leadership is a colourful book that uses the dramatic personality archetypes first proposed by Arthur Koestler: the Yogi and Commissar. This provides a solid base for describing the roots of knowledge leadership found within theories of learning. Using this model, readers are able to assess their own knowledge-creating style. Chapter 3 presents a short form of the Knowledge-Bias profile. I found this profile an amazing tool to diagnose my own leadership style (and to compare it with the results of their cross-cultural study) to learn the benefits and limitations of my own style.Organizational failures are often caused by ineffectiveness, but few management approaches address this problem. The authors stress the importance of pragmatic knowledge as the missing link for improving business performance. They carefully lay out the basic concepts of their model: a pragmatic and fallabilist perspective on knowledge. I agree with the authors that our own lessons of experience about what works best in practice, will enable us to know what actions are truly most effective. The authors take a bold step to propose a company-wide approach in which all people create pragmatic knowledge based upon their own problem solving experiences, and openly interact with others in Communities (of Inquiry) to validate new knowledge claims. It is clear that Knowledge Development is truly the domain of us all.Cavaleri and Seivert then take a final, brave step in the last section of the book. They introduce a normative model called the FAST-Knowledge-Based Organization (KBO). It is a prescriptive model and specifies an end state vision and the necessary innovative organizational principles (self-organisation, balancing high levels of innovation and knowledge creation with improvement in productivity and efficiency), etc.I rate this book with 5 stars. This book is very well written, easy to read (good summaries, stories and examples), and provides lots of new stimulating visions, concepts, models, and engaging assessment tools and tests. My conclusion is that the authors brilliantly (re)tell the tale of TNKM for a more general public in an understandable way, and by doing so enriched TNKM and management science with their elaborated concept- perhaps it should be called \\"The New Knowledge Leadership\\"? But how to deal with the tension between the new Knowledge Leader and an Old Organization?Henk Hadders (Assen)"},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Transgressions provides readers with the opportunity to sample ten different offerings from ten different authors. There is a gritty 87th Precinct novella from Ed Mcbain and a lyrical offering on a child abduction from Joyce Carol Oates. Steven King is well represented with a short but strangely moving tale of a 911 survivor haunted by his souveniers from his unlucky co-workers.I enjoyed Transgressions for both its quality and variety. While no story in particular was a stand out, each provided a sample of the particular author's style. Like a buffet, a taste is really all you need to determine where (and whether) you will return for second and third helpings."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Novellas are an odd duck, significantly longer than short stories and much shorter than full length novels. I suspect that it takes considerable self discipline to maintain one's focus for from between 10,000 and 40,000 words (which may explain why novellas are infrequent). Whatever it takes, Ed McBain inveigled a terrific coterie of writers to create a series of wonderful stories which can keep you going from the beach to the mountains.From the humor of Donald Westlake to Anne Perry's haunting depiction of northern Ireland's \\"troubles\\" to Stephen King's eerie recollection of the tangible memories of the victims of 9/11 to Walter Mosley's tour de force creation of Archibald Lawless, anarchist, McBain has forged a memorable collection of just good fiction. Indeed, I hope that this volume becomes a real tribute to Ed McBain's skill as a story selector!This is a can't miss read."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Oh. My. God. I passed up buying the complete short stories of Raymond Chandler for this one. McBain, Mosley, King, Westlake, Deaver, and Block sharing the same book? And, mind you, not with any skinny little throwaway, wrote-in-a-weekend, virgin Bloody Mary shorts, but with big phhhhhat novellas. The novella is one of the greatest lost forms of detective fiction -- a dense, polished gem waiting for future generations to find in a dusty magazine pile or anchoring an obese anthology.Fitting that Ed McBain -- whose nearly-half century-aged 87th Precinct is still going strong and fresh -- would revive the novella. His own contribution is a new 87th Precinct novel-in-miniature, \\"Merely Hate,\\" which just simply rocks. The post-9/11 theme of religious and cultural intolerance rockets along with serial murder, terrorism, media satire, and those great McBain cops and characters. The whole squad chimes in in the course of this unexpected marvel, and it all wraps up in the kind of twist McBain's become famous for.I moved on to Lawrence Block's new Keller novelette -- another score for my favorite hitman -- and on to Donald Westlake's latest raucous caper for hapless Dortmunder and felonious friends. I'm saving the Stephen King as a sort of creme brulee capper, but so far, my fictional world has been rocked to its foundations.I'll buy Chandler next paycheck."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"After the success of his novel BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, Evan Hunter (Ed McBain) turned to what were then referred to as \\"novelettes,\\" his subject being the 87th Precinct detectives of Isola (think New York). As time passed, the 87th Precinct novelettes grew to full-length novels. Fifty years later, McBain persuaded nine other mystery, thriller, and horror writers to submit what are now called \\"novellas\\" of around a hundred pages each.The result was one of my most enjoyable reads of 2006. I don't know why I don't read more anthologies. It was in an anthology that I first experienced Stuart Kaminsky, Sharyn McCrumb, and Lawrence Block.Coincidentally, one of the best novellas in this anthology is one by Block. Block returns with his enigmatic hit man Keller in KELLER'S ADJUSTMENT. Block manages to make us feel empathy for the man. Although he has sex with a Phoenix real estate saleslady, Keller is essentially a lonely man. He needs somebody to talk to. He once had a dog, but a former girlfriend took it with him when she left; he went to a therapist, but the therapist turned into a snoop, and he had to dust him. Unwilling to take a chance on a living breathing entity, Keller buys a stuffed animal to talk to.Jeffrey Deaver also responded to the call with FOREVER. In it he introduces Tal Simms, a mathematician/statistician working for Westbrook County Sheriff's Department. Simms is considered a \\"computer geek\\" by the rest of the detective squad, especially homicide detective Greg \\"Bear\\" LaTour. Simms and his eventual partner LaTour are confronted with several suspicious suicides. Older rich couples are killing themselves under dubious circumstances. In most respects, the underdog character Simms is every bit as likable as Lincoln Rhymes. I would definitely buy a full length novel featuring Simms.A new discovery for me was John Farris. Farris's THE RANSOME WOMEN concerns a beautiful art appraiser named Echo Halloran who agrees to pose for the great artist John Leland Ransome. She's not only flattered, but as a budding artist herself, she wants to learn from him. Her boyfriend, police detective Peter O'Neil, is suspicious, and with good reason. I enjoyed this novella so much I ran right out and bought FURY, THE TERROR Farris's masterwork.I have to admit that Ed McBain's own contribution, MERELY HATE, was my principal motivation for purchasing the anthology. I needed my 87th Precinct fix, and it's great as usual. It is post 9/11 in Isola, and the detectives are called to investigate the murder of a Muslim cab driver. Through these cab driver murders, McBain capsulizes the reason for the problems in the Mid East.Other writers who contributed novellas were Donald Westlake, Anne Perry, Joyce Carol Oates, Walter Mosley, Sharyn McCrumb, and Stephen King. All of them were excellent."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Reviewing an anthology like this is rather difficult; the best way is probably to divide them into three groups.The OK:* \\"Walking Around Money\\" (Donald Westlake) is the story of hapless thief John Dortmunder; it's amusing, but didn't excite me.* \\"Merely Hate\\" (Ed McBain, the editor of the anthology), is a compelling story, one of dozens set in the 87th Precinct. It's lucky that his knowledge of Islam isn't pivotal to the story, because there are numerous errors (though not quite as glaring as, say, those in Matthew Reilly's \\"Scarecrow\\" or Tom Clancy's \\"The Teeth of the Tiger\\").* \\"Keller's Adjustment\\" (Lawrence Block) is a character study about an unusual assassin. I haven't read anything else by Block, so I can't really say much more.The not-so-great:* \\"The Corn Maiden\\" (Joyce Carol Oates) didn't live up to its billing (\\"a spiral of destruction and despair\\"); its language shifts on a dime from educated to stilted, and it's badly edited, too (one character's surname is spelled *four* different ways).* \\"The Resurrection Man\\" is a fictional biography of a man doing a necessary, but despicable, job in the 19th century. It's fascinating, but rather thin on plot.The great:* \\"Hostages\\" (Anne Perry) is the most \\"literary\\" of the works here, but it's still a compelling read about the tragedies of human nature.* \\"Archibald Lawless, Anarchist at Large\\" (Walter Mosley) would make a great novel.* \\"The Things They Left Behind\\" (Stephen King) is an elegy about life, loss, and ultimately hope, in the wake of 9/11. [It's also the shortest novella in the anthology by far.]* \\"The Ransome Women\\" (John Farris) is an unusual love story, and a perfect entertainment for a rainy night.* \\"Forever\\" (Jeffery Deaver) introduces Talbot Simms, cop/statistician. He's an intriguing character, and I'd love to see him get a full-length novel of his own.All in all, a great read; even the not-so-great novellas are still worth the time."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"As the editor of this compilation (Ed McBain, aka Evan Hunter) says, novellas are rather unusual these days, although in the old pulp fiction days they were fairly thick on the ground. A novella is, as defined in the publishing world, a story that is longer than a short story (which usually runs up to 5,000 words) and shorter than a novel (usually more than 60,000 words), somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 to 40,000 words. And apparently a novella (sometimes called a novelette) is hard to write because it tends either to compress to a short story or expand to a novel. Yet, the ten writers here, none of the neophytes, met their charge from McBain to come up with a genuine novella with aplomb (except perhaps for Stephen King, whose novella really reads like a short story - but then he's a big enough name that it's no surprise that his story made the book without any criticism). As in any collection there are some hits and some misses, but in fact I was engaged by every single entry. Some, though, were a cut above the rest -- Walter Mosley's 'Archibald Lawless, Anarchist at Large: Walking the Line' and Lawrence Block's 'Keller's Adjustment.' (I will admit that I tend to read everything these two writers produce and they are particular favorites of mine. Mosley, in fact, I consider to be one of our best writers, regardless of genre.)As is usual for me, I could not get as involved in the story by Joyce Carol Oates, but I suspect that is some peculiar allergy of mine; I've rarely thoroughly enjoyed anything of hers, even though I can admire her skills and obviously plenty of others admire her more than I. Ed McBain's contribution takes place in his familiar Eighty-Seventh Precinct.One theme that recurs in the stories is the changes in the post-9/11 world. Indeed, in stories like 'Merely Hate' by McBain and 'The Things They Left Behind' by King that is central to the plot. (By the way, the King story causes his usual and still spookily enjoyable frisson with its eerie atmosphere.)I would definitely recommend this collection to anyone who likes shorter fiction but wants something more substantial than the usual mystery/suspense short story.Scott Morrison"},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Hopefully Ed McBain's effort in convincing a stellar cast of fellow writers to contribute the novellas that comprise \\"Transgressions\\" will induce publishers to encourage more of the same.Don't get me wrong, I love long novels. But, in these days when we all seem to have less time than we'd like, the novella is the perfect form to consume in a short period. And, the novella is a deserving and time-honored part of literature. Nabokov and Simenon, to name two among many, excelled in the form.McBain, who contributed an interesting tale of his own, deserves kudos for the roster of superstars who joined him in this venture. The 10 stories provide a good introduction for those not familiar with the work of some of these writers.Naturally, some stories are better than others. That, of course, being defined by personal taste.My own favorite would have to be Anne Perry's \\"Hostages,\\" a moving look at the continuing plight of families in Northern Ireland. Sharyn McCrumb contributes an excellent Southern gothic tale, \\"The Resurrection Man,\\" and the awesome Walter Mosley is represented with \\"Archibald Lawless, Anarchist at Large.\\" There are also tales by Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, Jeffrey Deaver, John Farris, Donald Westlake and Lawrence Block.I can truthfully say I enjoyed all 10 stories and a few writers who were less familiar to me will now receive more attention."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"This anthology includes ten crime novellas.EXCELLENTLawrence Block \\"Keller's Adjustment\\" -- Block is a master.

It's about a black graverobber who works for a Georgia university before, during, and after the Civil War. Stars slow but great storytelling.Anne Perry \\"Hostages\\" -- I usually get irritated with Perry because it often seems that she's being paid by the word. This one, however, surprised me. It's lean, mean, and compelling.Donald Westlake \\"Walking Around Money\\" -- Westlake is another master who knows exactly what he's doing and how to do it.GOODEd McBain \\"Merely Hate\\" -- Good procedural with a few twists.Walter Mosley \\"Archibald Lawless\\" -- Interesting if implausible piece about a naive New Orleans young man who gets involved with a larger-than-life personality after moving to New York City.Stephen King \\"The Things They Left Behind\\" -- Per usual, King is repetitive and can't quite pull off a great concept. I kept wanting this September 11 piece to get better, but it never did.Jeffery Deaver \\"Forever\\" -- Deaver just can't end a story. He's got to add twist after twist after twist until the story becomes this unsatisfying scifi thing.

I about died when a character and his doomed relative roasted marshmallows over the burning ashes of one of his paintings.Joyce Carol Oates \\"The Corn Maiden\\" -- Oates is not a bad writer. But she's certainly not a good one either. The story was disturbing and really kind of gross. I don't know what it is about Oates, but I get the feeling that she's never lived but only written and read.

Why she chose such a morbid subject is beyond me. This story takes place in pre-Civil War and concerns the maneuvering of a medical school doctor to get the cadavers he needs for anatomy class.In 1852, Dr.George Newton, was forty-five years old and paid his carefully-selected servant to obtain supplies (newly-buried bodies from the cemetery) saying, \\"We must make use of the dead to help the living.\\" After serving fifteen years doing this grotesque work, he returns to show the freed blacks with white guardians how to be grave robbers. In 1859, the doctor contracts tetanus (lockjaw). Then the war intervened, bypassing Augusta, for the big city of Atlanta. Slaves were called servants.

As with most anthologies (especially those composed primarily of \\"big names\\"), the results have been of mixed quality. A few stand out among the rest -- among them The Ransome Women by John Farris and The Resurrection Man by Sharyn McCrumb -- but only one stood high enough to be recognized as definitely the best of the bunch: Forever by Jeffery Deaver, an author I'd not previously read.In Forever, Deaver introduces police statistician Talbot Simms. Tal in a numbers whiz who is happy to remain at his desk, crunching arithmetic means and standard deviations. But when a couple of elderly suicides present themselves as statistical \\"outliers\\" (meaning the combination of events fall far outside the norm of mathematical likelihood), Tal declares them \\"2124\\" (suspicious) and inadvertently heads toward solving his first case as a \\"real\\" police detective.Deaver skillfully portrays Tal Simms as a novice among veterans, concurrently showing the reader all the tiny details needed to follow procedure. But Tal slowly feels his way along, with the reluctant help of Detective Greg LaTour, who develops a grudging respect for the \\"Einstein\\" of his department. Both characters are fully three-dimensional, and I would welcome a series from Deaver featuring them. Forever also features some of the most original plotting and imagination this side of classic science fiction. Odd that I put off reading it for so long, primarily from not knowing his work, because Deaver's is the name I'll come away from Transgressions most praising."},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"From what I've read, it seems like a lot of readers bought this just for the King novella. While King's short novella excellent, I highly recommend you read all the others, too. There's a lot of good material in this big book!"},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Suspense, mystery, crime readers rejoice and then send a hearty thank-you note to ace thriller writer Ed McBain - it's his idea and he made it happen. His thought was to tap ten of today's best writers in the suspense/mystery field and ask them to pen an original novella. As defined by Webster, novella is \\"a short novel or a long short story.\\" Not too helpful, eh? McBain made it clearer: 10,000 - 40,000 words. And then added that it wasn't easy to do.The novellas may not have been easy for the top ten chosen by McBain to write, but they sure are easy listening - compelling, frightening and sometimes, as in the case of Joyce Carol Oates, macabre. Voice performers Michael Boatman and Anne Twomey deliver outstanding readings without overly dramatizing but allowing pause and nuance to add to the tales.The two writers on this audio edition need no introduction - Walter Mosley stands tall among those in his field and Joyce Carol Oates continually amazes. There'll be no plot stealers here because the entertainment in a suspense story is found in not knowing what's going to happen.Suffice it to say that Mosley's \\"Archibald Lawless, Anarchist At Large: Walking the Line\\" is the terrifying tale of a young journalist's descent into a nether world. And, Oates's \\"The Corn Maiden,\\" the story of the kidnaping of a mentally challenged young girl, is a haunting narrative that will elicit shivers from even the most jaded suspense fans.A rare opportunity to enjoy the words of these award winning authors.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Terror's Echo: Novellas from Transgressions (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Most people will purchase Transgressions simply to read a novella by one of their favourite authors. I myself picked this up just for the Westlake novella inside. I don't think anyone, no matter which author motivated them to buy this, will put down this collection only satisfied by one story. Yes like any various author anthology the quality varies as do the stories fitting into your personal tastes, but I doubt there will be anyone that either doesn't find a new author to check out or at the very least is reminded of the talent of an author they've maybe only read one or two books of a long time ago in the past. Some novellas such as Walking Around Money can only be found in these pages and others such as The Things They Left Behind you may well have already readbefore (Just After Sunset).Keller's Adjustment in my opinion is the best of the lot. I've read a few of Block's other books containing stamp collecting hit man Keller, and this is easily the best story. You don't need to have read any previous ones to follow or get the most out of Keller's Adjustment. It reads like a standalone novel with no plots of previous novels given away. Keller a man who used to have no problems getting on a plane in New York and flying anywhere in the US without any serious searching by security for weapons he would take with him to commit the crime or validating his fake ID has had his world suddenly change. The post September 11 2001 demand for the airlines and airports to wake up and take security seriously for domestic flights now means a lot of complications if there's someone that needs to be killed on the other side of the continent. On a road trip across America in a rental car to get to his next victim Keller starts talking to himself out loud, something he's never done before which consequently freaks him out. His target also lives in a high security gated retirement community causing quite the challenge for Keller as well as plenty of time to ponder if a post 9/11 world is really a world where you can have a satisfying career as a hit man.Walking Around Money although not Westlake's best story or even best Dortmunder novel is an important find for any fan of the late grandmaster's work. You won't find Walking Around Money published anywhere else as it was written afterThieves' Dozen(Westlake's collection of the Dortmunder short stories) was published. In fact it is actually the third last Dortmunder adventure written before Westlake's death and takes place time wise between Watch Your Back and What's So Funny. Important for fans of the series as you find out if repulsive fencer of stolen items Arnie Albright sticks to his rehabilitation. In this adventure Andy Kelp and Dortmunder meet through a friend of a criminal friend an old man named Querk. Querk's angry and bored with his life as a forklift driver, working for a rural printing company who shattered his dreams of using his printing skills he learnt behind bars, which they told him are now obsolete in this computer designed modern world. Querk has plans for counterfeiting currency for a South American country during a night the plant is shut down, however he needs a couple of fellow criminals who don't live in his small town to help with the heavy work and to get it done in time. Like any Dortmunder novel, outside factors and Murphy's Law always play a part in a should be smooth caper not turning out quite that way.Anne Perry's Hostages about a rural cottage holding a couple and their adult son at gunpoint is interesting, however the husband of the main character is such a racist, bully and just in general not bright or nice guy that you are actually hoping he will be killed and/or the objectives of the Protestant extreme group hoping to replace him as leader will actually come off.Archibald Lawless, Anarchist at Large was a bit disappointing for me. I've read and enjoyed other Mosley stories and was enjoying this one to begin with about a young guy from the country who moves to New York and notices a weird advertisement for a job in a few different papers so decides to apply. He then meets a very strange man who gives him a list of people and tells him to go visit them and talk to them if he can. When one dies before his eyes he becomes a suspect. However then the story just got a little stupid.The other stories Corn Maidern by Joyce Carol Oates, Resurrection man by Sharyn McCrumb, Merely Hate by Ed McBain, The Things They Left Behind by Stephen King, Ransome Women by John Farris or Forever by Jeffery Deaver were no stand outs to what those authors normally produce. However I did find McBain's intro to this collection to be a really interesting read."},{"Title":"Postcards from the Trailer Park: The Secret Lives of Climbers","review":"A very funy enjoyable ecclectic group of stories taken from Cameron Burns' excellent writing career.

These three stories are related here. Each one occurs in a very different time and place. The middle one seems to have taken place in the past, though when is rather uncertain; and the final one has the feel of being both in the distant future and past. In both, characters find their meaning through love. However, the first one is the most compelling of the three, and if you buy the book only to read Child of Prophecy, you will be getting a good deal. Like the saga began in the Blue Flame, a fantasy world is intertwined with the modern, familiar reality. Brianna finds her big break in the catering business both exciting and daunting, as she is not sure she can assemble a party for a hundred people in two days' span. However, her potential employer, Mason, has every confidence in her and won't take no for an answer. Catering is not what he really wants from her in any case. What he wants is far more. His life has been bound to Brianna's for many lifetimes. Together, they are destined to journey to another world where they will unite their strengths with the sorceress Mirabella and her true love, Christian, to bring about a prophecy that will prevent eternal darkness from overtaking the land. The problem is, Christian has been captured by a dark witch, Katarina, who wants to replace Mirabella in the prophecy, thus preventing the light and bringing darkness.*** Dangerous passions and wild magic conflagulate to a stunning conclusion that can not leave you unmoved. This is a truly memorable story, compacting all the best of epic fantasy into a small space. ***"},{"Title":"Be Healed in Jesus Name","review":"Small book packed with scriptures!I ordered this book just days after being diagnosed w/Cancer.

Finally, I stumbled on Dr. Glass' book. It was just what I needed, helping me to understand what I needed to do to improve my voice quality. I followed the exercises, and in a short time, the improvement was incredible. So much so, that I have been invited a number of times to speak to audiences of 6,000+ on subjects in my field. The reaction to these has made me a very welcomed speaker. Previously this was not the case. I feel indebted to Dr. Glass for this helpful book, which has helped me become a much better speaker, with a much better vocal image.As a complete novice about this subject, I found it difficult to understand how to perform one or two of the vocal exercises described in the book. You may not. However in my case, after purchasing the audio cassette for this book and listening to it, I was able to understand how to perform them, which aided me further.I don't know if there are better books on this subject available, but I don't think you can go wrong in obtaining Talk to Win."},{"Title":"Talk to Win","review":"Excellent!!

The authors make a significant effort to formalise major stylised facts across different crisis episodes, through the lens of modern monetary and banking theory. Moreover, they offer a fresh look at issues concerning crisis management and resolution and policy evaluation in the \\"first\\" era of economic globalisation (1880-1914) as well as during the interwar period all the way down to the 1930's depression.Modern tools help test the hypothesis laid out generally at the beginning of the theoretical framework introduced in each chapter. Ranging from accounting exercises (fiscal solvency, banking balance sheets, as a few examples)to cutting-edge time series econometric modelling, the evidence found by the authours sheds light on crucial empirical issues. Some examples may illustrate this point:a) The Purchasing Power Parity assumption (PPP, in a single equation cointegrating framework);b) Money supply and demand, and exchange rate determinants in 1884-1913;c) The Internal-External Convertibility dynamics (phase diagram, Vector Error Correction Model estimation)Finally, the lessons drawn by Della Paolera and Taylor are, in my view, very telling to the way Argentina got into the path to the collapse of the currency board 1991-2001."},{"Title":"Elvis-the Final Years","review":"I summed it up in my title: Peter Guralnick's Elvis books are the standard serious biographies now, but before those, Hopkins' were the best of the dozens of Elvis books out there.

Henry Moray's work in the 1920s and '30s to Jim Griggs' Hydrosonic Pump in the 1980s and '90s. The author examines the politics behind the public debacle of Cold Fusion (it may still work), and the scientific principles behind what may seem to the layman like some mythical perpetual motion machine. Along the way he debunks a host of false claims. The first chapter is an excellent starting point for anybody who wishes to learn about Tesla, the genius who brought electricity into your home.Tutt is fair-handed and has obviously done his homework, having personally investigated Paul Baumann's Thesta-Distatica in a religious community in Switzerland. He repeatedly addresses the questions about the veracity of his subject just before they arise in the mind of the reader. For example, many of the inventors who tried for decades to get confirmation or funding for their devices never saw penny one for their efforts, in contrast to the usually successful short-lived \\"take the money and run\\" practices of transparent shysters (who are covered in Chapter 11).Tutt quotes extensively from statements sworn by scientists and bureaucrats who have tested the inventions in question, and reports the failures, too. In Chapter 12 he discusses the urgent need for new energy sources and also admits the difficulties in accepting and implementing new technology.Conspiracy theories are addressed, too, and the fact is that many of the inventors featured have been mysteriously harrassed, threatened or worse. Possibly a greater threat to the viability of these devices is the difficulty of getting funding to develop a technology which is difficult to understand and not supposed to work. We've been able to electrify the world, but promising yet underexamined anomalies in electromagnetic theory have been around since Faraday's homopolar generator in 1832 (Chapter 4). Once another Maxwell comes around to explain those anomalies in equation form, it may all make sense.The point of the book is to encourage interest in the idea of \\"Free\\" Energy without becoming a mystical or mathematical muddle, and it succeeds in an enjoyable way. It's like a mystery novel, but about actual work being done which just might change the world."},{"Title":"Scientist the Madman the Thief/Lightbulb","review":"FROM THE PUBLISHER\\"Imagine a world freed from the damaging demands of the oil economy; a world powered by 'fuel-less' energy; a world where all countries - rich and poor - have freely available electricity.

For over a hundred years, a maverick group of inventors and scientists have struggled to develop technologies which may end our addiction to fossil fuels. Their extraordinary and controversial discoveries now offer the potential to defuse the global climate crisis and yet they face opposition - both from the oil-dominated energy market and from the scientific establishment.\\" Drawing on extensive and revealing research, this is the story of the mavericks, geniuses and madmen who have set out on a path paved with good intentions, and yet who have often arrived soaked with the bad blood of betrayal and conspiracy. Filled with colourful characters - mad, sane and brilliant - The Scientist, the Madman, the Thief and their Lightbulb has all the elements of a dramatic conspiracy thriller in which greed, suicide, murder, jealousy and misunderstood genius all play their full parts."},{"Title":"Scientist the Madman the Thief/Lightbulb","review":"One item in particular needs attention. Page 217 reports the Ball Lightning created by Kiril Chukanov (patent 5537009). Within the center of the Ball Lightning is a Quantum Plasma Macro Object. His plasma ball is luminous, layered, cooler, and produced near atmospheric pressure with RF and DC energy. This is similar to a gaseous Complex Space Charge Configuration (CSCC) whereas the layers are assembled and detached and creates energy per \\"Zero Point Field and Intertia\\" by Haisch on the outer surface. Within each layer, the ions assemble together and become massive compared to free ions and lowers the vibrations to become cooler. Then the random hot electrons between each layer assemble together to form Cooper Pairs traveling spherically around circles. In an instant, the heats released, conductivity increases, and it enters a new state. In this system, all radiated energy is quantized and only optical and x-ray energy is allowed to be radiated, while the rest is absorbed within. The electrons pair together so tight that if you stopped one, they all would stop and the persistant current effect would ensue. It would get so cold that Wigner Crystallization would occur in its center. It can be rightfully argued that the temperature and pressure is too high for these things to occur. If its possible for this effect to work, it would probably work at limited temperatures and densities. If Haisch ZPE worked, they why would you need to continually zap it with energy to keep it running? Chukanovs device makes a great story. Another interesting device in this book made by Blacklight creates hydrinos (patent 6024935).

You'll meet other folks along the way, people who have something to say to Bill and to you. You travel easy with Bill. This Bill is not as funny as Bill Bryson but he's more thoughtful. And he'll get you thinking.This book is a book about a place and about the history of that place. Having hiked in both areas, I especially enjoyed the subtle distinctions Bill is able to discern in landscape, flora and in the character of people between what he sees in the gentle hills of Vermont and the rougher landscape and terrain of the Adirondacks.Take this trip with Bill McKibben. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"A very inspiring and gently provocative account of a trip, the likes of which we should all take at least once during our lifetime--even though we could not hope to achieve McKibben's mastery in telling a story."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"There are many reasons for a walk in the woods, and many ways of telling about it. Author Bill McKibben walked through territory he already loved and called home, and wrote this thoughtful short book to explore its significance in our world.He started his journey near his home in Ripton, Vermont and crossed Lake Champlain into New York, then on through the Adirondacks to his other home in Johnsburg, New York; over two weeks on the trail, carrying a pack, living rough. Along the way he met and traveled with a series of people who are rooted in this wild land, or who commit themselves to the preservation of wilderness, interacting with the land in sometimes unique ways.The Adirondack Mountains lie within the six million acres protected and preserved as the Adirondack Park, comprising both publicly- and privately-owned land. Over half of the Park is in private ownership but under the control of New York agencies that manage conservation, resource use and long-range planning. A detailed history of the Park and the conservation movement that led to its protection would have been welcome but was outside the scope of this book. McKibben, does, however, refer to the model of management that allows some use of the land, while protecting it from development and deforestation. This model is at odds with the ideas of radical environmentalism, and the author gives some time to Edward Abbey and other writers whose work inspired the Earth First! brand of ecodefense action. He always comes back, however, to the balancing point between access and remoteness, use and preservation.This gentle travelogue filled me with a sense of awe for the wilderness, and for the strength of purpose that protects it today. It was a pleasure to read, as far as it went, but I wish it had gone further. For me, it didn't foster a sense of intimacy with the setting, as Henry Beston did in his classicThe Outermost House: A Year of Life on the Great Beach of Cape Cod; nor does it detail the polical, cultural and natural history of the area with as much thoroughness as (to affirm another reviewer's comparison) author Bill Bryson does in his book about the Appalachian Trail,A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America Along the Appalachian Trail.It's no use to regret the book the author didn't choose to write, andWandering Home: A Long Walk Across America's Most Hopeful Landscape:Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks (Crown Journeys)was inspiring, informative and well-written. Four stars.Linda Bulger, 2009"},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"This is a helpful book to me right now as I, too, returned home in search of the past. Unlike me, he is still a young man who merely took a three-week trek from the Vermont mountains above Lake Champlain across the mountains back home to Blue Ledges near the Hudson River in the New York Adirondack woods. He is a naturalist so it was a commonplace thing to do, just grab a backpack and go home.For me, it was completely different. The Smoky Mountains are just up the road a piece from the place where I was bornas my ancestors came from Cherokee where the reservation has been since antiquity and the native people are still there. I came back 'home' to a town which still looked the same downtown, but it was as if I were in a foreign country. No one knew me and, since I have a different accent, considered me as \\"Northern.\\" Not knowing any of the inhabitants, I was lost the first two years, got sick and went back 'home' to Pulaski to die.Eight months later, I trekked via Greyhound back to my hometown and met the most wonderful person, God put me in his life. He was here when I was earlier, but no way on earth could I ever dream I'd actually meet him. I loved his history lessons on the old Knox. as, growing up here, we were not told any of the things which had occurred here in this two-buck town. It has stayed backward until now but we have a new, young mayor who hopes to lead his hometown to a future worth the effort.This was reminiscent of Bill Bryson's A WALK IN THE WOODS, only this Bill was way up East where Bryson had settled after so many years in England; his book was of following the Applachian Trail from the South to the North. He skipped the Smokies and made a side trip down to the ugliness of Knoxville, Tennessee.Young Mr. McKibben has previously written THE END OF NATURE, HOPE, HUMAN AND WILD, LONG DISTANCE, WHY WE NEED A GENETIC BILL OF RIGHTS and THE AGE OF MISSING INFORMATION. He is so bright for his age, as is the person here who helped me get to this point, and will continue to educate the public of the need for more humane treatment for all of the earth's inhabitants."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"Mt Abraham in Vermont has a beautiful view to the west, to the Champlain Valley and Lake Champlain. Here is where environmentalist, Bill McKibben starts his walk from one home in Vermont to another home in New York State. This is not a book about a walk from country to city, no; this is a walk in the country to the country through the most amazing woodland in the East, the Adirondacks.Bill McKibben starts his walk from his home in Ripton, Vermont near the famous Middlebury College where he has a post. Between Ripton and Johnsburg, New York where he finished his walk, we meet the most fascinating environmentalists and friends and glimpse through Bill's view the glorious vistas. This is a novel that takes you into the land. Through out the book, I could picture in my mind what Bill McKibben was actually seeing, his prose is so vivid. He has a love of his land and all land, and that comes through loud and clear. However, he is also quite truthful about the life he and his family live. They know they have a wonderful life, and his righteousness only goes so far. He benefits from what he calls \\"the systematic abuse of the planet\\". Cheap food, cheap energy and cheap wood are in abundance. He and his wife have tried to rein themselves in, they have one child, drive a modest hybrid car, and have a solar home. His friends take turns walking with him. The President of Greenpeace and other people involved in environmental groups walk and talk and tell tales of their exploits.The most interesting portions of the book are those tales told by the people who live on the land, and the stories of their ancestors. In Lock Muller, a small town in New York, a giant white pine shades the ground, and from it hangs a sign:\\"On this site in 1845 this pine tree, a sapling of twelve years, was transplantedby me, at he age of twelve years. Seventy-five years I have watched and protectedit. In my advancing years it has given me rest and comfort. Woodman spare thattree, touch not a single bough, In youth it sheltered me, and I'll protect it now.\\"Pascal P Warren, June 14, 1920Teddy Roosevelt loved New York State, and he loved the Adirondacks the most. He loved climbing the mountains, and it was on such a mountain that he learned that due to an accident he was now the President of the United States. As Governor of New York, he preserved much of the Adirondacks and it became state land, not to be touched and left in pristine condition. Bill McKibben discusses the logging of the land, and the safe conservation of our land. He gives us much of the past history of the Adirondacks, and the people who inhabit the small towns and villages throughout. This is a lovely book, we walk along with the author, and feel like his neighbor. He tells us stories, and we meet his friends and yearn to see his land as he sees it. This is a wise book that gives us hope. Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"Bill McKibben is a thoughtful writer. Most of all, this book made me wish I could take a hike with him and meet the land he loves so much. Be warned that this book might make you homesick, even if you've never been to Vermont or the Adirondacks. But beyond that, the book has some serious points to make.I'm a suburbanite trapped in the cycle of debt that has sucked in so many Americans (in my case, student loans and a mortgage). I work for the Department of Commerce. I have a husband. I have a child who is addicted to video games. I don't have the money or the freedom to move to the Adirondacks, or even take a trip there. This book is a reminder that Americans don't have to live the way we do. We might very well be happier if we got rid of a lot of our stuff and lived more lightly on the land. Of course, McKibben punctures that little bubble by pointing out that a lot of people have tried to do that in Vermont, with laughable results.I believe that once the cheap oil is gone, life in America is going to be very different. Ordinary American life today puts so much emphasis on getting places quickly. In the not-so-distant future we're going to be staying much more in one spot, and only rarely going anywhere we can't reach on foot or bicycle. This book is a reminder that such a stationary life might not be so bad. There's more to a meaningful and happy existence than what cheap gasoline and Wal-Mart can bring. Maybe someday the science of economics will remember that."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"\\"Wandering Home\\" compares favorably with John McPhee's \\"The Pine Barrens\\" in its scope and depth. Wonderful evocation of landscape, of people, and the stakes in the environmental debate. I spent summers on Lake Champlain as a kid and know the pull the region has on a person, as McKibben evokes so wonderfully well.But there is also something smug about his love of the place -- reminiscent of the way writer Michael Lewis got in trouble for a rhapsodic essay about his model wife's lovely behind. McKibben has his houses on the Vermont and New York sides, a way to pay for them both, and all this untrammelled wilderness as his backyard. How many of the rest of us could hope to duplicate his lifestyle, his access to nature, the benefits he accrues from wilderness? The Adirondacks are a land of natural plenty, for sure, but also a region of scarcity -- scarce housing,scarce jobs, and severe (and essential) limits on development. McKibben comes off as the last guy to get into the club before the door was closed --and then calls you to boast about how great it is inside.I'm not sure what the rest of us can take away from this, despite our envy and an intense desire to return to the place for a visit."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"Bill McKibben describes a walk through place and community. The community is bound by a geographic region but the displaced reader is imperceptibly drawn into the mind-set of McKibben and his guests. You are introduced to a group who love the land on the Vermont/New York border and recognise it as one of the few \\"wild\\" places left in America. It is their passion to preserve and conserve that comes through and it is infectious. The book inspires the reader to analyse their relationship to place and modes of behaviour driven by place. The antithesis of economic consumption exists in all of us, however repressed. Bill brings it to the fore.

I was a Travel Agent for five years and was lucky enough to be sent to some of the best, first class places in America and this journey that Bill McKibben takes us on with his words is more meaningful than many of those places I went to which include the Grand Canyon & Scottsdale, AZ; the San Francisco Bay Area; Paradise Island & Nassau, Bahamas; Manhattan; the Sierra-Nevada Mountains (by train); and New Orleans & Mississippi River Cruise!Each authentic and real person that McKibben joins on his trek lends a hand in telling the story. The book is as much about the beauty of the people as it is of the land. I grew up twenty miles away from the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania, and presently I am a steward and guardian of 400 acres of land in central PA with my husband, his uncle, and my husband's brother and I share and appreciate Bill McKibben's deep love for the power of nature, the wild, and the people. I found John Davis (owns a bicycle, no car) as one of the most interesting characters in the book. I also like the stories of Chris Shaw, who has the good sense of memorializing the people who have passed on but that once lived in the Adirondacks and give the book historical authenticity. My favorite stories in the book are from Donald Armstrong and especially Armstrong's memory he shares with McKibben (and us) about Don's wife, Velda and a fly-fishing event. I laughed so hard I cried! It is a funny moment, but this husband-wife story is so cute and sweet, and gives one a feeling of nostalgia. (The church steeple is a cool part, too.) This is a gem of a story and Wandering Home is a gem of a book.I am a people person and for the first few chapters of Wandering Home I'm thinking that it is too bad Bill McKibben spends all this passion on the Adirondacks. I imagine what his passion could do to improve the lives of the infirm or impoverished people. Much to my chagrin, in the last few chapters McKibben admits this deficit with charm and honesty. He admits he should spend more time helping the less fortunate, and then justifies his love and preservation of the Adirondacks as his way of giving something back to people. And, I agree that he has. Furthermore, he explains that he tries not to be a drain on the planet. If only we could all think this way, maybe our global warming and environmental problems would vanish. For the first time in my life, I realize the full extent of the impact that people have had and still have on our surroundings and I am saddened and sickened by it. (I imagine a sunrise or a sunset over a mountain, or an ocean breeze I thank God there are still a few areas left in this world that man / woman hasn't been able to get his / her hands on.)I do have one eco-criticism of Wandering Home. Bill writes that he and John Davis climb to the top of Owl's Head on page 93 of his book. Owl's Head is a considerable distance away from Bristol, and is not included in the path outlined on the inside covers of his book. But, every author has to create mystery in some way, right? Judging by the description of Owl's Head I can see why McKibben would include it in his \\"walk\\" since Owl's Head sounds like a stunning place with it's 390 degree view of the Adirondack mountains. On my map, Owl's Head is about sixty miles north of Lake Placid one way, as the crow flies.Dr. Robert Bernard Hass (English Professor, poet, writer, and Robert Frost expert at Edinboro University) and I got into a discussion about hyper-individualism in class one day. Dr. Hass told me about his friend named Bill McKibben and how McKibben writes about hyper-individualism and that a good place to start on the subject would be Wandering Home. I am grateful that Hass recommended the book to me. It was a book that I was sad to see end, but a journey I will always remember in more ways than one. I was so inspired that I am planning on a short family vacation to the Adirondacks for this summer. I will do my best to demonstrate a sense of forest preservation and protection while I'm there, visiting the wild of the Adirondacks."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"I have spent much of my recreational time in the two places Bill McKibben writes about in this book -- The Adirondacks of New York and the Champlain Valley of Vermont. They both offer some of the most beautiful, pastoral scenery in the US. From Lake Champlain itself you can see the Green Mountains of Vermont on one side and the Adirondack Mountains of New York on the other. As Mr. KcKibben points out, while they may look similar and proximate from afar, each is quite different from the other. The Champlain Valley is more pastoral, bucolic and New England-like. The Adirondacks are much more rugged, wilderness-like and rough around the edges. Both can call to you in a way that becomes a lifetime's pursuit.This book is an easy and short read. It is engaging, paints wonderful pictures with words and gets you to think about the tension between a simpler life closer to the natural world and modern society and progress/development. He is fair in his assessment of the joys and the struggles associated with a simpler life closer to nature. I don't know who would enjoy this book more - the person who has enjoyed this simpler life or one who can only imagine it through books like this one. I highly recommend this book for people who love this part of the world or who have thought about getting closer to the land and living a simpler life."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"This book is thin. I mean literally. It is really just a somewhat longish essay. I was disappointed that there was not more depth, more history, more \\"more.\\"This is the story of McKibben's amble from Vermont to the central Adirondacks, with a crossing by row boat of Lake Champlain. McKibben is a good writer and he loves this landscape and is very concerned about it and its place in the global environment, but I could not help comparing him and this book to another Bill-namely Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. Bryson is a much more energetic writer. In my opinion, he is funnier and deeper than McKibben. A Walk in the Woods is a great book, Wandering Home is light weight by comparison.McKibben has some very good thoughts on environmental issues and expresses an admirable moderation in this book. He is especially sensitive to the complexity of many environmental issues and actively criticizes the \\"knee-jerk\\" environmentalists for over-simplifying the issues in many cases. On the other hand, McKibben is something of a romantic airhead. Often his ruminations are fatuous and patronizing; for example, his dogma that those simple Vermont farmers and old Adirondack loggers that he's met are more \\"authentic\\" than you or I (McKibben makes this claim more than once in Wandering Home).Nevertheless, I liked this book and enjoyed reading it. McKibben loves the Adirondacks and so do I. In this short book he's managed to capture something of the flavor of the hidden Adirondacks, that fortunately so few people know. The Adirondack Park of New York is the most beautiful sylvan landscape in the world. McKibben's book raises, but barely starts to answer, such questions as why and how to protect and preserve the Adirondacks and other similarly blessed places."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"After reading this slim book I felt like I'd gone hiking with McKibben. And I felt like moving to the areas he describes: Vermont and the Adirondacks."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"Having parents and brothers who live in the Adirondaks and having lived and worked in Vermont, this book was priceless for me. I felt at home."},{"Title":"Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across Vermont's Champlain Valley and New York's Adirondacks","review":"\\"A blur not a line.\\" It is so refreshing to read an author who admits there are trade offs in everything we do. It is important to have blocks of pure wilderness, but there is no pure isolation and the edges in all dimensions will be impacted by what is around that wilderness. Choices have to be made and impacts acknowledged and then more choices and adjustments.This book was not just a journey of walking, it was a journey alongside people McKibben had come to know and respected. It was fascinating learning more about the Champlain Valley and the Adirondacks and those people and the blurs they are working to shape."},{"Title":"Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game within the Game, 3rd Edition (Insiders Guide)","review":"This guy knows baseball, having been a player and a play-by-player. And this book had a lot of stuff in it, mostly about baseball. And I like baseball. And this book. Top-notch!"},{"Title":"Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game within the Game, 3rd Edition (Insiders Guide)","review":"Remy knows it ALL. Every game I watch is infinitely more interesting because of the insights he shares in this book. Fantastic read."},{"Title":"Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game within the Game, 3rd Edition (Insiders Guide)","review":"Talking baseball with a guy who knows. Lots of color, lots of detail, lots of information.Valuable addition to the excellent broadcast coverage of the Red Sox."},{"Title":"Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game within the Game, 3rd Edition (Insiders Guide)","review":"First off, I'm a huge Red Sox fan and have watched the Sox play hundreds of games on TV just in the past several seasons alone, with Jerry Remy as the color commentator. I like him as a commentator. He has a great sense of levity and brings good natured humor to the game. Also, he often has insightful things to say about many aspects of the game, and doesn't over-talk, although he does self-promote a bit much. So maybe I've heard Remy so much that I've already learned all he has to offer.However, to use a baseball game analogy, much of this book is filled with routine groundballs and fly balls, while you have to wait a long time for hits and runs. By the 7th inning, you need to stretch because things are getting a bit long. There's just not a lot of insight or \\"discovery\\" here, unless you really don't watch much baseball.The book is broken up by these \\"Rem Dawg Remembers\\" excerpts, separated in the text and bolded. One such is \\"You don't see many great hitters that are strictly pull hitters. There have been some: Ted Williams, for example, and Barry Bonds. But they are rare.\\" That's it. Is that really \\"inside information?\\" How about talking about David Ortiz and describing his success against the shift? A Williams story? No - no mention if Remy even ever saw Williams when he was a kid. Nothing. Hardly a homerun of insightfulness.One reviewer noted that Remy said the hitter has the advantage in the rain. Pretty much all Remy says about this is that the field is quicker when wet (no kidding) and the ball is wet when they pick it up, maybe causing errors. Hmmm... and how much does this book cost?The bottom line is that if you watch baseball even casually on every other weekend over the summer, you already know 95% of what's in the book. As for inside information, Remy doesn't name any names unless he's kissing their butts, has nothing negative to say about anyone (how can you be insightful and skip over criticism?), passes over the steriod scandal, and for whom I thought was a humble guy, devoted lots of the book to himself. What other author has quotes about himself all over the inside of the book? Maybe the jacket, but please.The best chapter was \\"Hitter's Counts.\\" It was the one chapter that had stats to back up Jerry's hunches and feelings. Learning Kevin Millar led the 2004 Sox with a .383 BA when ahead in the count was interesting. But if you already know \\"inside info\\" like that on a 3-1 count the pitcher is probably going to throw a fastball, you may end up feeling like you haven't learned \\"the game within the game\\" that is advertised on the cover.The last 100 pages are filled up with boxscores from the 2004 playoffs and World Series (not written at all from Jerry's point of view, but co-author Corey Sandler) and then Jerry's favorite current players, and finishes with an brief account of each of Jerry's 7 homeruns. No big deal.Want to know what it was like to play for years with Yaz? To bat against Nolan Ryan? What's the dugout like? What goes on in player meetings? Want to know inside info about broadcasting Sox games, or funny stories about being on the road? You've come to the wrong book.If you can get the old 2005 edition for less than a buck, then maybe it's worth it."},{"Title":"Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game within the Game, 3rd Edition (Insiders Guide)","review":"Maybe if you're interested in a trek down Memory Lane of Red Sox Nation, this is the book for you, but don't buy it if you're a baseball fan who wants to learn the \\"positioning of infielders and outfielders, what goes on at batting practice, the difference between choking up and getting the yips\\" forget about this book. It was a pleasant read of personal anecdotes of a former player now broadcaster, but I didn't learn a thing about the \\"inside' of the game. I'm a fan who loves to watch the psychological aspects of a baseball game (the role confidence plays, handling failure, etc.) and from the title, I thought this book would be about that, and would let me \\"see\\" the game from the eyes of a player. Not."},{"Title":"Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game within the Game, 3rd Edition (Insiders Guide)","review":"Frankly, this book is terrible - unless you consider baseball to be limited to the American League, and then, specifically to the Red Sox.I have never heard Jerry Remy call a game, so I can't speak to how much he actually knows - but based upon this book, his understanding of the game is limited to a) Jerry Remy, b) the Red Sox, and c) a few other players/teams in the AL.Remy seems to have no understanding that there are TWO leagues in MLB - and that just because he played in one league his entire career, that doesn't mean that the other league is beneath discussion. If you are going to write a book to help people understand how to \\"watch baseball\\", maybe you should cover topics other than why you think the DH rule is awesome, and how Fenway changes the entire game.Granted, I'm a Cubs fan, and I will freely admit that if Ron Santo wrote a book about \\"understanding baseball\\", it would be pretty skewed towards the NL, and probably likewise Cub-centric.You won't get anything out of this book other than slobbering love for Fenway Park, the 2004 Red Sox, and lots and lots of pictures of Jerry Remy from \\"back in the day\\".Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Judo yell (Pilot books)","review":"A bargain at $0.01 for a used version, Alice Sankey's \\"Judo Yell\\" takes 128 wonderful pages to explain: AAAAAAIIIIEEEEEEEeeee!!!!!!!

Chapman is creative funny, and sincere with these characters and you feel the love between main players as well as the family they have around them. After all those books I was still left wanting more.I passed my set to my sister.

He is also trapped in the Dark Unseelie Glass, by none other than his enemy Lucan, a dark sorcerer who tricked him thousands of years ago.Cian gets his chance for revenge when Lucan is out of the country and a theif breaks into the apartment stealing all of the Hallows.This is when Cian meets Jessi St.James. She, a college student and also an assistant to Professor Keene is sent to his office to claim a package. This package is the mirror Cian is housed in.Jessi has no idea what to make of this artifact and thinks the sexy strong highlander man she glimpses in the mirrior is just a fragment of her overworked stressed mind. She brushes aside this thought and immerses herself into work, but she finds out sooner than later that her life is endangered. Lucan will stop at nothing to get the mirror back, he has to pay the tithe at Samahain, in order to preserve his immortality.Cian and Jessi are a funny adventurous couple. For those of you who love the twins, Dageous and Drustan, they reappear in the story with their mates. It's a good wholesome adventure and a great addition to Moning's Highlander series.

This book is delightfully similar! Julian of Macedon, from Fanatsy Lover, was a Spartan soldier, trapped in a book for 2000 years. Cian is a Celtic warrior trapped in a mirror for 1,100 years. Both are somewhat (OK, a lot) sexist, and have an adjustment to make to modern life. In both books, the stories are part of a franchise, though each one can stand on its own.Whereas Fantasy Lover, started fast paced and fascinating, and slowed down into some silliness at the end, Spell of the Highlander starts slow, and only gets a degree of tension after the couple arrive in Scotland. Cian is not completely free from the mirror - it reclaims him from time to time, and that really throws cold water on the budding romance.The story into which Spell of the Highlander is embedded is fascinating, and overshadows the basic love story. It is a story that spans Ms. Moning's Highlander series, and leads into her brand new 'Fever' series. The book is worth reading just to understand key elements of this overall epic! In fact it is a must have. Cian is a powerful Druid, and there are reasons to believe that his time being trapped in the mirror was by design, to bring him forward, with his kinsmen, also trapped in the 21st century from the 16th century, to fight an epic battle that is still to come in the series. The romance somewhat pales next to this story. And unfortunately, the story felt somewhat formulaic - some of the same romantic elements took place as happened in past books by the same author (this one is 8th in a series).But the fun part is watching this arrogant former Celtic Laird from teh 9th century make adjustments to dealing with a modern woman and modern society. He is an old fashioned man with the manners of a caveman, but also one of the most compelling characters in this genre today. And watching him interact with his kinsmen, protagonists from other books by the same author, is priceless!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I have now read five out of seven of Moning's Highlander books, and just finished this one.Unlike her other books, I really had to repeatedly talk myself into not slamming the book shut within the first few chapters. It was distasteful and crude, right from the beginning. Granted I haven't read the two books right before this last one, but the first four I read weren't this 'in-your-face' sex-wise. I mean, c'mon I read romance for romance sake, not to read the Fbomb repeatedly, especially in relation to sex. (how about 'making love'??) Or D!ck, b@obs, @ss, and any of the others.In addition, the heroine was just TOO empty headed and shallow.I had a few fluxuating thoughts while reading, that I couldn't decide on:1. Ms. Moning can't be serious. She wrote this book as a joke.2. Ms. Moning was in an extreme hurry/just didn't care anymore.3. The publishers were breathing down her neck so she took a \\"I'll show you to make me hurry\\" attitude.4. This book really wasn't written by Ms. Moning. And lastly..5. This is actually the first book she ever wrote, but she thought it was too bad to publish, but for some reason has dragged it back out.The book didn't pick up for me and get interesting until halfway through. I liked that she brought Dageus & Drustan into the story to make it a richer. Also, this book is decidely darker than the first four.My favorite of hers that I have read will always be #1, with the Hawk & Adrienne. Now THAT'S a romantic tale! When I read that, I was telling everybody I knew what a romantic writer she was, how she incorporated bits of Shakespeare, how the main characters were deep, in love, and romantic. This book is nowhere near her finest work!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"If you have enjoyed Karen Moning's previous Highlander novels, you will like this one too because it is a continuation of the series. All our favorite characters are back, except for Adam Black who is missing in this one (although mentioned) and who is now mortal, dare we hope the Queen restores his immortality someday? Of course the MacKeltar twins, Dageus and Drustan are back and they are accompanied by their now wifes, Chloe and Gwen. By the way, the story of Drustan and Gwen is my all-time favorite Karen Moning book and I think will be difficult to ever top. But, this one comes close and, as always, her writing is very intelligent. This can be called the Man-in-the-Mirror book because it is about Cian (pronounced Key-on) MacKeltar who is a wilder, rougher ancester of the twins, could it be possible? Jessi St. James is the young woman who happens upon the mirror and discovers the man trapped inside by the spell of the wicked, evil Lucan, who has definitely turned to the \\"dark side.\\" Lucan spends the novel trying to reclaim the mirror which was lost to him when it was stolen from his London home. He has to get it back in time to continue the spell. I don't want to give away any more of the story because if you read it, a great part of the fun is that you don't know where she is going with it and that keeps you engrossed. The suspense keeps you reading and the characters are fascinating and different from the previous ones. Another interesting aspect is the illusions to Queen Aoibheal's motives in allowing the MacKeltar's to find themselves in the modern world and what will be coming in the future. It certainly tells us that there will be more Highlander stories in the offing and they will include our favorite characters, and once again, the modern world will be in jeopardy and will need to be rescued by the MacKeltars.

The only thing though is that I had never really read a book involving Highlanders. I didn't know what to expect because I thought a Highlander would be set in the past. I certainly didn't expect a Highlander to be so sexy and drool worthy!When Jessi -- who is swamped with school work and such -- is asked by her professor to go sign for a package at his office while he is in the hospital, she never expects to fall into a world full of supernatural beings and a gorgeous man to protect her. She unknowingly uncovers a mirror that is a relic of the Unseelie. Inside this mirror is a tall and certainly sexy man. Jessi thinks it is her overtired mind causing hallucinations and a man in the mirror is a figment of her imagination. When she finally accepts that Cian MacKeltar is real, she has to make a choice in helping him or running for her life.Karen Marie Moning gives us her witty humor, sexual tension and dark suspense that she has never failed to give us. Her writing is exceptional and definitely has me craving the other books in this series.

If you can handle totally unbelievable and fantastic story lines, these are wonderful books. It has never taken me more than a day or two to read any of her novels.

Her goals are clear, and leave no room for romance, though she finds that frustrating. She's not the sort of person that might suffer an attempt on her life, she's too boring. Yet, when that happens, a split second's worth of thought saves and changes her life forever. Against all logic, she recites a rune that brings Cian out of an enchanted mirror just in time to keep her from being killed. Now, she finds herself on the run with a sexy eleven hundred year old druid who just wants to keep out of his enemy's hands for twenty days so that he will be free. Jessi's life is completely upside down, but she's found something more important, love, albeit impossible love.*** Though the story often goes overboard on sensuality, when it returns to focus on the actual plot, the writing is stellar. Cian's dilema and nobility shine through, and Jessi is a heroine that many readers will be able to find a commonality with. Old friends from prior books make appearances, something that not only adds to the story, but will bring a smile to fans' faces. ***Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This installment in the MacKeltar series was very good.

I started with her first book \\"Beyond the Highland Mist\\" and have ended here with \\"Spell of the Highlander\\". I felt her writing improved so much making this the best book I have read in a while. The subplot on the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann started out so weak in her first books but her vision becomes clearer with each book. In \\"Spell of the Highlander\\", I feel she accomplished so much. Previously, I would overlook her weak subplot of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann because the romance story was enough to be captivated. However in \\"Spell of the Highlander\\" I was just as intrigued in the subplot.This book was great! You get reunited with Drustan, Gwen, Dageas and Chole. It's has a lot of light hearted moments. The romance is great too. You pretty much have to wait until the end to get your smut fix in but boy it's worth the wait.What I am so very disappointed about is that she continues the series in her next book, so to speak, but leaves out the romance. Is anybody else extremely disappointed in this? It always seems like whenever I find a great romantic author who really knows how to write, they switch genres."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This book was carefully packaged and delivered in a very timely manner.

It's a must read if you love this type of book!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Spell of the Highlander is number seven in Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series. Because of the events at the end of number five, The Dark Highlander, The Dark Glass has been stolen, along with other priceless antiquities, due to the intervention of Aoibheal, Queen of the Tuathe de Danaan, who was determined to destroy the dark Druid sect of the Draghar.In the ninth century, women have always loved Celtic Druid Lord Cian MacKeltar, who as the only male in his family (his sire died just before his birth) has always been spoiled by the females. As the most powerful Keltar Druid ever to have lived, he's always enjoyed studying Druid tomes as much as bedding the lasses until he was tricked by his friend and imprisoned for eleven centuries in The Dark Glass, one of the four coveted Unseelie Hallows, objects of seemingly boundless powers. Over the centuries, Cian became a myth although he still lives in the hellish dark mirror prison.A former pupil and best friend of Cian's, Lucan Myrddin Trevayne, is the evil sorcerer and ancient enemy who imprisoned him and who will stop at nothing to reclaim the Dark Glass, pay his tithe before it's due, and gain more power.As a graduate student in archeology at the University of Chicago, Jessica St.James, receives a midnight phone call from her doctoral adviser. He has been involved in a car accident and needs her to go to his office on campus to accept an important delivery. She has no other choice but to comply and she soon finds out just what kind of package is delivered at night. A mysterious one. It turns out to be an ancient relic and her first thought is that she would love to authenticate its age and origins. But sleep and a hard days work beckons, especially since she has another full schedule the following day. When she returns to the office the next evening to retrieve books at the request of her professor, she finds a strange man there who attempts to kill her. Cian MacKelter calls to Jesse from inside the mirror and gives her the Celtic words which will temporarily free him from his prison to defend her. Her terror overcomes her disbelief and she recites the spell. Cian keeps his word and does save her, but there interaction sparks something far more intriguing.On Samhain, in tweny two days, Cian's most hated enemy, Lucan, must pay a tithe to the mirror to keep the MacKelter Druid imprisoned. Jesse St. James complicates matters worse for Cian when Lucan decides there are to be no witnesses to the knowledge of The Dark Glass. Cian has to keep himself, Jesse and the mirror hidden just long enough for the time period to pass. He cannot allow Lucan to pay the tithe, because Lucan looks to obtain the Dark Book, the contents of which are so potent that continual exposure to it will change a man forever...and not for the better. He must be stopped at all cost.Spell of the Highlander isn't very special in regards to Cian MacKelter and Jesse St. James. He's the typical mouthwatering alpha male that Moning usually creates, although, he does seem to have the 'caveman' syndrome of his time. And Jessica is the same with her bold, beautiful and intelligent self, or in other words, Cian's perfect mate. Their courtship is also similar to the previous MacKelter romance rituals. Though, what I really enjoyed was the plot line outside of the romance, which is slightly sad considering it is suppose to be a paranormal romance. However, Moning's Druid and fae stories are complex and is noticeably well thought out. All of her intricate subplots make for an incomparable read. The ending will defiantly leave you with your mouth hanging open. While Spell of the Highlander is not my favorite of Karen Marie Monings books, I still enjoyed it very much for it's uniqueness and humor. I have high hopes that she will continue with the series, for the end tales of at least two more."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This book is a great read. It is the 7th and last in the Highlander Series (although I hope KMM comes back to it again in the future!) It is linked to her Fever series (dreamfever, faefever etc) I couldnt put it down. Each one is just as good as the last, my favorite was the Dark Highlander (dageus McKeltar is just...*sigh*) I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good 'strong' love story:) But beware... dont start this one until youve read the others, and preferably in order to get the full effects of the series! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Another dark highlander has arrived in the 20th Century, but this time he is not taking \`no' for an answer. Cian MacKeltar is the ancestor of the two MacKeltar brothers from the previous two highlander books (Drustan and Daegus), and he is a lot more to handle. Cian is a dark sorcerer, as well as a Druid with skills more advanced than Daegus himself.The highlanders are becoming increasingly powerful, and dark, but as always a woman is found who can help tame him. Jessica St. Clare is an excellent student, studying archaeology at a university. One day she is asked to accept an artifact for her professor, and lock it up in his office since the delivery is rather late in the night.She opens up the crate to discover a silver mirror that gives off a strange vibe. Jessica thinks she is insane when she believes that she sees an extremely dark, handsome and sexy man in the mirror, but quickly shakes the thought away. That is, until the next day when she is locking up her professor's office once again, and a man attempts to kill her. Her only hope is to trust this man in the mirror, who appears to protect her, if only she will say the spell that will release him. Little does she know, that though releasing him will also release a rollercoaster of emotions and adventure as she and him have to work together to keep each other alive.This is because Cian MacKeltar has been trapped in the mirror for 2000 years by another dark sorcerer. What kept him sane, was his sole desire to destroy the man who sealed him away, finally getting revenge. When he meets Jessica he is instantly reminded of his dark past full of sins, and the 2000 years of pent up sexual energy he has inside of him.What was strange to me on this Highlander novel, was I just didn't like Cian. He did not seduce me as the other highlander's did, in fact I felt more repelled. Maybe he was too dangerous for my liking, or maybe he just didn't seem real enough. However, I really liked Jessica. She was very real and likeable, and one of the strongest heroines yet in the series. Jessica was most resistant to the seduction of Cian, but she at least knew that it was inevitable that she would fall into his arms.Even though Cian wasn't my favorite, he was still interesting, and the plot development in the book furthered the development of the overall plot of this series, as well as setting up and foreshadowing the dark fever series. I also love that the other MacKeltar brothers come back and help out in this one, especially since I am a hardcore Daegus fan, and even the mere mention of him excites me.The growth I have seen in Monning over the course of this series is tremendous. This series is no longer just straight romance with a bit of time travel, but an intricate plot has been interwoven. Monning is brilliant in the sense that I never saw it coming. I highly recommend the last four books of the Highlander series (Kiss of the Highlander, The Immortal Highlander, The Dark Highlander, and this one) to anyone who has read the Dark Fever series and needs something to whet their appetite in anticipation for the final book."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I have not read one KMM book that I haven't liked. She's done it again with Spell of the Highlander. The characters are great together, the story is awesome, and the sex is great!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I love these highlanders. Although this one wasn't my favorite in the series, these alpha highlanders never fail to make me laugh. This book was no different.I was reading this on while on a plane at 5:30am, hoping to avoid conversation with other passengers. That only worked until I started laughing...out loud. Seriously. When Jessi frees Cian, convinced the beautiful man is a dream, sidles up behind him, figures \\"why not, it's my dream\\" and licks him, I laughed so hard I almost dropped my book.As usual, Karen Marie Moning writes a great alpha highlander. Cian is a ninth century alpha male who definitely looks, thinks and behaves like one. I love all of the highlanders in this series. I hope she writes more of them."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Oh, if only this book had been longer, I didn't want it to end! But if it hadn't I would have been up even later than 3am.If your familliar with Moning's books you'll know this is a continuation in the Kelter Druid/ Faery series.And after reading the end of this book you find out that there are atleast 2 or 3 more books to come! The dialogue of this novel was so beautiful I may force my husband to read it and learn a thing or two!Cian Kelter is the oldest of our druid hotties yet. A genetic freak born in the 9th century & made laird at birth, he has all the possible magical abilities bred into the Kelter line. Naively he invited another druid into the castle one night, an evil twisted man, and to sum up events Cian ended up stuck in an enchanted mirror perched on his enemies study wall for the past 1,133 years. And he'd have probably stayed there...if the magic that enabled a previous Kelter hotty to serve hadn't also triggered an unheard of string of events...Passed through the black market and still trapped in his mirror, Cian has to hide out for 3 more weeks and his entrapment will end. He ends up in the round about possesion of Jessi St. James, an overworked anthropology graduate in Chicago. Convincing her to summon him from the mirror a few brief hours each day, Cian is able to slay the assasins the baddy sends after Jessi & himself only to find - with the hillarious help of his Kelter descendants- that Jessi is his soul mate.

The lastest offering by this very talented author is Cian's story and this highlander is just like all of the rest in this series...hot, alpha, and brought down to earth by the love of his life.Jessi St. James is over worked, and wondering if she is ever going to finally realize her dream of earning her PhD. But with one phone call her life is about to change. It's about to get more hectic, harried, and dangerous. It's also about to get a lot more exciting and one alpha male is about to make her feel real good. That is if she can keep herself alive and Cian out of the darn mirror....Cian has called the dark mirror his prison for the last eleven hundred years. He wants out for good and it looks like that dream may become a reality. But first he must talk Jessi into believing that he's not a figment of her overworked imagination, and that she can count on him. It won't be easy as Jess doesn't respond to him as others do...his powers can't touch her. How on earth is that possible? Together these two fight to stay alive, find an end to the curse, and try to come to terms with the attraction that sparks between them. Will they be able to do this or will they fail...at one of them? After all a very dark and evil man is striving for them to fail.Cian and Jess are an explosive combination. One of the things that I thrill to regarding Ms. Moning and her writing is we ALWAY get a chance to revisit with old friends (Drustin and Dageus, Chloe, Gwen)this in my opinion adds to the previous romances. Although at times this read was a tad predictable Ms. Moning's characters managed to keep it from being a total bore. Ms. Moning is an author that I purchase the second she has a book released...hardback, paperback...it matters not. What is important is the fact that you are guaranteed a good read that will leave you spellbound.Official Reviewer for Romance Designs"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this book!!! Why are you sitting here reading this?! Why aren't you out getting the book?I love the female character in this book. Most romance books are all the same... there is a stupid, weak, little girl who doesn't know half of what is going on, and then she is swept off her feet by a blundering idiot known as a male. But Moning's book is very different... her female character, Jessi, is very independent and strong. She is on her way to getting a PhD when her whole life changes because of Cian. I'm not going to tell you anything else about the plot of the book, because you can read it and figure it out for yourself.I believe that most people who read this book will become entranced with Karen Moning's style of writing. And the sex scenes... wow! Hot!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This is the third book in this series that I have read. Kiss of the HL and Dark HL being the other two, and I am glad I read the other two first. Cian is the worst character of the three. Drustan and Daegus are written with much more love and tenderness in their hearts. Now don't get me wrong I love an Alpha Male in my romance novels but he has to have a heart underneath that muscular chest. The whole couldn't keep their hands off each other was stupid, with the \\"tupping\\" in the hallway while everyone else is trapped in the library. I just wanted Drustan and Daegus to beat the crap out of him. I also did not like the heroine and I really tried to like her. I would only recommend this book if you read the other two and wanted to see Drustan and Daegus again."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I really wanted to like this book, having enjoyed Moning's previous works so very much, but I just couldn't get into it. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is basically the same book as the Immortal Highlander, but with much less interesting, one-dimensional characters. The formula is really starting to wear thin. Have some evil people after you? Run to Castle Keltar with your big, supernaturally gifted highland warrior, where you will be regaled YET AGAIN with stories of how the twins met their feisty, beautiful, intelligent wives, lose your long-held virginity in some mind-blowing fashion, contemplate the disappearance/impending death of said highlander, conquer the baddies, and then live happily ever after.If Moning had followed this formula but had fleshed it out with events that were remotely interesting, this book might have been saved, but I doubt it. MacKelter fans will probably want to read this anyway, but I highly advise waiting for the paperback."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Archeology graduate student Jessi St. James has an already full life with a research job, classes, and teaching. But when her advisor has an accident and asks her to receive a package for him, she can't exactly turn him down--even if she doesn't have time. The package turns out to be a strange mirror--with an eleven-hundred-year-old highlander druid/magician locked inside. The man who's owned that mirror for the last thousand years, the man who locked the highlander in the mirror, is desperate to recover it--and to make sure no one who saw the mirror survives.Cian MacKeltar recognizes the attraction he feels for the sexy Jessi, but knows it can go nowhere. With all of the sins he's committed, he has only one goal from life--to keep the mirror, and its power, from Dark Magician Lucan Myrddin Trevayne for three weeks. At the end of that time, the magic will be undone and Lucan will die. But Lucan has assassins, dark magic, and the power of unseelie artifacts at his disposal. Better than a thousand years of magic have taught him to be ruthless--and to be cunning.On the run from assassins, Jessi and Cian can think of little but the attraction that flows between them. That his mind control does not affect Jessi only makes her more attractive to Cian. But although Jessi has cast the spell to release Cian from the mirror, the effect is only temporary. The mirror calls him back--and will continue doing so (often at inconvenient times) until the spell is finally broken.Author Karen Marie Moning writes a highly sensuous tale with the powerful and primative highlander, Cian MacKeltar taking center stage. Other members of the McKeltar clan, also brought up to the present from the distant past return from earlier books in the series, giving fans a treat as they see the familiar characters moving forward with their lives. A few minor inconsistencies--especially the repeated reference to Cian as the ancestor of the other MacKeltars (he wasn't married in the 9th century and presumably didn't raise bastards to be heirs so he wouldn't have been their ancestor, just a some number of greats uncle) distract, but not enough to spoil the story's enjoyment.Fans of alpha male highlanders, loaded with muscle and magic, will definitely want to add SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER to their reading list."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I may be Karen Marie Moning's biggest fan! I have read every one of her books and Daegus MacKelter, the dark, intense, super-alpha hero from the \\"Dark Highlander,\\" and his time traveling brother Drustan, (\\"Kiss of the Highlander\\"), are two of my favorite fictional men. Although I remain loyal to Daegus, the MacKelter brothers may have some competition now with the introduction of their 9th century kinsman, Laird Cian MacKeltar, in Ms. Moning's latest novel, \\"Spell of the Highlander.\\" A major bonus in this new book is that all three McKelters, along with their mates, appear here.Cian is a Celtic warrior and the most powerful Keltar Druid ever to live. He is heir to the arcane magic of the Old Ones, but has been imprisoned for eleven centuries in The Dark Glass, one of the four coveted Unseelie Hallows, objects of seemingly boundless powers. The Dark Glass has been stolen, along with other priceless antiquities, due to the intervention of Aoibheal, Queen of the Fae, (the Tuatha De Danaan), who is determined to destroy the dark Druid sect of the Draghar.Lucan Myrddin Trevayne, a former pupil of Cian's back eleven hundred years ago, is the evil sorcerer and ancient enemy who imprisoned him and who will stop at nothing to reclaim the Dark Glass and gain more power.Jessica St.James, a graduate student in archeology at the University of Chicago, receives a midnight phone call from her doctoral advisor. Apparently he has been involved in a fender bender and needs her to go to his office on campus to accept an important emergency delivery. What kind of package, she wonders, gets delivered in the early morning hours? A mysterious one. The package is huge, the size of a sarcophagus. It turns out to be a mirror with an ornate golden frame carved with symbols and glyph-like shapes, apparently an ancient relic. Her first thought is that she would love to authenticate its age and origins. But sleep and a hard days work beckons, especially since she will have to take the professor's classes the following day. When she returns to the office the next evening to grade students' papers, she finds a strange man there who attempts to kill her. Cian MacKelter calls to Jessi from inside the mirror and gives her the Celtic words which will temporarily free him from his prison to defend her. Her terror overcomes her disbelief and she recites the spell. Cian keeps his word and does save her. Did you doubt?Cian's freedom is transitory and he has a lot of work to do before he can break the spell which has ensorcelled him and free himself permanently. He desperately needs Jessica to help him. Actually, he needs her to believe that he really exists and that she is not crazy first. On Samhain, in twenty-two days, Cian's hated enemy Lucan Trevayne must pay a tithe to the mirror to keep MacKelter imprisoned. All \\"Tuatha De bindings, both the Seelie (the good fae) compacts, and the Unseelie (bad fae) indentures, must be periodically reaffirmed by gold. Usually compacts only require reaffirmation if something is changed or violated within the agreement. However, since the Dark Arts run counter to the nature of things, the Dark Glass must be paid every one hundred years, on the anniversary of the original date of binding at midnight.\\" Cian has to keep himself and the mirror hidden during the twenty-two day period and plan his revenge. He cannot allow Trevayne to continue to live. Lucan looks to obtain the Dark Book, the contents of which are so potent that \\"continual exposure to it will change a man forever...and not for the better.\\" Lucan Trevayne is bad enough to begin with - the world does not need him to get worse! He must be stopped at all cost.Obviously, Cian is the typical mouthwatering male hunk Ms. Moning usually creates. And Jessica is bold, beautiful, intelligent, etc., in other words, a perfect MacKelter mate. Their courtship is similar to previous MacKelter romancing rituals. I really enjoyed the \\"Spell of the Highlander,\\" however, here's where I might run into some trouble with other fans. My critique is totally constructive and I do write as a loyal Karen Marie Moning reader. Her storylines are usually much more complex - intricate plots, subplots, etc. Not so here. The narrative is interesting, but very simple, without any real twists and turns. Cian is a likeable character, but not at all complicated. In fact, at times he is almost caveman-like. And Jessi is so stereotypical. Heroines like Jessica exist in hundreds of romance novels. I have read many books by this author and know what she is capable of. Maybe it's me, but I wonder if pressure from her publisher is forcing her to pump out the books. I really hope not, because I so look forward to reading Ms. Moning's work. Also, BASTA!! Enough with women drooling all over men and visa versa. It is getting old and there are more subtle ways, and sexier ones, to express lust and sensuality.From what Ms. Moning writes in a brief afterward, she is planning more novels about the MacKelters and the Fae. I say \\"terrific!!\\" I only hope the author grows as a writer as she further develops her wonderful characters. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I loved other books by this author, especially the books about Grimm & Hawk, but this one, featuring Cian [KEY-on] & Jessi, was pretty boring. It had its moments but quite frankly, until Daegus got involved at the end there, in a surprisingly witty and compassionate role, this book was doomed. I guess using the mirror was a necessary plot idea to the overall theme of Moning's tales, but I wasn't thrilled about this approach."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I too must preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of all of Moning's books, but \\"Spell of the Highlander\\" was a disappointment.Cian MacKeltar was too much a man of the ninth century for my taste. He had little of the charm of Circenn Brodie (granted, Circenn had 500 years to mature), or the fierce loyalty of Drustan or the seething sexuality of Dageus. Even Adam Black had a more introspective air despite his undeniable carnality. Cian was too rough-hewn and too much the Alpha Male with none of the romantic tempering Moning gave to all her other heroes. To my mind, that is what makes them so attractive. They are big and manly and sexy, yet each has characteristics beyond their sexuality that seduces their women. I cannot believe that many women dream of losing their virginity the way Jessi loses hers. Cian seemed too one dimensional to me, without the complexity of previous Moning males.Adam's book, \\"The Immortal Highlander\\" should have brought this storyline to a (satisfying) end. Yes, we loved Drustan and Dageus. Yes, I'm sure we all wanted more - and maybe if this book had been better written I wouldn't feel this way. How many times can we read \\"her glossy black curls\\" or \\"pillowing her breasts\\" against assorted surfaces without asking why the repetition? Where was her editor? This book felt like it had been written to satisfy contractual obligations and demands.Still, if you are a MacKeltar lover, you will want to read this book. I'm hoping that it will prove to be the exception to the rule, and Moning's next book will return to the strengths that made me love all of her previous novels."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I rarely write reviews of books, but I had to this time. I see countless reviews that tout this as wonderful, but honestly it's average... and average for this author is just plain awful. I've read all of her books and ordered this one months before it actually came out.It would be unfair to say it was a bad book, but it pales in comparison to books like \\"The Dark Highlander\\" or, really, any of the author's previous titles. If you want a decent romance novel, this one's fine. But it's not at all what she's capable of. The plot is regurgitated from \\"The Immortal Highlander\\" (save your money and buy that one in paperback).I'm still a HUGE fan of her work and will buy her next book, but it would be completely unfair to say this isn't the worst of her works. Everybody has bad days and this title represents Ms. Moning's."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I really liked this book but Cians' whole me Tarzan, you Jane attitude got on my nerves. I mean one minute he's being wonderfully sweet then the next he's treating Jessie like she can't think for herself. All the men in the other books where tough too, but they treated the women with more respect than this guy who, if he had listened to his mother in the first place, wouldn't have been cursed. Then when he met his decendents he acted like they were beneath him. Other than that the story kept me turning pages. I just hope the next installment of this series does better."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"KMM tells a fabulous love story, with vivid and detailed descriptions of bonnie Scotland.

The ending makes one wonder just what the Fae Queen is planning, and drops intriguing hints for the Tuatha De's future.A few things sttuck in my craw though:1) I'm sick of the \\"me so horny, but I'm a virgin\\" female leads. I can appreciate virginity as much as the next person, but it seems to be a re-occuring theme with KMM's heroines. I want to see a heroine who's had a few mistakes in her past, like most normal 24 year olds. A heroine with little/bad/no experience would be more interesting (& maybe with a jaded view of sex)with a hero who can teach her how it truly can be between two people.2)Jessi & Cian ripping off hotels, clothing, airlines, etc..Says a bit about their character.Oh, and one minor bit: the lack of desciption of how Jessi managed to enter Scotland without any forms of identification. One can assume she had a passport, but I wonder, because Cian did not want her to use any forms of id. This is unrealistic, but I'm stretching my imagination..Overall, though, a great read. So far, though, I'd have to say that out of all her hero's, Adam's my fave with Lisa being my fave heroine. Would highly recommend reading Immortal Highlander and Highlander's Touch."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"My main problem with this book is I didn't like the characters. I thought Cian was rude and abrasive. There wasn't enough detail about his past life. As for Jessi there just wasn't enough character development. I felt she was boring. I love Karen Marie Moning and I have read all of her books. This one just wasn't my favorite."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"As a great fan of Karen 's stories, I could not wait to read Cian and Jessica's story. Karen Marie is an outstanding storyteller and Spell did not disappoint one bit. I was truly captivated from page one. This one's a HIGH recommend from one romance reader to another !"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Cian MacKeltar was cursed into an Unseelie Dark Mirror so long ago that even his descendants, Drustan and Dageus MacKeltar, believe he is just a myth. The Dark Mirror grants immortality to one so long as the tithe is paid regularly, which Lucan Myrddin Trevayne had faithfully done. However, Aoibheal, Queen of the Fae, had set in motion a series of events in which the mirror was stolen from Lucan and ended up in the Archaelogy Department with Jessi St. James. Jessi believes she is going crazy when an assassin tries to kill her and she discovers Cian in the mirror. She summons Cian out of the mirror but his time each day is limited. Jessi and Cian escape to Scotland to avoid Lucan, where they meet up with Drustan and Dageus. Cian knows he is destined to die, as will Lucan, once the tithe is not paid. Lucan must die as he is evil and allowed an entire village to be killed to capture Cian in the mirror eleven centuries ago. However, Aoibheal left the memory of the Draghar with Dageus and therefore Cian is not doomed to die. This was an interesting addition to Moning's Highlander series as an underlying story involving the machinations of Aoibheal became apparent. I would recommend reading the stories of Drustan and Dageus prior to reading SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER, although this novel explains enough to make it a stand-alone book. I anxiously await the next installment!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Ms Moning has done something that I didn't think would ever happen, she has created a character that I love more then Drustan! There is something about Cian that I just cannot resist. Cian is a product of his times and to see him deal with a thoroughly modern Jessi is so much fun to read!I'm not going to do a synopsis of the book, that's been done. I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed the book. There are scenes that will remain classic. I can't think about them without laughing to myself (while reading I was laughing put loud) but Ms Moning also tugs at the heart strings. My emotions run the gamut while reading, laughing, crying, happiness, sorrow and joy to name a few.I have to say one of my favorite parts about the book is the inclusion of Daegeus and Drustan. I LOVE seeing them again and it's not just thrown in to make me as a reader happy. It's necessary for the story and when they meet, again, classic.As always Ms Moning wrote a thoroughly sexy, alpha smart hero and more importantly, a heroine who is his match. Like I always say, I like her heroines as much as I like her heroes and that's rare in a romance book.The only problem I found was that the book ended. I am already salivating and waiting for her next book! Brava Ms Moning. There is a reason why you are my favorite author and books like this is why."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"In the ninth century, women have always loved Celtic Druid Lord Cian MacKeltar, who as the only male in his family (his sire died just before his birth) has always been spoiled by the females. Still he enjoys studying Druid tomes as much as bedding the lasses until Samhain \\"buried\\" him alive in an underground library sealed for eternity. Over the centuries Cian became a myth although he still lives in a hellish dark mirror prison.While Chicago based archaeology graduate student Jessi St. James plans a post PhD life filled with boyfriends, Lucan Trevayne panics over a break and entry. Someone stole the Dark Mirror amongst other \\"Unseelie\\" Hallows artifacts at a time when his tithe is due.Professor Keene asks Jessi to accept a delivery for him. She does and looks at the ancient mirror, but sees a hunk looking back from the glass at her. Cian is freed but knows his powerful and most likely affluent enemy still lives and is coming for him and the mirror. With Jessi at his side to keep the woman he is falling in love with safe, Cian knows he must stop Lucan from regaining what he lost and regain the final fourth Unseelie Hallows object.This exciting romantic fantasy never slows down from the moment that Cian is trapped inside the Dark Mirror until the final confrontation. The story line is action packed (the first paragraph above is only a few pages) as the ninth century warriors battle in the twenty-first century with Lucan having all the advantages expect the love of a good woman. Karen Marie Moning provides a terrific saga.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Why does Karen Marie Moning insist on spoiling a good story by re-hashing the endings of the other MacKelter books. For the last three books I have been really enjoying the story and then she decides it's time to return to the castle Mackelter and the reader immediately knows that the books is going to go down the same tired old route all the other stories have gone down. Even worse she has now turned me off of the the characters of Drustan and Dageus and their wives who have become farcical thanks to the books that have come after their stories - especially the wives who seemed to do a lot of running around acting silly. I think it is time for Ms Moning to come up with a new way of resolving her stories, and reward the reader with something original."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This is the third title I've read by Karen Marie Moning and I have to say that one of the wonderful things about her writing is that it just keeps getting better. I read the Immortal Highlander about six months ago and it is the best contemporary/fantasy romance I've read within the last 5 years. I've spent the last two months anxiously anticipating Ms. Moning's latest release, Spell of the Highlander. Well, I liked it right away, in fact, now that I've finished reading it, my only complaint is that I felt just a little bit let down by the ending.Oh, don't get me wrong, Ms. Moning definitely starts off strong. Within the first few chapters, she does an excellent job of projecting the sense that a series of random events are falling into place to bring the main characters (Cian MacKeltar and Jessica St. James) together. All of her heroes are so fierce and dominating--sometimes to the point of frustration-- but I love that early on, she always takes the time to convey to the reader that the heroine is no wilting flower either. She didn't miss the mark with Jessica. Jessica St. James is a fiercely independant student working (or should I say over-working) her way toward a Ph.D. in archeology with very little time in her life for fun, adventure, or sex: Enter Cian MacKeltar. Cian, a dark, Druid sorcerer who has spent the last 1,133 years imprisoned within an ensorceled mirror is about to turn Jessica's hectic lifestyle on its ear. When Jessica happens upon the mirror one evening--while it is in the possesion of her professor/mentor--she imediately becomes captivated. It isn't merely the mysterious ancient carvings on the mirror's frame that speak to the archeologist in her; it is also the half-naked, rugged Highland warrior she glimpses that speaks to the WOMAN in her. Somehow or another this strange mirror has wound up in her professor's office and some deadly beings are out to take it back. Late at night one of these \\"beings\\" happens to be in the professor's office while Jessica is there and he is determined to have her out of the way. Just when Jessica realizes this being means to kill her to get to said mirror, Cian reveals himself once again and beckons her to speak the words that will release him from his glassy prison. Thus begins their adventure as Cian soon reveals that he has less than a month in which to defeat his nemesis--the sorceror who trapped him in the mirror-- and save the world from unimaginable evil.It is very rare that I buy hardbacks (because I'm a tad. . .well, let's say FRUGAL) so I nearly wept at the prospect of spending more than seven dollars on a book. Fortunately after reading the first and second prologues and the first chapter, I decided it had been eighteen dollars (and change) well spent. The story had the perfect blend of adventure, humor, and passion (God, did it EVER have passion) to keep those pages rapidly turning.Now here comes my only complaint; I did feel that the ending,(which I'll not ruin for you) was a bit anticlimactic. I felt that after all the build up of how powerful/evil Cian's nemesis, Lucan was, he ended up being far too easy to defeat. I expected there to be a little more struggle, a bit more, who-will-win-the-battle conflict. I mean, let's be honest, we all know who will be the victor in romance novels from page one. Still, a girl likes to be on the edge of her seat, feeling angst for the hero/heroine when they are losing the battle, and triumph after they've won. Ultimately I suppose I felt such triumph by the end of Spell of the Highlander. . .just not to the degree that the beginning of the book led me to believe I would. I also closed the book hungry, yearning to know more about Jessica and Cian's happily ever after. I was truly hurt that Ms. Moning didn't give their story an epilogue. I don't think authors intend to leave their audiences feeling cheated but when they end a story as passionate as Spell of the Highlander without an epilogue, that is precisely what they do.Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I would like to restate I truly did enjoy this book. If you're looking for adventure, laughter, (the exchanges between Jessica and Cian in the chapters before the high off to Scotland were unexpected and surprisingly humorous) a hero to lust after and a heroine who can make you proud to be a woman, take a chance (like I did) and let Spell of the Highlander put a spell on you."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This book was one of my favorite books written by Karen Marie Mooning. I don't know what the rest of the ladies on here were reading but I do know that Karen Marie Mooning has the ability to make all my fantasias come true. Cian is one of my favorite heroin that I have read since Immortal Highlander. I promise you that once you read one you will want to read them all. The love scenes were out of this world. If anyone is looking for a time away from real life. This is the book you should read."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Moning continues her story with the druid family by introducing an ancestor from the ninth century--thus explaining the hidden library in the process. You discover in this book that everything that has happened thus far in every book is by the whim of the Seelie Queen.Cian is probably my favorite (beside Black of course) so far. He's very manly-man (in a caveman sort of way). I kept waiting for him to hit the Jessie over the head and drag her by her hair back to his cave. There were a few parts that made me laugh. The famale character is practically a carbon copy of every other one that has come before (which is a common problem in all of Moning's books). Although she did try to changer her a little by making her look smart and slutty. What confused me was how she kept saying how \\"horney\\" she was in the beginning of the book and then near the middle (like all the other characters) we discover she is a virgin. So . . . why was she horney? Usually you have to actually try something before you can miss it. Oh well, whatever. Weird thing is I'll probably keep reading them just to see what will happen with the queen and if Black will show up again."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"It is really sad when as author this talented writes a story like The Immortal Highlander. That book was by far the worst of the highlander stories and unfortunately it has colored the reviews for this new book. This new book totally blows Immortal Highlander out of the water. I think all the people complaining about a lack of character exposition are just not reading closely enough. Jessi is not obsessed with sex, she just has a very busy stressed life and she wants that closeness that she sees other people having. They don't actually have sex until you are three fourths of the way through the book. The tension between the two of them is highly entertaining. You definitely get the feeling that Cian cares about her. There is none of the coldness in him that was in Adam, from the Immortal Highlander. Overall this has been a highly enjoyable read and reaffirms my faith in Ms Moning as one of the best in the business."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Cian and Jessi's story continues the mystery of the Druids and the Fae, but is less memorable than the previous six books in the series. Due to an evil unseelie spell, Cian is trapped in a mirror for 11 centuries until Jessi, a college asst. professor, calls him out. Her life is in danger and together they escape from Chicago to the Highlands and try to thwart the ancient enemy. This is complicated because Cian is called back into the mirror at unexpected times. Drustin and Daegus MacKeltar are also in this story and it is good to see them again. This book didn't flow as easily as the previous books. Other than Cian being discribed as big, lusty, and powerful, the author has not characterized him as thoroughly as usual. Maybe I was a just a little disappointed because Kiss of the Highlander and The Immortal Highlander, 2 previous books in the series, were so good."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"If you Love Romance Novels I Highly suggest you Read all of Karen Marie Moning Books.

It is great to see a strong woman remain a strong woman even after she meets her mate.Jessi is like Gwen and Chloe. She will face anything for the man she loves. Moving heaven and hell and earth would be nothing if she gets to keep the man who fits her perfectly.Can't wait for the next book in the Highlander series. Can't come soon enough"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Ever since I discovered Ms. Moning's early books at a library sale, I have really looked forward to each of the further adventures of the time travelling mystical hunky Highlanders and their bright, brave, modern soul mates. From the cover illustration (which for the first time featured faces) to the contemporary prose (full of allusions to 2004 pop culture) to the unsympathetic lovers, this latest book was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.This book was so inferior to the others, that I thought perhaps she had a new publisher or something, but it appears to be the same publishing house. You'd think the publishers could have at least got it right wrt hair length and color of hair if they're going to put faces on a book cover. Perhaps the distracting allusions to Godsmack, Buffy and the Vampire Slayer, and even her other romance novels were meant to provide humor that was otherwise lacking in the characters themselves. But those will date this book in a flash, making it awkward rather than a pleasure to reread. Finally, the lovers were pretty immoral and one-dimensional. For one thing, whatshername was perfectly content to let Cian rip off hotels, airlines, and small businesses. For another, you'd think a guy who had been imprisoned for over a thousand years and who thought he had lost his entire family might express at least a little interest in finding out what had really happened to his mum and the ensuing generations of his clan once he had got his jollies off. And even descriptions of aforementioned jollies used words that were much cruder and far less erotic than Moning's previous couplings. I still want to think I'm reading romance, not porn.Like a previous reviewer, I'm hoping that it was Ms. Moning's publisher who wanted quantity rather than quality, who is to blame for this debacle. I am still looking forward to her next book; perhaps she'll incorporate some of her newly married experiences in it. But I am rather glad that the next publication is a less expensive paperback."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Picked this up in the library and am glad I did! These stories should be in paperback form. After reading Diana Gabaldon I do like reading about Highlanders. This book was a hoot!It's sad in our society that we cannot imagine a woman reaching the age of 24 and still be a virgin. How much experience do you want a 24 y.o. to have? Well, I read the story for some erotic fun and it delivered. To take this kind of plot seriously is a big mistake. I enjoyed Cian immensely! Jessie was a typical heroine of this genre. I am pretty sure I've read one or two KM's books and they are basicly the same.This was no Diana Gabaldon but it was a fun read."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I really liked and enjoyed this book! That being said...now i can tell what bothered me about it and why i think it wasn't up to par with her previous novels.I just read some of the other reviews and one of them hit the nail on the head for me. Cian and Jessica were just too much about sex. Even if he had been trapped in a mirror for over a thousand years. I mean every other thought in their heads was some serious lusting. Now, I'm all for some good raunchy fun, but this time I think it distracted from the story and it just got a little old for me. Overall I liked both of the main characters, although again I agree with a few of the reviewers that Cian was a little too alpha and rough for my taste and I didn't like him as much as all of KMM's other heroes. I have read all of her other books(Drustan's twice) and while i wasn't disappointed with this book, I can definetely say that it wasn't my favorite. One other thing, is it just me or does Jessica seem a little preoccupied with her own breasts? And, it's not b/c she's self-conscious about them. She thinks to herself more than twice about how perfect they are and how wonderfully shaped and sized they are. In fact if i remember correctly she thought about them as much as or more than Cian did. Now that's just weird or very self absorbed or whatever you want to call it. Now I'm not saying she shouldn't be happy with her body or put her self down or anything but, I mean it just seemed a little strange to me. And I don't think I've ever read a heroine's thoughts where she praised her own body parts several times, even if it's something that she has had difficulty with in the past, cause all the men she meets stare at her chest constantly. Which I didn't get either because she herself said that they weren't very big so how do ALL these men know how perfectly perfect her breasts are when she's usually wearing a bra and tshirt and not walking around topless. I know that men will stare at most any woman's chest, especially when she's pretty, but she made it out to be like an every time she met a man thing. And, since she was a virgin and I get the impression that no man has seen her topless, so really she's had no one see them bare and complement her on their wonderfulness. Usually if a character is that complimentary and aware of her own body and especially her boobs, she's a secondary character who meddles and is a bitch and no one likes her except for the oversexed secondary male characters. Listen to me, now I'm overconscious of her breasts and I'm beginning to rant. It was just something I noticed and as you can tell it irritated me. But, despite that I didn't hate Jessica's character and I did enjoy the story and I will continue to love Karen Marie Moning's books!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Powerful! Sensual! Seductive! This series just keeps getting better & better! KMM socks it to us again in this captivating, funny, sexy, and romantic drama-romance. Cian (pronounced \`Key-on') MacKeltar, 9th century warrior, powerful Druid, and laird of clan MacKeltar, tricked into captivity by his so-called 'best friend' and imprisoned for 1,133 years in the Dark Glass, one of the five magic items of the tremendously powerful T'uatha De Dannan (the Faery). Jessica St.James, student of all things medieval, especially from the British Isles, needs to get a life. All her time is spent at the University working towards her PhD. - filling in for her professor in her spare time - grading papers, taking classes, and running sundry errands. One said errand was taking delivery of a 'package'. Very simple - take delivery of package, sign for it, lock it in his office. Go home. Do not open. Do not tamper. Do not pass go! Unfortunately (or fortunately, for Jessi) nothing ever works out the way it should where she is concerned. The package comes with a condition - viewer verification - in other words, she must open said package before signing for it (said package is waaaay larger than she expected). It turns out to be a beautiful, full-length antique mirror about 6 feet in length, with curious markings around the frame, and strange dark liquid silver \`glass'. Unknown to Jessi there is an assassin on the trail of that mirror - all who comes into contact with it are being killed by order of an ancient enemy, who will stop at nothing to reclaim the Dark Glass, because of its power, and its prisoner! Jessi's one chance at survival is Cian MacKaltar, but first she must speak the words that will temporarily release him from the mirror. Jessi must choose: she is trapped in the office with the assassin who leaves no doubt in her mind that he will kill her as easily as taking a breath, - should she speak the words and unleash this 9th century, just-this-side-of-tame, Druid/warrior - six & a half feet of raw male, face of a fallen angel; eyes and a voice to melt the Polar icecap! Global warming - take a back seat, puh-lease! Silky black hair with the requisite side braids (the mark of a chieftain) and beads; muscles sleek and taut (even after 1,133 years in captivity - it is after all a magic mirror!! And hey, don't sweat the small stuff)!! This is such a gorgeous read, that after I finished it, I re-read portions of it! I didn't want to say good-bye to Jessi & Cian or the twins and their wives for that matter (our old friends from previous MacKeltar books). I loved the ending - kept me in suspense right up until then. And also the footnote from KMM about Jessi & Cian being spotted in a small Highland pub doing the slow dancing thing! I think you'll not regret buying this book! It's a real treat! KMM rules!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Okay, admittedly, my favorite of the series still remains Daegus from Dark Highlander, but this book is still sexy and very entertaining!I quite enjoyed Jessi. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion, I found her to be intelligent and her reactions realistic for someone in her situation.Ciar is one of those alpha heroes that makes you howl and growl all at once. I thought Moning handled it well by making him a Ninth Century man. If he'd acted that way absent all the factors she wrote for him he may have come off as an ass, but instead, he was realistic for his own time frame. Nicely done.The chemistry? Oh yeah. The sex was very well written and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the next books entail.My only complaint? It wasn't long enough, LOL."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I loved this and I really like how the last 4 books characters are involved. If you love romance and romance set in Scottland you really need to read this series!! One of my all time favorite series!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Spell of the Highlander almost made me give up my long held favorite Moning Highlander, Druston MacKeltar, for Spell's wonderfully written Cian. I loved this book and recommend this book and Ms. Moning's entire fabulous series to anyone who wants a read that will captivate, excite, charm, entice, and most of all make one yearn to fly to Scotland in the hopes of stumbling or falling onto one of these time traveling captivating and sexy Highlanders. I also won't go into the synopsis, but Ms. Moning creates a dark and tormented alpha Scotsman who is understandably tormented by his imprisonment, his past druid and dark arts mastery, and his thoughts that he has betrayed and perhaps been the cause of the loss of his family. The author creates a totally likable and engaging female character in Jessi, as she is an archaeology Masters student/expert who dreams of having a more exciting life outside of her collegiate world, as she has put everything into her education and love of ancient antiquities to the extent that she has ignored having a life outside of that---including a romantic/sexual one, of which she is understandably extremely curious about--and the sensuous Cian is just the man to show her the way. This book brings back the breathtaking twins, Druston & Daegus and their wives, Gwen & Chloe, to the delight of the reader, creates another original & inventive scenerio for time travel/immortality and yet again intersperses clever & humorous dialogue, adventure, danger, love, eroticism, romance and also connects Cian's past history with the beloved MacKeltar clan. I do not want to give away any plots, but this fiction & romance reader highly recommends this book and all that have preceded it. Kudos & praise to Karen Moning and I await with great anticipation your next book and the continuation of this series!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"There is nothing more important I can say in this review than this: Get this book. Read it. And then close it with a sigh of satisfaction, while wondering when the next one will be out."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Oh my god... wow. I am just amazed at how great this book is. The character, Jessi, is such an amazing woman. The man... &lt;drools> if only I could find a guy like him.The way Karen Marie Moning writes is just fantastic. The intro, middle, and end are all beautifully written. I don't even know what else to say... I'm speechless.Follow my advice and get this book. It will make you happy the rest of the week, just reminiscing about the story-line."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Ok, so I should say that I am a huge fan of some of Moning's books. So much so that I perused many book stores hoping that someone would accidentally put it out early. I had a lot of expectations.If your thought the Immortal Highlander was good, you will enjoy this book more.I thought Cian was great, very alpha. Jessica was great, sorta a Gwen/Chloe sandwiched into one...however the lack of the extra star is was purely with the author's choices for some descriptions and events.I couldn't relate to a character whose underwear stuck out of her low rider jeans. That is the stuff of teen floozies and not of someone working on her doctorate. The exposition for Jessica's character was too short and too involved with just sex.I could believe that Cian wanted to have sex soon after being released after an 1100 years internment, but it seemed to be just that ...sex. There was none of the tension building as there was in the Dark Highlander. It was served up on a silver platter. Plus...they began having sex by stripping each other with an audience of his own family present. I am all for wild a kinky...but come on! There is wild and there is rude. She had a great formula with the Kiss of the Highlander (By far my most favorite book)and I suppose I enjoyed that story more because I felt that Drustan was a bit more vunerable, and needed Gwen just a bit more and his feelings didn't \\"happen\\", there was a building of tension and excitement beforehand.I am not going to bash this book anymore because I didn't think it was awful. I gave it four stars after all. Will definitely be a big hit with the RBL romantica ladies and that to me seems to be her main audience focus anyways. It ranks above her early first two books and above Immortal Highlander in my estimation. I am still going to be perusing the book stores for her future books. I can't give up hope that I am going to read something that once again knocks my socks off from this author."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I love this series by Moning. It's an easy read. It follows the typical romance-novel formula. But it is well-written, and it is fun. If you want to get lost in fantasy, this is the way to do it."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I first read Karen's Fever series and I was so blown away and impressed by her attention to detail, her wonderfully layered characters and her amazing twist on Irish folklore, which is why I backtracked and started her Highlander series. I enjoyed all of them until I got to the last one. Spell of the Highlander...I was floored.The plot was surprisingly simple and not very fun or exciting. Jessi lugging the mirror from place to place, Cian Voicing everyone within a 2 foot radius, and a seemingly inept villain. By the time Jessi and Cian got to Scotland I could barely continue reading. I didn't develop any connection to Jessi and nothing about her said \\"PhD\\" to me (flashing thongs and huge breasts). Maybe I was comparing her to Gwen? I thought Cian; who I assumed was supposed to be the most complex of her male Heros (Dageus takes that title), was the least developed and sometimes just came off as a dumb Neanderthal. The only things that I enjoyed about this book were that we got to see Drustan, Dageus and their wives and also the fact that it bridged over into the Fever series. I got the impression that Karen only wrote this book because of a contractual obligation. Maybe she was really ready to move on to the Fever series so she just threw this story together?When compared to her other Highlander books and especially to her fantastic Fever books this just does not hold a candle. I would've checked this out at the library rather than purchasing it for my own collection."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Karen Marie Moning may be better known for her Fever series, but her rich and occasionally rather purple, prose has been catering to romance readers' long before Mac and Barrons came into the spotlight. She was responsible for a good seven and half books of pure Highlander deliciousness, a series that ended with a bang, or should I say, multiple bangs.. Well a heck of a lot of banging, as featured in the last novel of the lot, Spell of the Highlander.Now I generally suck at synopses, (what do you know, I got that word well spelled in the first try), so forgive me for merely relaying the gist. And what is it comprised of? Brainiac heroine, Jessica St. James, assistant to a university professor and virgin de rigueur, whose life is forever altered after reluctantly accepting a mysterious crate in said professor's name. And what does the crate contain, pray tell? Nothing but a man-sized looking glass with whole lotta ensorcelled Highlander inside. Why the hell do I only get junk mail and fast food coupons?Needless to say, things get dangerous real quickly, as the baddie of the book, the powerful sorcerer responsible for Cian MacKeltar's sordid entrapment in the mirror wants him desperately back. His immortality is at stake if he doesn't get his hands back on his most prized possession and he's got a little over twenty days to do so. Of course he's willing to kill everyone and everything in sight to do so, including poor unfortunate Jessi.Well, unfortunate might not be the best descriptor after all, not when Jessi decides to aid Cian in his struggle to get free from his enemy. The greedy arse mofo has kept him imprisoned within the glass for over 1000 years. Yes, Jessi's life is in jeopardy, but Cian agrees to protect her in return, and boy is he one formidable protector. He's sexy, he's huge (oh yeah... aren't they all), he's from the ninth century and his speech is peppered with the doonas and cannas any Highlander worth his salt is supposed to use. His ways may be slightly (or very) archaic, he might occasionally treat Jessi in a me-tarzan-you-jane way (and this is actually a line in the book) but who cares. Cian Mackeltar stays true to the tradition of the blindingly sensual MacKeltar men Moning already introduced us to in Kiss of the Highlander and The Dark Highlander, Books 4 and 5 respectively. True fans will be delighted to know Drustan and Dageus and their oh so lucky wives actually make an appearance in this installment.Spell of the Highlander contains a heaping dose of all those things Karen Marie Moning enthusiast appreciate about her, an undercurrent of humor, and a larger than life alpha hero that scorches the pages with his kilted self, a slightly whiny but ultimately compelling heroine and an intricate, well thought out plot. The stakes are high in this last installment, and the battle between good and evil achieves apocalyptic proportions. And I just have to add, no one does sexual tension like this author, or at least very few excel the way she does. This may not be my favorite book in the series, as that title belongs to Kiss of the Highlander, but it's a solid four out of five read for me. Why did it loose a point? Perhaps because it just didn't affect me emotionally the same way as the aforementioned book, or Immortal Highlander (Adam Black's book) did. Nevertheless, there's still a rich, thick decadent serving of romance and action in this one. Yes, Jessi and Cian's inability to keep their hands off each other and their constant humping like energizer bunnies on any surface they could find was just a tad over the top, but hey, give me Cian and I might just turn into a Jessi myself. Like with any of Moning's Highlander books, it's made to enjoy, not to analyze. And it's quite a light, enjoyable page turner in fact."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Loved it!!

BUT the good news is...a great story is just that...A GREAT STORY!!Yes there were similarities between the way the events of \\"Spell\\" and \\"Immortal\\" played out, but truth be told \\"Spell\\" is the better book by far. Ms. Moning has redeemed herself as an author worthy of hardcover publishing as \\"Immortal\\" was a disappointing start...Cian being an ancient MacKeltar Druid has all the scrumptuous alpha male qualities and magic that our other MacKeltar Druid heroes possess...which if you were a fan of Drustan and Daegus' stories you know the allure. Jessica was a decent character, but like Chloe, and to an extent, Gabby, was sort of \\"just there\\" in the story. Sadly, not since Gwen and Drustan has Ms. Moning been able to truly captivate the reader (well...me at least) with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and romance as well as depicting a heroine that was equally as compelling and integral as the hero.But, I digress. Spell of the Highlander was quite the intereting read filled with ancient lore and one of the best villains I've ever encountered in a romance novel. Lucan was truly creepy and you just loved to hate him. Conversely, you rooted for our hero all the way (of course) and enjoyed how the MacKeltar twins roles in \\"Spell\\" aided in the forward movement and ultimate resolution of the story.Jessica and Cian's \\"love\\" was more steamy than mushy, reminiscent of Daegus and Chloe, and certainly not as wonderful as Drustan and Gwen's. Cian has now moved to my #2 Moning hero as Drustan will always have my heart.The reader is set up for more Highlander tales to come with mention of magical Druid Keltar heroes we have yet to meet...can't wait! It would be nice if our beloved author could put some of the time travel back into her novels...now that was fun reading!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I admit I didn't finish this book. I gave up after Cian dealt with his disappointment over not being able to rape Jessi by grabbing her crotch (which she loved of course - romance heroines love the good rape). I know Cian was horny and so raping some strange chick was supposed to be understandable. I just wonder if Jessi would have cared about how nice Cian's butt was had she known he intended to rape her using Voice? I know the men in KMM series tend toward the rapey, but the scene was so weird. Like he steps out of the mirror, planning to rape her then it's all cutesy because Voice doesn't work and now he can't rape her and he's so horny. I'm sorry, but if Cian had stepped out planning to seduce Jessi, yeah that's the highlander way. They pick a chick (Mine) and eventually nail her and she's all happy to have her virginity ripped away by huge dong. It's romance after all, but the way Cian was all excited over raping the heck out of Jessi just made me feel sorry for her and dislike him. The only KMM rapist I can tolerate is Barrons, but he's just special. Cian is not. I don't care how sweet he might turn out to be later in the book (once Jessi tames him, I assume), but his clear, and seemingly justified, desire to rape Jessi freaked me out. Oh, and him wanting to space out their babies (this is before he's even out of the mirror) so he wouldn't have to share her boobs with the kiddos was pretty gross too."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I had never even heard about Karen Marie Moning, until recently browsing my local bookstore, i decided to buy Spell of the Highlander. I am happy to say i didnot regret that impulse. I have recently bought, Dark Highlander, which is my absolute favorite as well as Kiss of the Highlander. Its hard getting new books in the Bahamas, but every book of her's i can find i will buy! She has become my new favorite writer!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I have loved Moning's book and each one seemed to get better and better. I have been waiting with baited breath for the release of Spell of the Highlander and having read it I could not contain my disappointment.It felt as if Moning has succumbed to the lure of formula writing and this book read like it was written overnight cutting and pasting bits from her previous books and without any imagination to top it off.The heroine has become silly to say the least - juvenile, despite being apparently intelligent, she irritates rather than entertains.Moning is a great writer - what happened with this book I hope is an lapse and Karen will restore her brilliant writing in her next book."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I have been a fan of 'The Highlander' series since book one and I eagerly awaited the realease of 'Spell of the Highlander.'Though I really did like the book, it seemed to lack the depth of her earlier books. Her past books kept you on the edge of your seat and Spell of the Highlander didn't do much in those regards. At times the charaters seemed too preoccupied with wanting sex and little else. The story felt thrown together and failed (for me) to create a bond between reader and characters, as in her past stories. The almost abrupt end was also somewhat of a let down and somewhat predictable.I would recomend that you get it if you loved the other highlander stories, if for no other reason than it is part of the series. I did enjoy the story but was disappointed that it didn't quite live up to the ones before it.For those of you who love the Highlander stories, we are shown that there will be more stories to come. I only hope that the upcoming books will be back to Karen's earlier works, with more feeling and depth.If you liked, but didn't love her past stories... you may want to wait and buy the book when it comes out in paperback when its cheaper."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. This was just a retread of the Immortal Highlander and not even a good one at that! The villian in this was so pathetic and one dimensional as were all of the characters. The storyline was so predictable that even the villian knew where Jessi and Cian were going to hide. Please save your money on this one. check it out from the library or wait for the paperback and get it used."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I never thought I would like reading about Scottish men running around in skirts and saving damsels in distress. But Karen made a believer out of me. I have all her books and I enjoy reading all of them. I read this book in one day. All the ladies need to experience a Cian MacKeltar once in there lifetime. Whew!!!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"***NOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS***Cian MacKelter has been imprisoned in the Dark Glass, an Unseelie Hallow since the ninth century and wonders if he'll ever break free. When by unbelievable chance his prison is stolen from his captor mere months before the tithe is due he sees in this action the hope of freedom. When he winds up in the hands of Jessica St. James a grad student pursing her PhD in archeology who needs his protection from death by his enemies it seems almost as for once fate has smiled on him. She not only offers his chance at freedom but provides the possibility of activities he hasn't participated in since the ninth century. Jessi St. James on the other hand thinks at first she's losing her mind, there's no way a man could be trapped in an ancient mirror, but as her life is threatened the events surrounding her become all too real and she has no choice but to free the mirror's mysterious captive. But can Cian keep Jessi alive for the twenty days it will take for the tithe to expire? And if he can does Jessi stand a chance of keeping her heart intact while in the sexy highlander's company?The first thing I have to say is that as I read this again I noticed the ending letter from the author in which she give us an idea of where the hero and heroine are now, but she also mentions that she has no intention of ending the Highlander series for some time to come. She wrote this in 2005 and while the MacKelters are featured as minor sort of background characters in the Fever series who are there but really aren't established as being of great worth to the whole of the story, the Fever series isn't the Highlander series and I personally would like to see these fascinating Druids and their formerly Fae benefactor get a lot more play. She's mentions on her website that she doesn't think she could write a straight romance again and I'm fine with that. I like the way Mac and Barrons story came together in the Fever series. But I would like to see the MacKelters come back to take more prominent roles and not be relegated as somehow less powerful than the other players in the game. When you read this series you can't help but get attached to the characters. While most of the players in the first three novels weren't people you got attached to as they didn't really reappear in later stories with the exception of Adam, readers of the Highlander series have now spent multiple books featuring Gwen, Chloe, Drustan and Daegus MacKelter as well as Adam Black . And it's difficult not to also get attached to the fascinating Cian MacKelter and his mate Jessica in this novel as well. I want to see a novel where these characters are distinctive again. So at the moment after having read that letter to readers in the back of Spell of the Highlander I'm a little disappointed in Moning because it's been seven years since she promised another Highlander series book and while like everyone else who's had the pleasure of reading it I adored her Fever series, I want another Highlander novel too. Especially as this one leaves some lose ends that I didn't see answered in the Fever series. There's no denying that the events of Spell of the Highlander are a fabulous set up for the Fever series. I mean the book is a prominent concern in this novel, the Unseelie Hallows are a major focus and Aiobheal outright admits that she's set up the events of the Highlander series to bring them where she needs them so that they will be basically her little Druid army in the future events that occur in the Fever series. But she mentions five druids and well I know who three of them are and I'm guessing Christian from the Fever series is the fourth but Adam isn't a Druid and neither is Circenn Brodie so who is the fifth Druid who will fight to save the queen? Silvan is long dead so it's not him. And Mac is a Sidhe Seer, not a Druid and did we ever actually learn what exactly Barrons is? It's been so long since I've read the Fever series that I can't really remember if that question was ever truly answered.The unanswered strands in this novel are a lot of the reasons I can't bring myself to give it a five stars because at this point the only Moning novel I haven't read is Into the Dreaming and that's on my Nightstand to start later tonight. And since Into the Dreaming is supposed to have come before these stories I don't think I'll find the answers there. What's really neat about this novel is like the Immortal Highlander it actually picks up in the same pivotal scene for The Dark Highlander after the Draghar have been slain. It's neat because you can see how this one moment in time affected so many different lives and you actually in a way see an example of how the fae queen manipulates the strands of the world. This really is an amazing book and while the love story is a little rushed it has to be since the threat of Cian's impending death and the dangers that surrounds them forces them not to hide from each other. Jessica is actually the one of the few female heroines Moning has produced where it almost makes sense that she is still a virgin in her twenties. She's so driven by goal and so haunted by her childhood views of relationships that being hesitant to take the step and go to bed with someone actually makes sense. Especially when you consider the time period during which most girls are hastily making the decision to take the leap into the world of sex Jessica was recovering from a debilitating injury which left her with a metal plate inside her head. At first when I was reading this I was thinking geeze another 20 some year old virgin, could you get any less realistic since the writer has now produced four unlikely modern day adult virgin heroines. But as you learn about Jessi's character it actually makes sense that she would be. So much like Gabrielle it actually made sense for her where it didn't so much with Chloe and Gwen. The close third person narrative offered in this story offers a thrill ride of action from beginning to end. One thing I don't understand though is how Moning could state on her website that this series was just a romance because honestly I saw so much more in the plots of this series. I could clearly see the set up of the series to come even if she claims they're unrelated just reading them you can see whether consciously or not the seeds and set up for the Fever series in the Highlander series. Each book in the Highlander series slowly builds this idea before the idea explodes in the first Fever series novel. If this were simply a romance, a typical happily ever after tale well honestly I doubt it would keep my attention. Yes I like my spice and happy endings in romance but there are very very few contemporary romances that keep my attention in any way shape or form and without a delicious secondary plot to a romance novel I tend not to get hooked on it. She references Darroc, who we'll really learn about in the Fever series though he was a big part of the Immortal Highlander as well, in this story. She continues in this novel to build this massively fascinating world, a world that is clearly the beginning of the Fever series. Her back story and tales of Fae and Druid history are absolutely fascinating and honestly as much as I like a good love story, it's that more than the romance that keeps me coming back to her Highlander series and leaves me wanting more. Moning is a talented story teller and Spell of the Highlander is an excellent demonstration of that. The sexual tension between Jessica and Cian is palpable but it's his curse and the hallows as well as the danger that makes this a fast paced, page turning ride from beginning to end. On top of that Moning offers just the right amount of humorous, laugh out loud scenes to keep the novel from becoming too dark. It's the perfect blend of everything I love about reading, there's magic, lore, love, danger and humor. Who could ask for more in such a story? With the exception for the loose ends I'd like to see tied up someday I can't think of anything I didn't like about this novel.While my favorite MacKelter will always be Drustan of Kiss of the Highlander, Moning presents us with a deliciously interesting character in Cian. This man has lived for centuries imprisoned inside a mirror and always outside of life. He's seen thing so horrid none of us could even really comprehend them and done some things of which the guilt would kill a lesser man. He's not as broody as Daegus but he's an interesting, layered character all the same and I think I could read about him for novel after novel and still not get enough of him or the other MacKelters in this series. Jessica is also a fairly complex and layered character who seems a nice fit for Cian but at the same time she doesn't have the years and experience under her belt to offer the same amount of page turning interest as the hero. She's a character you can related to fairly well, but in some ways she's like Chloe where not everything she does really makes sense to me or is something I can relate to. Most of the secondary characters were already established in the series and while Moning gives us a little more build on Daegus's character most of their characterization relies on previously established books and a reader new to the series might have trouble finding at the very least Gwen and Chloe to be distinctive from each other. You can clearly see the difference in Daegus and Drustan but without having read Kiss of the Highlander and The Dark Highlander Chloe and Gwen might not be as easy to separate and see as individuals. Lucan the villain of this tale was fairly well developed and exceedingly interesting however and boy would I ever kill to see the stories behind this one. The meeting of Cian and Lucan and the events that led to Cian's imprisonment as well as various other back stories that provide the set up for this series. Moning gives us just enough of these characters to leave a reader salivating for more.Overall I'd definitely recommend Spell of the Highlander to readers of Paranormal Romance and those readers who are fans of the Fever series. I think reading the Highlander series and Fever series both offers so much more to all the novels. Cian and Jessica's journey is thrilling to travel and time well spent. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I love this series and hope there will be more to come. Karen Marie Moning knows how to capture her readers and make them fall in love with the history and magic of Scotland.That said, I was disappointed with the Kindle edition of this book as it slipped in and out of italics throughout for no apparent reason. You kind of lose the rhythm of reading it when you keep wondering \\"Why are there italics? What am I suppose to be paying attention to?\\" Kinda silly but it really was distracting. I would still recommend the book though!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"We're not done with the McKeltar Highlanders just yet. Karen Marie Moning introduces us to a new member of the sexy clan, Cian. He was born in the 9th century and was probably the most gifted and powerful of the Druid line. But he met a Dark Sorcerer named Lucian who tricked him into friendship and trapped him inside a Fae mirror for over 1000 years. Now the mirror has been stolen and sold to a college professor. Lucian sends his goons to retrieve it --but not before the professor's assistant, the lovely Jessi, crosses paths with it. When her life is on the line, Cian tells her how to free him from the mirror to save his life.Of course, enchanted mirrors and the Fae are a tough pill to swallow, but Jessi becomes a believer quickly as Lucian sends more threats to her life. And despite his dark edge and penchant for taking charge, she can't help but being drawn to Cian. The two go on the run; Cian determined to protect Jessi. They only have to elude Lucian for three weeks, until Halloween. If Lucian doesn't reclaim the mirror by then, the curse is broken. Unfortunately, Cian can only stay outside of the mirror for a few hours at a time before it reclaims him until the next day.The couple decides to go to Scotland, to hide on MacKeltar land. And there, they run into Dageus and Drustan. Cian reluctantly seeks their help as Lucian closes in on him. In the meantime, the relationship between him and Jessi reaches a fever pitch. But he is holding a secret that will likely ruin any chance they have at a future.The end of the book sets up the events that take place in Moning's Fever series... which takes place five years after the conclusion of this story. We hear from the Fae Queen, an overview of what is to come in the dark days ahead.I liked this book, though not quite so much as \\"Kiss of the Highlander (The Highlander Series, Book 4).\\" It feels like every hero has to be more powerful than the last.... Enough already. The love scenes were very hot. And I was pleasantly surprised at the tenderness we see from our tortured Cian. One other little peeve: enough with the virgins already, sheesh! A heroine doesn't HAVE to be a virgin in every book. Let's change it up just a little every now and then m'kay? 4 stars."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Okay, so let me begin by saying that I did not read this book word-for-word. It came in my order of free books (thank God it was free), and I skimmed it from start to finish, reading large chunks here-and-there, and paragraphs in other places just to hurry me along.With that said, I read enough to know that the male protagonist, Cian (a hot Druidian Highlander who has lived in a mirror for over a thousand years) was more believable and realistic than his 21st Century female protagonist, Jessica (a 25-year-old college student studying for her Ph.D.).So, let's take a look at Jessica: It's not believable that a 25-year-old Ph.D. student is 1) Going to talk like a 16-year-old Valley Girl (\\"Well, duh!\\", \\"Whuh!?\\", \\"As if!\\" and \\"Crimeny, what a butt!\\" are some of Jessica's more astute quotations and thoughts); 2) Be a virgin (continue on for why I find her virginity hard to believe); 3) Wear low rider jeans with a thong purposefully showing over the waistline to tease members of the opposite sex (see why her virginity is not very believable?); 4) Has boobs seemingly the size of watermelons (like, fer sure, that's believable!!! Not!); 5) Can eat four cheeseburgers without gaining an ounce of fat when I saw no mention of her workout regimen.I'll admit that any woman with a healthy libido (and one who has male domination fantasies of being tantalized by a man with an expertise of the female anatomy) will drool over this book...but the storyline...wait a minute - what storyline? It was if the author wanted to write a sexual fantasy, and then decided to throw some semblance of plot around all the sex scenes. Great sex scenes, though!!! I'll admit that much!! Whoa! Who turned the heat up in here!But, sex scenes do not a great book make. A plot and plausible, realistic characters with more than just abnormally large body parts flopping around and sticking out everywhere make a book one to remember.Also, the author's use of the word \\"slant\\" really became irritating after a while. He \\"slanted\\" his mouth over hers. She \\"slanted\\" her mouth over his. He \\"slanted\\" her head up to his. Okay...enough with the slanting!! He \\"tipped\\" her head up to his. She \\"tilted\\" her face up so that their lips met. He \\"brushed his lips over hers, softly at first, then more aggressively as his passion mounted.\\" Okay...do you get the picture here? A little variety, please!Lastly, the end of the book had a rushed \\"so-a-stake-through-the-heart-does-not-kill-a-vampire\\" feel to it. It was almost as if the ending was an afterthought and an urgent attempt to make the world right again so that the sun would continue to rise and set...blah, blah, blah.This story had so much potential!!! One other reviewer said that it felt rushed, and I would agree. It was as if I was reading a rough draft instead of a well-thought-out and finished product. I think I even caught a few misspelled words along the way. I'm writing a book myself, and after a three-hour skim of this one, if mine doesn't get published, something is wrong in this world! Mine is still in rough draft stage, but it's already better than this one.Sorry, Ms. Moning, but this book missed the mark for me. Great sex, but not much else. You need to do a better job of developing your characters than this. It seemed like Junior High reading to me (and, in fact, reminded me of the stories I wrote in Junior High), but, sex scenes aside, this book isn't for \\"mature\\" audiences, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"1 BEYOND THE HIGHLAND MIST* A Midsummer Night's Dream-like time travel; a cute tale of a contemporary heroine (untrusting of attractive guys) & too gorgeous Hawk2 TO TAME A HIGHLAND WARRIOR* Grimm is a Berserker, sort of a 'touched' super warrior.

Trusting that reading-between-the-lines will be enough to provide the same feelings. This sometimes makes the storyline empty after the initial excitement of the plot begins to fade. The characters' manners are carbon copied ... the binding vows seem inevitable ... the humor and sexuality lack originality and spice ...Ah well, the author starts a new series soon."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"After reading (and loving) the Fever series, I went back and read all of the Highlander books and for the most part, I wasn't disappointed. However, one thing that really detracted from this book was the formatting for Kindle.Unfortunately, Spell of the Highlander was full of misplaced italics...in fact, the majority of the book was written in italics, with intermittent and wrongly placed switching between italic and non-italic script. This is the only book in the series in which this occurred.The MacKeltar books all have very engaging storylines and characters, however the poor format prevented me from really getting into the story. As far as the actual plot went, I found the characters to be a little underdeveloped for Karen Moning's usual style, and the ending to be extremely rushed. That said, it was still a good book and a must-read for finishing out the MacKeltar books and contributing to some Fever series back story."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This all started with a Kindle freebie months ago. Oh how things change. Once, I was unaware of KMM as an author and blindly oblivious to either the Highlander or Fever series. Now, several months and a LOT of happy reading later, I'm sitting in awe of the mind that has created and penned TWO series with delicately interwoven stories and building drama. I've never even heard of an author able to do what KMM's done here.Starting with the Highlander series, a solid and THOROUGHLY well written time travel paranormal romance series, KMM's fleshed out and delineated a world full of magick, mystery, danger, and HOT highlander men. THOROUGHLY entertaining narrative with delicious humor and mouth-watering sensuality that, when read one after another, winds you through a path of increasing danger and intrigue and Tuatha D&eacute; Danann machinations leading straight to the front door of the Fever series. Each book in the Highlander series gets darker and darker, and the tone of the Spell of the Highlander so closely matches the start of that decidedly urban fantasy series that the transition is virtuously seamless. It's all due to KMM's phenomenal talent as an author and dedication as a story teller.Spell of the Highlander was perhaps not my favorite of the Highlander series, but that's roughly akin to saying dark chocolate isn't my favorite of the chocolates - it's ALL delicious, decadent, and delightful. I just grooved on Adam Black a wee bit more than Cian. Totally loved Jessi, though. And their story was taut, tightly woven, and rich with history - like all the Highlander stories. What elevated Spell of the Highlander to nearly iconic stature in my eyes was how deftly KMM wove in details of things that I'd wondered about in the Fever series. That's just totally kick ass, and earned ultimate respect. If I'd read the Highlander series first, I don't know that I'd have truly appreciated the attention to the most miniscule detail, so I'm glad I didn't...but I FULLY intend to go back now and read the first four books of the Fever series (and NOT just to soothe the JZB jones until Shadowfever is released in December) now that I understand more of the Fae mythos and KMM's rich, detailed world.Excellent read for Spell of the Highlander. Mind boggling how amazing the series is as a whole. And I just don't have the words to fully express my appreciation for KMM and the world created with the Highlander and Fever series together."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Huh. Well. This was interesting.I got hooked on Karen Marie Moning via her FEVER series - wonderful but pretty dark urban fantasies with a romantic core. I love, love, love the FEVER series. I tried one of the Highlander books - THE DARK HIGHLANDER - hoping for a similar reading experience. But THE DARK HIGHLANDER was a very different kind of book, a much mellower, more typical romance. THE DARK HIGHLANDER wasn't half as dark as the more cheerful parts of the FEVER books, if you ask me.When I read the customer reviews of SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER a little suspicion formed in my mind. A lot of readers who'd enjoyed other HIGHLANDER books were frustrated by SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER. Everyone seemed to think that the romance was a little more intense, a little less romantic, while simultaneously pointing out that the adventure elements were more dominant than in previous books. Hmmm, I thought. It sounds like SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER might be a little more like the FEVER series. I snapped it right up and...wow, it is a LOT more like the FEVER books. No wonder the romance fans were frustrated. The book is decidedly a romance, and the relationship between Cian and Jessi is the focus of the book, but its tone and atmosphere are straight out of the FEVER books.Devoted FEVER readers will be thrilled by the crossovers here. The conclusion of the book is practically a spoiler for the FEVER series (and since it's definitely a spoiler for SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER, that's all I'll say), and any FEVER readers who want to learn more about the Unseelie Hallows will find plenty of information here, since Cian is trapped inside of one - a mirror - and the villain of the novel is hunting for a certain Dark Book that has been at the center of the FEVER series from the beginning. The mirror aspect also sheds some light on the Sifting Silvers. The Barrons-curious will be pleased to know that we learn more about the difference between Druids and sorcerers, and the purpose of those red-and-black tattoos that sorcerers wear.Also for the Barrons-curious: the hero of this book, Cian, is enough like him that reading SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER is almost wickedly enjoyable.Now, I've managed to get to the end of my review without saying a whole lot about the plot of the book itself. Personally, I loved it. I thought it was deliciously intense, that all the danger complimented the romance and all the romance enhanced the danger. Very steamy. Cian and Jessi are together pretty much 24/7, so they have a lot of time to interact over the course of the novel, building a relationship while the villain sends them on a wild ride."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This is definitely my least favorite of the Highlander series by Moning. The relationship started out very cute, but it quickly took a back seat to other story lines. In fact, the end was very truncated and we didn't get to learn how our couple fared. I think Moning realized this and tried to fix it by adding the author's note at the end, but it failed.We do get to see old favorites, like Drustan and Drageus, but they continue to distract from the plot. I don't like investing 300 pages to a plot line that just doesn't get finished. Oh well...Bottom line, if you are new to Moning, don't start with this one. If however, you have read the other six books, I won't try to dissuade you."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This is the third book in this series that I've read and I've found that they are all pretty good. I like Ms. Moning's writing style (I find myself laughing out loud quite often at the heroines' conversations with themselves) and find the world of the Keltars very interesting. The whole series is an original take on the Druids and fairy myths.This edition got off to a slower start than Dark Highlander and Immortal Highlander (the other two that I've read) but it caught up very quickly and captured my interest. I wound up staying up all Saturday night to finish it. Just had to know how they would get him out of that mirror jam. It reminded me of Julian's predicament in Sherrilyn Kenyon's Fantasy Lover. Anyway, it's an interesting series that I recommend readily to anyone who enjoys romance novels with a bit of the supernatural. I intend to purchase the whole series."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting this book for a year or more,now,and I was not disappointed!!! Spell is SIGNATURE KMM STUFF!!! All of the trademark humor,sexual tension,mystery,and of course the meddling Fae are present in Spell!Cian MacKeltar is trapped in the \\"Dark Glass\\",and has been for over 1,000 years.Tricked by his onetime \\"friend\\" into it,his one chance to be free of the Dark Glass is to keep it out of Lucan Trevayne's hands until after midnight on Samhain.(Halloween)Then the chance for Trevayne to pass the gold \\"tithe\\" through the mirror,by which he has ensured his immortality for the last 1,000 + years,will be gone.Jessica St.James has been asked to accept delivery of a \\"package\\" at the university she attends,being the professor's assistant.Trevayne sends men to retrieve the Dark Glass,stolen from his home.They are under orders to kill anyone who has seen it.Jessica is forced to summon Cian out of the Glass in order to protect her from Trevayne's flunky.The trick now is to stay one step ahead of Trevayne and his people,while trying to keep her hands off the unbelievably sexy,powerful Cian MacKeltar.He certainly doesn't want to keep his hands off her,after 1,000 + years of celibacy!The sexual tension smolders,eventually exploding to a scorching,sizzling level.Jessica is a smart,clever girl,an excellent match for Cian.Much loved characters from Karen's previous books are in Spell,also.Dageus and Drustan MacKeltar,powerful Druids themselves and descendants of Cian,add humor to the story and figure nicely in the resolution,as well as the Queen of the Fae,Aoibheal,who has plans for the Highlanders....Although my favorite book remains The Immortal Highlander(Adam Black.'Nuff said!) Spell is an AWESOME book,and I highly recommend it! It is able to stand on its own,I believe.However,do not miss out on the rest of Karen's EXTRAORDINARY writing,ALL her books are excellent,fabulous reads,and she has unique ideas/plots,in them ALL! Part of the appeal of her writing is that previous,much loved characters reappear without distracting you from the primary couple in the book.The world of the Fae she has created is intriguing,and the books yet to come are sure to be marvelous stories,not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I'm a huge fan of Moning's and this novel does not disappoint. The hero is hot and the chemistry is strong. Another book that confirms my love of this author...and of highlanders."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I stumbled onto Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series after reading favorable reviews from Amazon. I was a little reluctant to pick them up at first because for some silly reason I thought the plot seemed far-fetched. After devouring the whole series, the only thing that seems silly is that I waited so long before I read the first one!Cian MacKeltar is a Druid, and an ancestor of Dageus and Drustan. For the past eleven hundred+ years, he's been trapped inside an Unseelie mirror by his sworn enemy, the vile sorcerer Lucan. When a thief breaks into Lucan's home and steals the mirror from Lucan, Cian has no choice but to go along for the ride.Jessi St. James is a hard-working twenty-four year old student pursuing a PhD. Her every waking moment is spent slaving away grading her professor's exams, or running errands for him. One night, he calls her up and requests she accept delivery of an item for him, since he can't do it himself. Jessi reluctantly drags herself out of bed and makes her way down to his office at the university. After unwrapping the rather large package, she discovers its contents--a mirror, and a gorgeous, powerful Highlander within. Fortunately, Cian can be summoned from the mirror for varying amounts of time, depending on the vagaries of the fae. Sparks quickly fly between these two. But soon, Jessi's life may be in danger as Lucan attempts to get the mirror back into his possession.This book was a fun, worthwhile, exhilarating, and sexy read. I love Moning's Highlander Cian. He is definitely an alpha male and will stop at nothing to protect those he loves, but he is also very caring, intelligent, and resourceful. One thing in particular about this book that got my interest was a premise introduced at the end of the book that seems to insinuate there are still two more MacKeltar Druids to be found.I only had a few problems with this book. One of them was that Jessi was impervious to influence by Druid powers due to a plate in her head. That seemed rather silly to me. I thought another explanation might have seemed more realistic.Karen Marie Moning certainly knows what she's doing, because her books are brilliant. I feel her characters are richly drawn, well-characterized, and very human. Her heroines are strong and intelligent, and her males are never overbearing. I loved this installment in the Highlander series, and I am eagerly anticipating the next one."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"What can I say Karen, you've done it again.. another great highlander novel.I now find myself researching scotland and taking a look at how beautiful the country is thanks to reading your books.I'm looking forward to your next book after the ' Spell Of The Highlander.Keep up the good work...Sincerely Billie"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I was really pleased with this book, as with all of Karen Marie Moning's Highlander novels. It was definitely a page-turner. I appreciated that she brought back several of the most popular characters from the series (yummy Drustan and Daegus Mackelter in particular), and that she set the stage nicely for the next several novels to come. There seemed to be a little less humor in this novel than in, say, Kiss of the Highlander, but all in all the characters were engaging and the male protagonist, Cian Mackelter, was scrumptious and sexy.I don't have a problem with Ms. Moning sticking to the same formula that has worked in the past as long as she keeps coming up with new and exciting characters to play out the time travel romances at which she excels...and this was definitely one of those."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I've been in a reading rut for a month or so, which is so unlike me. Then, finally, I recieved this book which I pre ordered for Rhapsody Book Club about two months ago. This book has snapped me out of my rut, and now I'm ready to read about more alpha males again!First off, let me say that I've read all of Moning's books, and this is one of the best. You really can't rank them because they are all THAT good. Cian MacKelter was born with all the power of the Druids (and then some), the only one in existence that had ever been blessed, or cursed, with all the powers of the Druids. Betrayed by his best friend Lucan, Cian has been trapped inside a mirror for over eleven hundred years, let out only occasionally to satisfy Lucan's cruel whims. Then one day the Dark Glass is stolen and placed into Jessica St. James unwilling hands.Jessi doesn't understand why someone was trying to kill her. Couldn't even begin to comprehend that a man had stepped out of the weird mirror and ran after her assailant. It must all be a dream. But she finds out that Cian Mackelter is not only NOT a dream, but he is overwhelmingly real. Running from her assasins, and trying to keep her virginity intact, she goes on an adventure of a lifetime that she would have never thought possible.There wasn't as much adventure or plot as other Moning books, but I tell ya, this one was very, very, sensual. I found no problems with the hero of the book, but Jessi was too annoying for my tastes. Moning has always created great heroines, but this one had something lacking. There were humorous parts in the book, like when Dageus found Drustan shaking his fist and hollaring at a mirror in the front yard. I personally thought that Cian was the perfect looking hero: his long braids (not his whole hair ladies) tattooed arms and neck, tall dark and handsome...sigh. Perfect for a highlander.Run to the bookstore and buy this book. It's a book in one of the best series ever written for the historical romance reader."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"i just loved this book. I have read my fair share of romance novels in the past 10 years and this is up there with my all time favorite next to ofcourse all of Julia Garwood's and Johanna Lindsey older stuff. The men in these \\"Highlander\\" series were just delicious, wonderful, romantic, strong basically the next best thing to sliced bread. And, the female leads were pretty, smart, strong and mainly believable. After reading the entire series i have decided i must make a trip to scotland and hopefully fall back in time. YUMMY!!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"For some reason I was expecting this book to be less entertaining then the rest. I was wrong. It was a very well woven plot which leaves me looking forward to more \\"Highlander\\" books by Moning in the future. I just can't seem to get enough of the time traveling Keltars. Bring it on Karen!!! I'll be first in line for the ride. Thanks for great writing in a sea of veritable \\"paper crap\\", your's stands out."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"If you like passionate romance novels that take you to exotic locals with a sexually charged alpha male hero, you will want to read this book!

I really enjoyed the fast pace, the great humor, and the deeply passionate relationship between our hero and heroine. I was sorry when it ended, but lucky for me there are six more in this series for me to devour. And devour them I will. KMM has officially moved to my \\"must buy\\" list of authors."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Another great highland epic by Karen Moning. If you have read any of Karens you know the drill. It's the same basic formula but it always works. This book kept me glued from beginning to end. Our highlander 'Cian' is the ultimate man, big, beautiful, loyal and totally 100% male. Our heroine is an over-worked student who is planning on a life once she leaves school in walks 'Cian' and his issue (you'll have to read the book to find that out) and her life is turned upside down. It's the kind of story that makes you feel \\"why can't this happen to me\\", the magic, myths and men a great combination and another winner from Karen."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"KMM has done it again..

I think the raw emotions were more intense in this story. This was a fantastic read that I could hardly put down. What I liked about this story was the humour from Jessi's point of view. Her comments had me laughing out loud throughout the book...often startling my 2 dogs! This was a delight and highly sensual. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This latest book from Karen Marie Moning is excellent, just as expected. Her books go beyond ordinary romance novels, they are exciting adventure novels that include a story of love. You will enjoy every last page and cry out for more!"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Karen Moning's reputation as a fiesty, sexy, and funny author is well deserved with this latest book. Jessica St. James is a fantastic heroine with the right amount of human weakness, spunk, and twenty-first century woman. Cian MacKeltar is the true Alpha Male of the summer, complete with just enough of machismo and heart to make even the most hardened of readers sigh. Moning's work has always been good, but her true grit as an author, and not just a writer comes out in this book. What began as one novel, \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" has blossomed into a full fledged series that only gets better with every book. And with at least 2 more coming, who can wait??"},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Karen Marie Moning weaves magic with hot highlander goodness. Ah, it's such a nice blend, too.Behind the every day goings on of the world is one where faries tinker and power can weave worlds. This power can be light or it can be dark. Cian, born gifted with power and charged as a guardian of the Sidhe, was tempted by the dark arts. Unfortunatly that kind of stuff attracts unsavory types. Hence Cian has been trapped for hundreds of years in a mirror of dark power.Grad student Jessica St. James, unfortunately, ends up opening up a package for her professor that contains this dark object. Sure, you get a hot guy, but the headache of having to deal with a dark mirror and a psycho dark mage ready to kill for it back.Of course the romance between Jessica St. James and Cian is fabulous. Karen Marie Moning has a talented pen and writes dialogue that is funny and wicked.I really enjoy her world of alpha highlanders and magic."},{"Title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"I eagerly awaited the publication of this book.

I was one of the loyal Highlander fans who felt really disappointed with \\"The Immortal Highlander.\\" However, \\"Spell of the Highlander\\" is an excellent story. The hero, \\"Cian\\", is dark, mysterious, dominant, and possessive of the woman he loves. He fits the ancient time period he comes from. The modern world has not tainted him.The heroine, \\"Jessi\\", is the typical \\"Highlander\\" series female character. She is a virgin, from the modern world, who is educated in a field surrounding ancient times. I would have liked to see something different in this female lead. Still, I liked her because she wasn't overly sarcastic or snobby. She was more of an everyday modern young woman.The Story:Jessi is well on her way to earning her PhD in archaeology. She has dedicated her life to her education, leaving no time for a social life. She is stretched between school, studying, and working as a student teacher at the university. Her mentor, Professor Keene, has become injured. He sends Jessi to his office to receive a package for him. When it arrives, she must open the package to inspect the condition of the merchandise.A mirror from ancient times, but with modern glass, this artifact is a mystery. When Jessi leaves Professor Keene's office, she has the feeling she is being watched.When the office goes dark, Cian MacKelter peers through the entrance of his prison: The Dark Glass. Peeking out, he sees that his sense of smell had been correct... \\"He smelled woman.\\"Trapped in The Glass for over 1100 years, Cian's knowledge of the modern world consists only of what he has been able to watch from his captor's wall. This modern woman is unlike those from his time. She wears pants, speaks boldly, and has short curly hair. He is drawn to her. He decides that if he is freed he will have her.Jessi's long hours are now even longer. Aside from her usual schedule, she has taken on the grading of Professor Keene's student reports. While in his office, a strange man enters. He seems to have a lot of knowledge about the mysterious mirror. Something feels wrong about this man. Before she is realizes what he intends, the man pulls a strangulation cord from his pocket. Jessi knows this man wants the mirror. To stop his attack, she grabs a lamp and threatens to smash the glass. While in the midst of a stand- off, a voice arises from behind Jessi. There is a man in the mirror. He promises Jessi that if she will release him from The Glass he will protect her from her attacker. Jessi repeats the spell Cian recites. A huge man walks through the glass. He chases the attacker from the office. Jessi is convinced it is all a dream.Now that Cian has found this woman who can release him from The Glass, he offers her protection from future assassins who will be coming for it. In exchange, Jessi will help him reach Scotland where he can take revenge against his captor, an evil sorcerer named Lucian. Each time Cian is released, he has only a few hours before The Dark Glass reclaims him. Together, Cian and Jessi travel to Scotland in a quest to kill Lucian. It is their only hope for Cian's freedom, and Jessi's safety.During their time together, Cian and Jessi fall in love. When Jessi asks how Cian feels about her, he responds by thumping his chest with his fist and telling her \\"You fit me here, woman.\\" Jessi's heart sores. However, Cian is keeping a dark secret from Jessi. Cian's revenge has a very costly price.\\"Spell of the Highlander\\" is a captivating story. Drustan and Dageus MacKeltar are brought in about 3/4 of the way through the book. Drustan's part is pretty mild. However, Dageus becomes key in saving Jessi and Cian. I loved the fact that Dageus could still call upon his dark side. He was hot in \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\", hotter in \\"The Dark Highlander\\", and just as hot in \\"Spell of the Highlander.\\""},{"Title":"Reading and Writing Workout for the SAT (College Test Preparation)","review":"This is the WORST prep book for the SAT (along with the Princeton Review's Math workout).

It should be digested over about 6 weeks, and should be used along with a book of practice tests to practice the techniques introduced in the chapters and problem sets. Also, the book's content requires drilling and pacing (practice practice) to work. Do not buy it with \\"Cracking the SAT\\" (which is a condensed version of the 2 workout books combined with a couple practice tests.) Explanations for all problem answers are given, making it helpful in understanding implementation of strategies. The occasional typos and, worse, occasional wrong answer choices listed for revised problems (with the old problem explanation accompanying) make the editing of this book sometimes surprisingly sloppy. The flash cards are silly, since flash cards only work when self-prepared, but they do have nice sentence examples. Still, the basic messages of this book--with its Math Workout twin--are the best available."},{"Title":"Reading and Writing Workout for the SAT (College Test Preparation)","review":"As an educator and an SAT tutor, this is my top pick for the SAT review. This book may not have as many practice tests as some have complained, but it has strategies, and that is what's key.

I believe Isaac Newton spent a lot of time with God going to him with questions on his mind and God answered him with the small things like an apple hitting him on the head. I agree with a lot of his historical views of interpretation but am not premillenial. During his time (as he states in his book)a lot of expositor's saw more fullfilment of the prophesies of Daniel in the first coming of Christ as do I. I also believe the feet of iron and clay are both Roman and Jew. The kingdoms represented are kingdoms that ruled Jerusalem and at the time of Christ the Jews had a priestly rulership though it was a man-made one (clay) while the Romans had a strong-arm rulership (iron). This is an eye opener for anyone who has not read any interpretation from a historical viewpoint and well worth the price. Relatively short and to the point."},{"Title":"Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John","review":"Who doesn't totally love and respect Isaac Newton? What a mind!

There is in this book a consistency of interpretation in all the details of the prophecies of Daniel and of Revelation that I have not seen in any of the works of modern-day scholars. Isaac Newton seems to be completely true to the message of the Bible when providing his own thoughts on the Antichrist, the Beast, the Woman called &quot;Babylon&quot;, and the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot;. The integrity of Newton's scholarship and skills of exegesis give the reader a distinct impression that, unlike most writers on end-times prophecy today, when faced with a detail of interpretation that conflicted with his existing views, Newton would have gladly given up his prejudices in exchange for something better: the Truth. He presents an excellent example--perhaps the best I have read--of what is known as Premillennial Historicism. This is essentially the same view held by H. Grattan Guinness, E.B. Elliott, Matthew Henry, and Charles Spurgeon. In my opinion every pastor or teacher who preaches or teaches on the subject of the Last Things should have a copy of &quot;Observations...&quot; on his or her desk."},{"Title":"Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John","review":"Isaac Newton's interpretation of the prophecies of Daniel and John's Revelation of Jesus Christ was a great surprise. He loaded his points with historic reference rather than 'This is what I feel is true' views that we read and hear so often today. Although I was impressed with his historic views of these prophecies, I was most impressed with his Christian faith. To think one of the greatest scientists of all time was a strong believer in Christ is simply awesome!"},{"Title":"Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John","review":"This book gives you a great viewpoint from Newton on Christian Eschatology.

He recognizes the faces of the creatures as symbols employed by the tribes in their encampment standards.Judah- a Lion, Ephraim- a Bull or ox, Dan- an Eagle, Reuben- a Man. On page 132 he wrote,\\"Whence were framed the heiroglyphicks of cherubims and seraphims to represent the people of Israel.\\"He defines the differences between cherubim and seraphim.The author also provides a thoughtful argument against Antiochus Epiphanes being the horn in Daniel.Like Uriah Smith and others, he identifies the little book in Revelation as the sealed book from Daniel.For any reader looking to study a historicist view of Daniel and the Revelation of John, I would recommend \\"The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation\\" by Uriah Smith as a much better choice."},{"Title":"Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John","review":"I was very excited when I found out Isaac Newton was a Unitarian like myself. So I got the two books that he had written about the bible and it's meaning. I think there is another one but I am not sure. The first one concerning two errors in the bible and this one. The first one was a private a letter that turned up in the 40's. They have been published now and shed light on one of the most intelligent men in history.This book goes with his wanting to know when the end would come. Which oddly enough is around 2060. The way he walks through the prophercies of Daniel and Revealtion is something to behold. He does take some shots at the Trinity but overall it is more of a history book of things that have been fulfilled. To see this mans mind at work is something to behold indeed.A lot of people don't know he was going to become a minister. After years of study he walked away from taking the title because of the Trinity belief. He could not voice his opinion for fear that he would be killed. He hid them and they were found much later and sold at an auction. This is a great read not matter what you believe. If you are like me it adds to what you already believe. If you are a Trinitarain it is still a great study on the prophecy of the bible and who knows it might make you consider the Trinity in a different light and make you study the subject for yourself!"},{"Title":"Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John","review":"Newton's obscure but relevant observations on Daniel and Revelation is an astounding work.

Although his conclusions about which countries were represented by the different symbols in Daniel and Revelation &#8212; due to his position in our timeline &#8212; his amazingly studious research was as thorough as it could have possibly been. His proximity in time to the literature he references makes for a very interesting perspective. I did, however, skip almost all of the latin and old/middle french he writes in (at length) so I managed to read through the book in a couple of days.

The Dastard, a book in Piers Anthony's Xanth series, is about a young man, The Dastard, who gave up his soul to Lord Xanth in exchange for the power to go back in time and change events. The Dastard is searching for a princess to marry. Xanth is a magical world within Florida where all naturally born citizens have a magic talent. The Dastard is accompanied by Becka, a 14-year-old girl with the talent of turning into a fearsome dragon. The two of them soon encounter a woman who can turn into a soup-er star and numerous other women the Sea Hag, a demoness who sucks the souls out of girls, took control over. Three four-year-old princess, Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm, transform into their twenty-one-year-old selves to help defeat the Dastard.The Dastard shows one main theme: good or bad, life is an obstacle course with people in your way. Not everyone is satisfied by the objectives and actions of others.The Dastard is a wonderful book for fantasy and adventure lovers alike. I loved this book because of the story's constant momentum. Anthony just throws out the adventures one after another. Anthony's unique style of switching the perspective from the princesses to the Dastard creates an unsustainable suspense at the end of every chapter.

It has a lot of humor and too many puns (as usual), but the puns don't detract from the story. I have been waiting for the last 2 years for Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm to make an appearance as major characters and I really like their personalities. I would have liked them to star more as children (like Ivy did in Dragon on a Pedestal, my favorite Xanth novel), but maybe next time. Becka also proved to be a dynamic character. She had her dragon heratige to keep the Dastard in line, but also her morals and common sense to provide an alternate point of view from the Dastard and to move the plot along. Castle Maidragon was great fun and I hope it appears in future books. I'm glad Becka got her wish (though I won't say what it is). I thought the ending needed work and I would have prefered to see the Dastard work on using his talent for good.

The Xanth series pokes fun at the mundane world. Anyone who lives in Florida will appreciate the way Anthony describes local landmarks with a pun-ish twist.The Dastard didn't let me down. Piers Anthony is back with a great plot as well as a bucketful puns. I know, people have been saying that the Xanth books were becoming just one big pun and there wasn't really a story. I'll have to agree, but it was only a few books and they were still a GREAT read. But, be forewarned. The Dastard has not one, not two, but more plots and subplots than you'd ever dream of in Xanth book.

Do I think there are too many puns in some of the Xanth novels? Occasionally, yes. Do I think the series is something that should have been stopped? Heck no!The Xanth series is great for what it is--light fantasy, with an OCCASIONAL serious comment tossed in (drunk driving, etc). The books are something to pick up, enjoy, and get away from your troubles for a short time. If you want so-called &quot;serious literature&quot; and try to gauge Xanth by that standard you will be seriously disappointed. But then again if you are foolish enough to use the wrong standards in judging things in life, you will have trouble in more than just reading..."},{"Title":"Dastard","review":"Like many fantasy readers, I've followed Xanth from _Spell_ to the present with a kind of addicted disappointment. The first nine books were punny enough to make critics' eyes roll, but they shared a coherence and unity of plot that kept everything under control. Since Anthony's move from Del Rey to Avon and later to Tor Books, the plots have suffered from neglect and wordplay has taken over._Zombie Lover_ and _Xone of Contention_ strengthened my suspicion that Anthony spends more time lately assembling reader-suggested puns and plot twists than he does coming up with his own material. I was expecting more of the same with _The Dastard_, but as the Author's Note informs us, Anthony used up his supply of reader suggestions sometime during the first draft of _Dastard_. The result is a delightful throwback to what made the first nine books so enjoyable. The story line is suspenseful, the characterization is effective (no small feat when your protagonists are two mirror-image sets of triplets!) and no deus ex machina comes in at the end to finish things off and baffle the reader.Don't misunderstand me--I'd still rather reread _Centaur Aisle_ than _The Dastard_. But this latest offering is a definite improvement and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Dastard","review":"Love Piers Anthony books! This book was punningly funny!

These books, by Piers Anthony, are full of terrible puns and deep characters. Xanth is a magical, pun-filled land close to the Mundane Florida. In Xanth, everybody has one \\"talent,\\" or magial thing that they can do (Like a girl named Chlorine can poison water). In this story, there is a souless man called the Dastard who's talent is going bck in time and doing things. He uses this talent to make people's lives worse. For instance, if you had made an important discovery, he would ask you about it until he figured out how to prevent it, in which point in time, he went back and stopped it. The three princesses Melody, Rhyme, and Rythm were prophesied to stop him, along with Beka, the dragon-girl, but there is a problem. Beka is already with the Dastard and the 3 princesses are only six years old! The princesses must change places with their older selves from another world so that they can stop the Dastard. I wont tell you the ending; even the most brilliant mind will be surprisd. Like Anthony\\"s other books, this is light reading!

They were fun, light reading that lifted my spirit. As the series grew into the teens and then the 20s, the humor seemed to fade, and the books lost their light-hearted appeal. They were still enjoyable, but no longer what I would choose to ease a lousy day.This book marked a delightful return to the early Xanth. The writing was gleeful and the plot clever without being cumbersome. The Dastard is marvelously wicked and lacked only a moustache to twirl. Becka, the dragon girl assigned to the Dastard, could have been developed more. She showed promise early on, but was shunted to the sidelines when the narrative switched to a different character. As a result, Becka never really grew or directly experienced the conflicts we normally anticipate for a main character. The three princesses Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm make their appearances both as charming four year-olds and powerful but level headed young adults.Unfortunately, the author can't resist putting in at least one female character trying her darndest to seduce a man. These bold attempts that include strategic disrobing, kissing, and embracing bring an unnecessary adult element to the story and are getting tiring to read, book after book.Still, I enjoyed this tale, and will definitely put it on my \\"feel good\\" list.Side note--for the second book in a row, the author has referred to a particular past adventure and some stork signaling we hadn't been aware of. Is he setting up for something, or just throwing in odd details?"},{"Title":"Dastard","review":"A little different from Piers earlier Xanth novels, the dastard is truely a dispicable character.

Usually only Magicians and Sorceress' have powerful talents, such as being able to transform any living creature into something else.Anomy has a useless magic talent - the talent of stupid ideas. Frustrated by this, he sells his soul to a demon for a much more powerful talent - the ability to rewrite history. With his new talent and soulless self, Anomy changes his name to the Dastard, and sets out to erase happy people and events all over Xanth.Three bored princesses, Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm, happen to see the Dastard erase a happening in the magic tapestry in Castle Roogna. The princesses are bored and see this as an opportunity for an adventure; and their parents let them go see the Good Magician to find out how to keep the Dastard from ruining Xanth. He tells them that they need to exchange their four-year-old selves with their seventeen-year-old selves from Ptero, and off they go on an adventure that includes Becka, a dragon-human crossbreed, Sim, who will one day be the smartest bird in the universe, and the Sea Hag, an evil, centuries old spirit.In \\"The Dastard,\\" Anthony provides more of what Xanth is about - fun fantasy. In my opinion, the story is somewhat darker than many in the series, as the Dastard has a talent he puts to evil uses, and with no soul, he has no conscience. The Sea Hag also adds to the darker story, as she possesses young women and uses them their bodies to seduce and control men. But of course there's the classic happy ending, where everyone gets what they want, but for a while you're unsure of just how it's going to happen.3/5."},{"Title":"Manual of Ship Construction","review":"The book came in in perfect conditions and arrived sooner than I had anticipated.

And the last agonizing pages reveal to us the sorrow of a young boy after a fatal accident literally tears his family apart. In between we are bombarded in prose and verse with images of a condemned man in an electric chair rejoicing as his sentence is carried out, parishioners cowering in a church as a storm opens up the gates of hell, and a couple who find sexual satisfaction in a murderous menage a'trois. There are no happy endings here, no trite moral lessons, or vapid words of hope and inspiration. This is reality stark and terrible. This is &quot;Horror&quot; folks and if you like your horror served as it should be, dark, unforgiving, and steaming with the screams of the innocent, then baby John Turi has a book for you! As page tumbles upon page there is no doubt that you are riding along on a journey whose sole purpose is to pound into the reader's mind the horribles lessons of life. Nothing is forever and nothing is guaranteed. It ain't fair and nobody gets out alive. It is true that misery loves company and John Turi has some &quot;Sorrow&quot; to share with you."},{"Title":"Sorrow","review":"John Turi's debut collection &quot;Sorrow&quot; has some fascinating poetry in it and explores some bleak and frightening mental landscapes. Here's one for every connisuer of dark fantasy and horror fiction."},{"Title":"Sorrow","review":"I found this book enjoyable. Always on the look out for the authors, I found Mr. Turi to be quite detailed in his prose, and plotting. Even though I am not generally a poetry fan, I did enjoy the despair it created. I just wish the book was bigger."},{"Title":"Sorrow","review":"Apparantly John Turi designed the new &quot;haunted castle&quot; logo for the Horror Writer's Association. &quot;Sorrow&quot; is his very first collection. The limited edition appeared with a gross, suicide-in-the-bathtub cover certain to offend almost everyone. In fact, this book is definitely not for the faint of heart. Some of Turi's prose pushes the envelope a bit TOO far (at times reminiscent of Ellis in &quot;American Psycho&quot;) and most of the poetry is bluntly sexual. Still, if variety is the spice of life and true horror is what you're looking for, give the guy a shot. He's going places."},{"Title":"The year of the horse","review":"The son and widow of a disgraced Mongol general barely survive as despised beggers on the outskirts of Genghis Khan's imperial encampment. The only remotely friendly figure is the son of another general who feels that the boy should not be punished for the sins of his father. Determined to win glory for himself and clear his father's name, the son asks to serve in the army, but is refused even this.Given the opportunity to gain a horse if he can nurse a frail colt to health, he sees another alternative. When the horse recovers, he and his friend embark on a journey to search for information to clear his father's name, creating a murderous enemy in the process.I've read this well-written and fascinating young adult novel as both a child and an adult, and I recommend it either to lovers of historical novels, particularly those interested in Central Asia.It is fairly unusual to find a decent historical novel about the Mongols, especially from their point of view. They tend to be caricatured as the super-barbarians. Yes, the empire was built on a lot of bloodshed, but so are most empires, like Alexander the Great's, and yet so many are celebrated as \\"glorious\\". Rita Ritchie has written two other books on Mongols of this period: The Golden Hawks of Genghis Khan and The Secret Beyond the Mountain. I recommend them all."},{"Title":"Pueblo, Hardscrabble, Greenhorn: Society on the High Plains, 1832-1856","review":"You'd never know from the dullish title, but this is an interesting, well-written, authoritative book of Western history. The subject is the upper Arkansas River valley around the present city of Pueblo -- not one of the West's most storied locations. There are a number of famous people who pass through the pages of this book -- Kit Carson, John Charles Fremont, Francis Parkman, and the Bents -- but the main characters are unfamiliar and have unalliterative, forgettable names: George S. Simpson, for example.All the disadvantages aside, Janet LeCompte has written a small masterpiece about a handful of ex-mountain men, Mexicans, and traders who established several communities along the Arkansas River from 1840 to 1854. In the latter year, the Ute Indians killed most of the traders, thereby erasing Pueblo's claim to being the first White settlement in Colorado.Most of the histories of the west are expansive, looking a big men and events. \\"PHG\\" is micro, focusing on a relatively unimportant region, and deriving its importance from a reconstruction of daily life among the Anglos and Hispanics at the isolated settlements. The author says the book is about the men and women who struggled to make a good life \\"out of the wild Indians, stubborn soil and thin grass of the difficult valley.\\" Their failure, unnoticed as it may be in the larger scheme of things, is the drama of this homely story.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Pueblo, Hardscrabble, Greenhorn: Society on the High Plains, 1832-1856","review":"Absolutly terrific book about the area, the history of the three communities and their tie into the Taos area. Very enlightening, well researched and documented. Good information about the Mountain Man's demise, how he ended up in the Pueblo area, the connection between the northern ans southern part of the state and the \\"trail system\\". For those who grew up in the area this book can be quite enlightening about places and times that are \\"in your face\\" but not seen. Very good history of the upper Arkansas."},{"Title":"Pueblo, Hardscrabble, Greenhorn: Society on the High Plains, 1832-1856","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of Southern Colorado. I am from that area, and did not know about most of these events."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"This book reads like a wired magazine article. Its envagelical tone betrays a decidely unacademic agenda. At times it feels like you are reading a brochure for Prensky's company rather than an objective evaluation of the capabilities and possiblities of Game-Based Learning. It rarely considers contrarian points of view and when it does, only in passing. That being said, it does contains some interesting ideas. Unfortunately, there are not enough ideas to warrant the book's heft, and the few ideas that it does contain are elaborated and repeated ad naseum. Prensky is unabashed by this and readily admits it in the intro: &quot;You will find thoughout this book that many of the key ideas are repepated and illustrated in different ways and examples. This repetition is deliberate. Winston Churchhill counseled that &quot;if you have an important point to make, don't try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time-- a tremendous whack &quot;. It appears that this quote is more of a justification though than a reason because he later ironically criticizes such reduncacy in corporate training materials: &quot;There was at one time a company that specialized in reducing the length of corporate tapes so they could be listened to more easily. They were typically able to get an hour's lecture or speech down to 10 or even 5 minutes of real content.&quot; I feel that the same could easily be said for this book through more aggressive editing. Furthermore, the various chapters often feel disjointed as if they were constructed as atomic articles (or pieced together from such), rather than as parts of an integrated whole. And I am generous in attributing the original source to articles. My suspicion, based on Prensky's copious overuse of bullet-lists, are that many of the chapters had their odious origins within powerpoint slides. He also too often relies on quotations as support for his views when the people being quoted are not credible academic authorities but rather people running companies with a similar agenda to Prensky."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"When I first got this book, I was hoping to find a much needed argument in favor of the learning and educational benefits of games. Instead I found a lackluster series of marketing-like evangelisms that have neither valid science nor learning theory to back them up. By using a sales-pitch approach in an attempt to convince the reader, this book can do more damage than good to the field of educational videogame design and research. If one really wants to find out about what games have to tell us about learning, I would recommend Jim Gee'sWhat Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacybook instead."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"The content would make a good magazine article because the author does make some good observations and recommendations -- but there isn't nearly enough content here for 400+ pages. I hope the games the author writes/produces aren't as boring and repetitious as parts of his book.There are only a few poorly done illustrations, which I found puzzling given the visual nature of games. Instead of a lot of verbal hand-wringing about all the unwashed who &quot;just don't get it&quot; when it comes to the teaching power of games, a few compelling examples would have more impact.Having built games for teaching and research in the corporate world, I wish the author had spent more time on how to build and maintain good games for really complicated topics. There are a few examples in the book of multi-million dollar military simulation games, but a lot of the other examples seem trivial when applied to genuine corporate needs.Most striking about the examples from the corporate world, however, is the small number of successes and miniscule number of repeated successes. Those few souls who have built successful, non-trivial corporate training games appear to have a hard time repeating that success. This is not a good sign, but it's the hidden (and certainly unintended) message in the book."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"Always enjoyed the hardcoved edition (5 stars). Recently downloaded the Adobe Acrobat version and found it lacking the functions to efficiently read it on a mobile device with Acrobat Reader for Palm Devices. Publisher failed to tag the file to allow jumps from the Table of Contents to the referenced page. The pagination is also 18 pages off. I would not recommend the digital version if there are plans to read it with a mobile device."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"When you set out to tell all about e-learning games, it helps to have a broad background. Harvard MBA Marc Prensky has been a professional musician, high school teacher, business consultant, corporate trainer, and creator of dozens of software e-learning games. He is now CEO of a game company. He brings to the subject an intense love that enables him to find value even in flawed efforts in this fledgeling field, yet he retains the critical capacity and balanced judgment that are the hallmarks of credibility. The book provides a provocative analysis of how widespread playing of video and computer games has created a new under-35 Games Generation that sees the world through radically different eyes than their parents, who can be at best &quot;digital immigrants.&quot; Simply transferring tell-test and &quot;sage on the stage&quot; teaching methods to digital media, as many e-learning companies have done, misses the point, he explains. We need to exploit the opportunities to develop new, more engaging approaches--and that primarily means games. People will learn the most technical or boring subjects if presented as part of compelling, fun games. Prensky offers scores of case studies and war stories from practitioners in the corporate trenches. He ranges from simple quiz games to intensive virtual reality simulations, showing that often simple is better, that not only the type of learner but also the kind of subject/skill to be mastered should determine the approach, and that games possess inherent advantages over simulations. He laughs at the outrageous scenarios players deliberately generate in customer relationship games. He notes with respect the capacity of deep simulations and games to draw upon the insights of communities of experts worldwide to generate cutting-edge research results that can then be parlayed into real-world management systems. And he states six objections to e-learning games, then proceeds to blow them to bits like so many villains in a shooter game. In the book are many practical suggestions for getting an e-learning game project approved and funded as well as for how to bring it into reality. Of special value are its list of state-of-the-art games in various categories and its articulation of the advantages of each type. Two suggestions for the second edition: 1) Games and e-learning are at the cutting edge of a controversial transformation of cultures around the world, so it would be nice to have a chapter on e-learning games outside the United States; and 2) someone needs to explain to McGraw-Hill that publishing a book without first proofreading it is an insult to readers and a blot on the corporate escutcheon. In conclusion, e-learning games are a dynamic field that is wide open to creative initiative and promises major long-term benefits. Prensky's book is a rich, insightful guide and makes absorbing reading."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"Prensky's book had a great impact and have many good things in it, but one become annoyed by the lack of documentation, hype and comlete ignorance of much previous research. The subjectivity gives it a spark but in the (too) long book it becomes too much, getting in the way of solid arguments and evidence."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",D,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=u(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-498ea822"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/65.md","filePath":"guide/65.md"}'),P={name:"guide/65.md"},N=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,N as default};
