News, Mon, 15 Nov 2004 4:13 PM PST'SCRAPBOOK' DELIVERS THE GOODS (Headline)By Robert Osborne NEW YORKLiza Minnelli has certainly had her share of publicized woes of late, but something's on the horizon that should cheer her considerably.Scott Schechter has compiled a magnificent book on the one aspect of L. M. that always seems to get short shrift or is altogether ignored these days, i. e.,her years of delivering the goods in front of cameras and on stages throughout the world. That work has won her, to date, an Oscar (1972), three Tonys (1965, '74, '78), an Emmy (1973), a Grammy (1989), two Golden Globes (1973, '86) and an ever-loyal fan base, something Schechter covers in monumental detail in \\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook,\\" in bookstores this month via Citadel Press, with a foreword by Billy Stritch.No stone is left unturned in looking at the career of Minnelli and, for a refreshing change, no stone is hurled at her, either; here, it's strictly Liza's professional life and accomplishments that the author is emphasizing. And nothing goes unrecorded, be it a TV \\"Match Game\\" appearance on NBC in 1967, a 1987 concert in Stockholm, Sweden, or, this year, singing \\"Oscar\\" and \\"God Bless the Child\\" at a private party at the Ars Nova Theatre in New York. Besides being a dandy reference guide for anyone hunting for a Minnelli fact,\\"Scrapbook\\" also includes plenty of interesting info onMinnelli projects that came close to happening but didn't. She was announced, for instance, in 1975, and again in '77 and '79, to star in the film version of \\"Chicago,\\" playing Velma to Goldie Hawn s Roxie Hart (with, at one point, Allan Carr producing, Frank Sinatra playing the lawyer, NancyWalker as the prison matron and Carol Channing and Ann Miller as competing newspaper reporters); later, in 1992, it was rescheduled but with adifference: Lewis Gilbert was to direct, with Liza switched to the role of Roxie and Goldie as Velma.We all know how that turned out. In 1982, Liza tested for what was to be an \\"Evita\\" directed by Ken Russell; she sang \\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,\\" causing Russell to publicly comment, \\"We had found our Evita\\"; the entire venture, however, was KO'd until it was finally made 14 years later with a different leading lady. Schechter also lists dozens of other projects thatalmost happened (\\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" \\"The Carmen Miranda Story\\") and, carrying out the \\"scrapbook\\" motif, there are miscellaneous color photographs, candids and reproductions of Playbill and album covers and Liza-related ads. One thing comes through loud and clear: The lady may liketo play, but she has also worked.****The NY POST -- \\"PAGE SIX\\" -- Sunday, November 14th, 2004 :HITS THE SPOT :IT'S not all bad news about Liza Minnelli, who was just hit with a lawsuit by her former chauffeur. At the book party for Scott Schechter's \\"Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\" tribute tome, the author announced Minnelli's first theatrical movie since \\"Stepping Out\\" in 1991. Liza will play an offbeat self-help seminar leader who helps Parker Posey on her quest to find her G-spot, in \\"The Oh in Ohio.\\" It co-stars Danny DeVito and Mischa Barton.****The SECOND Review of \\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\" this one by Phill Hall of Boston's EDGE and also to appear in the NY RESIDENT paper in a few weeks :\\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\" by Scott SchechterGrade: A+by Phil HallEDGE Literature CriticMonday Nov 1, 2004Just from the title alone, \\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\" seems predestined to find a place on the coffee table of many gay homes. But forget the stereotypical gay worship of this show biz icon and zoom in on the rich contents. Scott Schechter's extraordinary tribute to Liza with a \\"Z\\" is brilliantly researched, lavishly illustrated and endlessly entertaining. It is impossible to come away from this book without possessing a deeper love and respect for Minnelli.Schechter breaks down Minnelli's career in a neat manner: a decade-by-decade career-based mini-biography (all scandals are removed from print), followed by a chronological appreciation of Minnelli's theater, film, television, recording and concert careers. Schechter uncovers a wealth of long-forgotten facts and photographs which will delight Minnelli's fans: Minnelli dancing on stage with then-unknown Elliott Gould in a touring company of \\"The Fantasticks,\\" her simultaneous Time and Newsweek covers for \\"Cabaret\\" (and you thought Bruce Springsteen was the only entertainer to accomplish that?)The book is also rich with Minnelli trivia, including unlikely appearances such as a concert for the inmates of a Chicago jail (two months after she won the \\"Cabaret\\" Oscar). There is also an unexpectedly large amount of little-known data on projects which Minnelli either turned down (including the role of Daisy in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" opposite Robert Redford) or which fell apart before production began (including the film version of \\"Evita\\" under Ken Russell's direction).Schechter is uncommonly generous to Minnelli, to the point of presenting the most glamorous and flattering photographs available; later-life tabloid photographs which show Minnelli's problems with weight control are conspicuously absent. Yes, \\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\" is a love letter to the great star. And honestly, what's wrong with a love letter to someone who truly earned the love of her fans?Citadel Press, $21.95, 228 pages****The FIRST REVIEW for \\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\"LIZ SMITH : NY Post -- Friday, November 5th, 2004\\"DEDICATED TO Liza Minnelli's artistry.\\" That's what it says on page one of Scott Schechter's \\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\\" (Citadel Press). This is a glossy valentine to the great star, concentrating on her long, award-laden stage, screen and recording career. The sensation of her \\"private\\" life is not emphasized. Tons of previously unseen photos and plenty of Minnelli minutiae. (Her first reviews, even as an awkward teen, are a thrill to read; she had style from the start!)

Another Amazon reviewer has complained that The Sisters Mortland is too much like the work of Thomas Hardy. That is not an unfair comment.

The characters' stories reveal aspects and layers to what, at the surface, seems a simple tale. Deeply moving and emotional, this is novel will linger in the reader's mind as an all-too-human reality. It is a reflection of life's complexities as seen through very different eyes.Sally Beauman brings formidable insight into the human condition to her work, and it shows.

It features abundant suspense but is ultimately about the characters.I must respectfully disagree with those who found none of them likable. It's true that most of them are deeply flawed--variously selfish, frustrating, at times even despicable. Most, however, ultimately redeem themselves in some way when they reveal their truest colors. And above all, in my opinion, they are vindicated by their love for Maisie.Maisie, the youngest sister, is the novel's lodestar--and an amazing literary achievement. It was a stroke of brilliance to start the story from her first-person viewpoint, because we learn to value just how remarkable she is on our own, before being influenced by the other characters' estimations of her.I'd probably give \\"The Sisters Mortland\\" four-and-a-half stars if that were an option; the book's not perfect.

Early on, I almost put it down and moved on to something else. I'm glad I stuck with it. In the early pages I thought the author had her tenses confused, but then I realized it was a matter of technique. At one point I was irritated with the publisher because a little white space could have made the beginning go much more smoothly.I think the most impressive thing about the book is the author. She is a fine, fine writer and she has made me a better reader. Her prose is excellent; her grasp of language sent me to the dictionary several times. But the thing that impressed me most was what she didn't tell me, what she made me figure out for myself. I don't want to include \\"spoilers\\" here, but at one point we learned something about one of the character's past acts, and I thought to myself, \\"What's going on here? The writer didn't tell me that.\\" Well, actually, she did tell me; I just wasn't listening. She had set up that character so well and had set up situations so well that I should have known what he was doing.

Told in several different narratives, you learn the story of Julia, Finn, and Maisie, three sisters who are living at an old convent with their mother and grandfather. You also meet a large supporting cast, which includes Dan, Nick, and Lucus, who will center around the rest of the book.The Sisters Morland opens with Masie as the narrator. We learn a bit about her life at Wyken Abby and one by one she introduces us to the supporting cast and she takes us up to the point of when the accident occurred. We then move forward by twenty years and Dan takes up the narrative and we then slowly learn more secrets that could have possibly led up to what happened at the end of the summer of 1967. The story ends with Julia tying up some of the loose ends and bringing the story together.The Sisters Morland is a clever story that twists, weaves and slowly lets the reading in n the big secrets that have been buried for 20 years."},{"Title":"The Sisters Mortland","review":"Sally Beauman, author of The Sisters Mortland, weaves a fascinating and haunting story of love, secrets and grief mixed with a high level of intrigue. Her prose is taut with information carefully doled out throughout the story.It is 1967 in Suffolk, England where we meet the sisters Mortland. Julie is beautiful, Finn is the intellectual, and 13 year-old Maisie is odd. They live with their mother Stella and grandfather in a crumbling medieval abbey where the nuns of an early era haunt the strange Maisie.Lucas, a young artist in residence, is commissioned to paint the sisters. Along with Daniel (a local man with gypsy blood) who is a friend of the sisters, and Nick Marlow, a medical student, they all spend a tumultuous summer embroiled in life and love with Maisie as the observer and narrator in the first part of the book.Lucas' painting captures the essence of the sisters and is completed right before a horrific tragedy occurs at the abbey. Some twenty years later, that painting has become famous and is shown at a retrospective. As Daniel narrates this portion of the book, we see his deterioration as a result of his obsession with the people and the events of that 1967 summer.Following other catastrophic events that impact the novel's characters, Julie becomes the third narrator and fills in the missing pieces to this unsettling story.Beauman's The Sisters Mortland, is a beautifully written, powerful and deeply moving story of an impoverished English family and the people whose lives are intermingled with theirs. The reader will be torn between the desire to read quickly in order to learn how it all ends--and to read each sentences slowly in order to savor the words.Armchair Interviews says: The Sisters Morland is breathtaking and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sisters Mortland","review":"In THE SISTERS MORTLAND, Sally Beauman has created a captivating novel of emotional suspense. It centers around the tragic and mysterious events which take place at crumbling Ely Abbey, the childhood home of the three Mortland sisters and the favorite holiday spot of the men who inhabit the small orbit of their lives. While this description may sound gothic and romance, THE SISTERS MORTLAND is essentially a well-crafted literary mystery reminiscent of Kate Atkinson's CASE HISTORIES. The novel's heart is the summer of 1967, but it continues to follow the lives of the Abbey's summer residents for several decades. The sisters themselves are fascinating, modern girls, known for their beauty and intellect as well as their familial strangeness. Independent Julia, the eldest, has just returned from a year's graduate study at Berkley bringing with her remnants of the American summer of love. Bright, bookish Finn, the middle sister, is on holiday from Cambridge where she is nearly inseparable from Dan (the Roma neighbor boy), Lucas (the starving artist) and Nick (a neighbor and soon-to-be doctor). And finally there is Maisie, the brilliant thirteen-year-old who is variously described as \\"abnormal\\", \\"strange\\" and \\"special\\", but is endlessly endearing to the reader as she is to the other characters. If the tragic summer of 1967 is the heart of the book, the soul is the painting that becomes Lucas' masterpiece: a portrait of the sisters Mortland that eerily captures the mysterious beauty and pain of the Mortland family.Ms. Beauman has fashioned a superbly shaped novel with superior structure and well-paced suspense. She masterfully feeds the reader just enough detail to keep create tension and leave one wanting to read further. The novel is divided into three sections with different characters serving as the first-person narrator. Interspersed between the chapters are clever bits of faux-historical passages from letters, histories and guidebooks about the Abbey. One of her most brilliant conceits is to allow Maisie to speak first, thus giving her an amazing resonance and believability. Through the eyes of other characters we learn that Maisie is possibly autistic but (as in Mark Haddon's THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT) her voice is so warm and authentic that we cannot help believing in her. Maisie composes exhaustive lists of things that interest her and she lives amongst the ghosts of the nuns who once inhabited the Abbey, but she is also keenly observant and possesses a deadly accurate view the lives of those around her. Later in the novel we hear the voices of Dan and finally Julia, each character becoming more startlingly endearing as they speak.Beauman skillfully reveals the tragic secrets of the Mortland family. Her style is subtle and the reader must look for tiny clues along the way. In fact, and this is not truly a spoiler, not everything is fully revealed and, to a degree, some things are left to the reader's imagination. While some may find this frustrating, I found it refreshing for an author to assume so much intelligence on the part of the reader. In short, it was a fascinating and compelling novel that kept me awake at night in order to finish. If you enjoyed CASE HISTORIES or even Miranda Beverly-Whittemore's THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT, this book will have great appeal."},{"Title":"The Sisters Mortland","review":"In 1967 in Suffolk, England, the three Mortland sisters and their mom Stella move into a medieval abbey following the loss of the family patriarch. Though in their twenties Julia and Finn have somewhat moved on, but Stella and thirteen year-old Maisie still grieve. Stella hires local artist Lucas Feld to paint a portrait of her daughters. Meanwhile for Julia and Finn, it begins as a summer of love with the middle daughter seemingly sharing trysts with Lucas, childhood friend Daniel Nunn or perhaps pre-med student Nick Marlow while Julia considers running off to London. However, the summer turns bitter when tragedy occurs.By 1991, Lucas is a renowned famous artist whose highly regarded painting The Sisters Mortland will be the center of a retrospective showing of his works. Daniel never recovered from the tragedy of what started as his greatest summer, but ended as his hauntingly worst as he fixated on the three sisters and the tragedy that shaped all their lives.THE MORTLAND SISTERS is a fabulous character study that grips the audience who want to know what happened to destroy the idyllic summer of 67. The perspectives cleverly shift with the changing eras. Maisie providing her viewpoint of the goings on in 1967; Daniel takes over in 1991 with his point of view of the \\"present\\" and what he recalls from the most wonderful and most devastating summer of his life; finally Julia brings closure to the drama. Each of the key players seems different and reacts accordingly to the events that Sally Beaumont lays out throughout the gripping story line. Readers will cherish this powerful character driven tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Sisters Mortland","review":"Eerie, affecting and absorbing, the story of The Sisters Mortland begins in 1967. The setting is Wyken Abbey, which was built in 1257 and is situated in Wykenfield, Suffolk The Abbey is the home of the three Mortland sisters and the ancient and crumbling mediaeval convent is the perfect setting for this intriguing story.Maisie, the youngest sister, is the first to be introduced to readers. She is extremely bright, talks to and sees the long dead nuns who at one time populated the Abbey. Her two older sisters, Julia and Finn, are gifted, beautiful and protective of their \\"different\\" younger sister.A neighbor, Nicholas, studies to become a doctor and marries one sister, but loves another. Daniel Nunn is a dark, handsome man with the blood of a Gypsy who befriends the Mortland sisters, Maisie in particular. Finally there is Lucas, a brilliantly talented artist who is painting a portrait of the three sisters. The portrait will one day make him famous.During a summer at the Abbey, unexpected tragedy strikes the Mortlands and changes the lives of all who are involved with the family. The character's lives are intertwined, tangled and filled with misfortune and regrets forever.You never know what twists and turns this haunting story will take and that makes it almost impossible to put this book down once you start reading it.Author Sally Beauman is a former journalist in America and Britain and is the author of six previous novels.&lt;"},{"Title":"The Sisters Mortland","review":"My book club read The Sisters Mortland and we failed to find a single character we liked.The book is well-crafted but the story is primarily about mean-spirited individuals or people who are self-focused. The author never made a good case to prove Maisie was a challenged child. In the beginning she seemed the most sane of the lot. Then all at once she was the sister who needed never to be left alone. It is not credible to switch gears so quickly. The one person who has the sole possiblity to be a good guy, Julia's long-suffering spouse, turns out to be one of the major catalysts for the sisters' disasters. I am not sure I will be cruising Amazon for Beauman's next book."},{"Title":"The Sisters Mortland","review":"The Mortland girls --- beautiful mean Julia, aloof Finn, and young \\"different\\" Maisie --- come with their mother, Stella, to live in their grandfather's home, a huge and ancient ruin of an abbey. Maisie instantly befriends the ghostly nuns who haunt the place and busies herself with the writing of many lists.In the summer of 1967, family friends Dan, Nick and Lucas arrive for a visit. Lucas is painting the girls' portraits. When he works on Maisie, she entertains him with tales of the family's past. However, when Maisie tells of having her fortune told years ago, he scoffs and so she doesn't tell him what she saw in the fortune teller's crystal ball.As the family begins to prepare to travel to Gramps's childhood home for their annual visit, their place is enveloped in a brooding sense of impending doom. Maisie (who wanders at night) spies Finn returning home very early in the morning, naked under her dress. Maisie worries that Dan's heart will be broken if Finn has been with Lucas, as she suspects.Before the family leaves on their trip, Stella and her father work on their plan to ask Gramps's wealthy brother for a loan to repair the crumbling Abbey. Maisie slips away, spying Lucas furtively leaving for Cambridge on Julia's bike. Did he steal it? Maisie then overhears a passionate argument between Dan and Finn, followed by an equally passionate embrace. The house is filled with fear, distrust and despair. Maisie doesn't know what is wrong with her family but decides she must take action to help them.As usual Gramps's brother rebuffs the family's request for a loan. However, Maisie acquires money through surprising means. During this transaction she learns that her family fears she'll turn out like her deceased father. What on earth does that mean?The story picks up again in 1989 and becomes Dan's tale rather than Maisie's. The sense of impending doom turns to suspenseful mystery as Dan reflects back on a tragedy that occurred during the summer of 1967 involving the Mortland family. Lucas is now a celebrated artist planning to show his 1967 portrait, The Sisters Mortland, at a retrospective. Dan is horrified at the thought of stirring up the family tragedy and sorrow.Dan's life is also something of a tragedy. His job as a producer of commercials ends, his father dies, and he lives in a drug-blurred depression (yet he is an entertaining, likable narrator). His life's central mystery is the tragic puzzle of the Mortland event that occurred during that long past summer. Where did it all go wrong? Why did it happen? How did he lose the love of his life? Dan gazes upon Lucas's famous portrait of the sisters and, fueled by the stew of many drugs in his system, finds clues.This book is a riveting and realistic blend of suspense, romance, tragedy, and meditation on Britain's social classes. The reader glimpses bits of the true story, as if wandering the Abbey's labyrinth or peeking into the \\"Squint,\\" a kind of secret periscope within the building. Piece by piece, the puzzle is assembled from the perspective of different characters. The author has an incredible talent for suspense, withholding information until the perfect time to dole out an intriguing snippet. Indeed, the story is almost excruciatingly enthralling and impossible to put down. A perfect ending is rare, but Sally Beauman has achieved it in THE SISTERS MORTLAND with a satisfying but not pat wrap-up.

On a second thought, even a third title, in Australia perhaps, would not save this full of plot and airs and rather insignificant and somewhat freakish novel from the oblivion it deserves. Plenty of characters, at least three sisters, some handsome abusive and abused guys, and lots of English countryside mist- all crash into a whole lot of nothing. The three sisters might be as beautiful as they are being described, but it does not turn them into attractive reading material. The men who paint them and fall for them drink and love and hate and suffer as cartoon heroes do.

Even those who have read Sanders, Longenecker or Dunn on the subject will not be dissappointed in the &quot;Preface to the Study of Paul&quot;. There is something about Westerholm's ability to take profound concepts and express them simply that makes him an excellent author and teacher. This book is a must buy."},{"Title":"Preface to the Study of Paul","review":"What Ever Happens to Herbert?Preface to the Study of Paul by Stephen Westerholm is a very unique book. It is short, easy to read. Yet it takes an in depth look at Paul the Apostle, his times, his world view, and how Moderns or Post-Moderns can relate to or apply Paul. I will be looking at this in relation to a few specific area's, firstly Herbert whom we are introduced to in the introduction, secondly \\"Bent nature\\" of minds and it as a definition of \\"Sin Nature\\". Finally, I will then look at the inconsistencies in the work. Does Westerholm open up Paul to the uninitiated?In the introduction we are introduced to Herbert, \\"But one can well imagine an outsider - a Herbert, if you will-wanting to pose what seems an obvious question: 'Why Paul?'\\" (Page ix) Westerholm goes on to introduce Herbert's doubts, and Herbert will go his own way, unless he is drawn in by the Pauline Industry. Interesting there is a reference to \\"Herbert\\" in a Star Trek episode called \\"The way to Eden\\" that aired February 21st 1969, In the episode there are a group of space hippies who are searching for Enlightenment, for the planet Eden, which in their Mythology is the source of all life. To them a \\"Herbert\\" is any one who is an outsider, unenlightened, authoritarian, or oppressive. In sum, anyone who does not understand the way. In Both, \\"Herbert\\" just doesn't get it.So the \\"Herbert\\" in out introduction is someone who doesn't understand Paul, or Paul's significance to Western Thought. So this book sets out to Give \\"Herbert\\" all he needs to make up His own mind about Paul. I believe in the first half of the book that the opening up of Paul to \\"Herbert\\" is well accomplished. Paul's view of himself is explained in the book. The world at that time. As well as situational applications of Paul today are well presented.However from chapter 7 on the focus is on Paul's teaching. We lose \\"Herbert\\" here because we lose the situational examples of \\"Jack and Jill\\" p.11, \\"Bill and Barb\\" p. 23-25, and the \\"Modern Parables\\" and \\"abc, Ashely, Brandon, and Crystal\\" Examples on p. 41 and 51. These examples opened up \\"Herberts\\" (and our eyes) to Paul's intentions and directions. However \\"Herbert\\" appears to get lost in the fury of activity in getting to the end of the book of Romans.We will now look at a term Westerholm uses for the \\"Sin Nature\\". Bent used on pages 75, 104 and else where. \\"Apart from a divine transformation, humanity's bent forsin is incorrigible\\" p.74 \\"Paul never attributes humanity's bent towards sin todivine action.\\" p.104 This is similar to C.S. Lewis' description of fallen non-Christian men in \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" as seen on p.77 \\"No, he had come with two others of his kind-bad-men ('bent' men was the nearest hrossian equivalent) who tried to kill him, but he had run away from them.\\" and again on p. 91\\"Bent hnau (men) of his own kind from Thulcandra (Earth) are following him, he should go to Oyarsa. If they find him anywhere else there will be evil.\\". C.S. Lewis continues this though throughout this book and \\"Perelandra\\" it's sequel, on p. 188 \\"Where he gave up his will and reason to the BentEldil (Angel)\\". In my extensive reading of Christian literature, I have only come across the term \\"Bentness\\" in Lewis and Westerholm. It fascinates me and also is a very good illustration of what sin is or of its effects. It communicates very clearly Paul's view of sin and how it affects our world and us. It is powerful and convicting. Westerholm does a good job of presenting Paul, his worldview and he breaks Romans down into digestible pieces. He gives a clear perspective on who Paul though he was and what his \\"Call\\" or \\"mission\\" in life was. He explains Paul's writings in terms of their relation to the Law, to Paul's thought, to the Greek world and even in sections to the modern world. These comparisons or contrasts between different views on subjects like goodness, faith, freedom, evil and sin, causes the reader to think, to reflect, and hopefully to act, change and grow. There are however faults with the book. Foremost is the lack of consistency of style. For the beginning part of the book, he uses examples or \\"Modern Parables\\" as he calls them to stress points. On pages 10-11, he stresses differing views of relationships that are in the process of development in the case of \\"Bob and Barb\\". Again in pages 23-25 he stresses character flaws, \\"sin nature\\" or \\"bent people\\" through examples of \\"Brandon, Ashley and Crystal\\". Then on page 41 he gives examples of real and false guilt through similar examples. And finally on page 51 -- Back on the topic of relationships-- This time, on the awakening of love and faith. The parable style is well written and works well.But then it the next 6 chapters, half of the book, we never again have these examples that draw us into the discussion, and the author shifts his style. That makes the reader make decisions either in support of or in opposition to the teachings of Paul presented, and that which Westerholm is explaining.This lack of consistency is confusing to the reader, who wants to get back to Herbert or to the examples which they can relate to. It seems as if the first 6 chapters were written for Herbert and to enlighten him, and as though the last 6 were written for a bible study group or theology class. This change of approach, lack of consistency, and methodology causes a break in the book and I believe a failure in it's purpose of opening up Herbert toPaul's though world.There are other inconsistencies as well. Chapter 12, on living the good life is a good summary of Paul's purpose, especially his letter to the Romans. However it is not a conclusion to the book. There is no wrap up, tying together of the Romans complete view, or of Westerholms own purpose in the introduction. It fails to reach the conclusion. The thesis is clearly stated: \\"The issue remains why. What (as Herbert himself would put it) is 'so big about Paul'? What have people seen in Him? Why did he make such an impact? Fair questions, all. To satisfy Herbert, we must dig a little deeper.\\" p.x Though this starts out well, it fails to fulfill this goal. Herbert gets lost along the way and what starts off as \\"Paul for the Layman\\" ends us a theological discourse.This book is facile to read. It is challenging of one's worldview and principles. For the Christian, or Theology or Religious studies student this book is a fun, quick read that can be revisited like an old friend to freshen up on the complexities of Paul and his world. For the non-initiated, however the book looses steam and probably interest and the end of the 6th chapter. Herbert who is mentioned by name 13 times and over 25 times including pronouns in the introduction; is lost and Westerholm never returns to him.Unless of course is Westerholm view's all of the readers as \\"Herberts\\" in relation to Paul and Westerholm intends that by the end we are Non-Herberts. Therefore, Herbert is missing from the end. I believe that is the examples, \\"Modern Parables\\" were spread through the last 6 chapters and a 13th chapter returning to Herbert were added this book would be complete and achieve it's objectives."},{"Title":"Preface to the Study of Paul","review":"Westerholm's introduction to Pauline thought succeeds at providing the reader with both the importance for studying Paul and an overview of Paul's beliefs, which come from his &quot;Jewish-Christian horizon&quot; and his personal encounter with Christ. Paul's letter to the Romans is Westerholm's primary reference for delving into Paul's mind. The author begins the &quot;preface&quot; with Paul's view of his calling to show that Paul must be interpreted in his own horizon. Westerholm continues by explaining Old Testament ideas that Paul assumes and uses in Romans i.e. righteousness, sin, moral law, atonement, faith, and the will. Many illustrations that the modern/postmodern person will identify with are used to show the relevance of these ideas. As the book progresses the author seems to believe that he has proved Paul's relevance because the illustrations disappear and Paul's own use of the Old Testament ideas is greatly emphasized. Westerholm's style is so effective that by the end of the book he has taken the reader from ignorance about Paul to the very heart of difficult issues in Pauline theology such as Paul's view of the law, election, and ethics, which he presents with a neo-Lutheran slant. This introduction to Pauline thought is a remarkable achievement that can benefit anyone from the novice to the scholar."},{"Title":"Preface to the Study of Paul","review":"Pauline scholar Stephen Westerholm, author of the spectacular Perspectives Old and New on Paul, has also written this great little introduction to the study of Paul. Organized as a conceptual tour of Romans, Westerholm seeks to acquaint his readers with Paul's worldview. He contends that coming to terms with Paul means first grasping his \\"particular vision of reality,\\" his worldview, which is then more fully developed and nuanced as one investigates deeper into Paul's \\"theology.\\"And this well-written little book accomplishes its aims admirably, and then some, I would say. Westerholm succeeds in contrasting modern assumptions about \\"the nature and terms of human existence\\" (1) with those views that underpin and are played out in Paul's writings. Topics such as law, freedom, and the nature of the cosmos are helpfully discussed to bring out common modern assumptions and illuminate Paul's own perspective.This book truly is an introduction, in the best sense, and would prove a very good place to start a study on Paul and his thought. It also carries out the task of a good introduction in giving a remarkably concise and readable overview of the important contours of Paul's theology. Especially illuminating are the discussion of the interplay of sin, the Mosaic law, and Israel and the new situation brought about by Christ.His chapter on Romans 9-11 is easily worth the price of the book, and the four-page discussion, \\"The Role of God in History,\\" is easily one of the best summaries and statements I have ever read on God's knowledge, providence, election, and interaction with humanity. He defends a traditional view of God's foreknowledge, the necessity of election and God's capacity to \\"harden,\\" while also maintaining that God certainly does not predetermine all human activities and choices, and furthermore that there is no divine role in the origin of sin. He also asserts that while some have drawn the further implication of a double predestination of some to salvation and some to damnation, Westerhom asserts that such an conclusion need not be drawn, and that in fact Paul often warns that those who are \\"called\\" may prove faithless and be lost and that the \\"call\\" can be resisted."},{"Title":"Ocho Mundos: Themes for Reading Skills and Cultural Awareness","review":"Ocho Mundos (&quot;Eight Worlds&quot;) is a textbook useful as a companion to any intermediate Spanish course (formal or home study).

The author of this fascinating book packs so much information into the well-illustrated story that 'Guernica' reads like a novel yet informs like a treatise. Initially painted by Picasso in 1937 in response to Franco's Nazi-assisted 'training lab' annihilation of the city of Gernika in the Basque region of Spain. 'Guernica\\" has become a symbol of the atrocity of war, the capability of man's inhumanity to man, and the global fear of self-destruction if we are not more in guardianship of the forces of war machines that continue to grind down the surface of this planet.van Hensbergen writes so well that the amount of information contained in this readable tome never overwhelms: it is just there as backup for every statement he makes. He firmly believes that 'Guernica' is the most important painting of the 20th Century, not only because of its critical breakthrough in the art world of the changes in representation (the Cubist movement), nor because of the rally against totalitarian force wherever it occurs (including the My-Lai atrocity with which the US bruised mankind in the Vietnam conflict, etc), but also because of the profound impact this painting had upon entering the USA, in easy access to the artists who responded to its power by developing the first truly original American art movement - Abstract Expressionism.It is often said that the artist is the ultimate philosopher. Nowhere is this better stated than in this absorbing book about the power of a single painting on the course of history in the 2oth Century. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, February 2005"},{"Title":"Guernica","review":"\\"No, painting is not done to decorate apartments. It's an instrument of war for attack and defense against the enemy.\\" So said Pablo Picasso, as World War II was ending. He must have reflected at the time that even the most famous painting-as-weapon had not really made a difference in a previous war or the current one. Still, his _Guernica_ had made an impression, and it still does. When war against Iraq was being considered, the United Nations's huge tapestry reproduction of the painting (originally made for Nelson Rockefeller, and donated by him to the UN) was covered up. A plain blue background was needed for the broadcasters in the building, said a UN spokesman; you won't be able to pull a cover on the upcoming carnage in Iraq, said an Australian delegate. In _Guernica: The Biography of a Twentieth-Century Icon_ (Bloomsbury) Gijs van Hensbergen has given a readable summary of both the art and the politics of the painting, from the history of the Spanish Civil War and the heinous bombing that it depicts to its eventual return to the Spanish republic. There is thus plenty of twentieth century history here, and art theory, and biography of the most influential painter of the century. It is all wonderfully well integrated and fascinating.In 1937, Picasso was in Paris when he heard of the atrocity of the firebombing of Gernika (Basque spelling), far behind the lines and without military connections, arranged by Franco and carried out by the Nazis as an initial experiment in what we have come to know as \\"total war.\\" He had procrastinated on a commission for the Paris Expo, but in a frenzy of inspiration, he drew his first sketches and five weeks later had completed the painting. After the Expo, the painting began its extensive travels, with the aim of giving support to the anti-fascists in Spain. Picasso refused to let it go anywhere in Spain until \\"a genuine Spanish republic had been restored.\\" Picasso was satisfied with _Guernica_ settling in New York: \\"By means of _Guernica_ I have the pleasure of making a political statement every day in the middle of New York.\\" But as a communist, his work was suspect, and the references to Franco and the Spanish Civil War were dropped from the label at the Museum of Modern Art. J. Edgar Hoover asked specifically that the US Embassy in Paris send any info on Picasso, even though the FBI had no business trying to get dirt on foreigners. The file on Picasso included asinine whoppers such as the accusation that he was a Russian spy. A congressman from Michigan state seems to have assumed a Rush Limbaugh-like role as radio commentator, railing against Picasso as \\"the hero of all the crackpots in so-called modern art\\" and that \\"critics who support modern art should be attended to.\\"Picasso died in 1973, and Franco in 1975. Franco had been increasingly ill and distant from actual power, and Picasso's work had gradually been allowed to be shown within Spain. Poster reproductions of _Guernica_ were popular. Picasso had not lost his bite, and gallery owners had to worry about vandalism, some of the worries proving to be entirely justified. The final section of the book deals with the difficult and labyrinthine negotiations to bring the painting back to the home it had never known. Politicians, lawyers, Basques, city boosters, and heirs all had to have their say, but eventually under extreme security, the massive canvass made a triumphal entry into Madrid in 1981, originally installed in a huge, guarded box of bullet-proof glass. One commentator observed, \\"Today the last exile has returned to Spain.\\" That is the sort of tribute and the degree of importance attributed to _Guernica_ repeatedly through the book. Its detractors, frequently quoted here, may be many, and its influence in actually stopping war may be nil. It will forever haunt us, though, like a conscience that insists that someday war ought to be no more."},{"Title":"Guernica","review":"Van Hensbergen's Guernica is a must-read masterpiece that covers art, history,passion and politics in equal measure. From war time France, through Franco's Spain,and on through the trials of McCarthyism to Guernica's eventual repatriation the writer doesn't miss a beat.

In much of the first part of the book, Disreali introduces the main characters and the political and social background against which the action in the later parts of the book will be played. In this book Disraeli covers several topics. He explains the state of parliamentary politics of the day and the changing social and political situations of the nobility and the rising manufacturing class. As the title character, Coningsby, develops his political philosophy, Disraeli gives an insight into his own core political beliefs. Through Sidonia, one of his main characters, Disreali makes a pitch for the rights of Jews, a group to which Disraeli is linked by consangunity, though not be religion. To make it all entertaining, Disraeli takes Coningsby and his lover through a long and chaste romantic quest, in which they finally overcome the obstacles placed in their way by their families. The book, ultimately, provides a triumph of love over hatred and pettiness.The strong points of this book are its pleasant story line and the ability to tell a romantic and political tale without including the moral failings, without which so many modern authors seem incapable of expressing themselves. The weak points are found in its age and storybook ending. The repeated references to so many details of political life of his day and the simililarities of characters to prominent people, which may have been amusing to the readers of his day, are lost on most contemporary readers. The ending, in which all the injustices inflicted on Coningsby by petty people around him are reversed through acts of self-sacrifice which set the world right, introduces a sense of fantasy which makes the book seem just a bit too much to believe. Overall this book is a worthwhile read"},{"Title":"Coningsby or, The New Generation","review":"I normally don't care for fiction,but this book is an exception.It may be fiction,but it is based on fact and real people.This book offers a view of the politics of Disraeli's time and where political power really exists.Well written and recommended book!One caveat:I have the Penguin Classic paperback and I don't recommend this edition as the print is very small.Thomas Braun edited it with notes for each chapter.It would have been great if not for the print."},{"Title":"Coningsby or, The New Generation","review":"This book caused a stir in its day if only because some famous political figures were actually very thinly disguised in the novel. It also was a book that clearly stated to the English aristocracy that if England was to be saved from imminent obscurity, the aristocracy had to change their ways.

I am reading this as it was listed in the book, \\" The Creature from Jekyl Island \\" as one of those read by the author. It is not hard to read and is really six books making up a set. It is interesting and intriguing and slower paced than todays books yet, has a good plot and story."},{"Title":"Coningsby or, The New Generation","review":"I read the novel \\"Coningsby, or the New Generation\\" (1844) because of the often-quoted line, \\"...the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\\" That quote is seen by some folks as confirming that Jews run the world. In context, that is exactly what was asserted.The author of \\"Coningsby\\" is Benjamin Disraeli, twice prime minister of England, and a Jew (though supposedly Christianized). Was Disraeli was actually revealing inside knowledge about the domination of the Jews? It could be argued that this was merely poetic license because he was not prime minister until decades after this book was published.In \\"Coningsby,\\" the character Sidonia is obviously intended to be a member of a \\"fictional\\" Rothschild family. (Disraeli was a pal of Lionel Rothschild.)This novel is reputed to be Disraeli's best. The author teaches us to distinguish between facts and phrases, realities and phantoms. This is a docu-drama, with real historical characters used as background for Disraeli's fictional characters.Some reviewers, more knowledgeable about English than History, have suggested that the political commentary is dated and not applicable to our times. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather than champion the cause of a particular party, Disraeli lampooned all politicians. Disraeli saw the liberals as destructive, and the conservatives as ineffective because of their abandonment of principles and their adherence to expedience. Disraeli's Tory conservatives took the brunt of his incisive and often humorous jabs.This book prods the reader to ponder many aspects of democracy, such as: who should vote, the theory of representative government, the role of political parties, the role of the press, the proper ties between State and Church, and the nature of the aristocracy. The book is educational, and even bestows a bit of wisdom upon the reader.The only negative attached to this book is its presentation of some distorted notions about Jewish history and the role of Jews in early Christianity. Also, Disraeli presents the Jewish tycoon Sidonia as the richest, smartest, wisest, man on the planet...a skilled public speaker, multilingual, possessing an athletic frame, irresistible to women, and a great horseman besides. It is a bit overdone."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (1952) makes good reading, but it is likely to be more appreciated by readers already familiar with the philosophical underpinnings of quantum theory. The scholarly introduction by F. S. C. Northrop of Yale University cautions the reader that a meticulous reading is necessary to follow Werner Heisenberg's discussion of causality, determinism, and complementarity.For the reader new to Heisenberg I suggest first reading a collection of essays published by Seabury Press in 1983 under the title Tradition in Science. In 1989 this collection, now titled Encounters with Einstein And Other Essays on People, Places, and Particles, was republished by Princeton University Press. A few discussions are a bit technical, but they do not involve mathematics. These essays were written between 1972-1975. Heisenberg died in 1976.Another good choice is Philosophical Problems of Quantum Physics, a collection of Heisenberg's early lectures that span the turbulent period 1932-1948. Many of the key ideas discussed in his 1952 book Physics and Philosophy will be found in this earlier work.Heisenberg believed that early Greek philosophy is closer to the ideas underlying modern physics than it was to the deterministic, objective reality defined by Newton. The story of the development of quantum theory is always fascinating, but even more so when told from the viewpoint of a major contributor to this great intellectual triumph. Bohr, Heisenberg, and other founders of the Copenhagen interpretation recognized quite early that quantum theory would have a the profound impact on man's understanding of reality.All three of these works, Physics and Philosophy, Philosophical Problems of Quantum Physics, and Encounters with Einstein, should appeal to a wide audience. Heisenberg was deeply intrigued with the philosophical implications of quantum physics (and modern particle physics) and enjoyed sharing his enthusiasm and fascination with general audiences. I highly recommend all three works."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Qualitative, descriptive books on physics, I think, are often unsatisfying because nothing suffices like actually doing the math to appreciate the full impact and enjoyement of what physics has to offer. Yet this hasn't prevented the likes of Einstein, Hawking, Feynman, et al, from attempting to do so. Perhaps for the professional physicist such works are interesting by virtue of their historical content, but the lay reader will likely find such works wordy and boring. This book by Heisenberg transcends this milieu however, with the author's shear brilliance and eloquence an admirable spectacle in and of itself. Heisenberg is a terribly smart fellow and that comes through thoughtfully.This book reads like a collection of essays and, perforce, some chapters could probably be left unread without great harm. Chapter 7, 'the theory of relativity,' being a case in point. No, the real beauty of this book is not in its trenchant reflections on the mechanical behavior of matter, but more on its correlation with physics as a human endeavor, and the evolution of human thought in philosophical terms, as well as language and how it expresses ideas; these themes, philosphy and language, are artfully crafted and make this book significant, not the fact that we can make atom bombs or postulate a universe.Heisenberg emphasizes the Copenhagen interpretation, which states that the observer effects the outcome of an experiment by the very act of having observed the experiment. This is of course true primarily in terms of atomic physics and not of macro events. For example, if you try to observe an electron you will have to use high energy equipment to do so, which will effect the behavior of the electron. On the other hand, if you observe a sparrow at 100 yards with a pair of binoculars you're not really going to effect the sparrow. By observing it with binoculars you won't break its neck, which is the equivalent of what happens when you observe an electron with x-rays. The idea however, that the observer, or participant, does inject a huge influence by simply participating is significant on a macro scale in linguistic terms; a notion Heisenberg effectively sets out in chapter 10, 'language and reality in modern physics.'The varying contexts and extensive meanings of concepts and language can and do effect the outcomes of human interactions in myriads of unpredictable ways. Perhaps at a time in humanity's past we could consider language as a logical system where a person either knew what they were talking about or didn't, or was lying or telling the truth based on what they said; a no BS kind of world where wise men judged the testimony of others in courts of reason, much like what occured in witchcraft trials, or in the way the Catholic church judged Galileo for teaching Copernican ideology. We know better now days, and this is, I believe, why Heisenberg makes such a point of the Copenhagen interpretation; not to show that it applies to macro physics, but rather to show how it applies to language and psychology. It's a tough analogy but Heisenberg makes a remarkable effort that engenders contemplation and awe. After all, we still have wise men judging the testimony of others in courts of reason, a sobering thought. This stress on linguistics may seem insignificant today but was probably more germane to the time this book was written, in 1958.If you like physics, philosophy, and psychology, not necessarily in that order, you'll probably like this book. Chapters 4 and 5 alone, the two chapters that track the birth of quantum physics philosophically, make the price of this book a worthwhile investment."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Heisenberg, the man who removed absolute destiny from science and replaced it with chance, eloquently attempts to unify the philosophies of Kant, Descartes, and Einstein with science in regards to the recent developments of Quantum Theory. From a historical and internal perspective, Heisenberg speaks directly to the the reader without the intellectual ego that often accompanies a man of his renowned stature."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"This book is important because Heisenberg clearly explains why quantum mechanics was fatal for great philosophical theories, and more particularly, for logical positivism and Kant.Logical positivism affirms that all knowledge is ultimately founded in experience. This led to a postulate concerning the logical clarification of any statement about nature. But since quantum theory such a postulate cannot be fulfilled.Kant's a priori's like space and time are viewed totally differently since quantum theory. His law of causality is no longer true for the elementary particles, because we don't know the foregoing event accurately or this event cannot be found.Heisenberg states that it will never be possible by pure reason to arrive at some absolute truth.Naturally this book is not up to date. It doesn't speak about COBE or superstrings. But Heisenbergs explanation of quantum theory is second to none.Quotable. After someone said that the quantum theory may be proved false, Bohr answered: 'We may hope that it will later turn out that sometimes 2 x 2 = 5, for this would be of great advantage for our finances'.A great book."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"This little book is highly recommended to anyone interested in the philosophical implications of the new paradigms of physics of the twentieth century, ...relativity and quantum theory. It is especially fascinating to hear first hand from, Werner Heisenberg, having been a key player in the development of quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.Heisenberg, very nicely, presents a history of the development of physics, and philosophy as it relates to epistemology, in order to contrast such ideas with the strange reality of quantum theory.Ancient Philosophy, and especially modern philosophy since Rene Descartes, John Locke, David Hume, George Berkeley, culminating with Immanuel kant, ... has had a close relation with science in the analysis of scientific method indirectly through the study of the philosophy of knowledge, and here Heisenberg presents a wonderful overview.Kant's transcendental deduction, that a-priori cognitive faculties determine the form of experience, and so the conditions of science, is here presented by Heisenberg with his amended argument that such a-priori conditions \\"can have only a limited range of applicability\\", something \\"Kant couldn't have foreseen\\". Heisenberg implies that this is where Kant \\"went wrong\\" in his analysis.While its true that Kant's a-priori synthetic concepts of space, time, and causality, are inapt prior to the wave function collapse of quantum mechanics, and yet science is still able to make predictions about phenomenal reality, ... the fact is, no one 'understands' quantum mechanics apart from these conceptual forms!! That is after all the point of the Copenhagen interpretation, just do the math and never mind (visualize) what's going on in 'reality' in between observations.This is already the essence of Kant's argument, that reality as it is in-itself, noumenal reality, is unknowable in principal, apart from the a-priori conditions of understanding due to the nature of mind. It seems that Heisenberg's reinterpretation of Kant's philosophy is redundant, and unnecessary.In any event, this is a classic book which should be read by anyone interested in the modern physical sciences."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"For reader response contact respectfulempiricist@yahoo.comLike so many great thinkers, Heisenberg attempts to create a unifying philosophy about the sciences. He seeks to correlate human behavior and beliefs with physics. With scientific breakthroughs theories become more abstract and it makes it more difficult to understand. The lectures that form this book explain the events leading to his famous theory, the relevance of Physics to philosophy and the moral imperatives of scientists.Werner Heisenberg, the renowned physicist and 1932 Nobelist, is remembered by most of us as the developer of the Theory of Indeterminacy. Simply put, \\"The more precisely the Position (of a particle) is determined, the less precisely its Momentum is known\\" This Theory was developed in an intensive \\"Think Tank\\" conference that took place in Copenhagen in 1927.He describes of how the abstruse proofs of Physics (as well as other sciences) must be made comprehensible to lay people. The accelerated changes in the sciences are based on the ever increasing new information and discovery. This creates a cognitive dissonance in the public and a common way to deal with that mental rift is reactionary. The results of scientific thinking may contradict some of our common ideas as those ideas become beliefs rather than science. Through folklore or youthful and innocent experimentation or by other means we often come to understand aspects of the world that have no basis in reality. We want to cling to them in the face of sound theory.The book is a complicated effort. Heisenberg wants us to be thinking of the impact of scientific advance on our society and values. His is a liberal perspective. This seems to be routine for the leading physicists who worked in early atomic fission. His presentation is not woven together neatly and the book requires rereads and extensive notes in order to make sense of it. The book also contains several different messages. Another reviewer may read the same book and find different aspects of it to be the kernel of Heisenberg's intent.The fact that it is awkwardly compiled requires intensity on the reader's part. Ultimately it is felt that Heisenberg points are taken, are sincere and that he sought a better future based on scientific breakthrough and design."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Quantum science is without any doubt the greatest breakthrough of science in the 20th century. If you want to know what quantum physics is all about, read this fluently written introduction to quantum physics by one of the founders of the theory himself, Nobel Prize winner Dr. Werner Heisenberg. It is very uncommon that a great scientist is capable to transmit his profound knowledge in such an easy to read book, without a single formula. (For the ones interested in the mathematics behind this theory, he has also written another book : \\"The physical principles of the quantum theory\\"). In the world of today, Aristotle's deeper understanding that philosophy is the mother of science has been forgotten, something that Heisenberg not only recalls, but actively uses as a guiding principle throughout this book.Quantum physics is important, since it produced a revolution within the materialistic perspective of classical physics. At elementary level, there is no longer a sharp distinction between matter and energy. Heisenberg says : \\"The elementary particles are certainly not eternal and indestructible units of matter, they can actually be transformed into each other. As a matter of fact, if two such particles, moving through space with a very high kinetic energy, collide, then many new elementary particles may be created from the available energy and the old particles may have disappeared in the collision. Such events have been frequently observed and offer the best proof that all particles are made of the same substance : energy.\\"This way he also solves the duality between particles and fields. If energy is the primary substance of the universe, then it will only depend on the experiment how we will observe this energy. \\"What we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.\\""},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"I am not sure that anyone truly appreciates the fundamentals of quantum physics. But, for someone who has done a great deal of reading on the topic and possesses an advanced degree in a relatively unrelated field (clinical psychology), this is a very readable book on Heisenberg's thinking related to quantum physics. For those who know anything about quantum physics, however, it cannot be overemphasized that this is, in fact, only one perspective on quantum physics (though, probably, the most accepted). Heisenberg was one of the originators (along with Wolfgang Pauli and, particulary, Niels Bohr) of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. For anyone interested in a more deep analysis of the thought that went along with the development of this incredibly groundbreaking thoery, I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Since the 17th century, philosophers have been struggling with the implications science has for classical philosophical questions. In a way, the relationship between science and philosophy is one that has always occured in Western philosophy; Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and also the medievals grappled with science and what relation it had to philosophy, but with the apparent triumph of science in the 20th century as mankind's premier way of knowledge, the questions are all the more urgent.While Heisenberg wrote this book seventy or so years ago, it remains a classic for two reasons. One, Heisenberg himself was one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, and second, he is widely read in the Western philosophical tradition. He shows an excellent understanding of Aristotle and Kant, and proceeds to argue where he feels philosophers have it right, and wrong, in the light of science. Like many scientists he argues for a more process based approached to the world rather than seeing reality as a static and timeless entity, and that space is not really empty and that the microworld is different from the macroworld and is more a place of potentiality than actuality.This work remains a beautiful exploration of the relationship between two ways of exploring the world and is essential reading for philosophers and scientists alike."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"This book was something of a disappointment for me. Of course the things Heisenberg says about physics, and in particular the Copenhagen interpretation of QM, are great...but that shouldn't come as a surprise. The stuff on relativity is a little boring if you've studied it before but good enough. On the other hand, I found most of what he had to say about philosophy somewhat lacking. Heisenberg innocently takes upon himself to \\"summarize\\" all of the philosophical developments post-Descartes in a single chapter - needless to say, any such endeavor is doomed to fail.To be fair, at points the book can be very interesting and provocative, especially in the later chapters. It's definitely worth reading, but I didn't find it mind blowing or supremely enlightening. That being said, there aren't many books like this one out there (at least that I know of), and for that alone it is worth reading.

It is well worth your money and time."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"The German physician and philosopher Heisenberg counts together with the German Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger as founder of the Quantum mechanics. In the year 1927 he formulated the uncertainty relation, German: \\"Unsch&auml;rferelation\\" (also called indeterminacy principle) according to which place and impulse of a subatomic particle cannot be destined at the same time. For his quantum physical research he received in 1932 the Nobel prize of physics.After the second World War Heisenberg became director of the Max-Planck-Institute. His \\"Einheitliche Theorie der Elementarteilchen\\" (unitary theory of elementary particles) from the year 1958 was called \\"world formula\\" (although that is just what it is not!) and strengthened Heisenbergs position as one of the most important representative of quantum physics.In countless lectures and essays he disputed the philosophical implications of quantum physics, among others in \\"Quantentheorie und Philosophie\\", \\"Physik und Philosophie\\" and \\"Der Teil und das Ganze\\".According to Heisenberg the whole thing is more than the summary of the parts. In this idealism is recognizable as to such a degree that it must be concluded to have created not the theory but vice versa the reality itself. And this would mean, that in the end all things that came into being must be traced back to an immaterial flow of information. But information is a spiritual phenomeneon. The magazine \\"Der SPIEGEL\\" called this \\"God in the quantum chaos\\", for according to Heisenberg:\\"The quantum theory leaves no room for a totally objective description of nature... In the experiments of atomic procedures we have to do with material things and facts, with phenomenons so much real as any phenomenon in daily life. But the atoms or the elementary particles are not equally real. They form much more a world of tendencies and possibilities than a world of things and facts.\\"Quite a heap of idealism, it seems, but a compelling conclusion from the datum of physics? Does a spiritual principle stick behind the whole cake? The universe as quantum world! A world which is incessantly in movement because she is designed like that. Only by movement is the personality-structure of all proprieties held. Still-stand is death, or better: non-existence. Is there still-stand at all? Nowhere is it visible, nowhere it has space.Einstein struggled long against the quantum theory. He tried to adopt it to the theoretical fundament of the classic physics and confessed to himself that he failed. There is no solid - you could also say no material - ground on which the order of the world is built! Many years Einstein spent to give the world the knowledge, that there is no chance to pass by the quantum theory, an almost metaphysical theory, when describing reality.In reference to Einstein\`s theory of relativity Heisenberg had called the fact that all physical systems possess either the propriety of a wave or of a particle and that only one of the two is measurable, \\"indeterminacy principle\\" or \\"uncertainty relation\\". Material, according to Einstein nothing but of time and energy, was robbed of it\`s last consistency. Und such thing should have stood in the beginning of the universe?Impossible since the quantum mechanics stand before. Material needs an idea to start movement. A frontier crossing to the spiritual realm is inevitable!Interestingly Heisenberg perceived the contradiction of the quantum theory to modern biology. \\"...most biologists are prepared to confess, that the existence of atoms and molecules can only be understood with the help of the quantum theory, but besides that they have the wish to regard the working material of the chemists and biologists, namely atoms and molecules, as stuff of classic physics, thus dealing with them as with stones or grain of sand.\\"Creation is, by all appearance, provided that we are ready to believe the quantum physics an artfully, a subtle construction, a \\"Within\\" which does not only make an \\"Outside\\" thinkable but even demands for it. Any attempt of a world formula\\" in the sense of Einstein must therefore fail, because it wants to explain the Within without the Outside!Some may flinch from the title of the book or the name of the author to read the book. The fears are not grounded. Basic knowledge of atomic physics is sufficient to understand what the author is talking about. He uses a clear and simple diction. If one understands his theories is another matter. But this might be indebted to the ideology one tends to hold."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"The world paradigm described by physics seemed to have changed with discoveries in the early 20th century, and yet due to the complexity of the science involved society has not been able to fully accompany that change. With that in mind, it's perhaps unfortunate that this book has not been given more prominent publicity since it was first published in 1958. In the book, Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum theory, gives a broad and insightful overview of relevant discoveries in physics in the first half of the 20th century and discusses their implications for science, philosophy, and everyday life. He relates important discoveries in physics to the history of philosophical and scientific ideas since ancient Greece, Descartes, Kant and Newton. With special insight based on his personal relationship with many great scientists of the last century, including Einstein and Bohr, he introduces the meaning of ideas such as the Theory of Relativity and his own Uncertainty Principle relating to the physical laws governing the behavior of subatomic particles. Despite dealing with complex subjects, he does a great job, in most cases, in translating concepts for the lay reader. Among many subjects, here are some things that he talks about: how \\"matter\\" is fundamentally composed of energy, how the search for a basic fundamental particle, or building block, of all other materials is influenced by our interference during the process of searching, how common notions about the nature of space and time disseminated among the general public since Newton need additional qualification, how the geometry of the universe, understood since the time of the Greeks may be understood differently in light of recent discoveries in physics. If you are looking for an explanation of 20th century physics in plain language by a top expert in the field, this is it, or probably as close as you will get. I would recommend this book for anyone in the general public who is interested in obtaining a basic understanding of the topics under examination in modern physics, and perhaps also for aspiring scientists who want to gain an understanding of the history of ideas that has led to current research. A great read."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"I will only mentioned a few aspects of the world of quantum mechanics and then if you get bored you can read the last part where I mention some aspects of the book.Werner Heisenberg is one of the most important figures within the world of quantum mechanics. Since Max Planck discovered that electromagnetic energy could be emmited in quantized forms a series of new discoveries revolutionised the world of physics. Albert Einstein confirmed Plancks's discoveries and theorized that light was composed of discrete quanta. This discovery was just too strange. How can light behave as a wave and as a particle. You can see the double slit experiment and observe how light behave when one slit is open and when the two slits are open, just amazing.So it seems that dualistic thought can not be applied here. Is light particle or wave, the answer: BOTH!As Heisenberg says in the book: \\"that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning\\". Thus observer and observed are in some way connected and not separated as in cartesian-newtonian world.In the introduction is written clearly: \\"...the act of of measurement defines the thing being measured, or that the thing being measured and the thimg doing the measuring are inextricably interwined\\"This is why there have been some analogies between this new physics and eastern traditions (like Fritjof Capra's Tao of Physics)like buddhism and the Indian philosopher Nagarjuna, founder of the Madhamyaka school that developed the concept of emptyness, that is, all phenomenon had no \\"self-nature\\" \\"or idependent origins\\", there is no such thing as Parmenide's Being.All is interconnected,like Indra's jewels in Hinduism there is no gap between the observer and the observed in the world of quantum physics. Quantum mechanics is more familiar with Heraclitus where Change is the main principle, Becoming and not Being.Particles are not \\"things\\" but are like Aristotle's potentia. Heisenberg tell us: \\"A quantum object, in itself, is neither one thing not the other. If you decide to measure a wave-like property, the thing you are observing will look like a wave. Measure a particle property (position or velocity), on the other hand, and you will see particle-like behaviour.\\" Note that Heisenberg that one can measure position OR velocity, this is the pillar of the uncertainty principle. In Heisenberg's words: 2The better you measure the position of a particle, the less you can find out its velocity, and vice versa.\\"Thus, the first years of the 1920s was a turning point in the world of physics. The Copenhagen Interpretation established the principles of quantum mechanics, some of this are: The uncertainty principle, the Complementary Principle (wave-particle duality of light) and that the description of nature is probabilistic.Now you can have a little clue about the book subtitle: \\"The revolution in modern science\\". Newtonian mechanics can' t be applied to the subatomic world.Thus, the view of nature as a Big, impersonal Machine and that it was a matter of time that \\"all mighty rational humanity\\" was to discover all its laws is far from true. Even Einstein was not happy with this group of physicians that were saying \\"there is no such thing called objectivity\\" \\"newtonian laws are like a fish in the desert\\". Einstein after the theory of special and general relativity spent much of his time lookink for a Theory of Everything (TOE), and in some isolated himself from this great discoveries being made in the field of quantum mechanics.Today there is this String Theory or M Theory wandering arround, and could be the best candidate that will unify the 4 forces: Gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak interaction. Time will tell...About the book:Heisenberg explains the developmet pf pshysics reviewing Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes (the three Milesians)Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Leucippus, then a quntum leap to Descartes and Kant.He explains relativity, space, time, the Copenhagen Interpretation, the limits of language to describe the quantum world, the role of scientists, his Nobel Lecture and much more.I think it is not a difficult book, but don't expect to understand quantum mechanics, because if you do, you really didn't understand a thing about it.

Unfortunately, even some of the great physicists have been somewhat shallow philosophers. For whatever reason(probably the fact that his father was a professor of classical studies), Heisenberg had a very good grasp of many philosophical viewpoints. He was able to mostly avoid the cartesian bifurcation that traps most physicists even to this day. He understood that much of the \\"trouble\\" with Quantum Mechanics was caused by our unwillingness to let go of the bad metaphysical assumptions that became implicit in classical physics.

I was completely surprised how many of the aspects of modern science we take for granted today would not be in the classroom if not for quantum physics. The linking to classical philosophy was equally stirring."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Heisenberg's Physics and Philosophy is a rare book in that it addresses two interesting but difficult subjects. These being epistemology and quantum physics.The nice thing about the book is that it has an easy to follow flow to it. As you read, you feel as if you are sitting inside of a lecture hall as Dr. Heisenberg delivers his remarks. This adds to greater accessibility to the material as it is presented. As you read, you must keep in mind that at the time period that Heisenberg was reflecting upon turned the old Newtonian approach to physics upon its head. This is the objective of the book. To show what has changed and what has stayed the same and how the old model will graft itself into this new understanding.Heisenberg attempts to show from the time of preSocratic thought that humanity has hypothesized about the origins of the things that make up our world. The treatment of the preSocratics to the ancients and then the modern philosophers is worth picking up the book alone. After he discusses this material he then moves on to show the reader just how much physics at the quantum level as changed the nomenclature of scientific thought as much as it did through the progress of natural philosophy.One of the nice things about the book is that even though it is a little dated, you feel as if you have been transported back to this time period where a lot of this stuff was just starting to happen. For instance, he mentions the beginning of the building of what is now the Cern reactor that helped to discover the Higgs Boson.Lastly, his explanations of quantum physics are clear and more approachable than some other writers. One thing to keep in mind, quantum physics is not playing Scrabble on a Sunday afternoon. This is difficult material for everyone. This is what makes Heisenberg helpful, it is a bit easier to ascertain what it is that this discipline is all about.All in all, a great book as a primer for the progress of natural philosophy and clear explanation of things at the quantum level."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Although this is an older book, it arrived in perfect condition. Although I have struggled with the concepts in the book it is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"This is probably the most profound, deeply informed, yet most accessible book I've ever encountered. Should be required reading for every student entering grad school in physics, but also suitable for many of us who are curious about the underpinnings of modern science. No equations, no diagrams, but every concept is laid out so clearly that none are needed. Writing in the middle '50s, Heisenberg set forth the four great conceptual systems of modern physics (Newtonian mechanics, the theory of heat, electromagnetism and quantum mechanics) and pointed the way to a still-gestating fifth system that would include all of them. Unfortunately, he left us in 1976, just as physicists were beginning to see the interrelationship between entropy, information theory and the rest of the field. Who knows how much further along we'd be had we had the help of Heisenberg's genius and continued contributions in this area."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Obviously one cannot read this collection of essays and supporting material looking for insight into current modern physics. Even so, Heisenberg's atypical eloquence and observations have aged well since the 1950s, and most material holds up quite nicely. And that is with the world of quarks, string theory, and many additions to the particle zoo yet to come.Heisenberg contrasts the philosophy he aligns with Newtonian physics with that implied by quantum theory and Greek philosophers, with more emphasis on uncertainty and less predictability than the world of Newtonian physics might have implied. The continuing battle between concrete and abstract, precise and imprecise, objective and subjective, and so on had been front and center when Heisenberg wrote 30 years after the dawn of quantum mechanics, and the topic has still not been exhausted.Different themes may have different appeal to various readers. I was less taken by the Copenhagen interpretation (perhaps because it's deeper on the physics) and more interested in the chapter on relativity, as one example. The reader may skim material at times without significant impact.The appendices with his Nobel lecture and a conversation on science and religion make a solid bonus."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"On my personal journey reading 'classical' books from the past I have recently read Heisenberg's 'Physics and Philosophy' , originally published 1958. More than 50 years later this seems to be still a very remarkable book, with an easy reading and a scope of thinking which is rare today.PHYSICSHeisenberg describes in his book the modern findings in physics in a language which does not presuppose any mathematics. And he describes these central findings in a way which is even clearer than written in the complex mathematical machinery of modern physics. The detection of the atomic structure of matter, the discrete structure of the energy levels, the velocity of light as the upper limit of the velocity of all moving bodies, the uncertainty in the description of the behavior of the atomic elements caused by the inevitable interaction between observer and observed object, the equivalence of matter and energy as well as the new structure of the physical space (non-euclidean) compared to the space of our perceptions, imaginations and the everyday space of daily actions. I can not remember any other book about physics which explains these developments in such a clearness and directness.PHILOSOPHYThe book gains even more because Heisenberg compares the concepts of the modern physics with the main concepts of the old Greek philosophy as well as with philosophers like Descartes, Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant. It is interesting to see that human kind was more than 2000 years ago capable to develop conceptual models of matter and nature which logically come very close to the modern concepts of the atom and its parts. At the same time it is interesting to see, that despite of this astonishing conceptual thinking the lack of proper measurement instruments and the lack of a sufficient mathematical language didn't allow better theories. Thus the development of new measurement instruments, new strong languages like modern mathematics as well as the right experiments appear to play a fundamental role in the construction of better world models; they are not 'outside' of the story but a central moment of it.LANGUAGEHeisenberg describes in length the insufficiency of language to describe the new findings in physics, especially those headed under the label of quantum mechanics, not an insufficiency only of the everyday language, but also an insufficiency of the mathematical language as such. While the concrete experiments are described with everyday language expressions and the terms of classical physics do the mathematical expressions describe formal structures like probability fields which encode expectations about the behavior of the quanta which as such are not concrete objects. From the point of theory there is no complete consistent solution conceivable for this problem, only 'practically' by relating concrete experimental data with the abstract mathematical models.WELTBILD/ WORLD VIEWHeisenberg describes not only the development of modern physics but considers also the effect of this new world picture on the overall world view of mankind. He suggests that the physical world view before quantum theory was too narrow, not giving satisfying answers to central phenomena like biological life, the human mind or even the concept of human soul. Only quantum theory has -according to Heisenberg-- forced an opening of central concepts, has widened the concept of objectivity, has reinforced the awareness that the observer is a central moment of the observed object; there is no 'real objectivity'. Knowledge is always a construct under certain conditions where we have to 'extrapolate' the 'hidden' structures with some probability. With regard to biology he states explicitly \\"...we are obviously still very far from such a coherent and closed set of concepts for he description of biological phenomena. The degree of complication in biology is so discouraging that one can at present not imagine any set of concepts in which the connections could be so sharply defined that a mathematical representation could become possible\\". (PP79f)\\" If we go beyond biology and include psychology in the discussion then there can scarcely be any doubt but that the concepts of physics, chemistry, and evolution together will not be sufficient to describe the facts ..\\".(PP80)CRITICAL REMARKSIf one wants to find weak points in the wonderful book, one can mention some. There is nearly no citation; this makes it difficult to follow the sources (if one wants). The look to philosophy is very narrow; many modern developments have not been cited, especially not the large amount of work in semiotics, philosophy of language, and formal logic. He mentions the limits of mathematical theories without citing the famous results of Goedel (1931) and Turing (1936/7). Or, he mentions the logic of quanta proposed by Weizs&auml;cker which has the format of a type logic; this has been introduced by Whitehead-Russel already in 19010ff. Heisenberg argues for the limits of physics with regard to biology using arguments which resemble those of Schroedinger in his famous book of 1944, without mentioning Schr&ouml;dinger. Despite all this, for me this is a very remarkable book, extremely clear, and very inspiring.FUTUREThe book shows that central questions regarding man are not solved. The phenomenon of life is still the big challenge of science."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"At the turn of 20th century when quantum physics was born; the founding fathers of this scientific revolution were thinking deeply about the philosophical consequences of the new physics in terms of existence and physical reality (ontology). The reality perceived through the laws of classical physics provided strong challenges to quantum reality and human knowledge of quantum physical concepts (epistemology). In addition, the theory of relativity, which also came into existence at about the same time, altered the concept of space and time (consequently their relationship to matter, and the concept of gravity) radically from the existing knowledge of Newtonian physics. In this book, physicist Heisenberg gives a brilliant account of physical reality after reviewing the works of notable philosophers like; Kant, Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. You get to read the physical and philosophical analysis of one of the founding fathers of quantum physics using both classical and quantum physics. His philosophical ideas are summarized below:Physical theories had to be proposed speculatively and pursued deductively with respect to their many consequences that can be put to theoretical and experimental verifications. It turns out that the theory makes more physical and philosophical assumptions than the facts alone imply. The assumptions could be ontological or epistemological in nature. For example, the concept of space and time (and its relation to matter) is independent of the observer, which would be ontological in nature since the subject matter of scientific knowledge is independent of the perceiver (consequences of relativity). The nature of quantum physics introduces indeterminacy to nature of things which would be epistemological since the experiment performer (and knowledge-seeker) influences the subject matter (the outcome his experiments) by his physical observation. The state of a quantum object is undetermined until an observation is recorded. Hence, the author's argument is that the potentiality is a part of physical reality. Einstein's contention was that the potentiality, probability or chance is due to epistemological limitations of our knowledge in knowing the entire picture, the Omni-complete, and hence misapplied to the object itself. The Omni-complete object is omniferous, omnifarious, omniparous, omnipotent and omniscient and therefore the concept of chance or probability is inappropriate in the description of a real object. Both Einstein and Heisenberg admitted that the experimental data does not lead to concepts of physics, and hence the object of scientific knowledge remains unknown, but it is known through the theoretical constructs or axiomatic postulation verified indirectly by experiments and its deduced consequences. To find the object of scientific knowledge one must go to the theoretical assumptions of a physical law; the concept of probability and chance figures into the definition of the state of a physical system (due to statistical nature of things, and also use of statistical analysis in understanding the results of an experiment) in both classical and quantum physics. In quantum physics it also figures in the subject matter, but not in classical physics. This is the major difference between two disciplines that separated Einstein from Copenhagen school of thought. Author Heisenberg suggests that the concept of potentiality very much a part of subjective reality contrary to classical reality.The probability function represents a mixture of two things, partly a fact and partly our knowledge of a fact. An atom consists of a nucleus and electrons (wave) moving around the nucleus; from the classical standpoint it is difficult to conceive how an electron orbit around the nucleus without changing its energy. Then again the electron is a wave until detected; therefore the energy is constant as long as it stays in the same orbit. The second point is that the act of determining the position becomes a measurement problem since light quanta is absorbed during its detection and the electron is displaced (change its position) to a higher electronic state. Thus the spacetime description of the atomic events is complementary to their deterministic description. The probability function obeys equations of motion as in Newtonian mechanics; its change in the course of time is completely determined by the quantum mechanical equation, but it does not allow a description in space and time. The observation, on the other hand, enforces the description in space and time but breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by changing our knowledge of the system. The mechanism and the results of an observation of atomic events can be described in classical concepts, but the deductions from observations results in probability functions which combines the statements about possibilities with statements about our knowledge of facts. Therefore we can not completely objectify the results of an observation. What happens between an observation and the next depends on the way we observe or on the fact we observe. This becomes subjectivism. Since the probability function combines objective and subjective elements. It contains statements about possibilities or better tendencies (\\"potentia\\" in Aristotelian philosophy), and these statements are completely objective, they do not depend on any observer, but it contains statements about our knowledge of the system, which of course are subjective in so far as they may be different for different observers. In ideal cases the subjective element in the probability function may be practically negligible as compared with the objective one.1.Heisenberg and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: The Physicist as Philosopher2.The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory3.Encounters with Einstein4.Philosophical Problems of Quantum Physics5.What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"6.Schr&ouml;dinger: Life and Thought7.Niels Bohr's Times,: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity8.Niels Bohr's Philosophy of Physics9.Ideas And Opinions10.From a Life of Physics"},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"Werner Heisenberg wrote an excellent book. It is deep, linear (not too many tangents), thought-provoking and accessible.Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not strictly counterintuitive, yet it is psychologically inconvenient: putting a limit to knowledge is, at best, an unhappy move. Only upon deep contemplation one may discover the true importance of this law and this laconic treatise might provide the reader with a comfortable place to start.Among gems of Heisenberg's manuscript are the tacit revival of Platonism (existence as a manifold of mathematical objects: only these mathematical objects are not open to analysis, they escape from being understood by shielding themselves with uncertainty), indirect defence of Kantian notion of synthetic apriori knowledge and the stunning (yet unnoticed) suggestion that quantum mechanics' notion of entailment must be understood as following the _tertium datur_ paradigm.It might be the case that the frustration we experience when we consider the uncertainty principle stems from the same conflict (understanding vs use) that colours our attitude to the Liar paradox, another unsettling example of insufficiency of our current notion of entailment. After all, both the ancient (Liar) and the modern (the uncertainty principle) are not merely obstacles on our way to understanding, they are stepping stones to it.Before we take to sea we walk on land,Before we create we must understand."},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"I was really expecting a nicer edition of this book.

V. O Quine considered the \\"queen\\" of the sciences--i.e., physics. Certain philosophers of physics assure me that this task will be necessary until a final theory is in hand, if ever, after long millenia, it can be in hand. The work of William Lane Craig and Quinton Smith is an excellant example of what philosophy can do for science, the work of Albert William Levi \\"Philosophy and the Modern World\\" is a masterful study by a non-scientist of the work of, for example, Albert Einstein and Max Planck and of Alfred North Whitehead. Modern philosophy itself--in its Logical Positivist manifestation--is technological;consider alone the level of attention paid to relativity theory and quantum mechanics by the Vienna Circle.Heisenberg is very careful in this work to offer an argument for the consistency of modern quantum mechanics with certain elements of Aristotle's concept of potency or potentiiality: He sees the nature of the quantum to lay in a certain manyness-in-oneness, or what is today called the superposition of the quantum wave function; since potency resides in this state, the orthodox Copenhagen School allows only statistical descriptions of the probable, emergent phenomena: these statistics are inherently part of any quantum field, or better expressed, any part of a quantum field when it is subject to the Heisenberg Cut, which is a mesurement of part of the quantum field which causes the collapse of the wavefunction and its superposition; what evolves once the Heisenberg Cut is made does so by a presumable determinism which is indemonstrable within quantum mechanics; and here, I think, is where Heisenberg's text re-pays careful study (I have twice read the book), for he admits a determinism at the scale of, say, planetary bodies or telluric bodies, but he also indicates that classical determinism emerges from the quantum state's potentiality. This whole problem in Modern physics revolves about various questions about the \\"measurement problem\\" in quantum physics, and I have already alluded to that; but Heisenberg taught us that just as Newtonian mechanics was eventually shown to be a subset of Einsteinian dynamics, when special relativity was considered, so does classical deterministic evolution of micro-matter occur as a subset of states of the quantum, but these states are the precisely measurable states. They are the product of freely chosen laws to this extent: they were brought into being by measurement, which founds the ensemble (Q. Smith), a micro-world as subset of the total world structure. To recur to Dirac's way of dividing the wave-function, it has two cognate parts, Large Psi, which refers to the entire quantum wave-function, and small psi, which refers to the division of the wavefunction into a proper subset: Here is where the crossroads of a great philosophic/scientific problem is broached, for if Classical determinism prevails at the level of human life or planets, and measurement from the superposition creates such determinism, then what measures into being the measurer?Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of NatureTheism, Atheism, and Big Bang Cosmology (Clarendon Paperbacks)The Principles of Quantum Mechanics (International Series of Monographs on Physics)Before the Big Bang: The Origins of the Universe"},{"Title":"Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science (World perspectives, v. 19)","review":"For those who actually think about Life, the Universe, and Everything, only this book can give a reasonable account of why existance is as it is.

I waffled on whether to give the book 3 or 4 stars, so 3.5 is probably what it deserves. The book lays out in detail several examples of Old Testament typology, focusing on the first 6 books of the Bible, Genesis through Joshua. Typology is essentially the study of how Old Testament people, places, themes, and events foreshadow or outline New Testament realities in a prophetic or 'typical' way. For example the crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites is a type of the future reality of Baptism, whereby Christians are washed clean from their slavery to sin (cf. slavery in Egypt). The actual content and interpretations in typology that Danielou provides is quite good. I especially enjoyed the section on Rahab as a type of the Church, and the comparision of Adam and Christ. The parts of the book that really dragged, and were uninteresting was Danielou's rather wordy descriptions of what the church father's meant, and the sections that dealt with allegories. It was helpful, however, that Danielou spent some time distinguishing allegory (which he rejects) and the hermeneutics of typology. But, he did this multiple times, and the example of the allegory of the ark should have been enough to get his point across. Overall I enjoyed the insight that came from quoting his sources, but I didn't find Danielou's commentary very interesting. Some chapters on allegory in particular are worth skipping altogether."},{"Title":"From shadows to reality;: Studies in the Biblical typology of the Fathers","review":"Biblical typology is almost a lost art to many Christians who are unfamiliar with the writings of the early Church Fathers or the great Saints of the Middle Ages, all of whom were steeped in the mystical tradition. It was critical to the early Church Fathers to demonstrate the fulfillment of the prophecies about the Messiah which fill the Old Testament and to show how the \\"types\\" of the Old Testament are fulfilled in the sacraments given to the Church by Christ. Some examples are the Mystagogical Lectures of St. Cyril of Jerusalem or De Mysteriis and De Sacramentis by St. Ambrose. It is also important to recognize that understanding the liturgy more fully is not possible without understanding the biblical typology upon which it rests.Origen and the Alexandrian School of Scriptural interpretation especially brought out the spiritual richness of the developing tradition, which goes back to the Jewish scholar Philo. However, even the more literally focused Antioch School spoke of types, though their interpretation differed. For example, the Antiochian school saw the water from the rock in the desert as a type of Eucharist (which comes from the Pauline tradition), while the Alexandrian school saw it as a type of Baptism (from the Johannine tradition). Yet as Danielou notes \\"we meet an agreement of all schools upon the fundamental types.\\" Thus, he can conclude, \\"This proves that we are face to face with something which is part and parcel of the deposit of Revelation.\\"The chapters tell the story of the richness of the biblical typology presented, which only skims the surface of all that the Scriptures hold: Book I: Adam and Paradise; Book II: Noah and the Flood; Book III: The Sacrifice of Isaac; Book IV: Moses and the Exodus; Book V: The Cycle of Joshua. Cardinal Danielou does not have time to explore the history of the origins of typological exegesis but what he gives us is rich fare indeed. This receives my highest recommendation for those seeking to deepen their faith in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Pons-Kompaktworterbuch: Franzosisch-deutsch, deutsch-franzosisch (German Edition)","review":"this book was purchased as a gift for a German girl living with us at the time.

This excellent book serves as a catalogue of a traveling exhibition of his works and it is quite revealing.From elegant portraits such as the 1949 Robert Penn Warren example through his surveys of the natural phenomena of nature as he observes it, Szarkowski's eye focuses on the most mundane of images and from them creates masterworks. His preoccupation with trees is microscopically focused in a fascinating work entitled 'Graft', a grid of twelve images that reveal the arborist's magic of making a grafted tree.Szarkowski's 'landscapes' of meadows, fields, and barns are luminous and endlessly fascinating to study. He creates naturally found still lifes from views through barn windows to trees and grasses outside. From this excellent sampling of his work and writing (and the accompanying fine essay by Sandra Phillips) this book justifies his placement in the realm of exceptional American photographers.

I wasted two large batches of sap following these instructions. When I did an internet search to find out what the actual correct temperature should be, it consistently said, 7 degrees above your boiling temperature. And although that may vary by a few degrees, 248 is way off from 219, which is the correct temperature to make syrup. 212 is the temp at which water boils, 7 degrees up from that-219!

If you like Beluga whales and learning facts about them, this is the book for you!This book was published in 1996, therefore if you are looking at population or captive statistics this is not the book for you. On the other hand though, if you are looking for basic facts about beluga whales you have the right book!This book explains what scientist believe the Delphinapterus levcas (scientific name for beluga whale) evolved from deer, cows and other types of ungulates,(land animals).The Beluga's appearance is explained also very well. They are born a grayish tint and stay with their mothers until matured. Belugas turn white and their pectoral fins turn up at the tip as their age progresses. They are round shaped and are not made for fast swimming.Beluga whales covers their interaction with each other. They communicate by \\"groans, buzzes, clicks, whispers, pops, raspberries, and other myriad noises.\\" Belugas travel in \\"pods\\" which are groups of whales in a pack of approximately 18 belugas.The book has many more topics covered such as how they treat their young, migration, feeding, interaction with humans, human hunting and what they use beluga for, and many other topics.

How can a book written about a joke be worthwhile? His paintings were/are indistinguishable from what your average six year old would come up with if given a paint brush and some paint.

I'm sorry he died young, but if there was ever a fraud perpetrated on a gullible intelligentsia, it was Basquiet!"},{"Title":"Jean-Michel Basquiat","review":"This is a great book with many of Basquiat's paintings and drawings. It also has various essays by art critics and people who knew him. I suppose the reviewers who slammed Basquiat also think anybody could knock over a couple of paint buckets and be Jackson Pollock. The genius of Basquit in my mind is his ability to create truly beautiful paintings while painting in a seemingly uncontrolled, primitive (I hate that word) fashion. The way he layered colors, and added details is incredible. My favorite is &quot;Untitled (Skull)&quot; 1981. Here is a brilliant example of how Basquiat combines dissarray, ugliness, harmony, and beauty all into the same striking painting. I know Basquiat idolized Hendrix and ultimately went out much like he did, unable to cope with his talent and the attention it brought. To me Basquiat's painting very much mirrors Hendrix's musical talents. They both created wild, noisy, seemingly unharnessed, unpolished art. But to the careful, sensitive observer the true beauty and magic is revealed."},{"Title":"Jean-Michel Basquiat","review":"This is by far the best catalogue of Basquiat's work as it was shown at the Whitney.

As a result, I did a graduate paper on him. Anyone who has any knowledge of black art with respect to racism and the use of symblols in art which relate to one's culture, oppression, genocide, etc. could surely see the important messages floating throughout Basquiat's work. If everyone painted like the &quot;master's&quot;--oh what a boring world and perception of life that would be. If you love Basquiat like I do, read the biography by Hoban, watch the film &quot;Basquiat&quot; starring Jeffrey Wright as Jean Michel--who looks sooo much like him, and listen to the sound track afterwards.

Although the author does not tell us the exact date for the events in the novel, it is fair to say that it is probably more of a &quot;Georgian&quot; than a &quot;Regency&quot;. Probably the main difference in these two subgenre, when they are done well, is that the Georgian presents a more languid and stately scheme of events and behaviour. In this novel, the hero Lord Amberley, is elegant and refined with some characteristics that are best described as languid rather than energetic. After many years he encounters Rosalind Vernon who was the victim of an accident in which he was involved but for which he was not truly responsible. Much of the frame of this novel sets out his inner thoughts and feelings as he comes to terms with loving a woman for whom he fosters much guilt. Whilst sponsoring Rosalind to a season in London, thinking he will allow her to blossom, Rosalind sets him free and he comes to depend upon her more than she upon him despite her blindness. Her clarity of thought, brightness of spirit and love and loyalty allow him to focus his own life so that they may join together in what will be, one feels, a truly happy marriage.The author seems to have had a brief output. A shame, this, because this book was terribly attractive, well written with interesting and well-rounded adult characters.I do recommend this - look out for a copy!"},{"Title":"The Parfit Knight","review":"In this Georgian Romance, the hero's involvement in the event that lead to the heroine's blindness is the impediment to mutual happiness.A beautiful girl, accidentally blinded in childhood, is cossetted and protected by her concerned, but brick-headed brother, Philip.Rosalind, left on her family's estate, Oakleigh Manor, yearns for the interactions and experiences denied her by blindness and the overprotectiveness of family and servants.Dashing Lord Amberley's coachman is injured by highwaymen.

I am repeatedly disappointed when I look up terms in Dorland's. Pronunciations are often lacking (e.g., for the cranial foramina and skeletal muscles), the illustrations are meager and inferior to Stedman's, and many terms are missing. Dorland's doesn't even define first-, second-, and third-degree burns, for example, and the levator labii superioris muscle and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi are completely missing from both the body of the dictionary and the appendix of muscle tables. Such omissions reflect either inexcusable carelessness or inexplicable editorial caprice. A professional writer or physician should have Dorland's on hand as a backup source. I find it useful for corroborating some facts and getting alternative meanings of words. But I still go to Stedman's as my first resort; it does a far better job.

Both books have occasional errors; each book has terms that the other lacks; and each book has some definitions that are superior to the those in the other. However, if you purchase only one, I recommend Dorland's. In my opinion, Dorland's has definitions for more terms, better definitions and fewer errors."},{"Title":"Dorland Illustrated Medical Dictionary. (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary)","review":"I'm not in a position to criticize anyone who prefers Mosby's or Stedman's dictionaries; however I have used all three and found the 30th ed. of Dorland's to be my personal favorite.1. Anyone who uses books regularly knows the importance of a dictionary's binding and printing. Dorland's has a beautiful layout, easy-to-read font, and subtle and effective illustrations. The paper is top quality, and few books these days are so well bound. The book stays open at any page and when shut feels like a brick. The binding doesn't flex and the pages don't sag.2. I am not a specialist, but I haven't found any word from a medical textbook that wasn't easy to locate and very well defined. The quality of the illustrations is really striking--particularly for anatomical terms. I find an excess of pictures and photographs distracting in a dictionary, and Dorland's are always well-chosen and relevant.3. The CD-ROM/registration code is a nice plus. I can't comment on the PDA feature, but the access to the internet version of Dorland's is an incredible time saver if one happens to be working at the computer.I love this dictionary. If I had time I'd read it cover to cover. The only downside is the size. There's definitely a place for Taber's or some other compact dictionary for travel, etc.P.S.-- Thanks to Ken Saladin for his excellent critical review. The editors at Dorland's must have been listening too, since the 30th edition has all the terms he listed as missing (and hopefully others as well!)"},{"Title":"Dorland Illustrated Medical Dictionary.

The layout is that of a common dictionary, which we're all accustomed to using, and it is easy to find the word you're looking for. Compare Stedman's: the layout is confusing in that there are are often many subcategories to one word, and I often cannot find a word I'm looking for, only to find it another day under some heading where I never dreamed it would be. When reading Dorland's, it is clear that the dictionary is geared to the medical professional, with its concise, scientific definitions and detailed illustrations.

Those who are new to the profession find out quickly!Every possible medical condition is described in this easy-to-read, easy-to-navigate treasure. Some of the peskiest problems in medical editing, knowing when to italicize a genus and/or species, and even identifying which IS a genus and/or species, is a quick page away with Dorlands. Therefore, I no longer fear the mention of pseudomonas (if I haven't spelled this right, forgive me...my Dorlands is back at the office!)There are many other medical dictionaries, but most medical editors in the know use this one.

(Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary)","review":"I was very disappointed when I got this dictionary. I had before the 1937 17th edition and the 1982 pocket edition. This edition shows you what cann happen when a book goes through many editions. Among the things wrong were: 1) The book is oversized and bulky to handle. 2) It is printed on what may be positiveley the worst sort of paper for a medical dictionary or other alphabetically rganized reference book. The pages are a bit hard to separate and are very easily badly wrinkled by water. I worried about whether Amazon com would let me return it after I damaged one page but they said okay. I have very rarely seen any book printed on paper like it or close to it except for some Bibles. 3) It is an important principle of a good medical dictionary that evry word used in a definition should itself be defined (although that will send a novice looking through half a dozen or more entries, the person will learn and it's valueable) This principle I think has been forgotten and this may nmot apply to new words added in recent editions - or the word may be defined only by pointing back to the entry that mentioned it. 4) The definitions have gotten too wordy. This is probably an attemppt to make them more exact but this is done by throwing in extra clauses into the middle of a definitio. 5) The illustrations are all in black and white, even for the eye, in spite f the fact that the 1982 Pocket edition had several color plates. 6) There is a lot f extra white space on the pages. To me this just looks like a reduction in quality. This is not more user friendly. User frinedly would be ease in speed of looking something up and understanding. The dictionary as a whole almost seems l like the target audience the publisher now has in mind is an experienced physician who may once every month or three look up ONE word. That is not for whom a dictionary should be designed for. rather it should be a student or educated layperson. I'm keeping on using my old dictionaries. For anything new I can probably find glossaries in a book. There may not be now any good medical dictionary on the market or if there is it is probably pbscure. Overall also I should say paperbacks or Permabond type covers are better than hardcover. Not only do they weight more, but I think the dust jacket of a hardcover is more easily damaged than the cover of a paperback."},{"Title":"Dorland Illustrated Medical Dictionary.

I have looked at Dorland and Stedman and other medical dictionaries in libraries and I think that Dorland is the best one for someone who doesn't know what the words mean before to use.

(Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary)","review":"note: this part of the review was written when I first purchased the text, some of my happier thoughts can be found further down in the review...I'm pleased with the dictionary, but I can use the dictionary in the library where I study. I purchased the dictionary so I could reference it while at home, etc. But I was motivated to buy it based on the included CD and the internet access. Both very disappointing. As a student I cannot carry the dictionary with me wherever I go, even if I would like to do so. The online access is dreadfully slow. When you type in a word (most of the time the website won't load within 60seconds and I give up) even if there is an exact match it doesn't take you to that screen, just to a screen with the word--which you then have to click to get to the final destination--what's the point in that?As for the CD, it's not working right now, but that's a problem with my computer. I had hoped that either the CD or the website would be easy to use. I just noticed that it says on the label \\"single user version.\\" That means that every single time you want to use the dictionary on your computer the CD has to be in the drive. I ask again, what's the point in that? Some lightweight laptops don't even have CD drives currently. Why should I need to carry the CD everywhere as well---I wanted a program I could install--that's what I was lead to believe I was purchasing. Not too mention the program is load and slow when it must be run from a CD drive--that's why people install programs.I have a Merriam Webster Dictionary--which after about 6 years I discovered the CD in the back cover. It works like a dream. I installed the program once, and whenver I want to look up a work, I click an icon, and a simple and efficient program (what else do you want in a dictionary) opens and I can look up words rapidly.Don't let this mislead you---I enjoy the print version. That is what is advertised. But there are copies of those all over the library where I spend my time, and I was hoping that access to the extras would be worth me buying my own copy. Just wish they lived up to the standards.that was written early in 2008 -- here's some more of my thoughts in Nov 2008-- I tried to move the rating from 3 to 4 stars, it probably does not really matter...but I tried:I believe I previously gave this a lower ranking because I was pretty disappointed in the CD that accompanies the dictionary. I still feel that way about the CD.However, I wanted to add that in the second year of medical school when you spend much more time studying specific disease processes instead of the basic sciences this book has been invaluable. I use it daily. When one professor says one thing and another says something different -- I go to this book. Internet sources are helpful, but I think this book is great. Anytime I have a question I turn to this reference. When is it vaginosis rather than vaginitis -- this book will tell you. Did you know that touching the tip of your nose with your tongue is known as the \\"Gorlin sign\\" -- neither did I until I saw the picture in the section on \\"signs.\\" The pictures are great in this one. I've used Stedman's medical dictionary some as well, but I find myself missing the pictures. That one might be handy if you wanted to carry it around with you -- this is a big text. Don't get it unless you can leave it in an area where you are going to use it. It's too big to carry around school. But that is also one of its strengths -- it is built solid, feels good, smells nice.One thing that takes some adjustment: things are often listed in categories (the sign example I mentioned above). So if you want to find out about Marfan syndrome -- it's not under \\"Marfan\\" it's in a special section of \\"syndromes\\" -- so you need to know ahead of time if you are looking for a disease, or a syndrome, or a sickness, or a sign, or a symptom, etc. That can be confusing, and make a few things hard to find at first. Or you may get where you think you need to be and you see the dictionary is sending you elsewhere.In the end, I use this daily for my studies in my second year of school. It is also the reference found throughout the medical library, which was my original influence for picking this one."},{"Title":"Dorland Illustrated Medical Dictionary.

You decide on what pace you want to go.For anyone who has been away from calculus or not even taken calculus, I strongly recommend Forgoten Calculus."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"I would never have gotten through my first semester of Calc w/o this book. The initial examples and problems were basic and then increased in complexity, allowing me to smoothly increase my skill level. Would (and have) recommended it to my fellow students."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"Or for anything else for that matters. I sold it nearly as fast as I bought it. It fails to explain limits, fails in giving a proper definition of the derivative. The problem is not in its lack of rigor, that is acceptable for many non-mathematicians who need to just learn or use the calculus as a tool. There are better choices out there."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"The book is good if you're a beginner at Calculus, if you're at a more advanced level you will find it a bit too easy."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"Update: I wrote the following review for the 1st edition of Forgotten Calculus. When I learned that Dr. Bleau had released a 2nd edition of it, I bought it too. Yep, that's how much I like it. The main advantage I found of the 2nd edition over the 1st was that Bleau had updated her calculator coverage for the TI-84 (the TI-83 was used in the original), and that her explanations how to use the TI-84 were clear enough even for a neophyte like me to be able to follow. By the time I was halfway through the book, I'd become comfortable using the TI-84 with her text. Having said that, however, I'm still pretty old school. I still worked out all examples and problems long hand, and would just use the calculator as a quick reference.I'm still hoping that Bleau will consider releasing either a \\"Forgotten Calculus\\" Volume 2, or a \\"Forgotten Calculus\\" for engineering/math/science majors. C'mon, Dr. Bleau, whaddya say?Original review follows:When I picked up this book, I had completed one quarter of calculus at the university level (about 15 years prior), and had accumulated a bookshelf full of calculus texts and self-help books over the subsequent years, with the best of intentions of delving deeper into the subject. It never happened, though. All of the books I had obtained on the subject were either obtuse, mind-numbingly dull, or both. Then I discovered Dr. Bleau's Forgotten Calculus. At first, I was somewhat daunted by the title, because for me there was a lot of \\"not-taken\\" calculus in her book, but then I noted the blurb on the cover, the last clause of the last sentence, which read \\"...and can be used by adults who have never studied calculus.\\"This is simply the best self-help book I have ever come across. It took me about two months to complete, working through the material in my spare time. The subject matter was stimulating and clearly explained, favoring the practical over the theoretical. Best of all, it left me wanting for more -- an uncommon feat for a math book, especially one about calculus."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This book provides a gentle review of differential and integral calculus. About 2/3rds of the material is devoted to differential calculus. Numerous fully worked examples, as well as problems with full solutions, are provided in each Unit. Each of the 28 Units ends with a relatively long list of exercises, usually hovering around 20 or so. Fully worked answers, not just solutions, for all exercises are provided at the end of the book.Some of the features which make the book appealing as a basic introduction may limit its usefulness for those who need to use calculus for more advanced work or \\"real world\\" problems in the immediate future. Examples are overly simplified compared to even modestly complex applications in the undergraduate curriculum or \\"real world\\". As an example, the Unit on Linear Applications presents a demand function for a homemade cake business, where the business can sell no more than 10 cakes. This is excellent for a novice calculus learner, but it might disappoint the economics's major who might hope for a few more realistic examples. The business nature of problems used in the text and exercises will limit the books value for engineering and science students.The book, as one might expect of any mathematics book, is not free from errors, although the number is smaller than one would expect for a book with this many worked problems. Also, most of the errors are fairly obvious and should not be a problem, even for beginners. As an example of the errors one might encounter, here are some from Unit 6. On page 79 a \\"+\\" is inadvertently changed to a \\"-\\"; example 5 gives the wrong vertex for a quadratic function, and the graph of 6.1 gives incorrect values for f(-1) and f(-5). Occasionally a problem solution is left off as in Exercise 5d in Unit 11, or a problem appears, Exercise 20 in Unit 15, that is unconnected to the material in the Unit.The book is an \\"old style\\" calculus text in that it emphasizes repetitive pencil and paper problem solutions. The text and Exercises often provide a small amount of material on and for the TI-83 graphing calculator. However, the emphasis is clearly on solutions to simplified problems, easily solved by hand. The exercises provide for extensive repetition. For the reader having problems, this is extremely helpful. Others, however, may select to solve only a few of the end of chapter exercises. Some may even decide to solve only the examples and problems in the text and skip the exercises completely, as the text presents all the necessary material clearly. However, the book provides plenty of exercises if needed.In summary, this book is an excellent basic introduction or review of calculus for the business or economics major. Its a friendly introduction, with concepts clearly explained with relatively few errors.I kept track of the time to read a number of chapters and solve all chapter exercises. Based on the results, it should be possible to complete the book at a reasonably comfortable pace within three weeks, or within two weeks with a more concentrated effort."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This is one of the better practical texts available for a cursory review of calculus. My congratulations to Barron's and Dr. Lee Bleau. I usually do not take the time to comment on books although I like to get some feedback before buying a book. I felt so good about this text that I had to recommend it for anyone who wants to review their precalculus and calculus. It has a great synopsis of functions, as is usually covered under precalculus courses. It then moves on to derivatives, differential and integral calculus. Other &quot;quick learning&quot;/review books have not been as &quot;smooth&quot; as this one. The topics are covered clearly and in good order. There are a lot of example problems, with solutions, that help reinforce the learning process. I have actually found that I enjoy reading this book. The author does a great job in covering the material."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This book is a miracle! As a college student currently taking calculus class, I was saved by this book. This book is not one of those stale boring textbooks that bombard you with thousands of incomprehensible formula, proofs and theorems that drive you absolutely insane Rather, this book gets to the point right away. In each chapter, it presents the subject of study in a quick short paragraph, and immediately begins to teach us how to calculate the problems using important rules and formula. For every example problems, the author writes out every single step, complemented by concise explanation, to show us how to solve a problem. At the end of each chapter are a set of more problems, accompanied at the back of this book by detailed explanation of solution. The writing style in this book is very personal, not formal, so that this book is easier to understand, and not intimidating. If I am asked to use three words to describe this book, then it would have to be \\"effective, concise, fast\\".For those of us in college currently taking calculus, especially those who are taking so many classes that they don't seem to have enough time to study, this book is a must have.P.S: This book deserves a ten stars out of five. But such option is not possible on Amazon, so I can only rank it a five."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"When I decided to pursue my engineering degree I discovered that I needed to take calculus-1 and 2. I had already taken calculus-1, but that was over 7 years ago. I then realized I'd &quot;FORGOTTEN CALCULUS&quot;. This book was for me, literally. Anyone who desires a calculus review, or would like to learn on their own, should pick up this text. A basic knowledge of algebra is all that is really required. The algebraic review, in the first 9 lessons (out of 28), makes the transition to calculus a breeze. The author is careful to not take anything for granted, and never goes off on tangents (ha ha). The worked out examples have a natural progression that makes sense of the entire problem, not just the answer. The problems and exercises, which you work out yourself, are very comprehensive and appropriate. All the answers are given so that you can check your work. This book rocks!"},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"I bought this and its companion book, Forgotten Algebra, in the hopes of shoring up math skills for engineering and physics classes. This is not a useful book for such. It gets about as far as the chain rule and some simple multivariable stuff, with an emphasis on biz apps. My mistake, the book is likely fine for most readers just wanting a quick refresh of the very bssics."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"I have collected a shelf full of calculus books over the years. I looked for the &quot;magic bullet.&quot; This book is it. The pre-calculus review at the beginning brings you back to speed. Then each chapter deftly progresses into the heart of the matter. I highly recommend this a book for even rank beginners. The writing is top shelf and the ideas are clear and easily grasped."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"I teach a business calculus refresher course at a local university and use this as a referenece book for students. All the feedback that I have received from students has been extremely positive.It does a great job of reviewing the basic ideas and mechanics of basic calculus and manages to throw in some applications as well. (This is the only weakness of the text...applications are limited, especially with respect to integration.)"},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"Being accepted into a MBA program was great until we jumped right into calculus based economics.

I started a month ago with the school textbook, library books and other books at the bookstore on Calculus. Two weeks into studying I thought it was hopeless becuase I was could figure out only the most basic problems. This book helped me get past the first stumbling blocks, and I had no more difficulties as I finished the rest of the book over the next two weeks. I spent the past few days reviewing my school textbook and finally understanding the problems."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This is the best book that I found to help me understand to work out the problem.

Unfortunately the degree I went for required me to recall a ton of knowledge that was buried in the deep places of my mind. This book helped me to recall my knowledge fo calculas and even taught me some techniques I wasn't aware of before. I say it's a good review because if someone weren't introduced to calculas before they might be easily intmidated by the subject material eventhough this book does the best job possible to easily convey the material to the reader. Kudos to the authors!! I was able to recall 3 years of calculas in approxiamtely 1.5 months. As a study aid or textbook supplement, I would receommend this for all."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"Most Calculus textbooks assume their reader is majoring in Mathematics when at least 90%+ of students in Calculus 101 are not math majors. So result is that most Calculus textbooks expound on the fundamentals of theoratical Calculus that most of us will never use and put us to sleep, and that includes most engineering grads.That is too bad since Calculus is an amazing tool to solve practical problems that can be quantified.This book focuses on graphs, differentiation, and integration and how to use them to solve real world problems. There is no rigorous emphasis on limits, proofs, and asymptotes, and no undue focus on graphs. The book focuses on the basic rules of differentiation and integrals and how to use them to calculuate optimal (maximum or minimum) values given an equation or a practical problem.Unfortunately, this book does not cover regression, which is a method on how to derive the equation that can unleash the power of Calculus.I highly recommend this book as the first book on Calculus. I particularly recommend this book for business and non-science students.If you need a Calculus refresher that leaves out the theoretical hodgepodge, then this book should also fit the bill.Finally, I am sometimes apalled at the lack of even basic mathematical knowledge of today's business leaders. If you can master the contents of this book along with statistics, that will certainly put you ahead of pack. Knowledge of Calculus and Statistics is becoming MORE important especially because the explosion of information technology has put almost boundless data at most business's disposal."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This is a very good learning tool: simple language instruction, lots of examples and problems, all with step-by-step explanations.No frustrating 'big jumps'in ether the examples or the problems-the provided answers make absolute sense.

Differential Equations. I'll probably get another book for the trig stuff but I'm really understanding the basics for the first time vice being a monkey and just solving problems. Heavy emphasis on graphing or estimating graphing which I believe is a skill I will need in DiffyQ."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"Okay this is a very long story. I started taking calculus this semester at City College in New York. Unfortunately for me the Professor I thought I had signed up for is not actually the professor I got. I should have known this would happen as this school is notorious for changing schedules and professors without notice. Further more, to add to my distress, I find out that this teacher is from Germany (he speaks perfect English). The problem is not his accent as some would assume, but that he does Calculus in general math the German way. What does that mean?! Long and drawn out and far from the point. By the time you figure out how he got his results, your still confused over all, because of all the notes involved you then just don't understand what to do.Now I'm not saying that everyone in the class is suffering, far from it. But these kids who are passing are Freshmen who probably took Calculus in high school previously but not College Calculus, because of their introduction to Calculus for possibly a year before they have a basic grouding. But for us who had about 2 months of Pre-Calculus to show and have been out of the Mathematics loop for over 10 years it's not an easy concept to grasp.Anyway I took my first exam about 3 weeks ago and recieved an 11%. I started panicking!! To be a straight A student with 1 B+ to get an 11% out of 100% is bloody ridiculous. I knew I had a problem this just summarized it. I was so appalled besides panicked. Now I had two other chances to get a good mark to pass with a decet C+. Although I may not get 100% on the exam, there is a chance of me doing better on them.Anyway a girl introduced me to Calculus for Dummies. I was like this is pretty good..but still a bit too wordy for me. I'm not a person who does well with wordy things, I'm find that just straight problems with minimum chat is what I need. When I went too browse through some books at Barnes and Noble since I needed as soon as possible. I found the Dummies one, Idiot's Guide, and Forgotten Calculus.I should mentioned I had previously browsed amazon for direction on what study guides I should get. Although Forgotten Calculus was mentioned and I planned on looking at it, I wasn't going to buy it, since the title is VERY VERY misleading.Anyway as I was looking through the three I decided on getting Forgotten Calculus and I will expand on this. And Idiot's guide over Calculus for Dummies. I found the Dummies as mentioned before too wordy. I found the idiot's guide not as wordy but good for referencing although there is still a chance I may return it.But when I opened Forgotten Calculus I saw Angel's singing. I love chamber music. Anyway I so impressed by what I saw it was shocking. I was feeling awful prvious to getting the book because of my exam score and I had a vicious migraine. But the book was so clear it explained derivatives even with me suffering a headache. I can do basicly any Chain Rule derivative problem and I memorized it within 5 minutes. I plan on finishing a chapter a day.And also if your one of those people that like methods without skipping steps this it. And if you love practice problems you can check it is here!!! This book has it all!Dr. Bleau is a genius. She has simplified it so well...I can't explaine it. If I had this when I was taking Pre-Cal I would have gotten an A+ not a B. And I hope it can salvage my average. But I'm finally understanding what's going on and what I'm doing.This book is far more than a god send. If it can simplify and teach me derivatives with a pounding headache then it can teach anyone. You don't have to take calculus to teach yourself Calculus. This is definitely a do it yourself book and the most important piece or past students, present, and anyone who wants to be, or just wants to learn. You have no other place to look.She gives you problems, she clearly answerss them, and she gives you examples without being wordy. Added to that if your a calculator buff, she gives you methods on solving it on a calculator..by showing you a picture. It's an all around great books...so you can even check your answers with a calculator if you want.This book will save everyone adn anyone from flunking Calculus!!I will update this post when I'm done with the term..to let you know what's going on. But right now I'm in bliss and very happy. Good Luck with Cal this book is the ultimate!!!P.S. FOR ALL CALCULUS AND PRE-CALCULUS PROFESSORS, PLEASE ASSIGN THIS BOOK WITH YOUR USUAL TEXTBOOK, SO WHEN THE STUDENTS DON'T GET IT, OR YOUR TEACHING ADN YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND, THEY CAN REFER TO IT. YOU'LL SEE A DRASTIC IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR GRADES EVEN THOSE WHO FIND IT CHALLENGING!!!!

All the bases are covered in this book! Even if you don't remember a bit of your algebra. I actually learned more from this book than I did from my instructor I had in college. It will be the best $2.00 you've ever spent in you life if you pick up a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"Its different from the text I used just a few years ago to learn calculus. It explains things step by step instead of just assuming you follow their thinking like most calc texts do. I realize the reason for the other texts doing this but in the end it gets distracting and confusing for the student and this text seems to realize this. The author of this book takes the time to explain EVERYTHING they're doing in a problem including the basic math/algebraic stuff so you don't have to waste time on it and you can get down to getting used to calculus. When I first learned calculus it was scary and confusing, this text makes it so much simpler. It does show you a lot applications for it in business which might be of help to you business majors out there. Unfortunately for my case, I can't say I found them to be too useful as my reasons for needing calculus are much more scientific. I wish there was a part two to this text because there are a few harder integrals and partial derivative problems that I use but are hardly touched upon. I need a version of this book for advanced calculus. (like the kind you use in physics and chemistry) Perhaps we can call it \\"Forgotten Advanced Calculus\\"."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This is the best Calculus book I have ever read.

This book brought me up to speed in two weeks. It is well written and comprehensive. This book saved my life!"},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"I took my calculus courses over 15 years ago. So it has been a while. Suffice to say, I have not differentiated or integrated in some time. I found this author did an excellent job in the descriptions, examples, and problems provided. It had more emphasis on applied examples than I recall from my college courses (which I appreciated). As a review of the material, this book was exactly what I was looking for. And upon finishing it, I grasped all the concepts and I wanted to find another book to extend what I was taught. That, to me, is a sign of good instruction.Unfortunately, for Kindle owners, there are some editing issues. On the upside, in most cases, the math symbols that can be problematic for e-readers, actually came over well, though there were some formatting issues with font size and justification. It was also apparent that whoever was editing the scanned material gave up about 10 chapters in. Around then you will gradually see problems with words merging, transposing, and so on. In most cases, I could \\"translate\\" these. In a few though, it affected the problems, resulting in missing information, and in one case a wrong answer in the answer section.In short, 4 stars because of the material. It would be 5 but you need to wade through some poor editing in the latter part of the electronic version of the book."},{"Title":"Forgotten Calculus","review":"This is a great book for a general treatment of beginning calculus. It was definitely meant for people who have either already taken calculus or people who know nothing of it and want a easy intro.

He uses a historical approach and provides excellent background information that helps shed light on aspects of Barth's theological exegesis. Moreover, his appendix provides the preface drafts to the first edition of Barth's Romans commentary, and this is the first time they have been made available in English.The only problem I have with the book (and hence 4/5 stars) is that Burnett uses a great deal of German, thus limiting his readership (or limiting one's understanding of the book) and placing the book mostly in academic circles, though perhaps this was his intention. Granted, this is a revised edition of his dissertation at Princeton Theological Seminary. However, I still believe this book could have remained academic and still appealed to a broader audience. For example, Burnett will not even cite the Gottingen Dogmatics in English (except for the first time he cites this work - he notes the title of the English translation, and only at this point). Instead, they are consistently cited as \\"Unterricht.\\" Thus, if you forget that this is the German title, you find yourself flipping through the early pages to find out what source he's citing. He also cites the rest of Barth's works with their German titles (among other German authors/texts), adding to the difficulty unless one knows German. Thankfully, when he uses German terms he is good at explaining their meaning. An \\"abbreviation\\" section at the beginning would have helped tremendously. This may be more of a \\"heads up\\" to potential readers and buyers than a genuine critique of the book. Despite this shortcoming I found the book to be of great help in many background issues as they related to Barth's early exegesis."},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"Its an old book- which is okay.What surprise me is the somewhat casual and humor-injected writing style.

Buckley, Jr., and herself the mother of 10 children, periodically wrote essays for her brother's magazine, National Review, during the 1960s. Many of them addressed life with her children, and several were about their preparations for Christmas. However, the title derives from an episode in which her child asked Aloise whether a neighbor was committing a mortal sin by voting for LBJ. Mom explained her views on responsible and moral voting, then composed a song predicting that the neighbor would go to hell. As she explains, she really couldn't blame the children of the neighborhood for calling Mrs. Major morning, noon and night to sing her the song. Mrs. Heath had, after all, delighted as her own kids brought all of their friends round to hear Mom's outrageously funny song, and pretty soon, Mom was arranging harmonies and rounds. The poor children probably couldn't think of anything else.Mrs. Heath's look at life -- at soap operas (and their necessity for the modern housewife), movie magazines, politics, child-rearing, and husbands -- was imbued with self-deprecating humor and an unusual insight into and respect for children.

Like the M&uuml;tter Museum, (M&uuml;tter Museum: Philadelphia College of Physicians, 19 South 22nd Street, between Chestnut and Market Hours: Mon-Sat 10am-4pm, Sun 12-4pm), Stanley Burns' book is a window into the 19th century propensity to gather esoteric information of all types, organize it and, ultimately, to exhibit it as the means to greater knowledge."},{"Title":"A Morning's Work: Medical Photographs from the Burns Archive & Collection 1843-1939","review":"This is by far one of the best books out there depicting photographs of human anomalies, surgical procedures and things of the like during the early 20th century.

Not for the easily squeemish!"},{"Title":"A Morning's Work: Medical Photographs from the Burns Archive & Collection 1843-1939","review":"Stanley Burns is a physician and a collector of medical history photographs. You may remember his previous book of mortuary photographs entitled \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" which is long out of print and fetches incredible sums among used book dealers. (Fortunately, a sequel - \\"Sleeping Beauty II\\" is more readily available.) \\"A Morning's Work\\" is a collection of 127 vintage medical photographs from 1843 to 1939 along with a helpful narrative explanation of the photographs and their cultural significance. Although some of the pictures are more historically significant than interesting, the bulk of the images are of medical curiosities - and some of them are absolutely head-scratchingly bizarre. Among the images featured are mortuary photographs, images of amputations, surgical procedures, disfigurement, and a wide assortment of congenital and acquired diseases. The title \\"A Morning's Work\\" is taken from an image of a pile of amputated limbs taken during the Civil War, when the horrific wounds inflicted by the large leadshots used at the time resulted in amputations for even the most minor of injuries. Many of the photographs take us back to the Dark Days of medicine, before antiseptic procedures were implemented, and when a small wound could result in a deadly infection in a matter of days.The narrative explanations of the photographs add a special poignance to them. For example, a photograph of a dead man would not be nearly so interesting were it not for Burns' explanation that the man was Dr. James Howe who contracted Cholera while treating patients during the St. Louis epidemic of 1849 and was fatally afflicted. That one sombre portrait seems to symbolize the bravery and sacrifice of physicians the world over during times of pestilence, and if there's anything that you come away with after viewing this book, it's a newfound appreciation for modern medicine. All told, \\"A Morning's Work\\" is a fascinating book - and a must for enthusiasts of the bizarre and medical historians alike."},{"Title":"A Morning's Work: Medical Photographs from the Burns Archive & Collection 1843-1939","review":"This collection of photographs and plates are some of the most concise findings on the medical world I have ever seen.

I really recomend this to anyone who has an interest in the medical field and all of its mishaps."},{"Title":"A Morning's Work: Medical Photographs from the Burns Archive & Collection 1843-1939","review":"Stanley B. Burns, A Morning's Work: Medical Photographs from the Burns Archive and Collection (Twin Palms, 1998)\\"A Morning's Work\\" is the title of a photograph, included here, from Civil War times. It was taken by a surgeon and depicts a pile of amputated feet. While Burns talks about other interpretations one can have of the photograph's title, the simple surface of the thing is enough to give you an insight into what you're going to find here. (Burns also mentions in that introduction that Joel-Peter Witkin has made use of the Burns Collection on occasion. And if you don't know who Joel-Peter Witkin is, you're probably not reading this review.) The hundred-odd photographs that Burns has selected for this volume are often grotesque and always fascinating. Like all of the (few) Twin Palms books I've encountered, it is wonderfully put-together; this is a book that will last you a lifetime, as long as you don't run over it with an SUV or something. What there is to be read into the permanence of grotesquerie, I shall leave to the individual. That said, I would go no more than five pages at a time without finding another photograph that said \\"you need to use me for an album cover.\\" (And what that says about the reviewer I'm sure is much less a puzzle. I have long been a fan of Joel-Peter Witkin's.)Reviewing a book like this seems an exercise in futility; you're either going to be struck by it, or you're not. And if you're struck by it, there's a strong chance you're going to pick it up no matter what I have to say about it. But let the record show that I found myself unable to look away, I found the notes illuminating, and I continue to respect the way Twin Palms puts a book together; very few companies these days pay as much attention to the actual, physical construction of a book as they do. Whether you pick up a copy or not will depend on how you feel about the subject matter, but keep my recommendation in the back of your head if you're on the fence. For I do recommend this book if you're at all interested in the history of medicine, the history of photography, or a combination of the two. ***"},{"Title":"A Morning's Work: Medical Photographs from the Burns Archive & Collection 1843-1939","review":"definitely worth the price tag.

While that book discussed the specifics of Orthodox doctrine, it did so in a somewhat vanilla manner. The Orthodox Church is meant to be a very basic overview. This book, while not going into the depths of thought of people like V. Lossky or St. Justin Popovich, goes a bit deeper than The Orthodox Church into the spiritual profundity of the Orthodox faith. The chapters are on Mystery, Trinity, Creator, Man, Spirit, and Prayer... all as it relates to God; all about God being these very things.This is not to say that this book is totally a theological book about God; there certainly is mention of God's creation. But this book, like Orthodoxy itself, is God-centered. While the Orthodox Church gives the basics of Orthodox doctrine and practice, The Orthodox Way does a better job at putting Orthodox doctrine and practice within their proper context. For those who have an interest in Orthodoxy, this book is a necessary read."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Bishop +KALISTOS, himself a convert to Orthodoxy, explains in plain language the basic beliefs of the Orthodox Church.

Starting with 'God as Mystery,' Bishop Ware begins to clearly and concisely explain how an ineffible Deity can also be our friend, how we can understand and yet not understand the Trinity, and how all of creation--even evil and free will--is a manifestation of God's love.If you read just one book of theology in your life, this might need to be it. It is, in the very real sense, a revelation for Christians, and a call to those still seeking.Deep theologians will find this volume too much of an overview. It doesn't have 500 pages on the history of the filoque clause or the relationship between Eastern monasticism and modern materialism. But Ware does reference a surprising variety of sources. You'd expect the Sayings of the Desert Fathers or quotes from St. Simeon the New Theologian in a book with this title.

But don't take my word for it, do ask an orthodox clergy member too!Christ is risen!"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"This book is one of two commonly read books on the Eastern Orthodox Church. While the other,The Orthodox Church: New Edition, deals with more of the historical development of and life within the Church,The Orthodox Wayfocuses instead on the doctrine and theology of the Church itself.It is a weightier read thenThe Orthodox Church: New Edition, and contains frequent quotations from Scripture, Church Fathers, and even pseudepigraphal writings and non-Orthodox theologians such as C.S. Lewis on occasion. In particular, Met. Kallistos ends each chapter with a short section containing longer quotations from various Orthodox Church Fathers that deal with the subject of the preceding chapter that were too large to be quoted in the main body of the chapter, which I found extremely valuable.The chapters themselves are broken down very simply, each chapter dealing with the theology of the Orthodox Church regarding a different aspect of God. This is one defining point of the book, in that it is organized around God, explaining its theology in relation to him. Thus, the chapters are entitled, \\"God as Mystery\\", \\"God as Trinity\\", \\"God as Creator\\", and so on. Each chapter it meant to build on the other, but it is entirely possible to read one alone from the rest, they do not rely on one another for context, which makes reading a chapter on its own possible. And Met. Kallistos does an excellent job of building to and proving his conclusion in each chapter. The progression of each chapter is concise and easy to follow, not bogged down by tangents or poor writing.The construction of the book itself is also very pleasant. It is a paperback, but it seems a step above the average grocery store cheaply printed volume. The binding (glue) feels unusually solid, the cover is glossy, the paper is good and the printing is extremely clear and without errors. I am impressed with the quality of the publisher, St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, when I am usually quite indifferent.In short, I highly recommend this work. It is a relatively short, well-made and well-written introduction to the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church, without any negativity against other denominations, and it could serve as a valuable reference for anyone with an interest in theology due to its excellent topical chapters which have a clear internal progression."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Bishop Kallistos has written the classic introduction to the foundation of the inner life of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.

Also, not the least important, the book's language is vibrant and engaging. After the first page, I could not put it down.I wish more Protestants pastors have read this.

Lord Jesus Christ Son of God have mercy on me a sinner."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"_The Orthodox Way_ by Bishop Timothy Ware is a brief but excellent introduction to Eastern Orthodox mysticism and doctrines. A monk recommended this book to me as a supplement to Ware's other notable introduction to Orthodoxy, _The Orthodox Church_. While _The Orthodox Church_ is an objective historical study written when Ware first converted to the Church, _The Orthodox Way_ deals with more personal theological experience. It is structured into six chapters each dealing with a different aspect of God: Mystery, Trinity, Creator, Man, Spirit, Prayer and Eternity. The chapter on \\"Mystery\\" deals with the revelatory character of man's relationship with God and the ultimate bridge that separates the creation from the creator. Men, as created beings, cannot partake or understand the Essence of God but can partake of divine, uncreated energies. God has often been described by mystics as \\"divine darkness\\" or \\"cloud of unknowing.\\" \\"Trinity\\" focuses on the Father, the Son or Logos and the Holy Spirit as the three persons of God. They are each distinct from one another yet share the same divine essence. The chapter on \\"Creator\\" describes God as being in all things-not pantheism but panentheism. God is in all things yet remains beyond all created things as well. The \\"God as Man\\" chapter focuses on Jesus Christ as Incarnate God. Ware contends that Christ not only died for our sins but also suffered along with humanity, not just in place of it. \\"God as Spirit\\" relates the Church's doctrines and experiences of the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity. The Spirit has been symbolized by a dove and flames of fire, and is described in the Bible as the \\"Breath\\" of God, because of His mysterious and intangible nature. Ware notes from example from the Gospel, the Holy Spirit revealed Jesus Christ as God, while at the same time Christ's ministry heralded the coming of the Spirit to divinely guide humanity through the Church at Pentecost. Ware elaborates further on the mystical union between humanity and Divinity in \\"God as Prayer.\\" Ware mentions the Hesychast tradition of silent, continuous prayers as well as the practice of spiritual leadership by \\"God-bearing elders\\" (starets) and \\"Fools for Christ.\\" The former guide individuals by various gifts of Divine grace, while the latter forsake all worldly comforts and possessions as a radical example of the Gospel to the faithful. Ware's concluding chapter on \\"God as Eternity\\" explains how souls in Heaven will have a dynamic relationship, one that becomes ever closer to God throughout eternity. This may sound strange but it is entirely possible because God is by definition eternal and infinite and therefore no created entity can ever totally partake of God's divine essence itself.Ware's book is not totally without controversy. For one, it draws on a lengthy number of un-Orthodox sources to prove his points (like Thomas Merton, William Blake, etc.) and supplement his dialogue, in addition to ecclesial authors whose validity have been questioned like Origen. Probably the most controversial section is where Ware discusses the nature of Satan and the fallen angels before the physical earth was created. Is it possible that Satan will be redeemed in a universal forgiveness (as was originally maintained by Origen and Gregory of Nyssa)? Does Satan serve an ulterior purpose in God's plan that is unknown to humans? According to Ware, it is possible that Satan will be redeemed (although of course not definite) because God's love is universal and unconditional. The traditional Orthodox opinion is that Satan is condemned to the lake of fire in hell at the last judgment as related in the Apocalypse. Ware also takes a positive view of Hell. Hell is not necessarily a state of total abandonment of soul by God (as has often been articulated in various theological traditions) but is a sort of \\"fire of divine love.\\" I.e., Hell is God's love experienced in a negative way but nevertheless God's love.I recommend this book as an introduction to themes in Orthodox mysticism and doctrine. There are other titles that can be recommended that explore these topics in more precise detail: _The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church_ (Vladimir Lossky) and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"This book by Bishop KALLISTOS was instrumental in bringing me to the Orthodox faith. He explains, in a clear, very C.S. Lewis-like way, who God is and what it means to know and love God. He explains what it means to be an Orthodox Christian. His love for God and the church is infectious and resonates on every page. His gentleness is apparent. Anyone who wants to know God should read this book. Anyone who wants to be a Christian the way Jesus intended should read this book, for it is true to the ancient faith and the church started by Jesus, and continued by the Apostles, in the book of Acts. (The ancient church is preserved in Eastern Orthodoxy.) I highly recommend this book and KALLISTOS' \\"The Orthodox Church.\\" These two books together will change your life and your faith."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"This book was amazing for an inquirer like myself.

You will get a solid foundation by reading this book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Let me start off by telling you what this book is and what it is not via the context I was introduced to it: It was in a systematic theology class. That is the context to which THE ORTHODOX WAY is best suited. It is distinctly a theological explination of what Orthodoxy is in terms of theological ideas and beliefs. It is not the what but rather the why. Having said that, it is an excellent condensation of Orthodox theology in reletivly easy to grasp language. This makes sense as the book was intended for those new to Orthodoxy. However, while there is some explination of ritual, this book is concerned with what the Orthodox person believes, not what he or she does. Still, it should not be passed up by one who wants an introduction to Orthodoxy. On the whole, not bad. I recomend it if you've got some spare change."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"I have read few books that have made a deeper impression. The Bishop is a true shephard. Wisdom and truth in one package. Along with C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton, Billy Graham, and John Paul II, he is a guide to \\"mere christianity\\". Whatever your denomination or \\"brand\\" of Christianity, you will benefit from time with this Master.God bless you in your journey."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Though the perspectives of Eastern Orthodox peoples have rarely received much attention in the West, there is (perhaps because of the Iron Curtain's collapse) a growing interest in The Orthodox Way as Bishop Kallistos Ware titles his fine introduction to the subject (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's seminary Press, 1993).First published in 1979, this book provides an accurate and accessible entree to the riches of Orthodoxy. Yoked with his classic The Orthodox Church, Ware's scholarly works give us the best introductions to his church.He begins by insisting that the only way to know truth about the Way is to \\"step out upon this path, commit ourselves to this way of life,\\" to discover it through a \\"living experience\\" of its reality (p. 8). Christian Faith, to the Orthodox, is less a rational system of belief than a life-giving relationship with the Holy Spirit.This insistence grows out of the Orthodox insistence that God is fundamentally Mystery. As St Gregory of Nyssa said, \\"'God's name is not known; it is wondered at'\\" (p. 16). We know little more about God than a new baby knows of the world. This is not to say we know nothing, however. We can never know God in His essence, but we can know him as we discern his energies, as He works in His world. According to St Maximus the Confessor, our knowledge of God comes \\"'from the grandeur of his creation and from his providential care for all creatures. For by this means, as if using a mirror, we attain insight into his infinite goodness, wisdom and power'\\" (p. 31). While alone in the desert, St Anthony was asked how he could find truth. In response, he said, \\"'My book, philosopher, is the nature of created things, and whenever I wish I can read in it the works of God'\\" (p. 54).What we cannot fathom concerning God's essence, such as His trinitarian nature, He must supernaturally reveal to us. The first seven Ecumenical Councils, which Orthodoxy considers doctrinally definitive, defined God as three persons in one essence. Easterners have always insisted on keeping the three persons--Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--distinct, a community within the godhead. God the Son became man. Christ's Incarnation marked a new day for humanity. In His perfection we envision our potentiality. \\"The Incarnation,\\" Ware says, \\"is not simply a way of undoing the effects of original sin, but it is an essential stage upon man's journey from the divine image to the divine likeness\\" (p. 93). Conversion, repentance, faith, are not a one-time crises but continuing steps along the Way. That journey involves an increased sharing, a participation in the very nature of God.This \\"participation\\" means, to the Orthodox, \\"deification,\\" a term which abrasively grates on Western ears. It closely resembles what we Wesleyans call \\"sanctification.\\" As Ware explains it, \\"To be deified is . . . to be 'christified': the divine likeness that we are called to attain is the likeness of Christ. It is through Jesus the God-man that we men are 'ingodded', 'divinized', made 'sharers in the divine nature' (2 Pet. 1:4). By assuming our humanity, Christ who is Son of God by nature has made us sons of God by grace. In him we are 'adopted' by God the Father, becoming sons-in-the-son\\" (p. 98).Such participation assumes man's free will. Created in God's image, we are free. By its very nature, love requires freedom. A loving God is free. To love God we must be free as well. Unlike many Western theologians, who have often slipped into an Augustinian-Calvinistic determinism, the Orthodox (from St Irenaeus of Lyons onward) have resolutely stressed the necessary human role in salvation. \\"We are to hold in balance two complementary truths: without God's grace we can do nothing; but without our voluntary co-operation God will do nothing\\" (p. 149). Human freedom derives from the real and active presence of the Holy Spirit. Where the Spirit is, there is freedom! \\"The whole aim of the Christian life,\\" says Ware, \\"is to be a Spirit-bearer, to live in the Spirit of God, to breathe the Spirit of God\\" (p. 119). Thus, \\"If the aim of the Incarnation is the sending of the Spirit at Pentecost, the aim of Pentecost is the continuation of Christ's Incarnation within the life of the Church\\" (p. 124).The reality and power of the Holy Spirit have generally been emphasized more in the East than the West. Christ's crucifixion has often been the focus of Western theology; his resurrection has generally remained central to Easterners. As St Athanasius said, \\"'The Logos took flesh, that we might receive the Spirit'\\" (p. 124). This stress on the Holy Spirit at work within us explains the interest Wesleyans (including Wesley) have taken in Orthodox thought. To understand its basic teachings, Ware's treatise gives us solid guidance."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"For anyone serious about learning the Faith as handed to the ancient Christian Church by Christ and the Apostles, this book is a must. Written in a beautiful and thought-provoking manner that does not disparage or compare with other denominations. Truly changed my life and opened doors for a deeper understanding of Christianity."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"The Orthodox Way by Bishop Kallistos Ware has been a joy to read - I would even go as far as to call it a spring of fresh water in the land of sureties. For so much of my life, I have been taught that God could be understood by our minds - we just had to study the Bible, pray a lot and bingo, we could figure everything out.And yes, if you pushed these same folks would say that it is impossible to fully understand God...yet, their actions did not follow that line of reasoning. Their actions said that people with the right education could come up with the right theology which would explain God, His actions, and the world around us.This book offered a different route.It offered a way to embrace the mystery of God without having to understand everything.Instead, we could simply relax in the greatness of an Almighty, All Loving, Graceful God. Ahhh...isn't it wonderful not to know everything? Or to have to defend God?This brings up a sad side effect of Protestantism and the Reformation of the sixteen century. In all of the fighting and the rethinking of Christianity, we effectively lost a huge part of our heritage - namely the picture of God as seen through the eyes of the Eastern Orthodox Church.I say it is time that we - believers in the West - take the time to get to know our brothers and sisters in the East. They have a rich heritage of following God and seeing things that we have never seen. This does not mean that they are perfect, for no institution or person is prefect (save One). It is just that we need their insight and wisdom as we move into a new era of history.The Orthodox Way is a great place to start.Buy it, borrow it from a library (use interlibrary loan if you have too), do what you have to - but start reading outside Protestantism. Open your eyes to the finger prints of God as He is active through out all traditions."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"This book is clearly written, specific and to-the-point on introductory Orthodox theology.

It was radically different in tone and style than The OC by Ware. The non-Orthodox quotes get annoying fast and almost silly to the extent in which they are used. Also why did he feel he quote the Gospel of Thomas (I think that's what it was) and the Gospel of Truth (gnostic?). Odd.I think a drawback for a conservative evangelical reading this book was the lack of scriptural support for the 'way' demonstrated. The book seemed to be more geared to 'liberals'.The biggest problem with the book is that I found it not to be sincere. I don't know exactly what I mean by that, but I just feel like he was holding back. I dunno."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"This guy actually quotes apocryphal Gnostic docetic gospels in this book, like \\"The Gospel of Mary\\". For an \\"Orthodox\\" Christian, that's way off. In any case, \\"Orthodoxy\\" is just another schismatic sect: it's stuck a thousand years in the past, and due to being ground under the heel of oppressive Muslim rule, it has become the equivalent: anti-intellectual, anti-philosophical, not grounded in scripture, and parochial and ethnic to the nth degree. There is no such thing as a non-ethnic Orthodox church - it's as ethnic as any religion that exists, even as ethnic - maybe more - than Orthodox Judaism. Outsiders are looked on harshly, and conversion is frowned upon. The past is worshiped for no reason other than it is old: thus the organisation is bound in a curious mix of archaisms and innovations siphoned over time from their Mahometan overlords of a millennium.Walk in to an Orthodox church and look at a list of parishioners or donors: in a Russian Orthodox Church, they all end with \\"-sky\\" and in a Greek Orthodox Church they're all \\"-opolous\\": there is no \\"melting-pot-ness\\" anywhere in Orthodoxy. It's a backwards creed, the Christian equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny, full of fractured unity - most \\"Orthodox\\" churches are not in communion with others - and a dearth of any intellectual, spiritual, or philosophical development since the demonic Gregory of Palamas garnered support against Barlaam of Calabria almost 800 years ago for the practise of \\"hesychasm\\", or a type of prayer that involves repeating mantras, like in Buddhism, combined with physical movements that are ritualised and prescribed, as in Islam, and is a form of auto-suggestion or self-hypnosis: the \\"Orthodox\\" believe that only the \\"vision of God\\" gained through this hypnosis is \\"true theology\\", and, like Islam, denounce rationality and the Enlightenment as \\"corrupted Western influences\\" and curse Saints Augustine and Thomas Aquinas for \\"leading the Catholic Church astray\\". There is no place for logic or rationality in Orthodoxy, and thus no place for development. Try to find books of Orthodox theology: there may have been 10 published in the last 50 years, half of which aren't worthy of the name. The sum total of post-Reformation Orthodox theology is smaller in size and much leaner on actual intellectual material than the Summa Theologiae of Thomas Aquinas.The argument laid down in this book is thus: the 4th Century Church Fathers used a certain language to describe God, and learned of God in a certain way. Western \\"heretics\\" like Thomas Aquinas and Augustine came along, and developed new terms borrowed from Platonic and Aristotleian philosophy to describe God, and used the rational mind (may I remind you that God gave humans a rational mind) to describe God in a way that was foreign to the Early Fathers. Because it was foreign to the Early Fathers, who knew *everything* about God, it must be false and heretical.He neglects to mention that the Early Fathers invented their own language for describing God, and, without any practical forbears, invented their own methods of coming to know Him: yet, any further developments in the science of theology must be heresy.This typifies the Orthodox position of venerating the past for the past's own sake, a sort of rosy nostalgia for pre-Turkish times. But the Orthodox, after centuries of corrupt Patriarchs appointed by the Grand Turk - a process that continues to this day, as the government of modern-day Turkey must approve the appointment of the Patriarch of Constantinople - have imbibed much of the corrupted Mahometan view of religion: the essence-energies distinction, gleaned from the writings of Al Ghazali. A hatred of any form of improvement or innovation in religion, a concept directly analogous to the Mahometan concept of \\"bidah\\". A love for the \\"glory days\\" of the past, and resting on laurels, while being completely stagnant in the present. A strict rule of fasting, and often overly-strict legalism in the context of a \\"therapeutic faith tradition\\" in the word of Timothy Ware (the author of this book).For what it is, this book tries to make the Orthodox tradition seem less backwards and archaic to modern, post-Enlightenment Western sensibilities, but in doing so, he leaves behind the \\"Orthodoxy\\" that he tries so hard to defend, slipping in to near-Gnosticism at times, quoting the Nag Hammadi library as though it was scripture and not heresy, and near-polytheism at others as he tries to defend the miserable practice of hesychasm - a prayer directly borrowed from Islam due to the years of Mahometan rule and persecution continuing to this day in Eastern Christendom - and the essence-energies distinction that is necessary to even partially validate the psychotic delusions it induces.The book is confused, as Orthodoxy itself is. I can't say I mourn the loss, as there is nothing redeeming about the curious and confused mix of Sufi Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Buddhism that comprises the oft-archaic, parochial, ethnic, intellectually and educationally bereft, oft-legalistic mish-mash of syncreticism that makes up Eastern Orthodoxy. Even an Orthodox Bishop, as the author of this book is, can't sort it out well enough to write of it convincingly as a separate and legitimate Christian religion: Orthodox theology, today, as 1000 years ago, comprises three things: 1) asserting independence from Islamic influence, 2) cursing the filioque in the Nicene Creed, and 3) attacking and cursing the Papacy. You'll find less of that in this book than most, but it still abounds.In the end, this book might make sense to a believer, but to an outsider - even a fellow Christian or Catholic like myself - it just reinforces the stereotypes of Orthodoxy, proving them to be real, and not illusory, by so often and so vehemently denying them, to no avail."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Ware covers the basic philosophies and ideas that Orthodoxy espouses and on the surface, Orthodoxy is pretty fantastic. Here is a religion that has not changed in almost 1,300 years since it's first Concil meeting! But Orthodoxy in America is just as watered down as Protestantism. Do not read this book, look at the beliefs and get Heavenly clouds in your eyes-- each Orthodox church must be evaluated by the individual. I love the beliefs of Orthodoxy, but in truth, AT MOST CHURCHES you will find just as many neurotic individuals who worship the ritual as you will at other churches who get wrapped up in legalistics. You will find priests who are as warped in modern thought as anywhere else, and while the church seems to have a good attitude toward children, their stance on women is pretty misogynistic and mothering is often a lonely endeavor with priests who glorify the struggle instead of empathise with it.Ware emphasises community but frankly, these people are not crowding G-d anymore than the other religious groups that claim to have all the answers. Save your money and get closer to G-d by going to volunteer on Sunday mornings at a local hospital or read to elders at a senior center."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"&quot;The Orthodox Way,&quot; by Bishop Kallistos Ware is the second most frequently recommended book on Eastern Orthodoxy in the English language to date, and the top book specifically on Orthodox Christian spirituality. (The number one book on Orthodoxy is his classic work, &quot;The Orthodox Church,&quot; published under his given name, Timothy Ware.I first read an earlier edition of &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; many years ago as an Evangelical Christian, shortly after I began looking into the Orthodox Church. At that time it communicated to me that something profoundly spiritual was going on in this church of &quot;smells and bells,&quot; robes and formal liturgical worship. It introduced me to the mystery of God, and made me realize that it was important to spend less energy talking about and trying to understand God, and to spend more time getting to know him in prayer. This is where I first encountered the idea that theology in the strict sense of the word is &quot;the contemplation of God himself.&quot;It was this book that explained the importance of the Trinity, not only as part of the Nicene Creed, but that God has been Trinity since before the book of Genesis, and a proper understanding of him will drive how we commune with him. My first reading introduced me to new terms and concepts: apophatic approach (saying what God is not rather than what he is), apatheia (dispassion), passion (any disordered appetite or longing that takes possession of the soul), nous (spiritual intellect), nepsis (watchfulness, sobriety and wakefulness), theosis (deified, or &quot;christified,&quot; or &quot;made sharers of the divine nature&quot; [2 Peter 1:4]), and the difference between the &quot;essence&quot; and &quot;energies&quot; of God.Now, seven years after I began &quot;checking out&quot; the Orthodox Church, and four years after coming home to Orthodoxy, I found myself rereading this volume (revised edition) and discovering how much went right over my head. This time I paid closer attention to the many quotes from liturgical texts, Church Fathers, saints, mystics, monks, historians and theologians. It made me appreciate how much Bishop Kallistos is writing from a rich tradition, that has become my tradition, and how that this Orthodox way, is The Spiritual Way. For fear that this last statement may sound sectarian, it should be noted that this volume has been endorsed by a number leaders and authors outside of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.God wants all to come to know him, and this volume can introduce the reader to a Way that is well mapped out, but sadly, not often traveled. May God grant me the ability follow this way more closely.On a closing note, at the time I write this review, Mel Gibson's film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; is in the theaters, and causing many to discuss the significance of Jesus' death on the cross. &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; has perhaps the best brief summary of what Jesus accomplished by his passion and death on the cross, not to mention his birth, life, teachings and resurrection, which are all part of the story."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"I first read this book five years ago, and I still remember how uplifting it was. I'd always experienced theology as an intellectual struggle, but this book showed me that theology can be a deep, existential experience of God. As it did so, I saw clearly why Orthodox Christianity does not suffer from the theological diseases of the West. Of course, they have their own problems, but theology isn't one of them. In short, this book revolutionized my view and experience of Christianity. Amazingly perhaps, it's had this effect on other people as well.Let me describe some other similar books, to help you find what you're looking for. Ware's book \\"The Orthodox Church\\" introduces Orthodoxy to a Western audience, briefly covering history and some of the more common misunderstandings Westerners have. Though a little dry, it's most people's first book on Orthodoxy. Another very good book by the same author is \\"The Inner Kingdom,\\" a collection of essays on various topics. In it, he doesn't cover the fundamentals of Orthodoxy, but he addresses many issues (such as environmentalism, death, confession and so on) in greater depth. And perhaps the best book on Orthodox theology is Olivier Clement's \\"Roots of Christian Mysticism,\\" which makes the heart and depth of ancient Christian tradition accessible to modern readers. Hopefully one of these books is what you're looking for!(p.s. In case you are wondering, I am not Orthodox.)"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Bishop KALLISTOS (Ware), famous for his companion volume &quot;The Orthodox Church&quot;, presents in this offering a comprehensive approach to Orthodox spirituality. While &quot;Church&quot; deals with the history, organization, structure and basic theology of the Orthodox Church, &quot;Way&quot; is concerned exclusively on the Orthodox spiritual life -- the Orthodox &quot;way&quot; of spirituality. Having said that, since Orthodox theology is in its essence mystical and closely related to spirituality, KALLISTOS' book covers much spiritual theology from the Orthodox perspective. This is not a complicated treatise for experts, but a readable, usable guide for everyone wishing to uncover the incomparable glories of Orthodox spirituality. A tremendous guide to Orthodoxy &quot;from the inside out&quot;."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"A modern day classic of the highest quality. Bishop Ware covers the absolute basics or Christian philosophy such as God as Mystery, God as Trinity, God as Creator, God as Man, God as Spirit, and God as Prayer. He gives complete and full logical basis for each teaching, belief, and action of the Orthodox, and non-Orthodox Christian.It reminds me of &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C.S. Lewis in which he tells the story of how he went from a vehement opponent of religion in general, especially Christianity, to an Anglican Christian through philosophy. Not that Ware tells the story of his conversion, but that both of them use are utmost in their philosophy which flows so naturally and purely that it couldn't just be from humans.One of the main reasons (aside from historical reasons) I converted to Christianity instead of Islam, Hinduism, Deism, etc, (the list goes on at the religions I considered, researched, etc. some more than others though) is because the first was so much more philosophical, contemplative, logical, and filled with love, while retaining the utter unattainable, unknowable, and unfathomable greatness of God. It was as if everthing just clicked together, the entire essense and meaning of the Gospels permeated and elimenated the 'contradictions' that are seen when they are viewed in a shallow, ultra legalistic and literal sense. I realized they were written to expound a meaning and essense of love, not to be a code of laws like the Qur'an is for Muslims, or the Constitution is for hicks; to be viewed in a legalistic, shallow way, taken at face value, and not having a meaning past the words on the page.All I can do is to recommend this book, if it were within my abilities I would give a copy to every person I meet and bid them read it again and again and again"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"I was on my way to becoming Orthodox when I first read this book; by the time I completed it, I had no doubt that being Orthodox is the &quot;way&quot; I want to live my life. Fr.

Often, when reading various passages, I felt that this book should be re-named \\"The Christian Way\\" because of the orthodox truths presented. REMEMBER: \\"orthodox\\" is an adjective \\"Orthodox\\" is an important branch of Christianity (and one of the most ancient one).While this book is not a systematic theology of the Orthodox Christian Faith, it does expound on a lot of the beliefs held in common by all Christians and by orthodox Christianity. The author discusses various ways of looking at God or understanding God:1. God as Mystery2. God as Trinity3. God as Creator4. God as Man5. God as Spirit6. God as PrayerEpilogue: God as EternityEach chapter has descriptive sub-chapter titles, plenty of references, and ends with a compilation of sayings and words of wisdom. A complete and extensive bibliography, list of authors, and subjects reflect the depth of Bishop Kallistos Ware's writing.For those of you who may be intimidated by the word \\"Orthodox\\" in the title, I would mention that the style of Kallistos Ware is non-polemical, but rather padagogical and inspirational. A great companion to this book would be the \\"Orthodox Church\\" by Timothy Ware (name before becoming bishop) or Daniel B. Clendenin two books on Eastern Orthodoxy."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"If anyone has read Ware's book, The Orthodox Church, then this book is a must read. For those who haven't read Ware's introductory work on Orthodoxy, this book will still be enlightening and rewarding.Bishop Ware's main purpose in this book is to introduce the reader to the more salient and deeper teachings of the Orthdox Christian faith. Ware begins by arguing that God is an ineffable and incomprehensible mystery that cannot be understood by the human mind. This squares well with traditional Eastern teaching, but not so well with Western paradigms. The Orthodox believe that God's Essence and Uncreated Divine Energies are two distinct and separate concepts, whereas the West, following after Augustine, believe that God's essence and energy are one and the same. Therefore, the Orthodox believe that God in His essence is completely mysterious and unknowable by man, but God's energies may be perceived and understood. Also, the Orthodox employ a different method in order to understand and know God called the apophatic approach. This method states that one can know something about God by understanding what God is not. I think this is a valuable method and one that needs to be utilized more by Christians of a Western mindset.Next Ware deals with the traditional Orthodox understanding of God as Trinity. Ware argues that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in essence but consist as three separate persons. Nothing really new or groundbreaking here, but Ware does an admirable job of defending the traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity. The area where many will disagree with him is on the issue of the procession of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox believe that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as Jesus says in John 15:26, whereas the West holds that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Ware argues that to hold that the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son can have disastrous consequences by leading one to confuse the distinctive characteristics possessed by each Divine person. Also, he believes that since such an idea was a later unauthorized addition to the creed, and not argued for by the Eastern Fathers of the Church it is to be rejected. Finally, Ware deals with the subject of God as creator and God in relation to man. Once again, one won't find to much disagreement between traditional Eastern teaching and Western teaching, but there are a few differences. The Orthodox have a completely different understanding of original sin. They believe that mankind is not guilty of Adam and Eve's sin since they can only be guilty of that transgression, but that we all bear the consequences of their disobedience. Since the human race exists as a corporate solidarity Ware argues, mankind suffers evil, pain, death and sin because we are related to and descend from Adam and Eve.Lastly, Ware deals with the subject of God as man and God as Spirit. Ware shows why the Incarnation was an absolute necessity because of the sinfulness and fallen nature of mankind. He speaks of the redemptive significance of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and here is where Ware goes off the beaten track by hinting that maybe even Satan and the fallen angels will eventually be redeemed. I believe that Scripture seriously mittigates against such a view and leaves no doubt about the fate of Satan and his demons. Also, Ware's treatment of spiritual toll houses and the 40 journey after death are odd and are not well established teachings within Orthodoxy. In fact, such a teaching seems to have more in common with early pagan beliefs than early Christian teaching. Although the 40 days following one's death is an imporant time in Orthodoxy, the belief that one is tested and tried on a path of toll houses is not a common teaching. Overall, this book is an excellent work on the basic tenets of the Orthodox Christian faith. Although it does have some awkward elements it is still an excellent book and one that should be read by anyone interested in learning more about the Orthodox Church."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Orthodoxy can be a difficult subject for Protestants and Catholics to understand. This is due to the Western, compared to the Eastern approach in viewing Christianity. While the west generally likes things in neat rational-concrete catagories, the east is generally able to except the mystery of God and focus their efforts in that area.Bishop Kallistos Ware, a Protestant Convert to Orthodxy, has written this book in a very easy-to-read style. He writes concisely (maybe at times to concise) which does not overburden the average Western reader. I would have personnaly like a little more in-depth analysis in certain areas, but this was not his purpose. It has caused me to study some ideas even more and I think that may have been the purpose. To give a clear meaning aboutthis cherished religion, and for those who desire further study, to do so.All the chapters are well written: God as Trinity, creation, man, spirit, prayer, and eternity. At times trying to understand the view point may be difficult, but this is due to a cultural make-up in approaching philosophy and theology. An outstanding text."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"This is one of Bishop Ware's best! It is a great intro to Orthodox Theology. However, do not expect to find much history or ritual details. It is mainly an introduction, and touches on the fundamentals. Being an ex-Vineyard Church youth pastor, I especially liked his spiritual approach to theology, which seems to have been lost by most western theologians. I found myself in tears and full of the holy spirit reading this book! It's a must read! -Yes, I am an Orthodox convert."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"In this luminous volume, theology is made to sing!The Orthodox monk-bishop Kallistos Ware has given us a lovely gift, scholarly and accessible, inviting us to the loftiest of heights. God is explored under the various aspects of Mystery, Trinity, Creator, Man, Spirit, Prayer, and Eternity. Voices are summoned from the distant past and from the immediate present, from West and East; a truly &quot;catholic&quot; book, an inspiration, yes; but more, a re-vivification for those sensibilities that might be slumbering under the deadness of custom. &quot;Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light&quot; (Ephesians 5.14).Bishop Kallistos gives us an Orthodoxy that is receptive to other traditions, but mutely and benignly aware of its own excellence. He gives us a picture of the Invisible God, Who is the Source and Summit of all love, beauty, mercy, goodness, purity and truth. This is not the offering of a modish &quot;personality&quot; here to give us an absolution from every challenge, nor is it the hectoring of some reactionary suspicious of every vicissitude; no, this is a book of light and of life.We cannot think of a reason why any reader would not be grateful for the incalculably precious blessing that is THE ORTHODOX WAY."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Bishop Kallistos Ware does an excellent job of offering the reader a modern Orthodox catechism. The book presents theology in a way that is never stuffy and always enlightening. Non Orthodox readers will be impressed by the similarities of the basic trinitarian theology of the Orthodox church and other branches of Christianity whether it be Roman Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, etc. However, readers from other traditions will be challenged by the depth of mysticism in Orthodoxy and the emphasis on a serious relationship with God this side of heaven. Eastern Orthodoxy has a message for the rest of Christianity and this book delivers it well."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"Excellent book.

After getting through the first chapter, I decided to get my own copy. It is a very well written book that will affirm one's faith and is very helpful in explaining Christian Beliefs in layman's language. Many of the explanations are very inspiring, and for me makes reading it necessary for my own faith. Very helpful in explaining the differences between the Orthodox and other Christian denominations; these are minor to me and again help to reinforce my own beliefs. If you get your own copy, I suggest getting a highlighter as you will want to have key passages stand out for future reference.

Born in Great Britain, Bishop Kallistos is able to speak directly to his readers in English, which becomes an important and useful consideration as the issues become increasingly sophisticated. As one reads his books, it becomes abundantly clear that this is a man who posses a prodigious intellect and a warm heart. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese (website) has a streaming video of an interview with the Bishop that is definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"As an inquirer into Orthodoxy, I have misgivings, but also tremendous respect for Orthodox teaching. Kallistos Ware Does a marvelous job of explaining and defending some of Orthodoxy's beliefs and practices that differ from those familiar to us western Christians. The only problem is that he strays even from Orthodoxy occasionally and interjects his own approach as 'the way'. For example, in the section dealing with Hesychasm I found a problem. The way a local Orthodox priest explained the idea to me, it seems that most Orthodox teachers regard the practice as A way whereby SOME (mostly monks and ascetics) draw closer to God. It is a very deep and inward sort of prayer, but it is not the ONLY kind of prayer and certainly not the ONLY way to a spiritual life. In fact. the Church encourages great caution with this method, and it is generally agreed that those who wish to practice it should go so under the direction of a qualified guide. Mr. Ware does not explain this, and almost makes it sound like it is THE way, and ALL orthodoxy means when it talks about prayer...In the section on prayer Bishop Ware doesn't even talk about ordinary, rational prayer, and I found it very confusing until I talked with my local priest. I'm not partial to Mystical practices in general, and when I find this particular practice being held up as THE way, as apposed to A way (as seems to be the true teaching of the church), I find myself discouraged.That said, it will help you to understand the idea behind Hesychasm, and other distinctively Orthodox ideas, worth reading, but not a perfect Catechism for the Orthodox faith."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Way","review":"A truly great book! One problem, however, is the emphasis sometimes placed on Origen. While most of Origen's work is considered &quot;Orthodox,&quot; he was later declared a hereitic for some of his later teaches.

While many use his ideas, these days, he was the first to conceive the idea as it is used throughout fantasy fiction. Just as some of his books slowly unfold to show you ideas from different angles, so does he slowly reveal the multiverse. Read this and the three books in the War Amongst the Angels series and you will see what I mean. Moorcock was also the author who predicted Black Holes and a whole different cosmology to go with them, he spoke of the multiverse in terms of branches or branes on a tree, and science has continued to prove him right throughout his career. Moorcock is far more than a writer of fantastic adventure stories, but neither does he reject his own relish for the stuff and as a result he gives us books which, as adult, we can enjoy more and more. The literal minded consumer of mass production fantasy is probably going to need a lot more explanation than Moorcock provides. You just have to trust him, jump in anywhere, and let him carry you on a wild tide of adventure, character, philosophy and more! The ending of this sequence is famous. So it should be. There is nothing else as good, at least since Melmoth the Wanderer! (Actually, it's better than Melmoth the Wanderer)."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"A very good book, same with the first Elric. I can't rate it perfectly though as some of the stories have parts which sort of clash with my sense of taste ;) Though even then, if the elements seem bizarre to me, they fit in with Moorcock's multiverse and help paint it better. And some of the stories are simply excellent.I've introduced several friends (who normally don't read) to Elric and they've read the first text as well as the second.

I would love to see Michael team up with a new author, M.V.Cox, who wrote Souls Eternal. Funny they seem to have many passions in commmon. I reviewed Souls Eternal and found it the work of a genius.I will continue to read Michael Moorcock,but I would love to see him team up with Michael V.Cox.

On the plus side, this and the companion volume (Elric: Song of the Black Sword; Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5) are the easiest way to get all the Elric stories in one place. Although created on an editor's suggestion that Moorcock imitate Robert E. Howard's Conan, Elric is primo adolescent fantasy stuff, probably the main inspiration for Neil Gaiman's Goth icon Sandman and countless other fantasy characters.On the down side this is a strikingly unattractive edition, with a horrible cover painting (particularly compared to the phenomenal paintings created by Michael Whelan and Brom for previous editions) and populated by ugly, ill-conceived sketches. Moorcock has retitled, rearranged, and even rewritten parts of his own series, which inspires the same don't-mess-with-my-childhood reaction as the Greedo-shoots-first-now reworking of Star Wars. And while the original six-book series was famously written in under two weeks per volume, it possessed an adolescent urgency that made it seminal - a quality sorely lacking from the equally-hurried but uninspired prose of recent Elric novels The Fortress of the Pearl and The Revenge of the Rose, which are shamelessly pastiched into the original series, diluting and sullying the collection.Ick. Save your pennies for the individual paperbacks, still in print with a clever jacket design. Or - better - track down the original paperback editions with Michael Whelan covers.ADDENDUM: As of 2008, the best way to get all the Elric stories in one place is the series beginning withElric: The Stealer of Souls (Chronicles of the Last Emperor of Melnibon&eacute;, Vol. 1)."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"This book finishes the Elric saga wonderfully. Moorcock is in top form here as all the various themes of the stories come together here in one gloriously painful coruscation of words. Elric is THE dark fantasy series and this proves why.Here's an analysis of each story individually:The Sleeping Sorceress: Continuing the line of events set into motion by &quot;The Singing Citadel,&quot; Elric searches for Theleb K'aarna for revenge. Also sandwiched in here is Elric's view of the quest of the tower of &lt;insert long impossible-to-remember name here&gt; with Corum and Erekose. This view of it has much more impact on the Champion in question than it did on Corum, and makes for some wonderful character and plot development. Overall, the diverse elements synthesize into one fascinating whole. It even has Tanelorn, and that can't be bad.Revenge of the Rose: This is much, much more recent than the rest of the Elric stuff, but it still fits in seamlessly. This is the best side-story Moorcock's ever written, which is saying a lot. It develops Elric's growing discontent with his current solutions to his problems and sets it against a rather amazing adventure story and a tasty bit of Melnibonean background. Combining that with the trademark bits of philosophical food for thought (and, for the less cerebral parts of our minds, cool battles and spells), this story wonderfully fills in a gap in the saga that we didn't even know existed before we read this.The Stealer of Souls: Compared to the longer, more epic stuff, this isn't as great, but its still a nice little Elric story with some good developments, including a meeting we've been waiting for: the other Melniboneans.Kings in Darkness: This is probably the weakest story in the book, and just as well that it's pretty short, but the ending and the storyline with Zarozinia is worth the rest of it, as it does give the one thing we all wanted him to have to Elric, for at least a little while.The Caravan of Forgotten Dreams: This is a prelude to the end, setting up the idea that all isn't as nice and cozy as it seems. As a prelude, its not as good for the actual story as what it hints and sets up, but as that it's quintessential.Stormbringer: This is the point of all the rest you've read. Everything hoped for and feared comes to pass, and then some. All the @#$% hits the fan in this one and the Balance gets thrown out the window in this narrative. The internal and external conflicts finally get resolved, one way or another, and Elric takes part in one final quest that you would never have thought of, but it makes perfect sense. This is a darkly shining piece of literature, a true triumph, and this sums up everything the Elric Saga stood for. The imagery, characterization, and plot are all as good as Moorcock ever was then. I sat awe-struck for fifteen minutes after the final pages, too moved to move(that's a bit awkward, but oh well)."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"Not really, but somewhere there's a great tagline for an ad campaign for this book waiting to be used. Michael Moorcock has a gigantic catalog of novels and short stories, many of them dealing with his Multiverse concept, in which Law and Chaos constantly battle and a fellow known as the Eternal Champion tends to help sort it all out, with varying results. Back in the last decade White Wolf and Moorcock took most of the stories/novels, grouped them by character and concept and then put them out as a series of collections. This is the eleventh of those and second featuring Elric, perhaps Moorcock's most famous creation. While not my personal favorite of Moorcock's many characters (that honor goes to Jerry Cornelius, who I find has more personality) Elric definitely has a loyal following and his stories did a lot to nurse the then fairly low-key epic fantasy genre. Basically, Elric is a weak albino from a very old race that is dying out (and is quite evil) but he carries the magical sword Stormbringer that likes to suck the souls out of people (though Moorcock never says where the souls go, into the sword or straight to hell?), thus giving the sword and Elric vitality. Unfortunately, Elric has a very rough life and that makes him a somewhat dour person, since he's constantly caught between Law and Chaos (technically he's on Chaos' team though he swaps sides often). The stories in this volume depict the end of the Elric saga, when the war between Law and Chaos heats up on Elric's world and finally threatens to come to a conclusion. Moorcock's type of fantasy takes some getting used to, with a lot of really odd place names and bizarre monsters (some sound like they're straight out of Lovecraft) as well as some definitely odd situations. Elric himself seems to act more as an observer in most of these stories, trying to keep out of trouble. The earlier stories are typically the most formulaic (though brilliant for anyone else, as the cliche goes), since Elric generally has to fight Someone Bad and often saves the day by casting a spell or invoking the aid of some Old Elemental Spirit or just wading through crowds of people with his magical intelligent sword (oh by the way, it wants to kill all his friends too). Moorcock has definite style and flair when executing this kind of material but if you read them all at once there can be a definite sameness about them, where Elric just mopes and mopes and goes &quot;wow is me&quot; for chapters on end before getting attacked and summoning dragons or something to save him. The later stories (and Revenge of the Rose, which was written later) are much better, especially when they deal with the Multiverse directly, because the ideas and action and giant battles just keep coming, until it becomes a kind of sensory overload and toward the end of Stormbringer (the last story) everything gets all weird and metaphysical and it's just great. Moorcock can be lauded for bringing a mature sensibility to fantasy (Elric's a dour fellow but he has his passions) and for all of Elric's moping, he's far more memorable than most other fantasy characters. I won't go as far to say that these are his best work (again, I like the Cornelius stuff better and I haven't read Mother London or the Pyat novels yet) but for lovers of fantasy it's basically essential (if you can find them, the White Wolf editions went out of print and apparently command a high price, they must have been rare . . . the British editions are still available, I think) and no matter what you think of his style it's clearly one of the more original concepts in a genre that feels fit to merely repeat the work of a certain hobbit-loving author over and over again. Moorcock stands on his own and to understand fantasy at all, these books are required reading."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"I like the cover of this edition! Elric's inner torments are far more subtly shown than in some of the frankly crude pictures I have seen which give the impression that Elric is some sort of skinnier Conan. Elric is a complex, sensual man -- someone who has gone through unknowable torments simply to learn the sorcery he possesses -- a genius and a warrior -- but also a man trying to come to some understanding and moral balance within himself. This is all reflected by his internal struggles and the struggle with his living sword, which leads him into places he doesn't want to go! This is about every kind of adventuring and, for all its kind of formalised violence, it is Moorcock's humanity which blasts through all the vast cosmic landscapes and mighty tragedy and makes this deservedly one of the great classics of its kind. It deserves its place with Tolkien and Peake and is, with them, one of the cornerstones of modern fantasy. Like Tolkien, this is high adventure, with quests and dragons, but like Peake it is the story of tormented individuals looking for understanding and meaning in a seemingly chaotic environment. Start anywhere -- but save Stormbringer for last! Multiples of everything seem to be Mr Moorcock's stock in trade! TT"},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"I was told by a friend that you had to trust Moorcock. Not only do his stories unfold rather like life, with new information coming in from new angles all the time, but they march towards the greatest dramatic conclusion in all fantasy. And this is where you'll find it, in STORMBRINGER, the final volume. You will be mightily rewarded with one of the most powerful literary fantasy stories you've ever picked up. And once you start reading him, it becomes fascinating -- because no writer has written so much at such a high level of literary ambition. Read his Jerry Cornelius stories, his Pyat novels or books like Mother London and you will know why Moorcock got the Grand Master award and why he has been winning prizes since his career began."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"There are some books that, once you've finished, you have to put down and ponder the moment upon. This is one of those books. I find myself flipping through those last few pages, reading again what excited me so much. I think it would be a waste for anyone to have read the first half of Elric's tale and miss out on the ending to it."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"Elric of Melbone is a dark anti-hero who was portrayed perfectly in The White Wolf(WW). His dark and sorcerous soul was given solid definition. This book, Stealer of Souls(SOS), was an extra-dimensional nightmare that was fortunately easy to escape. In WW the journey of Elric had an undeniable flow that all great fantasies possess, but in SOS there was no firm plot that a reader could enjoy. Try as I might I could not stay interested in Elric's blundering about the Cosmos in search of Lord Knows What. The many small subplots could not generate enough concern about the characters. As hard as it was for me to do I could not finish this tedious tale of a once proud prince who has been reduced to a traveling sideshow."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"I totally disagree with the previous reviewer. For me the later Elric books show maturity, wonderful writing, and deeper understanding of Elric's character. Revenge of the Rose has beautiful prose, much of it rhyming when you start to realise it! I found Fortress of the Pearl a little disappointing -- but it sets the scene for the new Dreamthief's Daughter, which if anything is the best Elric since Stormbringer. It also develops and matures its themes. Of all popular and prolific writers only Moorcock and King seem constantly to be engaging with the modern world through their fantasy stories, maturing their own world views, offering us their consideration. You don't get that from many big-selling popular writers and we should be deeply grateful for the ones we have! There's scarcely a writer in the genre who doesn't acknowledge Moorcock's influence and his extraordinary and constant originality (I know because I have my own debt to him) and many of us thought it rather belated of the World Fantasy Convention to wait until last year to make him a Grand Master, since the genre owes as much to Moorcock as it does to Tolkien. And Moorcock offers a rare maturity only found in a few writers like the outstanding Gene Wolfe, whose work is equally interesting, equally ambitious. Most of this stuff, like LOTR, was written before there WAS a fantasy genre and to a degree it has been buried under its imitations. In my view Moorcock is an incredibly underestimated writer, except in his literary fiction, which continues to get great reviews in England but which we hardly ever see over here."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"When I read the last page of the series as a teenager many many years ago. The only thing I could do was throw the book in the air and roll off my bed. I lay there in a mind expanding daze for at least an 30 minutes! The ending took me totally by surprise, yet it fits the entire theme of the book and makes perfect mind boggling sense. This series is a must read. Elric is a tragic hero which rises to the level of the ancient Greek classics. This series will transform your worldview and shake the very foundations of your being."},{"Title":"Elric: Stealer of Souls (The Tale of the Eternal Champion, Vol 11)","review":"I have read much in these reviews and fan websites to led me to believe that I was about to read the Holy Grail of Fantasy and I was understandably dissapointed. Those expectations are much to high. I was intrigued by the character and was immersed in the universe so adeptly created by our illustrious author. All the tales leading up to Stormbringer were at times quick paced, brooding, and always fascinating. Mr. Moorcock has a knack for character development but I found Stormbringer to be at times awkward and unwieldly. Almost as if he tried to pour too much into one novel. I have to believe that if he were to write the end of the Elric Saga today it would be much different and a little more developed. My greatest dissapointment was the end..the almost melodramatic line &quot;I was always more evil than you&quot; sounded horribly stiff after so much wonderful writing. I put the book down and felt empty. It was just too abrupt a finish for something that was so grand in scale. I would encourage anyone with a taste for fantasy to read the Elric saga but to judge for themselves whether or not it is worthy of all the acclaim given."},{"Title":"Palms To the Ground","review":"Palms To The Ground is the sort of gem of a novel that will appeal to readers of all ages. I'm 34 and I loved it so much that I've bought copies for the young people in my life and also for my best friend.Amy Stolls writes with clarity, empathy, and humor. Palms to The Ground makes me wish that she was writing when I was a kid!"},{"Title":"Palms To the Ground","review":"An only child, Calman has been seeing a therapist since he was seven, and is now about to travel from his Boston home to Washington to meet his pen pal. His encounters with an unusual cast of very different characters and potential friends will bring him more awareness of his own life and personality than therapy could ever afford him."},{"Title":"Palms To the Ground","review":"Amy Stolls has a strong voice, and in her first novel she manages to muscle her way into her readers' heads. Calman Pulowitz is a teenage Jewish boy with a weak physique and a host of psychosomatic difficulties. His family invests in therapy, he has an addiction to Pepto Bismol, and an attachment to objects. After his pen pal Rizzy invites him to stay out in the rural wops of Walla Walla, Washington, he reluctantly takes part in a series of adventures with his new companion.Palms to the Ground is not a conventional youth novel - Stolls doesn't leave you with cliff hangers at the end of each chapter, and her characters are rife with idiosyncrasies. But stick with her, because her tone is reminiscent of the regional twang of Carson McCullers, chronicling the trials of the Dickson family with irony, humor, and just a touch of empathy. In fact, the adventures are really just an excuse around which to build episodes of exaggerated chaos, as mothers and children spar, fathers duck their heads, and local characters drop in to drink the house dry.Stolls is, so the clich&eacute; goes, one to watch in the future. She has a keen eye, a deft touch, and a ticklish pen. A little more action may have moved the plot along a little, but when it comes to the nasty confrontation everyone has to face with adolescence she is spot on."},{"Title":"Palms To the Ground","review":"The characters and descriptions took this 64-year-old reader on a ride through 50 years of time. Ms. Stolls brought me from delight to anger to sympathy and around again. She's a fine wordsmith with a \\"roll-it-up-a-notch\\" sense of humor.Lenore Paddock, Montville, NJ"},{"Title":"Palms To the Ground","review":"This is the kind of book you read on a plane and wish you'd had at thirteen. It's funny and sad and cool. It's about being a teenager with whacked out parents that really love you. It's about being over-protected and that's the name of parenting in the 21st century. Most of the joys/traumas of being a kid that I experienced just aren't available to my kids: Camping without adults, disappearing for hours, riding one's bike into forever, breaking limbs, exploring abandoned buildings. We live in a safe protected world. Calman, our main man, gets to go on a summer trip to meet his pen pal who turns out to be a girl. They get to live life outside his safe world and he gets to grow up, and it isn't all fun, but it's all good in the end. It's a life of gritty surprises. Amy Stolls is a good writer and you feel you're in safe hands with this book. You know your teen will read it and roll their eyes at you, and that's good too. It's a book either gender would enjoy equally, a rarity for YA. Give it to your kid. He or she will thank you for it. Kate Gale"},{"Title":"Palms To the Ground","review":"A funny and heart-warming tale of two penpals caught up in the space between childhood and adolescence. The nebbish Calman and the irrepressible Rizzy come to pitch-perfect life, not to be forgotten in their bittersweet complexities. Perfect for tomboys and nerds and everyone in between who loves a good story -- no doubt the best novel ever set in Walla Walla, Washington. And for older readers, it will take you back to the time of first heartbreak and the sudden realization that you are not too far away from adulthood."},{"Title":"Love Me, Love My Broccoli (An Avon Camelot Book)","review":"I am a 50-something attorney, vegan vegetarian, whose wife (also vegan vegetarian) bought this book for our kids (Guess what - vegetarian). She left it on the diningroom table, and I picked it up and read it. I couldn't put it down.I love Chloe Mankewicz, and I wish that she had been at my high school when I was there. This book is surprisingly engaging to someone who hasn't been in high school in more than thirty years, and who, by all rights should not be interested in a book like this. Nonetheless, I recommend this to any age group. It is a great story, well-told, and if your heart isn't aching for Chloe at the end, then you probably don't have a heart.And the book has a message. Several of them. Some which the author may not have intended, in the wake of the Colombine disaster. Being 14, bright and dedicated to a cause can be tough business, and the classic battle between the brains and the jocks can have unexpected outcomes.I think this book provides a lot of guidance to kids who are there now. If you are young, into animal rights and vegetarianism, this book gives you a lot of positive affirmation.If you are not, this book may change your way of thinking.I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Love Me, Love My Broccoli (An Avon Camelot Book)","review":"This was one of my favorite books! I am a vegetarian, and thisbook helped me keep faith, when my friends would say negative thingsabout me. Everyone should read this book even if you are not avegetarian!"},{"Title":"Love Me, Love My Broccoli (An Avon Camelot Book)","review":"The heroine, Chloe, is a dedicated (perhaps overzealous) animal rights activist who falls for Brett, a jock who does not share her values. She finds she is so busy with Brett that she has less and less time for her activism--and then Brett pressures her to give up her animal rights work altogether because he is concerned for her safety.The dilemma Chloe faces will be familiar to many vegetarian women; indeed, many girls and women period. It is inevitable that relationships change us, but how much change is too much?Unlike many books of the genre, the book does not have a simplistic happily ever after ending. Chloe's problems, including the tension between Brett and her beliefs, her relationship with her (noncustodial) mother, her faltering friendship with a fellow activist, and her grandmother who suffers from dementia, are not magically solved. What we do get is a realistic, bittersweet ending, with some hope for the future."},{"Title":"Love Me, Love My Broccoli (An Avon Camelot Book)","review":"Chloe is a teenage animal rights activist. And when she meets jock football-playing Brett, it's a case of opposites attract. But eventually, her idealism and Brett's desire to have Chloe be less of a political frebrand come into conflict and Chloe has to choose what is really important to her.This book was great, with observations about the difficulties of being a teen vegetarian and a strong-willed and likeable main character. The plot is multi-dimentional, with many subplots. This makes the book very exciting and interesting, holding your attention til the last page. I recommend it to any teenage girl, even non-vegetarian ones (like me)."},{"Title":"Love Me, Love My Broccoli (An Avon Camelot Book)","review":"While the author had a good story idea, the characters and their behavior seemed very unrealistic to me.

Besides the briefest of introductions, she augmented each photograph with narrative in three short sections: A paragraph of historical context entitled \\"Timeline\\"; a concise description of the image; and a few words from the photographer or other person closely associated with the photo.Glancing through the pages one can appreciate the easy and pleasurable arrangement of the photos and text. Each photo and accompanied text are placed on large, well balanced, two-page spreads. There are one hundred of these, starting with a 1898 photo of the Turin Shroud and ending with a 1997 \\"mosaic of pixels\\" of the Mars Pathfinder.The collection is one hundred photos short, but very rich. From Texas to South Africa, ayatollahs to lesbian lovers and from Buchenwald to the Moon, the photographs are beautiful, moving, telling, compelling and all the superlatives one associates with the rarest moments of photojournalism. There is a combination of history and poetry in images of people, places and events that we all recognize, and also those that we do not but want to. They convey the things that please, annoy, educate, repulse and move us, so, they make a superb pictorial account of twentieth century history.One can see the author's own aesthetic sensitivity in the layout of the book and in her choice of large-format black and white photos in combination with small color photos of photographers or other relevant images. While avoiding the Technicolor look of glossy magazines, she succeeds in presenting a subdued phantasmagoria that moves and informs her audience."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Bacteria (Comstock Book)","review":"Betsey Dexter Dyer has written a book in &quot;A Field Guide to Bacteria&quot; that, once it is opened, you wonder why no one has written before. The premise is so obvious that it seems to have been totally overlooked! Location, visual appearance, activity, smell and other characteristics that do not always require a high-powered microscope can be used to identify bacterial colonies! Fortunately the &quot;wait&quot; for such a book (which, until now, we probably did not even know we needed) has been worth it because Dyer has done an excellent job of writing it! In this book she introduces the reader to the teaming microflora of bacteria of earth in a way that cannot help but increase the number of people who appreciate these invisible true owners of the planet.The huge bacterial flora is well covered and the author's grasp of the multitudinous habitats where bacteria live and thrive, sometimes under the most extreme conditions, is impressive. Everything from sulfur bacteria, halophytes and causes of desert varnish to internal symbionts and more are covered in fascinating detail. Dyer has opened up a whole new way of looking at the world that give us a more accurate view of the pervasiveness of the tiny. Not all bacteria are out to get us by any means and this book provides a much needed balance to the &quot;killer bacteria&quot; usually featured in popular literature.A necessary book for amateur and even professional microbiologists, it will also, I think, provide a good read for anyone interested in the natural world as it really is."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Bacteria (Comstock Book)","review":"While this book is intended for the general public, and is certainly accessible to those without microbiological training, don't pass it up even if you have microbiological training -- in many ways it is a condensed version of Balows' _The Prokaryotes_, and likewise quite useful for reminding oneself what obscure groups of bacteria do &quot;for a living&quot;.Of course, Dyer's book is a lighter, more amusing read than Balows', and chock full of the sort of anecdote that is fun to slip into a lecture -- such as the explanation of Charles Dickens' cryptic reference to a &quot;bad lobster in a dark cellar&quot; in _The Christmas Carol_, and the fact that the oddly named cyanobacterium _Nostoc_ was named by the alchemist Paracelsus!In addition, I was pleasantly surprised that despite identifying herself on the very first page as a former student of Lynn Margulis, Dyer doesn't try to defend her mentor's continued rejection of the discoveries of molecular phylogeny, but even goes so far as to praise Woese and Sogin by name! It is refreshing to finally see a work of popular science that acknowledges how the pioneers of molecular phylogeny have changed microbiology over the last couple decades."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Bacteria (Comstock Book)","review":"This fun and informative book starts with the brilliant idea of identifying bacteria by their MACROscopic field marks (colors, smells, effects) rather than by microscope. You would never believe how many bacteria one can identify by &quot;field marks&quot; alone, and readers will be surprised at how much fun the identification and discussion of bacteria can be. The author's execution of the guide -- her excellent and enthusiastic writing style and her choices of which bacteria to discuss -- makes this the rare field guide that one can read from cover to cover. The book discusses everything from bacteria in hot springs to those that make cheese or pickles, to those in animal intestines. There are beautiful (yes, beautiful) color plates, great suggested experiments, and guides to finding different kinds of bacteria. The author makes the subject interesting, funny and captivating -- and she uses exclamation points without irony!

Not that I have that much experience but only that I would think most women know everything she imparted. There is no real know how or instructions on how to get things done but just some general verbage on what should be done. Not that it's bad but I think if you have had one or two relationships already then this book is not the one for you. There are several other books on becoming a good lover and partner that far outshine this one. I believe it sells because of the novelty associated with the author and if you like the little juicy tidbits she throws out here and there you will probably enjoy the book.

Most of her ideas are logical: Take care of yourself once you have a man - don't let yourself go. Understand that, as unfair as it may be, that men want you to look as good as when you met, even though he may have lost his hair and gained weight!These women are temporary fantasies. They don't complain about the kids, their jobs, the housework or anything else when these men show up. It's unfair, yes, but that is why the men are willing to pay to escape reality for a little while. Sometimes, men keep a mistress for the same reasons.Personally, I wasn't offended by the book at all. In fact, it gave me a few ideas on how to spice up my love life BEFORE my man strays!"},{"Title":"Just Between Us Girls: Secrets About Men from the Mayflower Madam","review":"Frankly, I read it for purely prurient interests, expecting lots of juicy sex tips. I was amazed at the depth of the insights provided.I used to think that anyone who strays from a monogamous relationship is a cad, but after reading this book, I now see that both partners may be to blame.I am recently married and I shared many parts of the book with my husband. We were laughing out loud at the humor and descriptiveness in the book. The author is clever and quite funny. We were also amazed at the odd combination of high brow and low brow in her escort business.Since it is considered the oldest profession, there must be something compelling about it. I found it fascinating to consider why men indulge.

It was only 50 cents so I got it. Well, should you come across it you can safely skip it. Ms. Barrows pretty much uses this book as a platform to defend herself and explain why she turned to pimping. That's okay, but wasn't that the purpsoe of her first book? So after re-reading her story again in Between Us Girls you finally get the meat of the book and what do you get? Not much. Mostly, Barrows argues that in order to hold on to your man you have to act like a $500 a night call girl in the bedroom. You must be on guard, on your toes and ready to perform at a moments notice. To back this up she points out that some of her old clients actually left thier wives and families to marry her girls. I wonder how long those marriages lasted? Should you take Ms. Barrow's advice? That's up to you but ask yourself this: If you have to do turn yourself into a geisha in order to hold onto your man is he really worth it?"},{"Title":"Just Between Us Girls: Secrets About Men from the Mayflower Madam","review":"Okay so I was pretty young when I read this book (17) but seriously, it was very, very educational.

She finds a fixer-upper and becomes an expert on household repairs. Her son straightens out and becomes involved in wholesome activities. Jake meets the perfect man, at least for her, and remarries.Most of the local inhabitants are law-abiding citizens with the few bad seeds known by all. Jake and her best friend Ellie visit Fay Anne Carmody, a spousal abuse victim. They knock on the door, but no one answers so they enter the house only to find Faye Anne's husband dead with his body sliced into pieces and wrapped inside butcher paper. Faye Anne claims no memory of the deed, but police believe the evidence that proves otherwise. Only Jake and Ellie assume their pal is innocent and set out to prove just that.Using local vernacular and a gothic-like atmosphere, WRECK THE HALLS turns into one of the better New England amateur sleuth tales of the year. The audience will admire and adore the wholesome protagonist while the support cast, especially her son and her friend, provide depth to a stupendously serpentine story line. Sarah Graves is a powerful mystery writer.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"Jacobia \\"Jake\\" Tiptree and her friend Ellie stumble across a dazed Faye Ann Carmody covered with blood in her house. Her husband Merle -- the town butcher who was not well liked -- is found in pieces wrapped in his own butcher paper. Faye Ann is charged with his murder but she can't remember a thing and had been drinking. Since it was widely known that Merle was abusive of Faye Ann, everyone believes she finally snapped. The police feel it's an open and shut case. Jake and Ellie don't.Then there's another death. This one appears to have been a heart attack, but Jake and Ellie feel it was murder and related to Merle's murder. With an attempted murder, things really start heating up.Christmas is just weeks away. Jake had planned to rehabilitate her old house this winter but now she's on the trail of a killer. There are so many suspects. Ellie and Jake spend their time checking each one out and eventually they end up in danger themselves.Jake is also a newlywed with a teenage son. Her ex lives in town and keeps coming to her for help with his new relationship. He is a very self-centered man.This author has created a wonderful town -- Eastport, ME -- with fabulous characters. They are very believable and act just like I would expect people in a small town to act. Her plots are always very well constructed and I have a hard time figuring out who did it and why.I have read 1 other book in this series. I highly recommend this book and the whole series. This a true cozy series.I like the friendship between Jake and Ellie that has developed. I hope the relationship of Jake and Wade is more prominent in other books. She spends more time talking to her ex in this book. I'd like to get to know her son Sam better. I think in some of the earlier books he plays a bigger part. One reason she moved to this town was to get him away from his old friends and drugs in the big city."},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"When Jacobia &quot;Jake&quot; Tiptree plans a visit to Faye Anne Carmody's house, she doesn't expect to find it covered in blood. She also doesn't expect to find Faye Anne dazed, yet alive. But she is. All looks fine, until Jake takes a trip to the butcher's shop, and finds a bunch of meat packages wrapped in brown paper in the display case. Realizing that this is unusual, Jake investigates, only to find Faye Anne's husband's, Merle, body wrapped in those little packages. Then another person is found murdered, and Jake immediately decides that it's up to her to solve the crime, instead of spending time with her family and working on rehabilitating her home. Who can get anything done during the holidays, when there's a killer on the loose?This was the first book I have ever read from &quot;A Home Repair Is Homicide&quot; mystery series, and I found it to be very enjoyable.

Jacobia and her friend Ellie couldn't have a 2-minute conversation without Jacobia going off about her problems with her house. Did I need to know about her possible skunk problems?What is Jacobia's problem with non-smoking restaurants? I'm not a health Nazi because I don't like people smoking near me.The last chapter explains all the ins and outs of the murders and their causes.

I complained about this in the Graves' first book, and it was apparently cleaned up until this book.I read half the book. And was so bored I gave up. Nothing was happening, and the plot and characters were as stark and drab as the Maine late-Fall landscape.

When Jake enters Merle's butcher shop to see who is actually dead, she finds him, neated chopped up and wrapped in butcher paper. Jake and Ellie need to find out who killed Merle, because Faye Ann is not capable of either the crime or defending herself.This was a little more grisly that the usual Graves mystery, but very good. The author introduces us to even more of the unusual characters of Eastport, and life in a Maine seaside town in winter. Very Very good mystery!!!!"},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"I am a fan of this series, and have very much enjoyed the four preceding books in it. This one, however, was a disappointment. First and foremost, the author has developed an extremely quirky use of colons. This may sound unduly fussy on my part, but the appearance of the colons is more than just a misuse of a punctuation mark: the author uses colons in this book as a substitute for appropriate paragraphing and sentence structure. The ubiquitous colons make the work read in a very fragmented manner. I prefer paragraphs and complete sentences; the colons seem almost lazy, and prevent the language from having any flow to it.Second, the characterizations and the plot were both fragmented. Like a Russian novel, numerous characters were introduced, but without enough about them to enable me to remember who they were between appearances. Perhaps this problem is related to the first one I mentioned, in that the abrupt writing style of this book distracted me from the content.I am looking forward to more books in this series. Coming out so soon after the fourth in the series, this one might have been a bit rushed (releasing it in the summer would have been infelicitous). I am more than willing to forgive this lapse in an otherwise very enjoyable series."},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"I have enjoyed each of her books.

It seemed very disjointed at times. I also was puzzled by Jake's statement that her ex husband(Victor) was almost 40 years old-yet the couple have a college aged son and she mentioned that she spent her honeymoon in the e.r. waiting room while her husband was performing neurosurgery(at 20-22 years old!!)-quite a stretch, even if he was a genius. Maybe it was an editing mistake, but this and other inconsistencies in the book added to the lack of flow. Hopefully the next book in the series will have the warmth and continuity the previous books had."},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"The sense of place is so beautifully drawn in this clever little cozy, that I'll excuse the mystery that gets rather lost going down dark alleys and dashing about chasing red herrings in the sleet and the snow. The language is as crisp and cool as the Maine winter. The landscape on the island of Eastport in Washington County, is simply wonderously set out - and is a place I actually was blessed to spend some time last summer. Having a peek during the chill of winter had me turning up the air conditioning, brrrr! Jacobia and Ellie are quirkily charming characters, who easily become very real and dear friends. A fun approach to life and a witty sense of humor come through each page. The rest of the population seems to be made up of hard working, salt of the earth, good to the bone locals -OR seamy, unsavory, irritating characters (including a loathsome ex-husband who isn't to be completely written off). Even the animals have their charms. Well, not the skunk.I will absolutely have to have some more of Jake &amp; Ellie, and thoroughly look forward to a return visit. Actually, Ms. Graves nearly had me packing up for a more extended stay on the coast of Maine, to join my dear friend who &quot;ran away&quot; almost exactly like Jacobia did."},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"A terrific mystery with lots of twists and turns, keeping you guessing until the final pages.

Read it for my book club over the holiday."},{"Title":"Wreck the Halls : A Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery (Home Repair Is Homicide Mystery Ser.)","review":"Christmas is coming to Eastport, Maine, and winter has already arrived. Jacobia \\"Jake\\" Tiptree, who moved from New York City when she bought a fixer-upper (an 1823 Federal in need of all sorts of serious work), has recently married local harbor pilot and gunsmith Wade Sorenson after they've been lovers for several years. Her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Victor Tiptree, has followed Jake to Eastport - supposedly for the sake of their college freshman son, Sam, but actually to resolve a professional crisis that almost destroyed him. Victor's dependence on Jake annoys her, but she tolerates him as a neighbor partly because of Sam, and partly because Eastport really does need a doctor of his caliber. Jake and her best friend, Eastport native Ellie White, are first on the scene after local wife beater and butcher Merle Carmody is murdered and chopped into body parts and packaged in his own shop. Merle's wife, Faye Ann, wakes with amnesia and with his blood all over her. Not to mention with rubber gloves on her hands, and a butcher's apron over her clothes. Why should the state investigators who show up a bit too promptly, as if they were already in the area, look at any other suspect? Open and shut case. Of course Jake and Ellie don't accept that, though. So they start their own investigation, at first aided and then hindered by Peter Christie, who was \\"seeing\\" Faye Ann before the murder but says Faye Ann broke it off.The characters and the setting for this series work their usual magic as this story plays out. The author knows what she's writing, and she does so with vivid accuracy. As a Down East coastal native myself, I feel entirely qualified to say so! The mystery has a suitable number of twists and turns, and its resolution manages to be credible without being foregone. I read this one through in an evening. Should have gone to sleep about 50 pages shy of the ending, and couldn't even consider doing so.--Reviewed by Nina M.

I loved the character and wanted to read more Moorcock, so I picked up Von Bek. Well, I did not care for Von Bek, so I picked up the Eternal Champion, which, excluding the Von Bek story, I liked. I had heard many good things about Corum and decided to give him a try. While I will not say that he is greater than Elric, he is almost as good. Corum's story is one of irony to the end. Humans take his eye and his hand, but he aids humans in their struggles and falls in love with one. She dies and the Prince with the Silver Hand collection starts up. I liked these novels and consumed them rather quickly. They are well-written and thought out and everything that happens, for the most part, is resolved. Moorcock's sense of continuity is wonderful. Corum, as are most Moorcock books, is violent and full of arrows through heads and swords through throats. If you are at all interested in dark fantasy, read Corum"},{"Title":"Corum: The Prince With the Silver Hand (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 12)","review":"While Elric remains Moorcock's most enduring charecter, Corum is the most likable. The Corum stories are also probably the best written because they were written as a series, unlike the Elric stories which were written through a 15 to 20 year time span. (The first 4 volumes of Hawkmoon are also excellent.)Corum, like Elric is a tragic Hero, but is much more likeable and really has a lot of elements of being a true Hero. While Elric is a taker (The Stealer of Souls), Corum leaves his own world for another to help humans in a dire struggle against an Ancient race of Gods. (Actually charecters and representations from ancient Celtic Mythology.)All in all one of Moorcock's best series. A must for any Sci-Fi/Fantasy Genre fan."},{"Title":"Corum: The Prince With the Silver Hand (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 12)","review":"In America at least, I think Moorcock has been overlooked as a notable pioneer in fantasy. At the very least he's merely underrated but as I read more and more of his work I realize how much he's influenced writers of today and the recent past, especially in the fantasy genre. Elric took the concept of the &quot;anti-hero&quot; and ran with it and Corum injects a whole heap of Celtic mythology into the proceedings, with quite entertaining results. Nowadays, some writers (Charles DeLint is the one who comes to mind right away) pretty much base their entire careers on building on those mythologies and folklores, but when Moorcock put all this stuff together, I don't think it was as common and I wonder what people thought of it at the time. This is another volume in White Wolf's Eternal Champion series and the second entire book to feature Corum (he's had cameos in other stories throughout) and this one basically wraps up his saga. Pound for pound I think Corum is a far more interesting character than Elric . . . Elric, while fun in a &quot;gee what new tragedy will happen to him so he can complain about it&quot; sort of way, probably has the biggest appeal these days to teenage fantasy lovers who mostly fixate on &quot;Cool! He sucked out that guy's soul!&quot;. Corum, on the other hand, is more well rounded, he has definite doubts after saving the world, he misses his late wife but is prepared to move on, has a sense of humor and is actually proactive once in a while, which I think gives the stories more narrative drive, as opposed to the Champion reacting to stuff over and over again. These last three stories in the series have separate plots but mostly deal with the ongoing problem of saving the world from huge demigods from Limbo that would really like to get back but since they can't would rather just destroy the world (I'll give Moorcock this, his villains are unique). Corum is summoned to the future (really the past, or at least an alternate world) to save the world from these menaces and proceeds to get hip-deep in Celtic mythology. Moorcock sure seems to have done his research and it's hard to tell where he's drawing from other sources and where he's simply just making it up. The plot do suffer to some extent from the &quot;plot coupon&quot; mentality, where Corum has to go track down the long lost rare artifacts (the titles of the stories are a good clue) generally by way of a lot of tangential side quests, but Moorcock piles on so much local flavor that you don't really notice and he does take time to throw in extra twists and wrinkles so it doesn't feel color-by-numbers. The ending is typically downbeat (I know they're called &quot;champions&quot; but boy do their lives stink) but it's a fast entertaining read and probably possessed of more reread value than the Elric stuff, this definitely makes for a more consistent reading experience throughout. A must for both fantasy fans (the White Wolf volumes are sadly out of print, I'm sure the British or the originals are all available, although I'm not sure how much revision was done) and those who enjoy adding a sprinkling of Celtic folklore to their reading."},{"Title":"Corum: The Prince With the Silver Hand (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 12)","review":"When it comes to real intellectual content Gene Wolfe gives better value than Moorcock in this series at least. But for sheer Celtic instincts (listen to Celtic Ladies CD while you read this) Moorcock is second only to Yeats, who used the great Celtic myths for inspiration (both the CD and Yeats refer to 'moorcocks'). These are the closest to their Celtic roots, using Cornish, rather than Irish, as their main influence. Is it a coincidence that Cornwall has so many traditions associated with King Arthur and Camelot. There's a suggestion in this that Corum visits Tintagel, which sometime Dubliner Moorcock has used to similar effect in his Jerry Cornelius books. How mythologies intersect, sometimes with disastrous results, is part of the theme of this hell-for-leather fantasy which goes so fast, in comparison to modern 'phat phantasy', as Revolution SF calls it, that you hardly realise the time has passed. The CONTENT of this book, like Wolfe's, is considerably greater than the content of most of its rivals. Highly recommended, if just for its sense of the Celtic Twilight."},{"Title":"Corum: The Prince With the Silver Hand (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 12)","review":"I am reading my way through the White Wolf omnibus series and have just finished this one. There is only one word to describe the sweep and the depth of Moorcock's imagination -- awesome. It's no wonder so many other fantasy writers call him the Master.This book, like the final book in the Elric series, has a dramatic and shocking ending, but that makes it all the better, all the more like a real myth. From books like Mother London and The Brothel in Rosenstrasse, through the Elric and Hawkmoon novels, to the most recent King of the City, Moorcock shows himself to be the greatest. A giant in modern fiction. Whether you like fantasy novels or literary fiction, I guarantee you will like the Corum series. Only Moorcock and Tolkien are the 'real thing'. Even in his minor work, he throws up concepts which other writers create entire series out of. He is one of the best and most influential writers of our age. Totally recommended!"},{"Title":"Corum: The Prince With the Silver Hand (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 12)","review":"Don't get me wrong, Elric is great, but Corum was the facet of the Champion that stuck with me the most, I guess because of how the character's fate relates to mythology. Plus, the stories are much more visual and absorbing than the other Champion tales.***I'm very pleased that WW Publishing is collecting the works of Moorcock, but isn't there some way to put these in mass-market paperback size at an affordable price? Even a trade softcover costs more than I want to pay for a book, plus they take up too much space. Moorcock has so much to offer fans and newbies alike. I mean, they did it with Tales Of The White Wolf...

Since I'm one of those Hardy Boys \\"buffs\\" as described in McFarlane's book, I decided to give it a read. I was not disappointed, and I don't think anyone who enjoyed the adventures of the Hardy Boys will be either. McFarlane was the ghost writer for the first 20 Hardy Boy books. Writing under the familiar to all of us boys pseudonym, F.W. Dixon, McFarlane quickly wrote the stories from outlines provided by Edward Stratemeyer. Today the Hardy Boys series remains the most popular series of juvenile adventure/detective books ever.The Ghosts of the Hardy Boys is actually an autobiography of McFarlane and covers more than just his experiences ghosting the Hardy Boys books. Turns out he did a lot more things, but his main \\"claim to fame\\" was always as the author of the Hardy Boys.The book isn't very long, and though maybe not as \\"easy a read\\" as the Hardy Boys, it is an easy and enjoyable experience.

Quotes, statistics and geographical interpretation of the riots, all are included in the realistic, sometimes tantalizing look at the struggles of Parisian women and their roles in the French Revolution. Not just a fleshed out version of a history texts after-thought, as happens so many times with books about the women or minorities of history - this book gives us the real forces behind some of the major events of the revolution - forces that include the demands of disenfranchised women eager to take part in the new Sovereignty of the people.The tons of research done by Godineau shows not only in the immense bibliography but also in the completeness of the themes discussed in the book.

It is filled with popular history sources and first hand accounts which really gives the reader a clear understanding and a vivid picture of what a woman's life was like during the war. The book isn't too heavy on traditional historical evidence or prose but that is one of the reasons why it reads so fast.

The author makes it a point to mention a broad spectrum of issues while making sure to highlight where research was located. I consider this a GREAT start to research of my own. She also makes it a point to credit her decision to write it on her mother which puts another whole personal aspect on it.

WWII women pilots were in danger of their planes being sabotaged by sugar in the engines, put there by male pilots. Those who were killed by these actions were denied military funerals until 1978. Read this book before you see the documentary \\"The Invisible War\\". This is the current story of service women who are assaulted and raped in today military.

It not only has fantastic information, superior references for further research, and multiple first hand records and accounts, but it is also really enjoyable to read. Content and organization are great and the pictures are priceless and memorable. (Yes, I like pictures. Don't judge me).

This tell about how women durning World War 2 came together to help win the war. From serving in the services, to life on the homefront. In many cases these were women who never held a job before, but help built the planes, ships and tank that help win the war. While they face many trials they kept on going to the war. This is a great book who is either interested in history or women issues. I really enjoyed \\"Our Mother's War\\" and I was sorry that I waited so long to read it."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War: American Women At Home And At The Front During World War II","review":"Very informative book on the roles that American women took on during WWII.

Parker for first hand accounts of life on the homefront during WWII."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War: American Women At Home And At The Front During World War II","review":"A great read!This book is full of surprising, well-told stories of heroic, courageous, and fascinating women. Not just another history of the &quot;supporting roles&quot; of women during the war. This book goes far beyond the stock portrayals of WWII women to take you into their private thoughts and fears. There are pilots, war photographers, disc jockeys, spies, soldiers, members of congress -- so many women who stepped up and took part in the war, often in spite of great opposition. (And it doesn't shy away from telling about a few women who were not so noble during the war either.)I had never seen the women of WWII placed in this light -- as equal partners in fighting and winning. This book will make you want to know more about your own mother, your aunts, and your grandmothers. (Hopefully you still have a chance to discuss this book with them!) It should be read by every son, daughter, grandson and granddaughter of the Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War: American Women At Home And At The Front During World War II","review":"This is a unique compilation of astonishing research andpersonal history that takes the crust off our mothers' wartime persona.

I read slowly and savored each page, and by the end I knew my mother and grandmothers and the human spirit, better. Kudos to Emily Yellin."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War: American Women At Home And At The Front During World War II","review":"The voice of women veterans is one too seldom heard. Now, with WWII veterans dying at a rate of over 1,000 per day, those voices will all too soon become silent. WWII was the first time women joined the military, and they encountered prejudice and hardships every step of the way. The women and nurses who served in the military witnessed horrors that many of the men encountered, but with much less preparation and little resource for healing after the war. All but forgotten for the roles they performed, this book brings to light their stories by both the women themselves, as well as the author's research and study. Much of the information is rarely found in available books, and \\"Our Mothers War\\" is an excellent resource for that information- particularly on the lesser known women's roles on the homefront, in espionage, and those who were taken as prisoners of war. Women volunteered to help the war effort in every possible way. The accounts tell stories of war as well as stories of the lighter side of day-to-day living that was the human side of life during WWII.An excellent overall account of women in the 1940's, and one that will likely encourage the reader to delve deeper into our nation's history of female veterans, women's roles and the women's movement."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War: American Women At Home And At The Front During World War II","review":"This isn't meant to be some exhaustive encyclopedia, but it's nevertheless a very solid thorough detailed account of what the women of the WWII generation went through, in many facets and fields. Besides just writing about the women in the military, in the factories, on the general homefront, and in the Japanese-American internment camps, there is also interesting insightful information on areas little covered, such as the women who worked at or who had husbands working at Los Alamos, prostitutes, women in right-wing pro-Fascist groups agitating against the American government, and spies. It's stunning to read about all the women of my grandmothers' generation had to struggle against to be accepted into the military, in factories, as professionals, in any capacity in fact besides that of wife, mother, sister, and girlfriend. Particularly horrifying was the section on the Victory Girls; the sexual double standard sent women (many of them proven innocent) suspected of passing VD to soldiers to jail, while giving these soldiers no punishment for cavorting with prostitutes and giving them the best care instead of forcing them to languish in dank unhygienic jail cells without medical attention. Blame the women and treat the men as innocent victims. Also shocking in modern times is how women believed to be lesbians in the military were treated, like they had a mental disorder and were deranged unnatural deviants, as well as how many women who had loyally punctually worked in the factories were handed their discharge slips on the day the boys came home. Still, even restrained by the double standard and beliefs of the era, these women had tasted freedom and greater possibilities, and thanks to everything they did, their knowledge of greater possibilities, they raised daughters who would help to bring about the womens' liberation movement in the next generation, knowing they could never go back to the limited world and possibilities that had existed prior to WWII."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War: American Women At Home And At The Front During World War II","review":"I purchased this book for my in-laws who lived through WW II. My father-in-law served in the Army in India as a medic, while my mother-in-law waited at home. They have read numerous books about the war, but until now had not seen a book about life on the home front or about the role of women in the war. They are really enjoying the book.

Onnearly every page you will find many surprising, little-known facts about the war.The real strength of this book, however, is the personal accounts from women ina wide range of American life at home and in the theater of war; from everydayworking women's lives to the lives of women in the highest seats of power. Thevoices of real women leap off the page and you are brought into their innermostexperiences, fears and hopes. Some of the stories are heroic, some about the dailyfrustrations of maintaining a family during war, many recount the sacrificessmall and large that women made with very little recognition or support. The bookalso discusses the opportunities that became available to women during WWIIlater led to permanent changes in American society ... breaking down economicand racial barriers that had been entrenched for centuries.

But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all. God bless us, every one!"},{"Title":"Spares: The Special Edition ( Signed Limited 1 / 500 )","review":"Sheer unadulterated brilliance is what Marshall Smith deliveres here. In a surreal world where people are cloned for spare parts, one man, down on his luck, comes to the rescue of beings considered less than human.

No dragons or ogres, just almost normal people in a messed up situation."},{"Title":"Fundamentalisms Observed (The Fundamentalism Project)","review":"This is the first of five volumes by The Fundamentalism Project. It is the only volume I have read to date. This volume begins with North American Protestant Fundamentalism, for which the term \\"fundamentalism\\" was coined and then studies in 15 more sections, each with a different author, (across 13 chapters) other religious movements around the world that have reacted to modernity in a way that might be described as \\"fundamentalistic\\" ... even if in quite a different form than North American Protestant Fundamentalism. The book may (almost) be worthwhile for its chapter on North American Protestantism alone but there is a huge amount more. The concluding chapter then tries to determine what might be \\"fundamentalistic\\" about all the religions presented thus far. This is just a beginning and it appears that study of the remaining four volumes might be needed to integrate all the material covered in this introductory volume alone.What impressed me most was how many people worldwide are far from the kind of \\"intellectual\\" religion expressed, say, by Unitarian Universalism or the Society of Friends, let alone from secular humanism and atheism. I suppose I should have known this but until I read through here I had not been mindful of it. Try explaining the appeal of Gnostic Christian mythology to any of the believers of these fundamentalisms and I think you will find a gap too wide to cross.I had not even paid attention to the issues found in Roman Catholic Traditionalism in the U.S., Roman Catholic Activist Conversation in the U.S., or Protestant Fundamentalism in Latin America. As section after section moved away from the Protestant Fundamentalism I was familar with, I began to feel overwhelmed by the varieties of what seem to be emotionally dominated belief systems. Moving through Jewish, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and Japanese forms, in a survey, text book form but nonetheless considerable detail told me I was \\"not in Kansas anymore\\".The five volumes may be too much for me and best suited for scholars or students of religion. I plan to go on next to Volume 5 (Fundamentalisms Comprehended) and see if it provides an appropriate summary for a lay reader such as myself. The conclusion of this book (\\"Fundamentalisms Observed\\"), \\"An Interim Report on a Hypothetical Family\\" does provide some summary information but it is brief and much of the details from the early sections seem not digested yet here into summary form. It seems what may emerge is an understanding of fundamentalisms that is not rooted in North American Protestant Fundamentalism, but has abstracted key elements of what seem like quite different ways of reacting to modernity with some aims of preservation.The major value of this volume, for me, as a lay reader, is to realize that there is an enormous amount and variety of religious activity in the world which is resisting modernity and which seems irrational. Given my liberal U.S. Protestant background, I'd never seen in such detail what much of the rest of the world apparently believes and it is quite disconcerting to find out. What makes it more disconcerting is seeing how readily many of these movements seem organized so as to mobilize their followers politically."},{"Title":"Fundamentalisms Observed (The Fundamentalism Project)","review":"*Fundamentalisms Observed* (the 1st volume of 5) is perhaps the most prestigious contribution yet to the ever expanding literature on the subject.

Elements of mysteries, illicit love affairs and all of the petty gossip that small towns thrive upon, emerge as everyone speculates on firstly, the identity of the victim and secondly, upon the murderer.Friends Carol Seddon and her next door neighbour, Jude,play detective as a relief from the boredom and insularity of small town life and uncover many secrets involving the town's inhabitants.The story is written in a light hearted way and in the elegant style of many other English mystery tales...I thoroughly enjoyed it !"},{"Title":"The Torso in the Town (Isis)","review":"I love this series. Torso in the Town is not my favorite installment, but it's a good one nonetheless. I think the reason I didn't enjoy this one as much is because the townspeople were either excruciatingly annoying or downright evil. In the other books in the series, the townspeople are just quirky and you like to laugh at them. In this book, there just seemed to be more of a menacing tone. Also, there was poor Carole and her breakup with Ted. The woman isn't exactly sunshine and rainbows on her normal days, so you can imagine what she's like after an embarassing breakup.All that aside, the plot itself is well written and the mystery is tight and interesting. As usual, the revealing of the culprit is a tantalizingly slow, heart-pounding climax. Brett once again throws red herrings everywhere. I absolutely did not predict the culprit correctly.So other than my slight disappointment with the characters, I enjoyed this book. I look forward to Stabbing in the Stables, which is coming out in August 2006!"},{"Title":"The Torso in the Town (Isis)","review":"One of my best friends is always asking me for new stories he can tell. He loves to use stories to entertain those at the right and left of him at dinner parties. Presumably, if he had actually attended the dinner party that opens up this book, he would never again need another story.The Torso in the Town is the third Fethering mystery featuring Carole Seddon (mid-fifties divorced, retired Home Office bureaucrat) and her relatively new neighbor Jude (an alternative healer who has no obvious source of income of about the same age). Carole is sedate, introverted, and concerned about appearances. Jude is a full-tilt boogier, loves people, and cannot wait to get involved in whatever is going on. They share a love of solving local mysteries, especially murders, as amateurs.One of the charms of this series comes in the clever plots that Simon Brett puts together to allow Carole and Jude to get at the facts to make their discoveries. In this case, Jude has been invited to have dinner with old acquaintances who have recently moved to Fedborough, just up the river Fether from Fethering where Carole and Jude live. Before the meal is done, her hosts' son races up to announce that he's found a body in the basement. In rummaging around behind a wall, the boy had located an old box . . . from which dropped a shriveled human torso. Talk about dropping your turkey on the floor in front of your guests on Thanksgiving!Carole, meanwhile, is licking her wounds after her brief relationship with local pub keeper, Ted Crisp. She feels embarrassed and doesn't want to be seen. This makes Carole even more standoffish than usual. Jude's story of the torso helps Carole ooze out of her hurting shell. It turns out that Carole had recently been consulting an interior decorator who used to live in the home where the torso was found. Carole finds it easy to drop by and find out what she can learn.From there, the complications are quite humorous as Carole and Jude become Fedborough's newest odd couple in the eyes of the locals. Initial connections lead to pubs, more drinks, a timely dinner invitation, and lots of gossip about who has done what to whom in the past. Carole and Jude also recruit unlikely assistants (including the boy who found the torso) before the book is over.The ending will probably not surprise you, but it presents far nicer questions of \\"what if\\" than most mysteries develop. I liked the ending best of the three books so far in the series. The ironies are pretty entertaining for those who love irony.This book has a special treat in it for those who have wanted to know what Jude's last name is: You get two clues via the post man."},{"Title":"The Torso in the Town (Isis)","review":"I found this too grisley for a supposedly \\"cozy British mystery.\\" Not only is the murder macabre, but the details are dwelt upon gratuitiously and repeatedly. It's obvious by the third chapter why the body is in the state it's in, so the ending is not the Great Shock it's supposed to be. The only question is: who done it? I don't consider this a book to curl up with before bedtime, if that's what you're looking for.I enjoyed the previous 2 Fethering Mysteries, and I also enjoyed the Charles Paris series. However, the dynamic here is wearing thin. If one deletes all the references to how New Agey Jude is compared to stick-in-the-mud Carole, the book would probably be 1/3 shorter. This one was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Torso in the Town (Isis)","review":"If you've read the first &quot;fethering&quot; mysteries, this book will delight!

This time the murder victim is in the village of Fedborough which is 8 miles inland from Fethering. Jude attends a dinner party there and the teenage son of the party host discovers a torso in the basement of the house that they had recently moved into. Jude shares the news with her sleuthing partner and neighbor Carole and they decide to team up again to investigate the crime.Carole at the beginning at the book had retreated back into her previous uptight personality due to the breakup with her relationship with pub owner Ted Crisp. The solution to the murder and ending to the book is different. It is one that I will remember.

His Fethering series are his best so far, but they are essentially 2-dimensional. My main problems with this book revolve around the lack of thought he put into the mystery itself...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILERS AHEAD>>>>For instance, if the police knew a body had been \\"smoked\\" after death, in a small village wouldn't the whole populace know because officers would be checking out the history of every smokehouse in town? Also, why would the police be tracking down previous owners of a property simply to ask them *when* they'd bought and sold it--isn't that a matter of looking up public property records? (Apparently Brett's police force is perpetually asleep at the wheel.) The final thing that irked me was the total NONSENSE of the ending--a person who is caught in the ACT of attempting murder cannot then be deemed \\"harmless\\". I'm sorry, but on this one there is only one possible conclusion: Brett's clueless."},{"Title":"The Torso in the Town (Isis)","review":"Simon Brett is a clever enough writer that I still enjoyed this third \\"Fethering\\" mystery but I must admit that I thought that the plot -- the finding of a mysterious body, personality differences between the two leads Carole and Jude, and snobby English village inhabitants with A Secret -- a bit too reminscent of the first two books in the series. Also, one small detail really nagged at me: one of the characters has been through an acrimonious divorce where her husband left her for another woman and she can't stand him, but she still lets him stay in her flat when the police make him come back to town to be interviewed because he insists that he doesn't want to spend the money on a hotel. Although it is a minor point, it annoyed me: Why would she still bow to his wishes? Overall, though, the book includes enough clever writing and insightful characterization that I still plan to read the rest of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Designing a Microsoft Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure (Academic Learning Series)","review":"Cole and Steen have done an excellent job in covering not just the basics, but some in-depth review of How, What and Why.This text is designed for the network designer and support staff that desire a better understanding of not only what protocols do, but how they can be tweaked to result in better performance.

These were tough people, who asked no quarter from nature and prevailed.I am interested, particularly, in the use of oxen on the trail. Unfortunately, oxen were common tools for the author.

In one episode one of the men lost a friend whom he had known throughout his school days, killed by rustlers. The sadness and anger felt by this loss of friendship and senseless death colored the rest of the novel.You are sure to enjoy this work especially if you have an interest in the Old West!"},{"Title":"Hopalong Cassidy","review":"His Writing are the real thing! The characters are written so realisitc and not too super-human..... Mulford's stories of Hopalong make you feel like your reading about a real person form the past...."},{"Title":"Hopalong Cassidy","review":"If you are expecting a book that is like the old 1950's TV show character you might be disappointed. Myself I am quite happy with it.Louis LaMore once wrote a few Hopalong books. I think he was under contract to do it and had the understanding that he could do them like Clarence Mulford did. Unfortunately it was not in writing and the publisher later told him he would do the cleaned up version or else. Louis was not happy about that but he did as he was told. He was so angry about it that when he became famous years later he denied that he had written them. His son explained why he lied after his death. He stated that after Louis had lied about it a few times he felt that he could not back down from his statement.After reading quite a bit of this book I wonder if Mr. Mulford influenced Louis's writing style. I'd bet it did.I like this version of Hopalong. He talks like the rough old men I knew when I was a kid. It's like a trip down memory lane. Some of the epithets I have not heard since I was a kid. I saw where one reviewer said he was a crude, rough, and dangerous man. It made his sound like some kind of criminal. Yes the Hopalong character is all that but he's like they would call in the old West &#34;A good bad man&#34; A fairly honest hard working man who you would not want to have angry at you yet at the same time one who is kind and gentle to women and kids. The bad bad man of old was one who was dishonest most of the time. He might be a coward who is only good with a gun or will steal only when he knows he won't get caught or can preferably blame it on someone else. A bad,bad man can also be as good with his fists as well as with a gun. He will also steal things right out under the victims nose and don't care how they feel about it.I feel that this book is a good way for younger people to get to know what people of the old days were like.I recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Ann Aurelia and Dorothy","review":"I read this book every year as a little girl.

These children had different lives, but it didn't matter -- they were just friends -- getting into some of the scrapes little girls get into. It's an excellent book for girls ages 9 - 12.

I read it becasue I am from a Northern English working class background. George Orwell started out as a communist in his youth, and by the time he wrote his last book, 1984 he was a rabid anti-communist. I think this book marked his turning point. He wrote it for the communists. He describes the horrors of life in Northern England during the depression for the first half of the book, but in the second half of the book he analyses the causes of the problems in society and tries to use communist doctrine to explain how it will create a better world. I think, however, that while he goes through this intellectual exercise, he realizes that communism will not solve the worlds problems but will actually make them worse. This must have really pissed of the communists who he wrote the book for! I think this book was a personal turning point for Orwell and is a must read for people of all political stripes."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"A politically niave and socially ignorant work of at least admirable intentions. A worthy read, but one should approach it with a cynical and open mind. Do not let Orwell spoon feed you with his prejudice. He attacks the entire middle class for being of one particular type and seeing the working class as another diametrically opposed type without seeing that he himself is guilty of the same crime, although the victims may be less 'worthy'. There is no blurring of the line, no consideration for specialist cases. Orwell's world is black and white, but mostly black. His views of socialists are appalling, as is his argument in favour. The heavy-handed emotive poignancy of the first half of the book is excessive in parts, although Orwell's descriptions of various wives in the same half of the book are utterly beautiful and make the book a must-read on their own. Any would-be socialists should read this, just for the feeling of indignant rage it gives you. Students of social policy or economic conditions in 1930s Britain will need to take it with a whole sack of salt.Still, a massively entertaining and thought-provoking read. Go on, try it."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"The interesting thing about George Orwell is the way in which he continued his intellectual quest to aid the downtrodden, the misbegotten and the dispossessed. In this book he starts by describing his odyssey through the coal mining towns of England in the years between the wars. Published in 1937, it describes the plight of out-of-work British coal miners as they struggle thru a bleak daily existance. His writing skills are on display as he delivers a \\"you are there\\" narrative with all the trimmings. In the second part of the book he waxes forth on the virtues of Socialism as a cure for man's maladies. He also calls into question the people he sees as tasked to lead the charge in this regard. Per usual, his take on socialism is long on promises and ideals, but short on results. Orwell never quite figures out that Capitalism isn't a system so much as something that occurs naturally if left unhindered by governmental interference. Of note, said interference is generally sought by one capitalist group against another with legislators as the intermediaries (see \\"the Myth of the Robber Baron's\\" by Burt Fulsom for nuance.)It's instructive to track Orwell's life through perusal of the subject matter in his books. He goes from his foaming dislike of the British Empire (from his experiences as a cop) in Burma to reflecting on poverty (as England continued to suffer through its Keynesian socialist economic policies) in the present book, in \\"Down and Out in London and Paris\\", and in others. Following these he writes \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" where his discovery of Stalin's treachery allows you to almost see the wool being lifting from his eyes. Subsequently, he writes a wonderful satire on Stalin with \\"Animal Farm\\" followed by a bleak view of the future in his \\"1984.\\" Had Orwell lived past 47 he would have become a modern day Paul Johnson, but he was taken too early to the detriment of his audience.Orwell would surely have seen the humor in the eastern bloc jokes in their post-1989 world when they averred that \\"communism was just the long bloody road between capitalism and capitalism.\\" Another clever jibe was that \\"capitalism can be defined as man oppressing man, with communism as just the reverse.\\" However, the trenchant emotions of the self righteous, morally imperious lefties allows them to continue to accept, without a reasonable factual discussion, that a command and control, top-down method for operating an economy remains superior to the capitalist model. They don't understand that the trade-off's inherent in the spontaneous and natural ordering of capitalism are superior in their ability to create a greater surplus for all. They don't understand that socialism drives away the inventor, the entrepreneur and the risk taker (with the equity capital necessary for most entrepreneurial success.) Read \\"FDR's Folly\\" by Jim Powell to see how FDR unwittingly kept us in the great depression by his mal-use of socialist governmental policy. The same was happening in a \\"Keynesian\\" England, but Orwell and the other socialists were too economically unsophisticated to understand it.As the information explosion continues to unveil reality thru its relentless interpretation of accurate statistical data our governmental policies will become more enlightened along Hayekian lines. However, Orwell continues as one of my favorites, both for his intellectual honesty and his keen skills as a writer."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"The Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell is a book requested by the Left Book Club on the issue of poverty and mass unemployment in the industrial north of England. Mr. Orwell does a great job of investigating the harsh job conditions in the coal mines, the foul lodgings, the bad diet, the pitiful wages and the struggle to feed a family. He points out that much of the conditions can easily be changed IF people wanted to change them. The wealth is there it just needs to get to the lower-class.The other part of the book is Orwell trying to explain why, if Socialism seems to be so logical, so reasonable, everybody is either turning away from Socialism and, in many changes, turning to Fascism. It seems that while people might agree with many ideals of Socialism they don't like the Socialists they meet. Orwell points out that Socialists need to work on the delivery of their message - less about class systems and more about justice and income.When you attack the middle-class you put them on the defense. Why would they join up in a movement that is insulting them? He says the Socialist should drop the idea of the class war and focus on the basic ideals of increasing incomes, better housing for everybody, justice and liberty. He also says that Socialists are linked to progress which many people link with a machine-civilization and therefore a dark, bland future. Funny I also linked Socialism with slowing down progress and Fascism with speeding it up.Even while the facts in the book are outdated the problems that many parties today face, such as Libertarians, are the same. How can you take a Libertarian seriously when he is dressed up as a butterfly? In print the ideas of the Libertarians and Socialists and even Democratics look good but sometimes the PEOPLE of these parties make the voters go running to the Republicans. I know many people who did JUST that - they didn't like the Republican's ideas but hated the people the Democratics had picked to run for President. Left-wingers sometimes come out, because of the terms they use or they way their come out as attacking almost everything, as nuts."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"The first half of this book was very consuming.

The book was important for me to read because I have read many of Mr. Orwell's books previously.This work is a kind of investigative journalism of the 1930s. Although the main premise is to investigate unemployment, Mr. Orwell covers the class system and the future of socialism, and takes swipes at vegetarians, femininsts, and men with beards. He is delightfully cranky in his treatment of \\"cranks.\\"The book is in need of a 21st century editor, someone who can explain the currency (Pounds/Shillings/Pence), who miscellaneous public figures are, and put the work into a context that a non-specialist can understand."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"As the story goes, Orwell was engaged to write a story about the then massive unemployment in the North of England.The first few chapters recount Orwell's experience in a working-class boarding house and then underground with coal miners...and they are fascinating. Orwell's deft talent for recounting the subtle is well demonstrated in these compelling and often hilarious early chapters...and then it happens.Orwell's insights into class distiction are well known, and way too often shared, especially here. Orwell cheaps out by prattling on about why he thinks no one really wants true socialism and blah, blah, blah.Even cheaper(!), Orwell constantly references already written works to demonstrate his point. So much so, that any reader would be vastly better off reading Orwell's fabulous semi-biographical &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; instead.If you decided to read this book, I think you can guiltlessly toss it aside after the coal mining recallections."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"It's worth knowing that this book was originally commissioned by the Left Book Club, a Socialist book club in the UK, and when the manuscript arrived they realized Orwell had delivered more than they'd bargained for. In part one, Orwell brilliantly reports on the atrocious living and working conditions in northern England in the 1930s. His chapter covering his visit to a coal mine has been often anthologized, but the entire section consists of equally vivid portraits. In part two, Orwell discusses Socialism with such a jaundiced eye that it had the editors of the Left Book Club wondering if they could get away with printing only the first half of the book! Orwell did not fully believe in Socialism until he fought in the Spanish Civil War after &quot;Wigan Pier&quot; was printed, and contrary to the right-wingers who have claimed him as one of their own, Orwell was a dedicated Socialist to the day he died, but a skeptical one. Read &quot;Wigan Pier,&quot; and for more information, read Orwell's diary he kept during his trip to the north in Volume 1 of the Collected Essays."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"Contrary to my expectations, this is Orwell's most personal book. He bares his soul to us. At least I think he seriously tries to be perfectly honest, if not complete.After his success with Down and Out in Paris and London, Orwell got commissioned by the influential Left Book Club (Victor Gollancz one of the editors)to write a book about unemployment in the industrial and empoverished northern part of England. This was the mid 30s, the recent depression had led to high unemployment and endless misery in England as elsewhere.GO went there and dug in and lived with workers and in boarding houses and crawled through mines (though he was about twice as tall as a miner should be) and talked to people and read statistics and reports.The outcome is an oddity. Part 1 is a solid piece of investigative reporting and journalistic sociology. Chapter 1 is along the lines of Down and Out, an account of life in a boarding house in the North. Start with chapter 2 if you are squeamish. The hygienic conditions are worse than anything in Down and Out.The following chapters in part 1 give us decsriptions of the life of miners and work in the coal mines, of the miners' leisure time, health, work safety, accidents, the housing conditions in the fearful northern slums (worse than the slums in India and Burma, says GO, because of the cold dampness), of unemployment and malnutrition, of food and fuel, of the uglyness of industrial countries at the time. The strongest chapter in this part, in my opinion, is the one on unemployment and its psychology. This subject is timeless. Even if the slums have changed, the essential condition of unemployment is surely unchanged.So far so good and in line with the job description.But then the man went and added a second part which deals in first place with himself, an autobiography and history of the thought of GO. Having grown up as a son of shabby genteels, he was raised on contempt for the working class. Public school education enforced the attitude. After school and after WW1, GO took a job in the imperial police in Burma and there learned to hate the system. He quit after 5 years and went into a personal crisis, a kind of horror vacui and hatred against his self. He goes on search of redemption as told with some embellishment in Down and Out. He tries to anihilate his social persona, but learns it does not work that way. The North England job gives him a chance to reconsider his position. He philosophizes about socialism and the classes. Interesting to us (at least to me), but shocking to the Left Book Club.They decide to publish it anyway, but Gollancz adds a foreword where he thinks he needs to warn his club members that here is somebody who does not walk the line of good doctrinarism. Very odd.By the way, did you know that quite likely fish and chips and the football pools have averted revolution in England by providing 'panem and circenses'? Says Orwell, and I love him for that kind of insight.(This concludes my Orwell cycle, unless I decide to re-visit Burma and Catalonia.)"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"What a valuable examination! As other reviewers have pointed out, the Left Book Club of UK nearly three quarters of a century ago (!) commissioned Mr. Orwell to write on the condition of the coal miners in North Yorkshire. The first half of the book shows Orwell's observations of the squalor and struggles of those working people. However, Orwell continued with a whole second essay. In that second portion of the text, he criticized the left for its arrogance, its being out of touch with that which it claimed to want to remedy.Orwell raises issues that could as easily apply today pertinent to those dedicated to &quot;change&quot; the conditions of those of whom they have little grasp. That's the only depressing thing about the book: so little has changed in so much time.Some observations on the then-growing fascist movement in Europe are eye-openers too.Read it and weep? Or read it and LEARN!"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"England in the 1930's had staggering poverty and unemployment and was still reeling from World War I. Socialism was enjoying interest from those who wanted to do something to fix the wrongs. The Left Book Club commissioned George Orwell, who had stirred attention with DOWN AND OUT IN PARIS AND LONDON to write a book about the working poor in the coal mines in Lancashire. He did that, but he also chose to go beyond the terms of his contract and assess the potential for Socialism to solve problems. His conclusions did not especially please the editors of the Book Club but to not publish the book would seem narrow-minded, so it went to press in 1937 as is tempered with a forward by Victor Gallancz, taking issue with Orwell's evaluation and vision.The first half of the book stands as a remarkable piece of journalism revealing untold squalor. Coal was the oil of its day and people wanted it in quantity and they wanted it cheap and they did not want to know what it took to produce it. It is difficult to decide what is grimmer, the work beneath the earth or the housing to which the miners returned at night. Especially mean is the fact that the privilege of a family of eight living in two leaky, barren rooms, two hundred yards from an outdoor privy, extracted most of the household wages. Orwell's urgent prose does not let anyone look away.Orwell then turns to a discussion of class differences, the bourgeois and Socialists. He portrays a culture saturated in a class system that will be difficult to eradicate any time soon, one in which the different classes have different values, fears and perspectives that obstruct understanding and reconcilation. Socialism, which had both its bourgeois and proletariat adherents, had yet to get its act together. Rather dyspeptically, Orwell saw it as a lightening rod for all the modern trends taken up in rejection of the old ways: feminism, vegetarianism, free love, humanitarianism, atheism, pacifism, to name a few. The Socialists fell feverishly upon their new orthodoxies with a zeal Orwell suggests would drive the public towards Fascism. He does not reject Socialism-in the end he equates it with common decency, but he wants it to get its act together in light of his views. In this essay lies the Orwell either side of the divide loves or hates, the Orwell who defies easy categorizing. In it also lies the eloquent, precise voice that makes reading him a pleasure despite wanting to say, \\"Look, here, there is nothing wrong with being vegetarian (or feminist or whichever of your sacred cows he's dealt some withering words).\\""},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"First off, I'd like to point out that socialism is NOT communism, since one of the other reviewers failed to make the distinction.Secondly, Orwell did not write this book \\"for the socialists\\" in the sense that some of the other reviews imply. He wrote the first half of the book-an analysis of living/working conditions of coal miners in North England- by request of the Left Book Club, a British socialist organization. The second half of the book- a critique of socialism and socialists- was not requested by the club, in fact, it prompted a rebuttal from a representative of the organization in the original release (which is included as an introduction in other editions of the book.)The half of the book about the miners and their lives is heartbreakingly poignant, described well by the other reviews. Read them. The second half is a well reasoned constructive critique of socialism and socialists. Orwell points out that most of those middle-class folk who claim to be socialists, in actuality, are not: they wouldn't be willing to lower their own standard of living for the sake of elevating those in poverty. He points out that the alternate view of \\"why don't we just elevate the standard of living for EVERYONE?\\" is a bit of a Jesus complex that would never work. He goes on to compare \\"bearded juice-drinking Marx-quoting Socialists\\" to the likes of pushy evangelical Christians, saying that most Socialists actually harm their cause and turn others away from socialism rather than converting them. Hillarious, wether you are a critic or friend of socialism (assuming that you have a sense of humor...)The one complaint I have about this book is that Orwell states that socialism is \\"obviously\\" the only cure for the ills of the coal miners described in the first half of the book. He never says how or why. One could extrapolate that socialism could alleviate the housing shortage by providing subsidized housing in the mining towns, and that it could improve the conditions in the mines by applying industry standards to how the mines are run. Wether this would actually be the case could be argued, but the author doesn't even bother to give any support to his claim.Overall a great book- read both parts!"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"Orwell's writing is alive. It interacts with you, striking you, caressing you, wiping away your tears, turning up the corners of your mouth in a smile. In The Road to Wigan Pier, he recreates for you this wonderfully real portrait of a working-class slum in 1930's England, and you can see how strongly he reacted to it. The first half is an almost overpowering description of the appalling conditions he found there, and it's all written Orwell's way: the floor so old it's transparent, the landlord with the black thumb, the sweaty claustrophobia of a coal mine. The second half of the book is Orwell's political standpoint of the time, which would alter radical over the course of his life. It's not exactly a watertight argument (it somehow feels unfinished), but Orwell, you must admit, is angry and he makes you angry. This is a very gutsy and well-written book"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"George Orwell wrote The Road to Wigan Pier in 1937, as a personal expos&eacute; into the lives of the working-class poor. Orwell infiltrated the industrial and mining towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire by sharing overcrowded and often unsanitary rooming houses with other workers. He reported on their appalling working and living conditions and in his descriptions did not hold back in using the most subjective language:\\"In Sheffield you have the feeling of walking among a population of troglodytes.\\"The Road to Wigan Pier is filled with language one might expect a mother to use if she stumbled across her teenaged son's room. When Orwell rents a room from a couple named Brooker, he has to share with three other men. The four of them are so cramped inside that Orwell, who was quite tall, couldn't sleep with his legs fully extended. Orwell keeps the dirty people he rooms with and whom he meets at arm's length if he can bear to look at them. This is one of Orwell's constant remarks about poverty in northern England: not only are the houses but the people themselves are dirty. This remark reeks of prejudice, which would have gone unchallenged in the class society of England in the mid-thirties. Orwell seemed on a \\"dirt hunt\\", checking under the fingernails and in the creases between the toes of his neighbours. In regards to the Brookers' rooming house, Orwell wrote, often with contempt:\\"Generally the crumbs from breakfast were still on the table at supper. I used to get to know individual crumbs by sight and watch their progress up and down the table from day to day.\\"Meal preparation at the Brookers was an ordeal Orwell could not stomach:\\"The meals at the Brookers' house were uniformly disgusting. For breakfast you got two rashers of bacon and a pale fried egg, and bread-and-butter which had often been cut overnight and always had thumb-marks on it. However tactfully I tried, I could never induce Mr. Brooker to let me cut my own bread-and-butter; he would hand it to me slice by slice, each slice gripped firmly under that broad black thumb.\\"To Orwell, poor people were dirty, miserable and had no personal pride:\\"In the mornings he [Mr. Brooker] sat by the fire with a tub of filthy water, peeling potatoes at the speed of a slow-motion picture. I never saw anyone who could peel potatoes with quite such an air of brooding resentment. You could see the hatred of this 'bloody woman's work', as he called it, fermenting inside him, a kind of bitter juice. He was one of those people who can chew their grievances like a cud.\\"Orwell looked down on the poor working class from his bourgeois pedestal. Those who failed in business were themselves to blame for lack of business sense was a congenital trait. The poor could not succeed in business because they were too stupid to know any better:\\"Certainly it was true that the shop did not pay. The whole place had the unmistakable dusty, flyblown air of a business that is going down. But it would have been quite useless to explain to them [the Brookers] why nobody came to the shop, even if one had had the face to do it; neither was capable of understanding that last year's dead bluebottles supine in the shop window are not good for trade.\\"Orwell in his analysis of reasons behind the current state of the British economy used two terms from the very beginning of The Road to Wigan Pier, which he didn't explain till a considerable length into the book. I was puzzled by the abbreviation \\"PAC\\", which he didn't elaborate upon or define as the Public Assistance Committee until page 71. Orwell also made repeated references to the Means Test, yet didn't explain what that was until page 73.The Road to Wigan Pier is divided into two parts, equal in length. After the expos&eacute; on the working-class poor, the second part is Orwell's socialist rant. I found this part overbearingly repetitive and boring. Orwell raises the same points over and over in favour of socialism, and in his own warped way gets into the minds of those who are against him and ridicules them. He reminded me of a psychologically imbalanced teenager who believes he knows exactly what every one of his fellow students is thinking and why everyone is against him. His subcutaneous omniscience rendered laughter instead of learned insight. I couldn't repress laughter whenever Orwell railed against fellow socialists who happened to be of the wrong class. He described these people as \\"sandal-wearers\\" and \\"bearded fruit-juice drinkers\\". Instead of seeing these people as allies and working with them, he belittles and dismisses them.I dreaded the second half of this book. I raced through reading the first part yet the second part plodded along; I couldn't wait to put it down and be done with it."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"Orwell is a great author who gets his points across very clearly. He talks about the working class, miners especially, of Northern England, and how Socialism will help them. I can't imagine that many people think of the working class, and their hardships; and if they do, they don't _really_ pay attention to the details of their lives. Orwell does, and he talks about it in a way that you almost convert to Socialism--until he starts criticizing Socialism and Socialists. It makes you wonder why he was a Socialist at all."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"I found this book when I was living in Sydney, Australia. When I brought the book to the front to pay for it, the clerk kept tucking it under a paper bag, hiding it from the other customers milling around the desk. Everytime I took it out from under the bag, the clerk hid it again. This happened several times, until I finally left. It gave me the immediate feeling that I was buying something a little bit illegal, a little dangerous, something that I shouldn't have, because the clerk had never done that to me before or after.The first thing I noticed about my little copy of the Road to Wigan's Pier is that is said it was not for sale in the U.S.A.. I recognize now that it was because of copyright issues, but at the time, I thought maybe the reason I had never seen this book in the States, is because it was somewhat suppressed for some reason.I was expecting more 1984, not a documentary of life in Northern England, not a political commentary. Since then, I have read the book perhaps ten times. It seems that Orwell (Blair) wrote the populist 1984 and Animal Farm simply to get readers to read his earlier works, like this one. Orwell is clearly a master of words, of pacing and of emotion. He can manipulate the reader transparently. By about the fifth reading of Pier, I began to feel that Orwell could have written bestsellers like 1984 and Farm much more easily than this one.So why is the book important, if for half of it he simply analyses the now-historical beginnings of the Socialist movement? Maybe because it doesn't matter in what direction Socialism has headed since he wrote this book, he wasn't analysing socialism or class issues as much as was busy digging up the truth of socialists, of the unemployed, of the homeless, of the middle class and the upper class. This analysis is still just as valid in 2004, as it was in 1930, even if the names of the political parties and the occupations have changed.This book was witten by a truthful person, who perhaps stretched the truth a bit, or condensed it, or altered it. These are literary devices. But the meaning of the book, as is most valuable today, is about a poverty-stricken middle class that gets itself into debt to keep up the appearance of a higher class. And it is about a lower class that is essentially better off, even with the hungry belly and the dirty rooms, than this affected middle class from which Blair came.Maybe this is the message that is so dangerous, the one that bookshop clerk tried to hide from the other customers. This book brings the poverty to light, and finds that the poverty-stricken can redeem themselves. But when Orwell unearths the truth of the middle class, the true subversive nature of this book spills all over the floor like a drunk puking on stage. What has not changed in almost a century is that the middle class may never be redeemed so long as we think that a \\"plate of strawberries and cream\\" is somehow our key to salvation. It fills our guts with something other than what we genuinely hunger.To toss that plate onto the floor and stomp around the house for a piece of black bread with hard crust will wake the babies. But more dangerous, it may force the owner of the strawberry farm and the owner of the dairy farm to get their own hands dirty. \\"And what of the farmhands, if these soft-hands are doing the work they once did?\\" As Blair points out, it can only get better when you're already living at the bottom."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"This book is divided into two sections. The first is a devastating account of the lives of coal miners in the north of England. While this account may be exaggerated it is completely conceivable that life in this time under such social and political conditions might have been like this. He goes to considerable length to explore the personal reactions and methods of endurance of the people he met. Orwell's dedication to exploring what life was really like for the coal miners was made at considerable personal discomfort and were as heroic as Jonathan Kozol's efforts in our present time.The second half of the book is a long argument by Orwell of the negative aspects of socialism. He does this in order to provoke a serious discussion over how socialism can be implemented in our society. He understood well, as demonstrated in 1984, that many political parties use propaganda as a means of convincing the public that theirs is the right way. But, by taking the opposing view and criticising his own beliefs, he is able to bring the issues of the party into an open forum to consider implementations of change rather than party rhetoric. He does this most sincerely and in no way tries to hide the faults of the socialist political system of thought. In doing so he proves himself to be quite dignified in his system of beliefs. The juxtaposition of these two sections provides a striking idea of the immediate need for political reformation. He did not need to defend socialism because the need for a political change that could effect the lives of the lower class he investigated was obvious. This showed that Orwell's political ideas didn't exist on some ideological utopian plain, but were firmly rooted in the immense danger a political system could inflict upon a large population. It would be wise to remember this in reading the more popular 1984 and Animal Farm as well.This book is compelling not just for people interested in politics, but also for anyone interested in history and the human condition. It is something you will be able to learn much from and provide you with inspiration."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"My generation grew up with parents with depression stories, mostly. In my family it was always how tight things were for other people, relatives who came to share the house, coworkers who ate their pet chicken, hand me down clothes from rich people's servents to go to school in, no Christmasses.Orwell's depression was not just suffering. It was poverty, but it was the toughness and the strength of British working people that he writes about in this book that launched Orwell on an arch as a person dedicated to the struggle to overturn this kind of exploitationa nd oppression of working people. What you see in this book is the toughness, strength and grit of British working people, dockers particularly.Orwell never romanticizes. He can write and make you care about people without making them look like poor pitable sufferers. he can write and make you care about himself, without hiding the baseness and studities and foolishness, and human fears that he has.Read this book and Down and Out in London and Paris, where he talks about being the lowest of the low, homeless, in a memoir and not a story. Read these two books and Homage to Catalonia. See the realities he unveils, real experiences that transformed Orwell from a British colonial cop, to a fighter for socialism! Maybe you can gain home in the strength of humanity to banish the evil too!"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"This is an excellent book. After having to read in high school (in the 1970s) both Animal Farm and 1984, I confess that I approached this book with some trepidation. However, Orwell's descriptions of life as a coal miner and his honest thoughts about Socialism, both in defense and in criticism, make me wonder why the English teachers of the early 1970s didn't have us read this book instead. It is much better written and more honest."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"of what he really saw. One thing that many readers might not know is that Orwell was commissioned to write this book as a way to support Socialism. Despite this, nearly half of the book is full of his opinions of the faults of Socialism. Yet the first half of the book shows many of the obvious flaws of blatant capitalism. It was refreshing to read an account that did not feel like it was trying to convert me to one viewpoint or another, and I could focus upon the really interesting bits of life in N. England."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"I had to take one star off of the review specifically for this edition, put out by Benediction Classics, Oxford. Besides being a bit over-priced, the typesetting and text itself is terrible. There are many errors and the alignment and justification that makes the book almost unreadable. There are line breaks after a single quotation, spaces where there shouldn't be and many other very distracting issues.After investigating, I noticed that a few of the same exact errors are in the HTML version from [...]. It seems that this publisher cut-and-pasted the text from the web and published it without editing. For shame!So, this is an excellent book and a classic from Orwell, but do yourself a favor and buy another edition."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"There's no point to defending Orwell's attitude towards the progressive rich (as expressed in this book). But his point is really quite simple: the working classes are more old-fashioned and less academic than the upper classes; therefore, if the stereotypical socialist is a &quot;bearded fruit-juice drinker&quot; who discusses Marx over tea, the movement is not going to collect members. Not revolutionary, but true enough and expressed with enough vigour to make it an entertaining polemic.That said, I prefer the first half of the book, where Orwell describes his stint in the coal-mining districts of the north of England. He is excellent on the squalor and awfulness of life in the mining towns, as well as the unemployment question and the general effects of the Depression. The chapter on working-class houses in Sheffield, though less vivid, is also excellent. Orwell isn't too much of a graphic artist, but he gives you enough detail that it's a minor imaginative task to reconstruct the lifestyle he's writing about.And, having reconstructed this landscape, it's difficult not to half-agree with his evocation of the dignity of a working man's life before the war, or to feel with him that &quot;it is not the triumphs of modem engineering ... but the memory of working-class interiors - especially as I sometimes saw them in my childhood before the war, when England was still prosperous - that reminds me that our age has not been altogether a bad one to live in.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"The Road to Wigan Pier is a brilliantly written work of documentary literature, with a propoganda piece tacked on at the end. Orwell describes the poverty and hardships of working people in the industrial disctricts in the north of England, based on what he himself has seen and heard during his travels there. The second part is entirely political, and does not seem nearly as interesting to today's reader. But the matter it deals with - the great struggle between socialism and fascism - was of extreme urgency in the late 1930's, when Orwell wrote the book. It's important to remember that Orwell did NOT attack socialism. He merely raised what he considered were the most likely objections to socialism, then refuted them. That a large corporation like Amazon.com would accuse him of &quot;slanting his reporting&quot; shows what a true socialist he really was."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"Even though I had not realised before reading it that The Road to Wigan Pier is not a novel but an extended essay, I was not disappointed. The book, which treats of the condition of the working class in 1930s Britain, is half descriptive and half political pamphlet. The first part applies Orwell's matchless powers of depiction to the slums of Wigan, its coal mines, its social housing estates. It is based on the author's experience living for several months among ordinary working families. The scenes from the bottom of the coal pits are particularly grabbing. In typical Orwell fashion, they make repeated simple but striking points: coal miners invariably had to walk for several miles underground just to get to their jobs, for example, and this meant navigating long, narrow passageways where in most places a human being cannot stand. The strain on the legs was such that untrained visitors could only hope to get there, after interminable creeping, exhausted and probably injured. And this was before several hours spent shovelling tons of coal even began.The second part of the book consists of a call to arms in favour of socialism. This was the great depression, and capitalism looked rather beat. Europe also faced the threat of fascism. Here the interest is historical, specifically in Orwell's own path but also in the contemporary ideological context. Orwell's pamphlet shows how an intellectual of great lucidity, honesty, and intelligence could have believed in the superiority of socialism. Inevitably Orwell makes false predictions ('The Socialists are right, therefore, when they claim that the rate of mechanical progress will be much more rapid once Socialism is established.' (page 192)). But he has many interesting observations on technical progress, human psychology, and culture, amid rich private reflexions on the meaning of class. The point in the choice of Wigan pier for a title is that the pier has become derelict and been destroyed. Yet Orwell would continue on his political journey. Next in line was Homage to Catalonia, also an Orwell must-read, describing his experience in Spain and concomitant disillusionment with the communist camp. It seems Orwell was subsequently impressed with the Conservative government's stand on the right side of WWII, completing his ideological conversion. At the same time, his affections remained with the British working class. The Road to Wigan Pier makes clear why."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"George Orwell is the man. This is for sure one of the top 5 best books i've ever read. Even if I tried, I couldn't come close to doing the book justice with this review."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"This work commisioned by the Left Book Club, a socialist group in England in the 1930's contains an incredible description of the miserable working conditions of coal miners in the northern industrial areas of England. Orwell's power of description brings home the awful condiditons to the reader in a very tangible and palpable way. Reminiscent of Jacob Riis' \\"How The Other Half Lives\\" or Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", Orwell's account is unforgettable social historical writing.The remainder of the book is a polemical piece critical of socialists of his day. To the modern reader that will not have as much relevance except as an example of Orwell's pursuasive writing but the earlier sections of the book are incredibly memorable."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"Published in 1937, George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier documents the grinding poverty of northern England, namely Lancashire and Yorkshire. As with Orwell's better-known and somewhat similar Down and Out in Paris and London, the author sets out to investigate the conditions of the poor by living among them and writing about his experiences. There is a chapter on coal miners and mines, and Orwell elucidates on the culture and mechanics of the industry; he goes down a mine to report, taking the reader with him. Orwell discusses unemployment (how it's misunderstood, etc.) and touches on how the upper classes view the lower ones.That, more or less, makes for Part One, which I found engaging from a historical perspective as much as anything. It's meant to be a socioeconomic investigation (a description, a testimony), but because it's 75 years old, it's become a historical document. Part One isn't as lively or vivid as sections of Down and Out, perhaps because there's little dialogue and it lacks that diary-of-life-in-the-gutter quality. The conditions Orwell describes are awful, but, comparatively, there is a sense of detachment in the way he communicates them.In Part Two, Orwell gears down, going from documentary to dissertation, and though historical, this part is timeless. \\"The English class system has outlived its usefulness,\\" is the message he wants us to take from Part One, so what's the solution? The most obvious answer is socialism, but is socialism really the medicine society needs to take?The section about machine-worship notwithstanding (time has proven Orwell, and probably many others, wrong about the future of machines and technology), Part Two makes for provocative, passionate, and insightful analysis. Anyone who's ever given thought to class distinction, class conflict, exploitation, the plight of the working poor, or been drawn, if only momentarily, to socialism or its various forms (Marxism, communism, democratic socialism, etc.) ought to read this book, and carefully. Anybody who reads tracts like Terry Eagleton's Why Marx was Right ought to read The Road to Wigan Pier immediately afterward. They should buy them together.In socialism, Orwell finds a few good, if loose, ideas, a lot of stupidity, and even more pretension. He lambasts its advocates, arguing they are out of touch with the proletarians they claim to venerate. Socialists are striking a blow at the bourgeoisie, yet they are the bourgeoisie. If a coal miner walked in on one of their meetings, they would feel, at the least, uncomfortable. Socialists hold that \\"poverty, and what is more, the habits of mind created by poverty, are something to be abolished from above, by violence if necessary; perhaps even preferably by violence.\\"Socialism is dogma, Orwell illustrates (without saying as much), arguing that it is not a mirror image of fascism, but a perverse form of it (a \\"travesty\\" is the word he uses). Though seemingly antipodean, the ideologies have much in common. If you travel far enough toward either end of the political spectrum, you end up as a blip on the opposite side.The attacks are scathing, and come in bunches. \\"We have got to admit that if Fascism is everywhere and advancing, this is largely the fault of Socialists themselves. Partly it is due to the mistaken Communist tactic of sabotaging democracy, i.e. sawing off the branch you are sitting on....\\" Moreover, Orwell says, Socialists \\"have never made it sufficiently clear that their essential aims are justice and liberty. With their eyes glued to economic facts, they have proceeded on the assumption that man has no soul, and explicitly or implicitly they have set up the goal of a materialistic Utopia.\\" The greatest excoriation, though it's hard to choose, might be: \\"Socialism calls up, on the one hand, a picture of aeroplanes, tractors, and huge glittering factories of glass and concrete; on the other, a picture of vegetarians with wilting beards, of Bolshevik commissars (half gangster, half gramophone), of earnest ladies in sandals, shock-headed Marxists chewing polysyllables, escaped Quakers, birth-control fanatics and Labour Party backstairs-crawlers. Socialism, at least in this island, does not smell any longer of revolution and the overthrow of tyrants; it smells of crankishness, machine-worship and the stupid cult of Russia. Unless you can remove that smell, and very rapidly, Fascism may win.\\"And it very nearly did win. The prophetic nature of Orwell's ideas is part of his perennial appeal.\`But hey,' interjects the modern-day far-leftie. \`Orwell is talking about a brand of socialism that no longer exists. Socialism has changed.'It has in some regards, but elements of the variety Orwell was talking about are still apparent. Democratic socialism is still championed by people from the middle class, it's still dogmatic, and it still reveres \\"great\\" men who believe change must come from above. Socialism is often the final destination of the alienated. It is a mind-numbing religion for the non-religious, intellectual, middle class.They say a good book tells you what you already know (or suspect), and it's probably for that reason I enjoyed this one so much. I live in one of Canada's poorest cities, thoroughly blue collar. It's hard not to look at the poor and start conjuring up ideas about social engineering. Give them an education, you think. Give them purpose. Break the cycle of generational poverty. I recently reread Marx and even voted for and joined Canada's democratic socialist party, though I quickly wished I hadn't. The rally I attended was dominated by \\"vegetarians with wilting beards\\" (or at least many of the local university's bearded faculty), sixties' activists, and \\"earnest ladies in sandals.\\" I was, quite frankly, put off by this, and by discussions in the crowd about the bright spots of the Soviet Union and a few of communism's \\"great\\" men, the handing out of hammer-and-sickle adorned propaganda rags, etc. As Orwell writes, \\"the thinking person, by intellect usually left-wing but by temperament often right-wing, hovers at the gate of the Socialist fold. He is no doubt aware that he ought to be a Socialist. But he observes first the dullness of individual Socialists, then the apparent flabbiness of Socialist ideals, and veers away.\\"And none too soon.There is an intriguing aside to The Road to Wigan Pier. The book was commissioned by a publisher named Victor Gollancz, who wasn't at all happy with Part Two and worried about the reactions of members of the Left Book Club, the organization that issued the book. Gollancz wrote a flaying, impassioned foreword, included in the modern Harcourt edition, where he attempts, lest the reader get the wrong impression, to take the edge off Orwell's words. Gollancz apologizes to vegetarians, half-gangster commissars, and cranks, and says Orwell is \\"astray\\" and a \\"frightful snob.\\" Orwell doesn't even define socialism, Gollancz whines; nor does he explain what he means by \\"liberty\\" and \\"justice.\\" The spirited \\"pretort,\\" if you will, ends with a figurative, if not literal, call to mobilize against the capitalistic enemy.The observant reader sees Gollancz's foreword for what it is: a wretched attempt at censorship and damage control, and the very sort of empty rhetoric, hare-brained we-know-best thinking, and militant jingoism Orwell so skilfully obliterates.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"If for the sake of argument one suspends their ideological beliefs, the working conditions discussed in the coal mines of Northern England were appalling. In making the reader understand these conditions, George Orwell establishes his position on the corrosive working conditions of this period and the path to change. In effect, the coal mines are Orwell's tool for presenting socialism as a more fair system.Some reviewers have made the argument that this is Orwell's manifesto for socialism. The first half of the book is an eye opening experience in viewing conditions in a coal mine. This was a time before strong labor unions or any type of organized labor. Though Orwell observes that the workers seem to be content in their squalor, their contentment does not make it acceptable. The conditions and lifestyle are sickening. As Orwell states \\"I remember the shock of astonishment it gave me, when I first mingled with tramps and beggars, to find that a fair proportion, ... were decent young miners and cotton workers gazing at their destiny with a sort of dumb amazement as an animal in a trap. ...They had been brought up to work, and behold! and it seemed as if they were never going to get a chance of working again\\" (p 81).The remainder of the book is Orwell's explanation of socialism and why so many are repulsed by it. In nature, the class system is far from just. Orwell never seems to completely follow through on his argument. While some readers will be negative toward the book because of a socialist theme, my negative view is based on the fact that Orwell's argument for socialism is far from complete. I am not sure many can be sold on the ideology from this book. Aside from explaining the process of Orwell's coming to terms with socialism and prejudices that exist in others, the argument lacks a sense of focus and perhaps even clear purpose."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"When I was in high school in the 'sixties, I had to make a joint book report on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984 for an American History class. I was so annoyed with this assignment that I wrote a vehemently nasty review. The teacher was vastly amused. He suggested that I read Road to Wigan Pier. I couldn't see anyway to niggle out of reading it, so I settled down to read it as perfunctorily as possible and still be able to convince the teacher that I had given it due thought. Instead, as I read, I became enthralled by Orwell's descriptions of life in a bleak industrial town in the north of England. I gained new respect for Eric Blair; I still didn't like 1984, but I understood better where he was coming from and why he wrote it.I've thought about Road to Wigan Pier many times in the intervening years, and I just recently re-read it. It is still just as powerful and despairing. The non-fiction beats the fiction any day. I have an insig! ! htful teacher to thank for recommending this book."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"...and the reasons for taking it are not immediately clear.\\" So says George Orwell, in commencing the second part of this book. He was one of the literary giants of the first half of the 20th century, leaving us far too early, at the age of 46. His most famous novels areAnimal Farmand1984, which combined have sold more copies than any other two novels by a 20th Century author. Mandalay is in Burma (a/k/a Myanmar) where Orwell spent five years as a police officer in the 1920's; his experience inspired his novelBurmese Days. In the late \`30's, he demonstrated that his concerns about fascism were not all talk: he fought in the Spanish Civil War, and related that experience inHomage to Catalonia. Between the latter two books, he experienced, and subsequently depicted the lives of the poor, working or not, during the Great Depression, inDown and Out in Paris and Londonand \\"The Road to Wigan Pier.\\"Wigan is a small town in the Greater Manchester district located in northwestern England. It is part of what was \\"the industrial north,\\" whose prosperity declined sharply after the First World War. Orwell, on an assignment for the \\"Left Book Club\\" visited Wigan, briefly shared the lives of the poor there, and wrote this account of his experience. The \\"Pier\\" in the title was a wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool canal that had been demolished even before Orwell arrived. He slept in a very sleazy boarding house, which he describes in detail. The vivid details include the dirty thumbprint of the owner, Mr. Brooker, on the slice of bread he would pass to Orwell as well as the fact that he slept, very crowded, four to a bedroom, and could not stretch his legs out fully in his bed until another roomer had left for work.The area around Wigan was coalmining country. He went down in the mine, a tall man in a short man's world. Just to get to work, that is, the coal face, once underground, a man would have to walk, at a crouch, between one and six miles! Miners were physically fit, they had to be, to get to work, and then shovel the coal onto the conveyor belts. Orwell then describes the miner's homes, and daily lives. There was a \\"housing shortage.\\" None of the miner's homes had a bathroom. There was a communal one, which might involve a walk of 50 to 200 yards. Imagine that, with five children! He describes the problems of bathing, and the efforts required to obtain hot water. He lays out the finances of their lives; a constant struggle, with disaster only one accident away. Orwell does this with a reporter's flat affect; no purple prose, the facts themselves would convey the pathetic misery of their daily lives.In the second part of the book Orwell examines what should be done about this. He is frank about the class structure in England, describing how as a member of the \\"lower upper middle class\\" he was taught not to associate with the poor, and how he developed an attitude towards the \\"common\\" people: \\"And what is this attitude? An attitude of sniggering superiority punctuated by bursts of vicious hatred.\\" What to do about it? As Orwell says, he studied Greek for 8-10 years in school, and cannot repeat the alphabet, \\"...but your snobbishness, unless you persistently root it out like the bindweed it is, sticks by you till your grave.\\"Orwell is a \\"Socialist,\\" a moniker that is still considered highly disreputable, particularly in the United States. But he lays out the economic dilemma succinctly, sans humbug, which is one of his more favorite terms: \\"The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all co-operate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions, seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one should possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.\\" And then he dissects why the socialist agenda is moving backwards, focusing with particular animus on the jargon-laden discourse of \\"thesis,\\" antithesis\\" and \\"synthesis\\" that so turns off the \\"common people,\\" not to mention the eccentricities of the sandal-wearing adherents of socialism. Some 30 years later, Paul Goodman was covering much the same territory. And more than 30 years after Goodman, the essential issues remain, during yet another economic downturn, and hordes of college graduates, not in the mines fortunately, but wasting away, waiting on tables. An often overlooked Orwell classic, 5-stars, plus."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"I suppose it is almost five years since I last read this book (my favorite rereading is his Burmese Days), and that was just long enough for much of Orwell's prose to seem fresh again, but there was a \`silent song' of almost forgotten feelings singing in the background. It is sometimes a shock to me that I am now old enough (Ahem! Sorry, - \\"mature\\" enough) to actually remember some of the still surviving social details that Orwell describes in his books, I did see the \\"Spikes\\" with the line of tramps patiently waiting the opening door, I recall the \\"travellers\\" knocking at my grandmother's farm cottage back door with the request of a \\"glass of water Missus?\\" that evolved to the slice of bread and butter to the \\"florin for the road\\" that was the original intent. Indeed, as a young seaman shunted and shoved from port to port to join delayed ships I have actually slept in those dreadful impoverished and smelly boarding house the author describes, and I knew shipmates, ex-miners, with their freckles of imbedded coal in their complexion and the \\"buttons\\" of never-to-be-healed scabs down the backbones. But never did I experience the true bitter poverty Orwell exposed.It often puzzles my American neighbours and friends when I give expression to my few surviving socialist views, but they are of course blind to the history that formed them in my youth, in my country, at that time. They were formed by an unshared experience of the residue that still existed in the England of my youth, of that stark horror of separation and inherited privilege that Orwell exposed.Of course, Eric Blair was of a \\"higher class\\" than I, a public schoolboy (Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge) and a professional, an officer of the Empire, an honored author whose every dwelling carries an official plaque, in every country he lived in or served. But he had the feelings for the poor and downtrodden and the courage to explore, experience and then to express them, to the outrage - still un-subsided - of the more conservative.This is a powerful record and a well written book, offering the reader deep insight to the conditions of the society he explored, presenting us with strong evidence that all societies need an awareness of all citizen's needs, even if, even today, it is often dismissed as no more than a \\"treatise on Socialism\\" or just another tract from Victor Gollancz's Left Wing Book Club!"},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"\`The Road To Wigan Pier' is in many ways two separate books. The first half covers Orwell's experiences living in the mining towns of Northern England, describing the poverty and unemployment there, while the second offers a stinging critique of Socialism. What ties the book together is Orwell's distinction between \\"socialism\\" the ideal and \\"Socialism\\" as a political movement. By the late 1930's, Orwell's political views were beginning to crystallise; although a passionate Socialist (as demonstrated in Part One), he was increasingly dismayed by the direction Socialism was taking (as he famously highlighted in Part Two). \`The Road To Wigan Pier' is a book that highlights the severe social problems Britain was facing in the 1930's, while also expressing concern over whether the current version of \\"Socialism\\" was really capable of addressing them.In Part One, Orwell outlines the appalling conditions of the miners in Northern England. He covers the conditions down in the mines themselves, plus aspects of home life such as food, unemployment benefits, and quality of housing. Some of his observations almost defy belief, such as a miner having to walk a mile or more bent double before reaching the coalface, or having up to ten people sharing a tiny house. Above all, Orwell seems determined to shatter the myths many Southerners had about miners; that they worked reasonable hours for good pay, and received generous benefits. He notes that while on paper the weekly pay and hours may look reasonable, the reality is very different. He highlights how many workers employed only part-time, have to travel for hours to work each day, and have their benefits vigorously policed and ruthlessly docked at the slightest pretence.What stands out about Part One is Orwell's genuine empathy for and understanding of working class people. While he notes a little self-consciously in Part Two that he was never really \\"one of them\\", his experiences living with these people did give him a unique insight into their way of life. By rooming with ordinary working class people in their own homes, he does not merely describe their plight, he lives it on a daily basis. Contrast this respect towards the working class with the attitudes of the elitist \\"Socialists\\" as described in Part Two.In Part Two, Orwell offers a critical analysis of Socialism. He notes that Socialism, properly implemented, would greatly improve the lives of working class people described in Part One, yet many working class people are apathetic or even hostile to Socialism.Essentially, Orwell's analysis reduces to two key points:1) That the \\"class issue\\" is alive and well in the 1930's. Despite mouthing all the right Socialist sentiments, a middle class person cannot have a complete understanding of, and connection to, a member of the working class. Orwell draws on his own background (Chapters 8-10) to discuss class prejudice from both sides of the fence.2) That Socialism as a political movement is a product of the middle, not the working class. As Orwell portrays it, this middle-class version of Socialism is more concerned with ideological purity and providing a haven for other middle-class concerns (\\"fruit juice drinkers, nudists, sandal-wearers, quacks, pacifists...\\") than with actually achieving anything practical for the working class. Following on from (1), the average working man views Socialism as consisting of intellectuals and academics who have no knowledge or experience of working class life, and who are more interested in philosophical squabbles than improving the lot of poor people. No wonder the average working man is reluctant to embrace such a movement.....Part Two caused quite a stir among Orwell's fellow Socialists. If you can, try to pick up an earlier edition containing the Left Book Club's desperately defensive Introduction, to get some idea of the general reaction. But Orwell's points are perfectly valid, and he succeeds brilliantly in articulating the doubts that many ordinary people have about Socialism. Note also that many ideas Orwell would later explore, such as the use of convoluted language in political speeches, are already well thought out and defined.As with all of Orwell's political writings, what stands out is how readable and engaging \`The Road To Wigan Pier' is. Orwell has a wicked, jet-black wit, and much of the book is delivered with a very dry sense of humour. It is this, as much as its serious political observations, that makes this such an important book even today. And it's still relevant, since many of the arguments Orwell makes about Socialism in 1930 are the same ones being raised against mainstream left-wing parties today.\`The Road To Wigan Pier' is an essential political work from a dedicated but intellectually honest Socialist. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"George Orwell (Eric Blair) was born in India in 1903. He died in 1950. Orwell in \\"The Road to Wigan Pier\\" goes into the lives of miners eking out a living in the northern part of England. Orwell examines the council housing and miner's homes which were dens of misery. Miners received poor wages and worked long and dangerous hours deep down in the earth. The health of the miners was poor and their lives full of misery. Orwell describes in detail the ugliness of the industrial cities of Sheffield and Wigan. Wigan had a population of 85,000 in the 1930s most of whose population were unemployed, on the dole or making a susbistent wage. Orwell was accepted by the poor, hardworking men and women he met on his travels. He wrote the book which was published by the Left Book Club; Orwell was a socialist who had fought in Spain on the side of the leftist government.In the second half of the book Orwell turns his attention to a discussion of the class system in Britain, the dangers of Fascism and the need to oppose Fascism in Europe. The Road to Wigan Pier is a good book which will interest students of English society in the 1930s. Orwell was a wonderful essayist who has influenced such present day literary luminaries as the acerbic Christopher Hitchen."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"I vividly remember travelling through what was communist East Germany (DDR) in 1996.

It is one of three great documentary works that define Orwell as great journalist. \\"Homage to Catalona\\" and \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\" are the other two noteable journalism books. The preface for this book is long and critical, written by a communist editor who had definite issues with Orwell- very unusual!

What resulted from Orwell living with the families of miners and in the seedy boarding houses of the industrial north was a detailed account of home life, personal budgets, mining technology and a decrepit social welfare system, the \\"Means Test,\\" which created much havoc in the lives of the poor. Orwell's ability to describe and experience the gritty facts of poverty is compassionate realism.The second half of the book shows the conflict with left-culture that was to characterize the rest of Orwell's life. The forward to this edition shows the conflict that book created with Orwell's publisher who insisted on the trip to the coal mining districts. Orwell was at heart always the colonial policeman and the Etonian...a cultural reactionary and yet a Socialist. It is not clear, however, how bad bath facilities for miners is a call for a planned economy.There is no analytical discussion here. We never get the details from Orwell.Orwell's genius for description reminds me of reading \\"1984\\", so long ago,and feeling watched even though I never really did identify with Winston's struggle against Big Brother. In \\"Wigan\\", Orwell honored the struggles of England's most critical workers with this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"I have just finished reading The Road to Wigan Pier and I have to admit that I did not enjoy it as much as I thought that I would. While Down and Out in Paris and London is darkly ironic and insightful (and, to a lesser extent, I have had similar experiences in my own life and share a similar feeling about them), the first part of TRWP -- the account of working and living conditions in Yorkshire and Lancashire towns in the 1930s -- is frankly bleak and historically interesting, but it is impossible to enjoy reading this part, and I find the second part -- the rant against socialists of his time -- to be too bitter and, to be quite honest, so unfair that it is more revealling of Orwell's snobbery and disillusionment than anything else. The second part is really all about Orwell's angst about his middle-class upbringing and I did not think that it did the first part any justice. I would have liked to have read more about what Orwell thought socialism should be, rather than his vague appeals to justice and decency, and his tirade against middle class prigs, parlour house Bolsheviks, and socialist intellectuals.Even though his complaints had some truth to them, I found myself agreeing with the rebuttal by Victor Gollancz -- the Left Book Club's editor --, which was printed as a preface, even though, with the benefit of hindsight, Orwell's comments about the Soviet Union were more insightful than the editor realized (though, given the preface was written in 1937, the editor should have had a little more hindsight than he did!).Having said that, it is important to remember that Orwell was going through something of a crisis of conscience at this point in his life and he was so deeply concerned with the failure of socialism and the rise of fascism that, by the time the book was published in 1937, he had already left to join up with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. I think that this book shows the frustration and personal conflicts that had risen to a head in Orwell's life, and his experiences of northern industrial towns was the last straw. I think that his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, even though they deepened his disillusionment and confirmed all his suspicions about the Soviet Union and the Commintern, as well as confirming his fears about the rise of fascism, helped him very much in dealing with his personal conflicts and his crisis of conscience. This is why is next book, Homage to Catalonia is, like Down and Out in Paris & London, darkly ironic, insightful, and, while clearly accounting tragedy and betrayal, is full of the 'warts and all' modesty and decency that I very much admire in Orwell's writings."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER is a fabulous bit of muckraking journalism by the most important political writer of the 20th century, George Orwell. O was an accomplished novelist in his own right, but it was in his capacity as an agitator for democratic socialism that his pen was at its sharpest, and in this revealing, often appalling look at the life of British coal miners, he was at his brutally honest best.WIGAN is actually two books in one - the first half deals with his own experiences in the industrial north of England, where he investigated not only what happened at the mines themselves, but how the miners lived, or rather subsisted, in conditions of disgusting squalor and privation (he also spends a good deal of time examining the fate of the unemployed and \\"pensioned off\\"). In the latter half, he offers a pitiless criticism of British socialism, which he sees is the only positive solution to Britain's social and economic injustices, but regards as hopelessly clumsy and dogmatic in its approach, and doomed lose out to fascism unless it changed its message and won over the ordinary British worker.Orwell's concerns in the book were severalfold. He wanted to expose and improve the lot of the common man; he wanted to make suggestions for how that lot might be improved; he wanted the Left to understand just how bad its image problem was in the eyes of the ordinary British citizen (their target audience); and he wanted, above all things, to hammer home to the world that Socialism stood for \\"justice and common decency\\" and not some watered-down version of the Russian Revolution. His greatest fear was that the fascists, by virtue of their superior propaganda and understanding of human motivation, would steal away the common man from the one system that could truly offer him a fair shake.THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER was commissioned by the Left Book Club, which wanted Orwell to write an Upton Sinclair-esque expos&eacute; of the life of the British worker \\"without whom everyone in England would soon starve.\\" They got what they wanted, but on the bonus plan; his criticisms of Socialism, and by extension, the Club itself, were so vitriolic that the Club inserted a forward in the book which essentially refutes everything in it. The forward is worth reading, if only to unintentionally demonstrate that Orwell's attack on the Socialist leadership was dead-on: they did lack common sense, they had no understanding of the common man or of how badly they themselves were regarded by him, and their propaganda was appallingly bad. Luckily for them, they had Orwell...though my guess is at the time they weren't feeling so lucky when they read it. The reader, on the other hand, will."},{"Title":"The Road to Wigan Pier","review":"Orwell wrote this before his breakthrough novels 1984 and Animal House, commissioned in the mid-1930s by the Left Book Club in Britain to write about the plight of the unemployed in the northern mining community of Wigan.He ignored this commission and wrote about both the employed and unemployed mining workers in Wigan. The book is a vivid description of the awful working conditions of these miners, wonderfully told in a very personal style. I found very interesting his visits to the homes of these families, and the various conditions he recounts as part of their \\"quality\\" of life.The second half of the book is his reaction to what he found, and an analysis of different policy-based solutions proposed to assist these folks out of their misery. He takes on and debunks many conventional notions held by socialists and other intellectuals in Britain during this era, making the book quite controversial for the Left Book Club, so much so that the introduction consists of the Left Book Club editors' response to Orwell's criticisms.A fascinating glimpse at a slice of life in Britain during this time frame, as well as a worthy contribution to the debate on how to address this significant social issue."},{"Title":"Longest Night (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) (v. 1)","review":"This angel story is all aout the longest night of the year and it's evil hourly events that team angel must help prevent. It's made up of thirteen short stories, one for each hour, these stories range from the teams going back in time to be burnt at the stake to evil christmas presents from everyones favourite law firm.Overall i loved this book but one thing constantly bugged me and that was the time span, i felt that with most of the tales to much had happened for it all to be in just one hour, plus i felt that sometimes the stories din't link to each other. An example of this is that in one Wesley is really sick but by the next hour he's out fighting the evil perfectly healthly again!!Even though this book has minor faults it's a cliff hanging read so if you just take it for what it is you will love it!!!"},{"Title":"Longest Night (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) (v. 1)","review":"This was a very good book!

Jane loves her friend, but hides her feelings from him because a stud like Will would never date let alone wed a plain Jane like her. Only Breakfast at Tiffany's serves as her sole romantic adventure and her personal George Pepperd (pre A-Team), Will, does not know how she feels about him and never will proposal or not.Several years later Will informs Jane he was not joking when he told her he would marry her. Though she expects to be shattered she agrees to move in with him on a trial basis if he provides an engagement ring. He does, but she never expected him to want her in his bed too. To test him, Jane makes dishes that a normal person would avoid like the plague, but Will eats every bite and then devours Jane next. Finally she so feminizes his home, no male would want to stay there; bujt he tells her he loves her.LEGALLY MINE is an amusing contemporary romance starring two charming lead protagonists. Though the four year gap seems weird (wild oats?), fans will enjoy the antics of Jane applying the Pygmalion Effect to prove her theory that a hunk at Pepperd's level would never remain with anyone less than an Audrey Hepburn. This is a fine time for the contemporary crowd with this romantic romp.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Legally Mine (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"This book reminded me a little of the movie &quot;How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days.&quot; Jane and Will were good friends in college and she was secretly in love with him. One day they made a marriage contract that if when he turned 30 they were both still single, they would marry each other. She is very mixed up about it when he shows up 6 years later to fulfill that contact. She tries goofy ways to convince him she is the fiance from hell, like making horrible dinners and hideously redecorating his house. He loves her anyway, and tries to convince her of that fact. They are both very likeable characters and the book is charming and funny. It is a wonderful Valentine's Day story."},{"Title":"The Undefeated","review":"How on Earth did a book this good fall into obscurity? George Paloczi-Horvath's memoir of growing up in quasi-feudal Hungary, becoming a Communist, then being jailed by the regime, then fleeing the country (after the 1956 uprising was crushed by the Soviets) is a thoroughly compelling read. There is scarcely a page herein which doesn't fill the reader with fascination, even if one's fascination is shot through with horror and revulsion.Born into Hungarian nobility in 1908, Paloczi-Horvath underwent his awakening of conscience one night when, at student age, a friend brought him to the servant's quarters on his uncle's estate. Those who served the aristocracy lived in appalling huts scarcely better than stables where \\"the air ... was a fog of dishwater and sour sweat and rancid fat and wet linen.\\" [p. 15] And why was his friend visiting the huts? To exercise his seigneurial rights over one of the servants girls.From this point, Paloczi-Horvath began a long revolt against this degrading world, in which he realised millions of Hungarians lived. The zeitgeist pointed to Communism, and like many others of his generation, he was seduced by a cause that promised equality. The stick which complemented Communism's carrot was the contemporaneous rise of the far right: and not least of Horvath's reasons for turning to Marxism was that his \\"father and his friends were impossible reactionaries ... who in the nineteen-thirties went around bragging that thanks to them fascism and Nazism were really invented in Hungary.\\" [p. 14] (Hungary's Admiral Horthy is said to have been Europe's first fascist dictator.)The narrative goes on to describe the invasion of Hungary by the Germans; and Horvath's account of his lucky escape through Yugoslavia to Britain is nail-biting stuff. After the defeat of Nazism, Horvath returns to help rebuild his native Hungary. He is inexplicably arrested, and over the next five years endures appalling conditions in various prisons, before being released into a Hungarian society that is brimming with potential - but fateful - insurrection.Almost as awful as the violence of the Communist regime in Hungary (here described in chilling detail) was its indefatigable absurdity. Lowlights:** At one point, Paloczi-Horvath is tortured by sleep-deprivation for days because his interrogator wanted a one-word answer from him that turned out to be merely a synonym for one he had already given.** Later, Paloczi-Horvath is asked to make a false confession for a rigged trial which will be held in camera. The interrogator has no answer to his question \\"But why tell a lie if it will be kept secret? Whom do you want to mislead?\\" [p. 170]** The Secret Police were so ignorant of the outside world that they made prisoners who had once live in the West \\"confess\\" to being \\"imperialist agents\\" of American literary figures who had been dead for half a century.Paloczi-Horvath was a contemporary of Arthur Koestler, and the parallels are striking. Both were Hungarian; both fled the Nazis by circuitous routes to Britain; both joined the Communist party; and both left it in disgust. There is one crucial difference: Koestler's novel \\"Darkness at Noon\\" was an imagining of how the absurd confessions at Soviet show trials were extracted beforehand; but Paloczi-Horvath's memoir shows us the real thing, because he saw it all from the inside. He lived the nightmare, described it splendidly, and preserved his humanity: for this and many other reasons, the ghost of this great writer deserves a far broader readership."},{"Title":"The Undefeated","review":"This is a deeply-felt, deeply-thought and deeply-moving book. It tells of the author's movement towards communism in the context of a pre-war continental Europe which had to choose between fascism and communism; and how his experiences in Hungary after the war led to his slow but systematic disillusionment. The result is one of the most convincing intellectual testimonies against communism as it was practised, portrayed in a context of a very personal agony. As part of the history of Hungary, or any part of central Europe, this would be compelling reading. As testimony to the human spirit in adversity it is both humbling and inspiring."},{"Title":"Learning to Sail","review":"I learned to sail in a 19 foot &quot;Lightning&quot; class sailboat holding this book in my left hand and the tiller in my right hand, while alone in the boat. His homey, unsophisticated descriptions, conveyed the feeling that H. A. Calahan was in the cockpit with me every step of the way. This gave me the confidence to learn the &quot;ropes&quot;. In successive chapters he tells you how to buy a boat, how to handle the boat, &quot;17 ways to get into trouble&quot; followed in the next chapter by &quot;17 ways to get out of trouble&quot; with simple easily understood descriptions. There are also many other chapters on subjects essential for safe, trouble-free boating.

The boat deals with both gaff and jib-headed sailboat rigs. Although I have sailed small boats for several decades, this book covered subjects I could not find in more modern learn-to-sail books. At first I was somewhat disappointed, but once I started to read in detail, I realized that that &#34;Learning to Sail&#34; had many things I had been looking for and even more subjects I did not expect. There is excellent information about reefing and how to organize your boat to avoid crossing reef lines and damaging your sails. The photographs are not very detailed. You will probably not learn marlinspike seamanship from his photographs, but H. A. Calahan covers many subjects well and in useful detail."},{"Title":"Learning to Sail","review":"Callahan's \\"Learning to sail\\" , published first in 1932, is still the best beginner's handbook for the new sailor.

This is anoutstanding book. If you visit his webpage ... you will find that Mr. Hemry is ex-Navy. Being ex-military myself, I have to say that this book's treatment of the future US military is a believable exaggeration of current and historical conditions. Just when I thought I was going to be left with a satisfying ending, I was treated to a teaser that has left me anxious for his next book, Stark's Command (according to the webpage).Rather than repeat anymore about the book as a work, let me offer another view of its possibilities. Early in the page count, I found myself considering what it would be like to role-play in a Stark's War campaign setting. By the time I finished, I had determined that most any scifi or contemporary/near future set of RPG rules could run a campaign in Stark's universe. The book is short enough and clear enough to be a sourcebook for such an attempt even with future releases. Any role-player would find Stark's War a resource for his future genre games. Fear not this purchase.My estimation of the rules best suited for a Stark's War campaign: 2300AD, Babylon Project, Jovian Chronicles, Traveller, Top Secret/SI, XXVc, Justifiers, Alternity and Era Ten."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"I was very disappointed in this book since I was very enthused about all of his 'Jack Campbell' and his Fleet series.

As a retired military officer myself, I assure you that portrayal was totally false. I was Air Force and we did not get as involved with the enlisted men as the Army and Navy did since most combat aircraft contain mostly Officer's.

The plot is predictable right down to the obligatory hospital scenes and male/female buddy bonding scenes that are so fashionable right now. What I find most disturbing isn't the lack of credibility in the story line or the weapons or the characters. What is most disturbing is this book is an obvious set-up for follow on novels.Mr. Hemry seems to have taken one large novel and broken it down into seperate books. One wonders if this is for the monetary or artistic ways this can play out. If you write a book about the Moon and war thereon, don't stop half way and tease. Write the whole thing and publish it. If Robert Heinlein had tried to publish &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; in this manner he would have been laughed out of his publishers office.The authors of today should stop trying to milk the endless sequel cash cow and just get back to the business of writing enjoyable self contained novels."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"At best an uneven book.

But this novel is dead on. The author must be ex-military to have captured so accurately military life and the end game of where the military seems to be heading. The novel is set in the not too distant future where promotion in the US officer core is determined by political correctness rather than effectiveness. Military weapons acquisition is ruled by political pay-backs and the enlisted men and women have become virtually military slaves.

American government officials funded the military but political office was awarded to those individuals will to do the corporation's bidding. Former President Eisenhower's worst nightmare had come to pass as military actions were dictated by corporate profits. Those individuals seeking freedom from the oppression of the United States established colonies on the moon. This situation irked the corporate and political leaders of America, who declared the moon as American territory and dispatched troops to enforce the edict.The military receive no resistance upon landing on the moon. The colonists are returned to earth while loyal American are transported to the lunar colonies with the military assigned to keep them safe from invasion. Other earthlings band together to stop the American thrust to dominate space as they have done on the planet. The war on the moon lasts for years. Men like NCO Sergeant Ethan Stark lead soldiers into combat, but his loyalties are with the safety of his men and not some government 250,000 miles away.STARK'S WAR is a high caliber military science fiction thriller that belies the fact that this is John G. Henry's first published novel. The fast-paced story line reads as if the audience is seeing the war first hand due to the nonstop action and the likable characters. Hopefully, Stark stars in a series of novels that should spell adult Skywalker (Luke not Darth).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"Stark's War (2000) is the first Combat SF novel in the Stark series. A century from now, America was the only remaining international power. The end of the Cold War followed by the Millennium Crash had left American corporations owning every significant technology and resource in the world. These corporations soon owned the politicians and the politicians controlled the military.The military fell into the hands of the political generals. Most honest officers resigned from -- or were driven out of -- the services during this period. The military eventually became a separate institution from the civilian culture and most soldiers were drawn from within this military society.The US military developed the most comprehensive suite of C-three gear in the world. With this capability came micro management of the troops on the battlefield. Commanding generals could literally call the shots of individual soldiers.When the rest of the world went to the Moon for necessary resources, America retroactively claimed the whole satellite. The American military was ordered to take all foreign installations on the newly reclaimed territory. The military followed these orders and US troops soon occupied these installations.In this novel, Sergeant Ethan Stark is an oddball. For one thing, he comes from a civ family. After graduating from community college without learning much of anything, he really didn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Being a war movie fan, he had a distorted view of the military and enlisted in the US Army instead.Stark is also strange in another way, having acquired a strong sense of responsibility for those under his command. Where necessary, he finds -- or devises -- authority to match these responsibilities. For example, he has fortunate losses of communications when given orders to lead his squad into certain death and then accomplishs the mission by other methods.Stark soon develops a reputation among the officers. Of course, these officers are never in his chain of command for more than six months, but outgoing officers pass on the word to their replacements. The newcomers know to keep an eye on this loose cannon noncom, but it is hard to argue with success.In this story, Stark pushes his troopers hard after taking their objective on the Moon. Even after months of training for the mission, the Moon is still an alien environment. Just walking and crawling take lots of practice. So does situational awareness in the strange lighting and landscape.When the enemy counterattack finally comes, Stark's squad is ready for the onslaught. However, the division is too widely dispersed and has to contract into a tighter perimeter. They rally around the new settlement being constructed in their area.Even in these new positions, the enemy still has too much momentum in the attack. Without prepared positions, Stark's squad is being whittled down by artillery and infantry fire. So Stark leads a counterattack.His squad follows him into the enemy positions, as did the rest of his platoon and a tank unit. The enemy is pushed back and unable to resume the attack. These new positions are soon fortified and remain stable lines for a considerable time.This story tells about Stark's early years in the military and the development of his deep disrespect for most officers. It also relates his friendships within the military and his deep respect for several other noncoms and some privates. His best friend during his years on the Moon is Sergeant Vic Reynolds, a very savvy lady.This novel is based on the widespread rank conflicts within the US Army during the Vietnam War. Naturally, the cultural gap between officers and enlisted men during that period is expanded into a great chasm in this story. Moreover, the much updated concept of \\"fragging\\" is still applicable within this story.In some ways, this is a utopian novel. Although the officer hierarchy depicts the worst of all possible worlds, the enlisted culture lacks the natural defects of humanity. Minor human flaws are displayed among the troopers, but the major sins are strangely lacking in the noncoms. Where are the normal interpersonal conflicts?Nonetheless, the combat action is very realistic, although the hero survives too many times for true realism. Yet this wish fulfillment fancy is good fun. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Hemry fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of military culture, close combat, and enlisted comradeship.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"This book is in some ways the flip side of Ian Douglas' Heritage Trilogy. In both stories, American soldiers are fighting United Nations troops in space for similar reasons, but in the Heritage Trilogy the Marines wear the white hats, while Stark's platoon is fighting to protect greedy corporations with extremely idiotic officers calling the shots. The characters are well-drawn and likable, but the overall story is very depressing, and you'll be tempted at many points in the book to go buy a gun and shoot yourself to keep from seeing any of these trends come to pass. So, if you're looking for more of the hoo-rah gung-ho military SF that's standard fare nowadays (and just so there's no hard feelings, I personally love that hoo-rah gung-ho stuff), this book isn't it. If, however, you want something hard and gritty, then this is about as gritty as it gets."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"On a recommendation from author David Sherman, I ordered this book from Amazon. I've been going through a Robert Howard kick recently, and needed a bit of high-tech to counterbalance the swords. Well, this was a bit of a surprise.First of all, this wasn't the action-packed, blood-n-guts Starship Troopers garden-variety sci-fi novel. There are a few well-written battles, with some very satisfying violence, but they're more in there to satisfy the military theme, it seemed to me. The main thrust of the story is to let the reader take a glimpse through a window to the not-too-distant future...and what a thoroughly horrifying future it is! You think &quot;political correctness&quot; is annoying now? Its the life-force of the US-of-A in the future. Leadership is geared towards personal gain, not the well-being of the grunts. Like it was mentioned in a previous review, the grunts are considered nothing more than expendable hardware, there to bleed and get the job done, make money for the American corporations and promotions for the officers. Personal initiative is often rewarded by a position on the front-line under some very intense fire.Character development was outstanding! You really get to see inside the mind of a compentent Sergeant and his troops, seeing what makes them tick and getting a feel for that which every military man, since the first military was formed, has felt, that special something that keeps you going in the face of astronomical odds and bumbling incompetents.All in all, I thought this was a very excellent book! A &quot;must-read&quot; if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking Sci-Fi...or even if you're not! I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"From what I've been told by my ex-army buddies this is about as accurate as it comes in terms of laying out army life.

Stark's war is a great addition to anyone's library. Its a cross between military fiction and science fiction.

I loved it!"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"Back when paperback science-fiction was young, Ace Books came up with the idea of a double paperback. In theory it was two books in the same binding, bit opposite to each other so that the reader would consider one cover to front one book and the other cover for the other. One of the books might be a full-length novel, but the other was often a novella reprinted from the pages of a science-fiction magazine - there were many of those back in the day. Ace charged $0.35 for one of these doubles as opposed to the standard $0.25 that every publisher charged for a regular paperback. (See what going off the gold standard did to our money?) It made Ace more money and the extra dime usually supported an up and coming author like Poul Anderson who was still writing for the pulps in those days.Stark's War is a novella. It's 245 pages long (padded out to 271 by judicious use of editorial matter and division into \\"sections\\" each of which allows for 2 more pages that have no fiction on them, just a title. There are two more books, we are told, in the series. This one tells of a mildly interesting character, Ethan Stark, who finding himself as a sergeant in a military gone insane, convinces every other sergeants in a lunar occupation force to rebel on the battlefield and incarcerate all of their officers. At the end of the book, Stark is preparing to withstand invasions from Earth as the attempt to restore the status quo. Presumably by the end of the third book, their will be some sort of resolution.Interestingly, though there are lieutenants, captains, majors, colonels and generals in this novel, the author seems unaware that there are many different levels of sergeant in the armed forces of every country, including the U.S. all the way up to Command Sergeant Major, a lofty rank that most three-stripers cannot aspire to. But in this future service, all distinctions have disappeared for some reason and there are only generic sergeants.I read the story with some interest. Although strong on plot and weak on character, Hemry capture the reader's attention with both his view of the story and the machinations of the military. Unfortunately, having captured it ultimately backfires as it becomes obvious that this novel does not stand alone but is simply one segment of a story which will cost another $16.00 to read all the way through. It could be argued that this puffing up of a novella into a stand alone book by Ace is the logical follow-up to the double-novels of the 50's. But I cannot help feeling that charging $8.00 for a piece of work that has a beginning and the beginning of a middle, but nothing else, is a rip-off."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"If you like the camaraderie of military fiction and the adventure of outer space, you'll enjoy this series! Stark is a talented, experienced noncom pushed into ever higher levels of responsibility and leadership. His skills as a leader are obvious, though he manages to remain believably human. We're spared the aggravating omnipotence or crippling self-doubt so prevalent to sudden heroes -- Stark is a man simply doing what is needed.Also, while providing enough information about battle armor and weapons to satisfy the tech wizards among us, and bring the moonscape to life, Hemry's descriptions don't require the reader to have an engineering degree. He makes the hardware interesting and integral to the story, not a substitution for plot and character. Reminded me of my favorite Heinleins. ;-)"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"The nom de plume of Jack Campbell delivered the interesting , science geek oriented, \`Lost Fleet' franchise. The 'Lost Fleet' was stocked with believable scientific abstracts and developed logically consequential strategies and tactics. \`Lost Fleet' has been a gritty tale and highly entertaining for readers interested in good science in Sci-Fi. Jack Campbell reveals the talent of an experienced (or well tutored) scientist or techie engaged in realistic extrapolation. I pre-order and anxiously await the next installment of \`Lost Fleet'. On other basic writing levels, Campbell's character development is rather sterile and the good vs bad guys are unnaturally opposites in pursuit of expectations and driven by blind motivations that diminishes the stories overall quality. There are periodic, cumbersome narrative diversions into politics, economics, and the consideration of \`average bloke' versus the system. These curious diversions distract from Campbell's real expertise of extrapolating the technology of warfare with a good story. These foibles do not significantly detract from 'Lost Fleet' but are noticeable.In shopping around for another space opera, the Stark's War trilogy under Jack Campbell's new nom de plume of John Hemry was my reason to give Stark's War a whirl.Hamby's writing takes a decidedly different turn from Campbell. First, the good ... the hypothetical not-to-distant technology of lunar warfare is painstakingly envisioned and enjoyable. No magic weaponology. The first quarter of the book is promising. Our hero, Sgt Ethan Stark is a career, up through the ranks mil (military) enlisted guy. His non-mil childhood experience are not so positive in the families commercial fishing enterprise. By the end of the first half of the book a solid image of man-on-the-moon combat technology is well done and as craftily as the \`Lost Fleet'.Then the book changes rather dramatically and unpredictably. Stark's War #1 was written in 2000 long before the current economic meltdown. In a 2012 context, Sgt Stark's world view is a rage-against-the-machine hero who's target is anything and everybody associated with the military-industrial complex, officers and command motivations, a caste system like segregation of ranks and a basic bias for thoroughly believing that officers expend enlisted personal for personal career gain. Stark's rule #1 ... never trust command. Add to this mix absurdly irrational corporate greed, worthless politicians beholden to big corp and civilians, who are generally unknown but most probably \`enemies' to Stark's (Hambry's) Darwinian view of 22nd century human society and you get Occupy Wall Street taking he reigns of civilization.Sgt Stark very much appears to be the embodiment of a 2012 OWS protestor and heroically assuming 4-star level command through mutiny to 'run' the Moon the OWS way. The ending, a 22nd century OWS victory, is completely predictable at a little past half way. The narrative of the Sgt Starks transformation into 'world peace' rebellion is bad writing. Hamby crosses the line into hyperbole and propaganda as if it's right out of the front pages of 2012. Is the average OWS protestor \`qualified' or \`capable' to run the Moon? Do we desire to be led by the OWS 'principles'? Indeed, yes we do for Hambry as that is Stark's War's premise. If you can imagine that an OWS protestor is the right guy to run the expansive Moon society, this is a read for you.It's curious that the anti-hypocrisy 'money' of Stark's ranting's is not born out in Hamby's own exercise of hypocrisy with his greedy big corp publisher. This is a faux-trilogy deviously short on pages and segmented into 3 installments to maximize revenues. The reader will be hard pressed not to conclude that a $/word contract is in operation. At $8/per installment, Hamby stands to reap a $24 revenue for what should otherwise be a single $8 book. This trilogy is by no means a $24 space opera craftsmanship. I read volume 1 cover to cover in 5-6 hours with interruptions. The OWS-like screeds can be bypassed to accomplish the read to 4 hours.It's an average book at best but a fun read if one skips the author's 1-2 page editorial opinions. However, the publisher pricing dupe is ridiculously transparent. Hamby queues up his screeds in a fashion that alerts the reader that he's about to exit story and enter the screed mode.Whoever is actually writing these books is extraordinarily nave and damaged by experiences that stunted maturity. In Stark's War, the author disses everyone but the enlisted soldier. My own experience in the defense technology domain among joint government and civilian scientists, corporations operating under federal regulations and overseen by competent gov't employees and the quality, leadership and camaraderie between enlisted's and the officer corps reveals a very different reality to me after 40-some years. Hamby might get the science but completely misses the boat in how the people and organizational side of the equation work."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"On time, enjoy his books &#34;To seize the moon from foreign powers--and keep his men alive&#34; The best, keeping you on the edges"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"John Henry's (aka Jack Campbell) first book in this trilogy is quite good.

Stark, on the other hand, seems to have been the author's getting-up-to-speed series. The scifi element is thinly placed over a whole lot of less than fascinating soldiers-in-the-barracks scenarios. And yet there was enough plot interest to keep me reading. I much prefer the descriptions Hemry (a.k.a Jack Campbell) does with the light-speed traveling space ships of the Lost Fleet to the ground battles fought on the moon in Stark's War, but if you're short on adventure/military scifi, this short series will fill the bill for an evening or two of escapism.A heads up: In this book, Hemry hits hard with a few political messages which may or may not suit his readers' views. Authors do this all the time, and with enough finesse, it's okay. Hemry makes his points much more creatively in the Lost Fleet books. As I said before, this was obviously an early entry in his career. His skills have sharpened with each new book."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"This is one book of 3.

It's really not their fault as they are micro managed by the next step up the military ladder and those at that level are in fact micromanaged by their bosses.The big bosses rotate through every 6 months to add another location to their resume in their quest for promotion. Now that a direct video feed is available from troops in the field there must be action action action. Even if it has to be created at the expense of the lives of those involved. After all, good ratings make for faster promotions and field staff are just assets to be used to attain your promotional goals.On a regular basis Stark sort of inprovises, particularly as it relates to the 12 people in his squad, and he has been successful to this point. However the current campaign involves throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy with the intent of shocking them. That really doesn't work on the moon as thousands of troops who are advancing on order, are slaughtered with even more put forward as sacrifices.Stark endures it for a short period of time but soon feels compelled to act before everyone else dies.To what ends will Stark move ?Is Stark leadership material or just a hot head ?Is the new strategy, unsuccessfully used by Napolean, actualy going to work on the moon ?Lots of top class military sci fi from one of the best in the fieldHighly recommended book and seriesOther two books in the trilogy are Stark's Command and Stark's Crusade"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"Stark's War was classic Jack Campbell (John Hemry) and is a very good military science fiction page turner. Set in the near future in which corporate America, already in charge of the world's wealth, hungers for more, and more is found, among the growing mining and manufacture industries of the moon. America's military has shrunk in size and grown in quality, over stretch at enforcing the Pax on Earth, now they are tasked with taking the moon away from the other powers by force. And all the while the high command keeps an eye on ratings. In fact, that was one of the best ideas in the book, as military campaigns are planned based on their media ratings potential, regardless of sound military strategy and tactics, or their cost in human lives. Not the greatest military science fiction novel ever, but definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"This Military Sci Fi novel from the author of \`The Lost Fleet' series sees the USA reigning over Earth as the last surviving superpower, economically and militarily supreme. Seeking to build a society free of American influence, foreign countries have inhabited the moon. Now America has raised its gaze once more, and the US military has been ordered to return and wrest control of the new colony.Sergeant Ethan Stark must train his squadron to fight a desperate enemy in an airless atmosphere at one-sixth of normal gravity. Ensuring his team's survival means choosing which orders to obey and which to ignore...This may be science fiction but the way in which Hemry presents everything makes it all perfectly feasible with its world where governments are controlled by corporations and the public are entertained by footage of soldiers fighting a long way from home having eerie echoes of our contemporary world. Although Hemry has said his books take the \`what if?' scenario to its logical conclusions, this has much to say about us now as it does on a potential near future version of our world.This is war from a \`grunt's eye' perspective and the rugged and uncompromising Stark is perfectly placed as the central protagonist in telling it as it is.When war is seen as entertainment with civilian ratings and viewing figures a concern and a constant battle for meagre resources at stake this is a cynical and dangerous world. Stark represents the last of the honourable soldiers who find themselves in the middle of an ugly and unwanted conflict. He is like many others an unwitting pawn of a greedy and self serving government and military.Amidst all the combat and world weary cynicism there is gallows humour, banter, camaraderie, loyalty and valour. These soldiers are likeable and believable characters, portrayed as fallible human beings who miss their homes and question their orders from top brass.Despite being set in space in the near future it is clear that Hemry has researched the technology and attempted to keep his novel within the realms of believability as much as possible.The cynicism, gloom and mistrust for bureaucracy that pervades the novel manage to create tension and a dark tone. You can sense the outrage and the desperation of the men and women as they fight side by side for a cause they do not entirely believe in and for people who do not necessarily understand or care what they are fighting for.The military and the media are always trying to put their own spin on things whilst characters like Stark, Vic Reynolds, Sanchez and Mendoza try to make sense of it all whilst trying their best to survive the battles and the questionable decisions of those that outrank them.\`Stark's War' is gripping, stirring boys own stuff with lots of desperate, frenetic, pulsing action as well as managing to be both poignant and thoughtful which is some achievement.This delivers on many levels and it is not trying to be a polemic or another glossy sci fi adventure, rather it is a chillingly feasible look at the mindset of the military, governments and the media in an all too conceivable future.Faceless bureaucrats deciding the fates of thousands sent into danger a long way from home will certainly resonate with a contemporary readership. If Bernard Cornwell gave literature Napoleonic soldier Richard Sharpe, then John G. Hemry has succeeded in giving us a noble warrior of the future in Ethan Stark."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"Stark is faced with the problem of his superiors working only for promotion, using the soldiers as pawns without considering their lives, and ignoring input from the people on the front who really know what is going on. I've never served on active duty in the military, but I related completely. It was simple to replace the military in my mind with corporate America, their dehumanization of the workforce as \\"resources,\\" and their casual disregard for our livelihoods.If you are looking for a lot of heart-pounding action, you probably won't enjoy this book. However, if you like action mixed with accurate predictions of the future, give Stark's War a read. It's a short book, but the thoughts and predictions packed into it eerily reflect what is happening today, and not just in the military. I laughed out loud at some points, not because what was happening was necessarily funny, but because it was so true.My two biggest complaints with book were the time jumps and characterization. I have a hard time investing in a story when years pass between scenes. Also, the theme Hemry was trying to convey took over his characters so thoroughly in some cases that I felt like I was reading about talking heads reciting a script.Regardless, this is a good book and I would recommend it, if only because the series gets better, and Hemry's points are well made and accurate."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"Starks War has all the action, drama, and science fiction that anyone in the military and not would just love. This book kept me on edge for hours. The perfect length for any book, it leaves you letting you know there is much to come in the second and third books of the series, which I did purchase 85 pages into the first.

Not quite up the the standards of modern military sci-fi."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"An incisive biting novel with persuasive characters. Timely; not a simple shoot-em-up war game, but a story with important messages about politics and the military and the uneasy relationship between loyalty and patriotism. Hemry has created characters I wish I could meet at the bar for an evening or two. My treat."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"I've enjoyed the \\"Lost Fleet\\" series that Hemry writes under the pen-name of Jack Campbell, so I thought I'd check out his other series. Unfortunately, \\"Stark's War\\" doesn't live up to Blackjack Geary's universe in any way. Other reviews can fill you in on the details, but Sgt. Ethan Stark is an honorable man stuck in an intolerable system. That could have led to some interesting conflict, but virtually everyone above the rank of sergeant in this universe is a one-dimensional character, and an idiot at that. Hemry creates a dystopia in which the corporations run everything, including the gov't, and officers are only concerned about getting their tickets punched to move on to the next steps in their careers. There is maybe one officer who tries to do something moral, and she disappears quickly. The result is that our \\"hero\\" fights against straw men (and women), and that's not a very satisfying read for most of us.The first part of the book is mostly backstory that establishes Hemry's view of what's wrong with the military and the political system generally. It's told mostly through dialogue between Sgt. Stark and his comrades. Unfortunately those parts feel a little like being stuck in a bar or on a plane next to someone who is spouting their one-sided view of everything that's wrong with the world. With a few exceptions, even the combat scenes are relativley flat, since it's rare to actually see an enemy combatant in this high-tech world. It isn't until page 238 of a 260-page book that things get interesting. That is where Stark decides to try to save a squad of soldiers who are being sacrificed to the latest \\"brilliant idea\\" of a General sitting comfortably behind the lines, sending soldiers to certain and useless death. Not to give away the details, but Stark decides to do the right thing, despite direct orders (yet again) and goes to save the dying soldiers. To his surprise, his actions lead to a wider mutiny. The last 20 or so pages were quite interesting, and it made me realize that what I thought was just a long streak of poor writing was actually a setup for the next two books in the series. I've seen this before from other authors, and always feel a bit cheated/deceived. The best authors write books that fit into a series/universe, but also stand on their own well. This book certainly does NOT do that. I'm not sure if I'll read the others in this series or not--don't want to encourage this kind of behavior! I'll need to check the reviews to see if the 2nd and 3rd books are stronger, now that I've spent the time to lay the foundation for what COULD be an intersting world.So is this book worth reading? On its own, no. IF the series picks up from here and tackles the hard questions, it could be an interesting series. But if it is more one-dimensional \\"everyone is a self-centered idiot except the noncommissioned enlisted man\\", it is a major disappointment. There are too many good books out there to spend time on this kind of thing.My recommendation for an author/series that does it right: Lois McMaster Bujold and her Vorkosigan universe. Her characters are three (or more!) dimensional and fun. They face challenging issues on multiple levels. There is good, old-fashioned, fun space opera there, but also other genres (she consciously wrote these characters into mystery, romance, comedy, spy, and other genres along the way). Her Miles Vorkosigan character is one of the best I've run across in decades of sci-fi (and other) reading. I recommend that you start with her \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" which includes the first two novels in the series. Get past the somewhat slow first chapters and I think you'll find some very interesting characters and situations. But the series really takes off with Cordelia's son Miles. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"I thought some of the actions of the hero were a bit unbelievable, but I enjoyed the book a lot.Having lived through many a confusing presentation on the latest fantastic innovations in managing Software development teams, I thought thelecture on \\"Military Synergy\\" towards the end of the book was particularly hilarious.Three of the trends portrayed in the future in which this book takes place:government run for and by the corporations,the US military used as a fire brigade by the corporations,and the complete isolation of the military population from the civilian populationseem quite prescient when one looks over the last ten years of unending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Officers micromanaging enlisted men seems like a real possibility too given the direction military technology is taking.I thought the author must have been influenced by the War in Iraq, but then I saw the copyright was 2000.

Sandwiched betweenthese three brief, interesting battles are pages on pages of thoughts and dialog that are extremely sterotypical on how civilians can't possibly understand a military individual and officers are all idiots.The book is entertaining enough, but I wish Mr. Hemry would have evolved the brief glimpses of the struggle for the moon into a whole book."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"This book is a decent read, it takes a situation which many have postulated (corporations taking over control) and carried it to a satirical extreme. The situation portrayed of a military hwere the officers are mostly interested in advancing in rank, have no concept of their jobs, duties and responsibilities is wildly overplay. UNfortunately, from my experience and my brother's in the army, there are a few officers like the ones in this book. Thankfully not a lot. The book kept me interested in the lead character and his response to the end. Like in the real military, it is the NCOs who keep everything moving in the right direction and take care of the men. A good book to read on a trip, where you have no distractions."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"Like another reviewer, I read \\"Lost Fleet\\" first and agree that it's MUCH more even in terms of Hemry's writing. Hemry writes under the pen name, Jack Campbell, in the \\"Lost Fleet\\" series for those of you who do not already know. \\"Stark's War\\" stumbles here and there and the characterizations are a bit sketchy in places. Lot's of military stereotypes. However, this shouldn't deter you from reading the novel. I'd say that reading the Stark series is essential for anyone reading the \\"Lost Fleet\\" novels, since the books really give insight into the author's thinking. While the \\"Lost Fleet\\" novels provide commentary on military leadership, ethics, and values, \\"Stark's War\\" is a fairly strong commentary on the modern military (including leadership) and it's role in society at large. It's also fun to read and a pleasant way to spend a lazy Summer afternoon. If only it was still in print and easier to obtain! It was worth the search.

I was pretty much surprised, which makes this book worth reading. Basically, Stark is a warrior fighting a war that is run by people who don't know war and politicians backed by American companies. Everything takes place from the point of view of Stark, and although there are a few time lags that are annoying, it comes out well. It is the old 'don't want to be a hero just save my men' kind of hero story, where he only tries to do what is right and ends up getting far more than he wants. The action is pretty good, and interesting, even involving some armored (tanks) combat. If you are looking for some fun on the moon and some rebelious action against your (insane) superiors then Stark's War is for you."},{"Title":"Stark's War (Stark's War, Book 1)","review":"as soon as i finished the lost fleet series, i began to look for other books by john hemry! i have not been disappointed."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"For decades now, THE MIND OF THE SOUTH by Cash has been THE consummate statement of the South. Anyone who wants to understand the South or the southern mind must read it. Don't shut the cover because you think it might be dated."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"W. J. Cash's The Mind of the South (1941) examines southern society and thought between colonial times and 1940. According to Cash, the role of the frontier is what influenced southern society and made the section different from other parts of the country. The South remained in the frontier stage for a large part of its ante-bellum history. The essence of the frontier is competition. This competitive spirit of the ruling class (which sought to tame the land and build plantations) and the nature of life on the frontier contributed to an intense individualism. The plantation system developed by the ruling class essentially perpetuated frontier conditions and individualism. The tradition of the old backcountry also contributed to an intense distrust of any exercise of authority.Cash also develops the themes of the conflict with the Yankee and southern defensiveness on the issue of slavery. The will to victory over the Yankee led to the development of the southern passion for politics and rhetoric. The Civil War made southerners more self-conscious and unified than ever before. Cash asserts that during Reconstruction the South overcame the frontier that the Yankee tried to impose on the defeated Confederate states. To summarize, the role of the frontier, southern defensiveness, and the conflict with the Yankee are the dominant themes in The Mind of the South."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Fascinating and comprehensive analysis of the southern states, our culture and thinking up to World War II.

I found my thought processes and feelings on loyalty versus what is logically right were quite different from my new friends who had been raised in the southern tradition.This book does an incredibly good job of explaining the phenomenon."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Cash gives a fairly objective history and calm, respectful, clear-minded critique of the South while advocating that the South become more liberal, realist, secular, intellectual, and socialist, as these things were understood in 1940. Cash was for the dissident academics who stood up for secularism and evolution. He was not a fire breathing radical, but he did advocate ameliorating poverty by accepting unions and raising wages. He disapproved of the southern individualism of \\"every man for himself\\" and \\"winners take all\\" in which all responsibility for wealth and well-being was up to the individual and not to any collective good will. Even when jobs were scarce and labor was at a surplus, southerners often demanded that the unemployed \\"root or starve\\".He says that the reasons why the north would not let the south secede was that they wanted a united nation under a tariff set by the north and more importantly, they wanted to make the south more like the rest of the nation, which meant getting rid of slavery for starters.Cash gives more examples of characteristics of the south. One being that there is an air of unreality here in which the inhabitants become caught up in emotional, irrational, and superstitious thinking. He thought the influence of living with blacks had something to do with white's behavior in the south, saying that the blacks are most romantic and hedonistic of the races. He thought that the Southern planters would not have seceded if they had thought more clearly about how it was inevitably against their interests to do so, but they could not because of unrealistic thinking, which meant that any Southerner could whip ten Yankees easily.The south is also known to be romantic and sentimental. Cash did not like the Southern Agrarians and movies like Gone With The Wind because they perpetuated the idea of sentimental and romantic South of legend, not reality. He also that the Agrarians were wrong in assuming that the South wanted to remain an agricultural society forever, but actually embraced industry after the Civil War.The south is known as an elitist society by choice amongst all classes. The lower classes often looked up to their leaders reverently as they were often the heroes of the Civil War or were Cotton Mill entrepreneurs that were going to save the South's economy. Hence, there was not much of a class conscience in the South and the workers continued to be exploited as cheap labor and were denounced as traitors to the South if they went on strike. It was often believed that any poor man could become successful if he just worked hard enough. Before the Civil War, poor whites lived on the poor land, as the rich planters had bought up all the good land. Poor whites did not do much other than hunt hogs, grow corn, and drink bust head. After the Civil War, the poor whites were put to work in the Cotton mills and they worked long hours from an early age for low wages and lived in towns owned by the company. Still, their housing was better than in the past and it was free. The elitism of the south was not frowning and arrogant; the leaders had a kindly, paternalistic but patronizing way of communicating with poor whites that diffused tensions. In a sense, the rich and poor whites were equals, as the blacks were considered inferior. Poor whites were also often cousins of rich whites.There is a good statement from Cash at the end that sums up southern characteristics nicely: \\"Proud, brave, honorable by its lights, courteous, personally generous, loyal, swift to act, often too swift, but signally effective, sometimes terrible, in its action--such was the South at its best. And such at its best it remains today, despite the great falling away in some of its virtues. Violence, intolerance, suspicion towards new ideas, an incapacity for analysis, an inclination to act from feeling rather than thought, an exaggerated individualism and a too narrow concept of social responsibility, attachment to fictions and false values, above all, too great attachment to racial values and a tendency to justify cruelty and injustice in the name of those values, sentimentality and lack of realism--these have been the characteristic vices in the past. And despite changes for the better, they remain its characteristic vices today. \\"So that is the criticism dished out from one son of the South, albeit a rather unusually liberal one. Is he still in the family?"},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Written in the stilted pedantically formal style of the 1940s, Cash's description of the South is both full of surprises and reaffirms some of the worse stereotypes of the southern way of life. His manuscript divides the South into three frontiers: pre-Civil War; reconstruction and its aftermath; and the era of industrialization. The reader cannot avoid noting the many parallels between Cash and Frederick Jackson's frontier hypothesis of the American West. But he will also note that Cash's version has the added twist of applying an economic theory to the southern way of life. In short, the author engages in his own kind of southern romanticism. By seeing sees the frontier as an economic opportunity for southern expansion, I believe that the idea of expanding slavery to the new territories gets sidestepped in Cash's narrative.In the first section, dealing with the pre-Civil War South, the author rejects the quaint notion that southern planters were linked to British royalty via the English Cavaliers, and asserts instead that they were mostly poor \\"risk-takers\\" who happened to get lucky and were then able to work their way up through the ranks. One would have to dig deeply into the history of the early settlers to confirm or deny this thesis. He also rejects the syrupy \\"Gone with the Wind\\" mythology of southern gentility and readily admits that the south was four-squares backwards, with little interest in academics, philosophy, and scholarship, few men of letters, and being congenitally wedded to slavery, which in Cash's view was a complete economic failure.As for the Civil War itself, Cash agrees with many others that while the North did indeed win the shooting war, the will, mind and the anti-democratic values and political tactics of the South not only survived intact, but also were reinforced and fortified. With the leadership of the South after Reconstruction being made up mostly of officers in the Confederate Army, the old racist order in the South returned with a vengeance, and with the exception of a name change, so too did slavery. \\"Sharecropping\\" and other economic ruses, including vigilantism and the jailing blacks on any pretext, including being unable to prove that they worked for a planter, made the transition from slavery to a new modified form of extended paternalism, one smooth sociological operation.Today, 72 years after the book was published, the fact that the South may have lost the shooting war but won the only war worth winning, the cultural civil war, is even more true than during the time the book was published: It is not an exaggeration to suggest that it is the Old South's values that represent the core philosophy of today's Republican Party. Its emphasis on \\"states rights\\" over Federal rights; its focus on freedom from the federal government by individuals; yet its contradictory demand for conformity on social issues such as abortion and seeing inside the bedrooms of everyone, or gay rights, and its opposition to any policies that African Americans support, suggest that the conservative Republican's platform has all its roots firmly planted in post-Reconstruction \\"Old South\\" politics and sentiments.In the third part of the book we see the 19th Century come to a close with textile mills, banking and light industry replacing southern plantations. However, the southern racial order of paternalism that kept blacks at the bottom of the \\"pecking order,\\" continued. It did so by making the poor white worker strike a bargain with the racist devil. That devil made him think that he was better off remaining emotionally superior to blacks with slave wages than being equal to them with much have higher wages. By augmenting the slave wages of poor white workers with an emotional currency called racism, the southern Mills were able to compete on par with their northern counterparts, and in addition, were also able to keep labor unions out of the South.The bargain with the racist devil was an insanely dumb and counterintuitive bargain that still exists today: When offered the chance to improve their economic status by joining with blacks politically, or by voting against their own economic interests simply to see blacks remain in their familiar inferior position, poor whites will opt for the latter every time. That is to say, they will elect to chop of their own economic legs at the knees rather than see blacks draw equal to them. Arguably, (at least since the Nixon Southern Strategy of 1968) without this pact with the racist devil, there would be no Republican Party.In summary, much of Cash's interpretation of the southern mind has to do with holding contradictory or paradoxical views in the mind at the same time: To wit, the South both embraced progressive movements, yet it was reluctant to give up its pet conservative ideas even though they hurts southerners as a whole. Also, a tendency toward both hedonism and Puritanism is a strain that runs from beginning to end throughout southern thinking. Religiously, even the Methodists in the South were steeped in a stern kind of Calvinism, yet there was also an undercurrent of free-will theology. The southern conservative canon focuses on freedom of the individual, yet at the same time it demands conformity on issues that deal with what goes on in the sanctity of the bedrooms of every individual.Throughout the era of the author's study, a caste system existed in the South. It changed, from planter, to confederate officer, to mill boss, to inner city policemen, to today's Southern Bank Managers and CEOs. But structurally it remains essentially the same as in 1940 even today. This is the same system that blocked the rise of an egalitarian populist movement in the late 19th century, one that essentially ended with the Bacon rebellion, which would have brought together poor whites and blacks to fight the corporate industrialists for a better economic stake in America. Instead, even today poorer whites continue to throw their lot in with the wealthy corporatists, even when they see that their respective interests continually clash, and even when they see that they continually get the raw end of the stick..For the \\"Old South\\" as for the \\"new South,\\" there is no value higher than \\"keeping black people down,\\" that is to say \\"in there place.\\" The race card still trumps all, that is the long and the short of southern history, whether 1940 or 2013.

Some neo-Southerners call Cash a South-hater, but they miss the point; Cash wanted desperately to love The South, but could find little to love except myth. You get much the same with Woodward, though in finer clothes. &quot;Strange Career&quot; is nothing but myth, yet it propelled Woodward to the heights of the Academy. The key to both these books is that they are Yankee approved mythology. The publishing houses are not on Peachtree Street, they are on 5th Avenue. For anyone wishing to begin exploration of Southern thought, Cash, the Nashville Agrarians, and Strange Career are the places to start. If you go no further, you won't know anything about The South, but to go further, you must start here."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"I am the author of Rising Tide, another book about the South, and the greatest compliment paid to me so far was by someone who compared my book to this brilliant book. Cash's work is certainly one of the most insightful inquiries ever written about any region, any where, by anyone. Some of Samuel Johnson's work about his travels into the Scottish Highlands comes to mind as comparable, but I can't think of any other. In fact, the southerners Cash wrote about are often descended from that same stock.Then of course there's the personal tragedy of the author's suicide. If you want to understand America, you have to read this book.A good counterpoint to this is William Alexander Percy's Lantenrs on the Levee, published the same year and also still in print. Cash writes about rednecks; Percy writes about aristocrats, chiefly his own family who considered being called &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; an insult. They, after all, were descended from the Norman conquerors nof the Anglo-Saxons."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"This book was suggested to me by an American History professor 10 years ago. Just recently did I get around to reading it, however, and I must say that it is an impressive analysis of the white Southern mind-set leading up to the Civil War and through the Depression. I believe that many of the same thought processes hold true to this day particularly with all the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag and its inclusion in state flags (MS, SC, GA etc) in addition to the national shift of power to Southern conservatives in the Congress last decade. The book describes the political, religious, economic and social distinctions of the South in psychological terms and often in Jungian fashion showing opposites in existence together (i.e.- hedonism and refinement, morality and slavery/Jim Crow, etc). I have lived in the South most of my life and was glad to have 'rediscovered' this interesting book. Cash's writing style is difficult to follow at first- somewhat meandering and flowery (and intentionally humorous in some cases), but his insights are very modern and relevant in today's American society. ... Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Since Reconstruction, works of Southern history and, in this case, sociology have usually fallen into two distinct genres. The first tends to reinforce the popular Old South mythology with exaggerated, romantic imagery as inspired by an emotional attachment to the &quot;Lost Cause.&quot; The second is a reaction to the first. The revisionists, always irritated by the chauvinism of Southern popular mythology, want to convince you that Southern mythology is exactly that--a myth. The most violent of the revisionists will have you believe that romantic images of the Old South are fundamentally fictional--an image created by the Southern propagandists eager to create only the most flattering cultural portrait. For the record, THE MIND OF THE SOUTH falls more into the second category than the first. In fact, all of the works of Southern history and sociology that we now consider &quot;classic&quot; are more critical and revisionist than romantic. The non-fiction works of Cash, Odum, and C. Vann Woodward, and the fiction of Ellen Glasgow are all appreciated throughout the country for their critical views of what we call the Old South. It has become nearly equivalent in Southern studies to call a work both revisionist and worthy of praise. The ideas are, unfortunately, redundant. One's appreciation for things Southern all but negates one's credibility as a serious scholar. But the problem with extreme revisionism, and with the Cash work in particular, is that it has you believe that Southern mythology is SO fictional that it is nearly arbitrary. It wants you to believe that popular Southern imagery is a product of ignornace rather than careful consideration of the evidence. There is a difference between calling mythology an exaggeration, as the best works of William C. Davis, John Shelton Reed and Edward L. Ayers do, and calling it patently false, as the works of C. Vann Woodward and W. J. Cash do. This is the challenging question for any revisionist: If the popular view you are trying to de- and reconstruct is false, why (and how) was it originally created? And more critically, if all of history is just a social construction, what makes your take on things innately more accurate than mine? It seems to me that popular mythology must have some grain of truth, for it would not have developed as it did from nothing. It must be based on something that really exists. This idea, of course, is violently rejected by most post-modern historians who believe that ALL of history is nothing more than a social construction. For those sympathetic to that view, this book will appeal to you. To those looking for some insights into the factual basis for a Southern creation myth, you'd do better to read Ayers, Davis, or Reed. These fine historians are able to treat the topic with a sensitive balance of critical insight and popular appreciation.Published in 1941, one can't help but think that THE MIND OF THE SOUTH is an iconoclastic reaction to the immense popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND, released in 1939."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"W. J. Cash is hard to pin down. Liberals, from C. Vann Woodward to Nell Painter, seem to have little use for him. Conservatives, like Donald Davidson and the other Southern agrarians, also had little use for Cash. Yet Cash's book is still in print and being read sixty five years after his suicide. There are reasons for this. First there is the unique Cash style. In his excellent introduction, Bertram Wyatt-Brown advises the reader to imagine Cash as a country lawyer presenting a case in court or perhaps sitting in the town square swapping stories with friends. There is much merit to this advice. Cash's style is often folksy, sometimes sarcastic and, at other times, completely his own as he summons unique and usually spot on phrases to describe aspects of Southern culture. Cash is a product of his time though he does not spend that much time on the Old South and rather focuses his energy on \\"The Frontier the Yankee Made.\\" But do not think Cash is an old South apologist. He has little use for the hagiographic tradition of the Dunning school or the Nashville circle of Agrarians and his book clearly reflects it.But Cash is no traditional liberal either. He was a man of his time and place as is shown in his comments on race on gender. Cash clearly feels that continuity was the chief hallmark of the Southern past and shows it again and again, from the planters leading the \\"man at the center\\" in the Old South to the lack of success of the labor movement in the 20's and 30's.Cash's interests as a newspaperman are also reflected in his book. Cash handled book reviews and foreign affairs editorials during his tenure at The Charlotte News. His comments on authors and books remain some of the more interesting and lively parts of his magnum opus. The threat of tyranny, which Cash wrote about in great length in his columns, was on Cash's mind as he wrote the book as can clearly be seen in the last pages.If somewhat dated, Cash's book remains one of the most interesting and controversial looks at the South. While often critical of his home region, Cash remains very attached to it and its virtues. Above all, Cash believed in the South as a unique and interesting region. In this age of mass communications and moving around the country, Southerners looking to understand their region before its completely submerged into a common culture should look at Cash. For if the South is to survive, it will not be a sense of place, it will be a sense of mind. In an era when we can order the same food, listen to the same music, watch the same television in Asheville, Oak Park, Denver and Trenton, Cash may be more important than ever to Southern survival."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"What makes the South unique as a region has virtually disappeared since this book was researched and written. What Cash describes is what made the South unique to begin with -- its blend of agrarian culture, 18th century British cavalier society, and Scottish individualism. As Cash writes, \\"the Southern world, you will remember, was basically an extremely uncomplex, unvaried and unchanging one.\\" How the South approached the complexities of the modern era, and dealt with the ideas of industrialization and multiculturalism, is not his focus. Certainly the book should be read in the context of its times (America had yet to enter World War II) and with the realization that much has changed since then. His book is not an apology, nor is he blind to the clash of racial and social issues that the Civil War and subsequent Reconstruction left unresolved, either. The fact that Cash's work has been vilified and re-evaluated over many years, even by the reviews here, is an indication that the concepts and issues he described more than sixty years ago are still debated today -- a true picture of the mind of the South in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"The nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the Outsider's incorrect perceptions or the Insider's preconceptions, depending on which is constructing the definition. What we find with W.J. Cash's The Mind of the South is no different, although it is a pleasant journey. Sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing, Cash's work deserves recognition for this reason alone; yet there is value in the exposition itself, even if it forgets a full two-thirds of the South's population in its description (blacks and women). What the modern reader is left with, then, is not so much a description of the \\"the southern mind\\" as it is \\"the white southern male mind.\\" And while Cash's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind, it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the American South, with a small dash of glory added for good measure.First, it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by Bertram Wyatt-Brown. Wyatt-Brown shows that Cash's battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the South, as was his upbringing. Wyatt-Brown seems to agree with my assessment on the Insider/Outsider effect:\\"The origins of Cash's interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of Southern intransigence about issues of race and change, but in the very makeup of his mind. Like so many creative depressives, he stood apart from the society around him. Such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society cannot obtain (Cash xxvii).\\"Wyatt-Brown, with this statement, makes Cash an outside-Insider, by virtue of his being a manic depressive. He is a southerner, and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner; however, according to Wyatt-Brown, by reason of his mental condition, he is elevated away from this status and into a new status altogether, a presumably better one. I would agree with this, if the work itself is to be taken as proof. Cash is capable of wonderful insights into his own culture and society. However - and this is crucial! - we must not gloss over the fact that by omitting women and blacks from his work, Cash loses some credibility. It is here, it seems, that Cash could not escape the Insider mentality.This work is characterized by one over-arching theme: southern culture, though as elusive in most respects as any other, is penetrated throughout with one defining and collective temperament. In essence, this work is interpretative rather than linear, as it attempts to analyze rather than delineate. This elevates Cash from the traditional historian (in the mold of Clement Eaton) to sociologist or social commentator (in the mold of David Halberstam). That is not to say that Cash does not know his history or pilfers it from others; it seems impossible after reading The Mind of the South for one to imagine Cash using such smooth language while pulling facts from anywhere outside his own mind. The disjointed quality usually apparent in any attempt to fuse sources without an overall voice is thankfully absent. Cash is who we hear while we read, and it is his elucidative brush-strokes that paint the image of the Southerner.Much is left out of this short review of Cash's work, as brevity is a consideration. A more complex examination of the work would require many more words than I have time for at the moment. But I do feel obligated to at least sum up the trajectory of Cash's masterpiece. The first few chapters lay the groundwork for Cash's southern temperament - individualistic, violent, quasi-aristocratic, provincial, just to name a few - while the remainder of the work displays the evolution of that temperament while it is worked upon by forces both outside it and from within, and its own natural need to adapt. The Yankee plays his part, as does Uncle Tom and the fugitive slave, the southern belle and the Garrison abolitionist, the carpet-bagger and the scalawag, the confederate soldier and the lynch mob, the fire-eater and the bible-thumping revivalist. It is impossible for any society to exist in a vacuum, or as a prehistoric insect preserved in amber. That being said, it is still remarkable that the American south came as close as it did."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"As a native Southerner, I was bowled over by the profound truths contained in this book. It strips away the legend of the South and shows the reality behind it. One of Cash's main tenets is that the South never changes, it just adapts to new times. This makes the book somewhat repetitive, as each era of history is essentially just a variation of the past. Also, this book was written before the Civil Rights Movement. I would have loved to know how Cash would have changed his opinion of the South after desegregation. Even though it is somewhat dated, this is still a book that every American should read. The South matters, and this book provides a key to understanding it."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Have you ever wondered why Southerners are the way they are?Why are they so hospitable sometimes but so refractory at other times?Why did we (Yankees) have to fight that Civil War with them? &quot;The Mind of the South&quot; holds answers to these questions as it paints a loose, but poignant picture of southern attitudes before the Civil War. It was written by a Southerner. However, I'm certain that anyone with an interest in the Civil War, the South, or the psychology of Southerners, would find it interesting. I found that it helped me understand why Southerners don't see things the way I do. Why would a Southerner see a Yankee &quot;as cowardly, avaricious, boorish, half Pantaloon and half Shylock&quot; and himself &quot;as polished, brave, generous, magnificent, wholly the stately aristocrat, fit to cow a dozen Yankees with the power of his eye and a cane? (pg. 67-68)&quot; Read the book to find out why. The effect of reconstruction on the attitudes of Southerners is also explored, as well as the growth of the South up to W.W. II. This was also very insightful. The book did tend to be a little too long. You may find some of it offensive. It is certainly controversial. Nevertheless, I highly reccomend this book.

The book is well written,although at times it seems to be redundant."},{"Title":"What Is Secular Humanism?","review":"Although Dr. Hitchcock, professor of history at St. Louis University, is a Catholic historian, all Christians unite in their concern about secular humanism. This book should be well read by both Protestants and Catholics. Hitchcock's treatment is mostly an intellectual history of secular humanism. He describes its origins, its development through history, and its present impact upon Western civilization.He begins his description with the Greek emphasis on reason (instead of the gods) and the various responses of church theologians over the centuries. Both the theologians' overemphasis on reason and overemphasis on faith facilitated the secularization of the West. The upper classes began this process of secularization primarily during the Enlightenment when the writings of the French philosophes directly attacked Christianity with the ideas of reason, human innate goodness, and secular utopia based upon these two principles.The nineteenth century, however, gave birth to three new revolutionary systems of though all based on secular humanism: Marx, Darwin, and Freud. The strain of modern humanism which flows from Feuerbach, Marx, and Nietzsche Hitchcock calls Promethean Humanism because it embodies \\"a demonic urge to negate and destroy\\" rather than the Enlightenment humanism which mainly emphasized reason and morality.Hitchcock focuses in on the secularization of the American experience. Although the people of America have always been religious, Enlightenment ideas at fist seeped in through the Founding Fathers. The Christian faith was mainly confined to the personal spheres of life and morals rather than public policy. As Americans became wealthier and a consumer mentality was substituted for the producer mentality, even this personal faith was undermined and left empty by this new materialistic urge. Americans began to focus on themselves and their rights to do anything they desired. The 1960s represented rebellion against established norms and the 1970s came to be called the \\"me decade.\\" Hitchcock blames Humanistic Psychology, as represented by Fromm, Rogers and Maslow, for advocating a new concept of sin. Sin is now the road to sanctification. This is not merely a new psychology, however, but a new religion. God has become \\"simply one more pleasure\\" in which to indulge (p. 77).Secular humanism is now no longer merely the ideology of the upper educated classes. It is believed and practiced by all classes of society. No one has been left untouched. The mass media has facilitated a moral and religious revolution by talking about the \\"hitherto unmentionable,\\" ridiculing formerly accepted beliefs, exploiting sympathy for the underdog (\\"Oh, the poor homosexual\\"), redefining reality by determining \\"what ideas are to be considered respectable, rational, and true\\" (p. 84), and noticing religion only when it generates controversy or ignoring it as a positive force. It is not solely the media's fault, however. The very temporalness of the media is incapable of dealing with eternal truths. But more important, Christians have supported the media's moral revolution by divorcing moral aspects of entertainment from other aspects of their lives. They have swallowed the secular humanist thesis that religion must be kept private and not affect all spheres of life.Hitchcock describes the ways in which secular humanism is changing American law and its interpretation of the Constitution. Whereas early America endorsed the Christian faith, and the public schools until at least World War II had a strongly religious character, between 1948 and 1977 the Court has decreed that public education must be secular. Rather than reflecting careful judicious thought, Hitchcock contends that these court decisions merely reflect the prejudices of the judges against Christianity. In the name of religious freedom the Court has forced a religious secular humanism that opposes Christian values, familial authority, and the Christian faith upon a nation. Again, Hitchcock points the finger of responsibility for this at the passivity of Christians who divorced political involvement from their faith.Not only has culture been secularized, but the Church as well. In the attempt to be more relevant to the culture, the Church has fallen into the same pit. Although this has always been a problem with the Church, Hitchcock begins his description with the theology of Schleiermacher and religious liberals who had animosity toward religious authority and orthodoxy. Rather than any concept of divine truth, liberalism within the Church accepted dialectical truth, i.e. truth arrived at relativistically through the limitations of culture and history. Consequently, objective morality became relative to the culture. Divine truth as well as divine ethics are thus merely human creations.Hitchcock closes his book by asking who are the true humanists. He argues that secular humanism results in the attribution of increasing powers to the state (ultimately resulting in totalitarianism), the desecralization of human life (abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia), the atomization of the individual (total freedom in total solitude a la Sartre), and the use of law and mental health for the benefits of the social order rather than moral rightness. Thus, \\"every Humanist system in the end betrays man\\" (p. 150).Who are the true humanists? Not those who have been claiming themselves to be so. Not the secular humanists. By default, Hitchcock implies that Christian humanism based upon the objective Scriptures is in actuality true humanism. He does not, however, outline the nature of this Christian humanism in more detail. He has only described the origins, development, and results of secular humanism, the topic of his book. Thus Hitchcock appears to conclude in despair. All forms of secularism lead only to death. Ultimately, everyone who is not a Christian is secular. Thus, Hitchcock's book reads like a Who's Who of the world, ranging from the most famous and influential philosophers to entertainers of like kind. Hitchcock has put them all together into one category. Essentially, there is no neutrality: there are either believers or nonbelievers. Nonbelievers trust in humans for salvation; believers in God. The salvation of humans will always fall short, and indeed has and will always cause death. Only God can save us from these bonds of death!"},{"Title":"What Is Secular Humanism?","review":"This is one of the best and most concise historical sketches of secular humanism available in my opinion. The book only takes you up to 1980 or so but there's a lot to learn from an author that grew up in the 60's and 70's. There's a lot about that era that people today don't know or refuse to acknowledge. Contrary to one of the reviewers, there's nothing outdated about this book, at least in the history it tells. Nor is it unfair in its general assessment. In fact, it's refreshing to read an account of secularism that doesn't try to gloss over things like its ties to oppressive regimes and silly philosophical movements. It's all laid bare in this book. Whether you consider yourself a \\"secular humanist\\" or not you should definitely read this book. At the very least you'll come away knowing what many religious people think of the ideology."},{"Title":"What Is Secular Humanism?","review":"For months after being transformed from an angry, impatient, money-drive feminist into a follower of Jesus Christ, I was still wondering how I could have been so blind for so many years -- the evidence for the truth of Christianity is so overwhelming that I couldn't figure out how I'd overlooked it. And then I stumbled across this book and found out exactly what the problem was. I don't know if reading it years ago would have brought me to Christ any sooner, but at least I would've been aware of the many ways in which we're being brainwashed with the secular humanism worldview. An awesomely important book."},{"Title":"What Is Secular Humanism?","review":"I naively thought, based on the title, that this book would tell me what a Secular Humanist thinks Secular Humanism is. Wrong. The author offers a condemnation of Secular Humanism,based on his definitions which do not conform to those of Secular Humanists. He also blames Secular Humanism for many of what are, to him, ills of society at the present time, such as: environmentalists,atheists,feminists,propagandists,communists,psychologists,evolutionists,and liberals."},{"Title":"What Is Secular Humanism?","review":"This book does nothing to reveal what Secular Humanism is about, what it stands for or what it's goals are. It's arguments are old, out of date, and quite tied to a \\"Cold War\\" mentality. The funniest thing I found in this book is the authors repeated attempts to link Secular Humanism with Marxism and Communism. This will come as a great surprise to many of the Libertarian Secular Humanists I know. All in all, it's a waste of your money."},{"Title":"RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION (THE NEW THINKER'S LIBRARY)","review":"Huxley in his opening chapter presents the reader with his basic ideas and conclusions. The rest of the work is their detailed explication. Huxley unlike the present generation of anti- religious evolutionary scientists of the Dawkins Dennett school has a real understanding and appreciation of various aspects of the religious life. As he sees human life and development it is an overall evolutionary process. This is one reason why he could be a champion of the works of the Christian thinker Teillhard de Chardin who saw the whole development of mankind as motion towards higher and higher complexity, greater and greater spiritual development.Huxley's opposition is to a key element at the heart of the great monotheistic religions. He is opposed to the idea of a Supernatural Personal Being as Ruler and Guide of the Universe. He argues that there is no need for such a Diety as the method of natural science has given us a way of understanding the world without reference to such a Being. Yet Huxley does not classify himself as an ' atheist' but rather as an agnostic who is undecided on a matter he does not have enough evidence for.I should not mislead here. Huxley is an opponent of the religions of Revelation.However what I find interesting and even exciting in his work is not this but with his vision of Religion as ' an activity of man which suffers change like all other human activities: ... that as it grows it cannot avoid coming into contact both with intellectual and with moral or ethical problems and with the development and broadening of human experience and tradition.'As Huxley understands it the development of the human involves involves the development of what he calls the 'emotional side of the religious life' that aims at a ' communion with the divine'.For Huxley the scientific method is the method which yields truth . And if it does not yield certainty, it by its openness and being subject to endless questioning and re- testing is essential to bringing mankind to greater completion and knowledge.In other words it is almost as if Huxley sees Mankind as being able by itself to so transform its situation and reality as to move to greater and greater progress in religion.I think that even for a traditional religious believer like myself there is much to be learned from this modest, scholarly , learned and rich- in- ideas work and thinker."},{"Title":"Point of Departure","review":"This book is a sensitive examination of a young woman's journey from discouragement to hope.

Readers who are navigating the same difficult waters may find the fictional adventures of Joanna and her daughter useful in planning their own journeys."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"I did not like _The Dragon Charmer_ as well as I liked _Prospero's Children_. Unlike the latter, _Dragon Charmer_ seemed disjointed and hurried. There were too many things going on at once and in my opinion none of them were as well developed as they might have been. The language was beautiful, but it seemed as though the focus on the language was trying to make up for the fact that there just really wasn't much story, like piling frosting on a overly-thin cake.A lot of what story there was seemed like a repetition of what had already been said in the previous book. It annoyed me that Fern spent all of _Prospero's Children_ breaking away from being a prim, controlled child and letting magic into her life and then she had to do it all over again. I was also not interested in hearing still more about the &quot;Oldest Spirit.&quot; Nor was I particularly thrilled with Siegel's dragons or the portions of the story based on Arthurian lore. It just seemed like she didn't have anything new to say here.Where Siegel did explore new territory -- as in the relationship between Will and Gaynor and the character of Kal, she was as good as I expected. Unfortunately, she just didn't spend enough time there. It was as if _The Dragon Charmer_ was nothing more than a set up for book 3 in the series, so many of the interesting parts just didn't go anywhere. That there will be a third book was pointed out in an unnecessary and annoying epilogue, just in case you missed the hints about it in the body of the text.I think even linking books deserve to be fully developed. I wish Siegel had just gone ahead and written the book she wanted to, instead of merely giving the story a lick and a promise before moving on."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"Over a decade has passed since the horror of PROSPERO'S CHILDREN occurred and all Fernanda Capel wants is to live a normal life. To that end, she buries her witchcraft gift and accepts a proposal of marriage from Marcus even as she admits to her best friend that she does not love him. Fern's efforts to ignore her powers seem futile though she constantly tries because otherworldly omens continually intrude.On the eve of her wedding, Fern falls into a coma and is rushed to a hospital. As she lies unconscious in bed, Fern's soul lies trapped in purgatory. Though the odds are overwhelming against her success, if she can free her soul and reunite it with her body, Fern knows she must war with powerful evils to save the world and her best friend.THE DRAGON CHARMER is a strong fantasy novel because the story line ties the supernatural with the mundane in such a clever way that the otherworldly elements seem everyday and a matter of fact. That element along with a fully developed, authentic feeling cast (in spite of some being not of this earthly plane) makes this a powerful novel that will please fans of Jan Siegel and send new readers searching for the previous tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"I just finished reading Jan Siegel's 'The Dragon Charmer'. Guess what?! Its part two (of three). I picked it up in a store on a trip. I had finished my last book, and was looking for something to pass the time. Dragon Charmer looked good, so I picked it up. Nowhere on the book, inside the cover, or anywhere else did I find that was the sequel to 'Prospero's Children'. Until I read the Epilogue; and kind of felt cheated.All in all, I thought it was a pretty good read. I did find the first fifty-some pages to be very slow. Additionally I found much of the book to be over-poetic. Six adjectives to describe, when they could also pass for synonyms, is just over-wording things.The most annoying thing, was the since of time. Near the end of the book where time seems to be very critical, the two perspectives are not being told in very similar time. One perspective gets way ahead in time, until the perspective's paths seem to cross; then the other perspective picks up much further back in time.The story starts with Fern, a \`gifted' young woman preparing for her wedding (I was worried I had picked up a romance novel by mistake, but soon discovered this was not the case). Wedding plans get put on hold when Fern somehow finds herself in a strange other-worldly dimension. Back in the real world, Fern's body lies in a coma while her brother and best-friend, Will and Gaynor, try to find a way to bring her back.I especially like the references to many \\"historical\\" mythos. Some of them in rather obscure ways, but all very interesting and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"The first time I read this book was in a huge book that included all of the books in this series. The whole thing was titled _The Witches Way_, I believe. You may want to check that before you quote me on it.There were many things I loved about this series. The first is that the protagonist is a woman. The second is that after having read many fantasy books and series, this one seemed to be very well worded gramatically and in its variety of adjectives...I actually learned some new words. The plot is complicated in the sense that it goes back and forth in time... time in general blends in these books. Past becomes future, present becomes past, etc. etc. etc...which is all part of the fun. There is much more than that though.... I personally consider this series one of the best. I lent it out to a relative and she couldn't put the book (whole series in one) down until the last."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"Like the author's first book, Prospero's Children, this book begins in rural England, where elements of magic and strange happenings are gradually introduced into an otherwise modern setting. Also like the first book, the main character spends a significant part of the story isolated in a different &quot;world.&quot; In this book, however, the author does a much better job of carrying two story lines, and integrating the other world into the main story. The character development and sense of realism are also much improved. I found this book to be a entertaining read, with some interesting ideas and story elements, all very well told. I recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Jan Siegel's work."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"I have very mixed feelings about The Dragon Charmer. I looked forward to it very much since I read Prospero's Children a year ago. In some ways, it was a let down, in others, it was perfectly fine. I love the character of Fern, and I was really anxious to see how she would grow, change, and mature. She did do so in this book, but not exactly how I hoped. I had hoped this process would leave me more in love with Fern, and while I did not loose any empathy for her, I also was not more devoted to her. Her brother's character, however, was very enjoyable, and changed in all the right ways to make a real character. I also was somewhat dissapointed that the story did not really seam to connect to Prospero's Children. It carried a lot of the same things over, but it seemed like just a seperate adventure with the same main character. I am looking forward to the final book in the trilogy in hopes it will tie the two books together. Even though the story did not really seem to flow from the first book, it was still a wonderful story. I was never bored and was fascinated with Siegel's immagination and descriptions. The story moved fairly slow, and I like that, as long as it does not drag, and it did not. The end/climax moved way too fast for me, however, especially since it was so interresting. I felt that I had spent so much time on the rest of the story that I wanted to spent a equal amount on the end instead of feeling rushed. It was not the sequal I expected, but it was a great read and very enjoyable. I am glad I read it, and I look forward to the next instalment."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"Jan Siegel (pseudonym for Amanda Hemingway) is also the author of \\"Prospero's Children\\" (1999), and \\"The Witch Queen\\" (2002), the books that precede and follow \\"The Dragon Charmer\\" (2000) in this fantasy trilogy starring magically-gifted, Fern Capel.These three books need to be read in order if any sense is to be made of Fern's increasingly complicated love life and her growing power as a sorceress. The first novel in the trilogy, \\"Prospero's Children\\" starts out as a YA coming-of-age fantasy, populated with evil villains (a witch, an idol, and an art gallery owner) and eccentric good guys (the Watcher, a female werewolf, a house goblin). Unfortunately, the second half degenerates into a standard Swords and Sorcery fantasy about Atlantis. It's almost as if the publisher said, \\"Okay, Jan, this is a great novel but we need another 100 pages, and why don't you throw in a Lost Continent. Lost Continents are very big this year.\\"Nevertheless, read the Atlantis bit very carefully, because the following two novels constantly refer back to Fern's sojourn in this ancient, drowned world. If this author has a serious fault, it's her overuse of extended flashbacks. Her greatest strength is her darkly imaginative blend of worlds (excluding Atlantis). The World Tree where Fern spends most of \\"The Dragon Charmer,\\" is borrowed from Norse mythology and inhabited by nightmarish crones. There is also a savage boar that eats the fallen fruit from the Tree - the regenerated heads of those who did evil in their lives on Earth.This is my favorite book in the trilogy, even though Fern spends most of it in a coma. Her body is tended by her friends and relatives after she reclaims her paranormal Gift, and her spirit is stolen out of Time by a sorceress who is looking for a new apprentice.Meanwhile Fern's brother, Will and her friend, Gaynor, with the help of other characters from \\"Prospero's Children\\" such as the Watcher and the werewolf, try to solve the mystery of her sudden descent into a coma. Their adventures and Fern's struggle to return to her body from the Land of the Dead and the not-so-dead, alternate to the very end of the book, where all of the story threads are combined into a very satisfying climax involving Fern's most ancient Enemy and the dragon of the title.Although witches, dragons, and drowned continents inhabit many mundane fantasies, they've been combined into a darkly imaginative sorceress's brew in this trilogy. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"This sequel toProspero's Childrenby Jan Siegel is a delight and well worth reading for anyone who liked the original. Foremost among its good points is that Siegel doesn't immediately pitch the teenage Fern into another magical adventure. Instead she allows a dozen years to go by in the gap, so that the Fern in this story is now an adult facing adult problems. These include an upcoming wedding to an intelligent but dreary man, career conflicts, and a drinking problem. All the surviving characters from \\"Prospero's Children\\" are here as well, along with some worthy newcomers.Another strength is the writing, as luxurious and mature here as in Siegel's first novel. I love the decadent use of descriptors, particularly once the characters leave England for more magical locales. The atmosphere of the area surrounding the World Tree is magnificent and the two new villains are genuinely frightening. As others have said, the weaving of various strains of mythology into a coherent whole is done flawlessly.The minor issues that makes this less of a total success are the pacing and a few plot points. Some of the opening sections are a drag. Sometimes the plot appears to require a little bit of unexplained stupidity from the characters in order to make things work. Those, however, are minor issues in an otherwise successful book.Also recommended for those who like Siegel's writing:The High Houseby James Stoddard andLarklightby Philip Reeve."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"There is no middle ground when it comes to Jan Siegel's novels: you either love them or hate them. Considering I love them, you might want to take this review with a pinch of salt as you may take my advice to read it and find that it is simply not to your taste. In any case, borrow before you buy and hopefully you'll enjoy these books as much as I do. They are beautifully written, with intriguing ideas and careful plotting, and (in my humble opinion) are among the best books that the fantasy genre has to offer. In a world of Tolkien rip-offs, it is a rare thing to find a fantasy novel that transcends the cliches into something fresh and new, yet resonant with older traditions and mythologies.In the previous novel \\"Prospero's Children\\", Fern Capel came into her inheritance as a witch, fell in love, bartered with a demon and travelled back in time to the final days of Atlantis in order to race evil powers for possession of the Lodestone. Now twelve years later she has done everything she can to put that traumatic summer firmly behind her. She wraps herself in a world of respectability, and is about to marry the charismatic Marcus Grieg, a man twenty years her senior. Returning to Yarrowdale with her best friend Gaynor Mobberley (the site of her adventures twelve years earlier) at her financee's insistence, Fern begins to feel ancient powers emerging about her once more. These otherworldly forces are not so eager to let such a powerful witch out of their grasp, and the day before her wedding Fern falls into a mysterious coma whilst her spirit wanders far away.Whilst Fern's brother Will, the ex-wizard Ragginbone and Gaynor attempt to unravel the mystery to Fern's illness, Fern herself finds herself keeping the strangest of company under the World Tree, where the heads of souls bound to purgatory hang like fruit on its branches. The two groups find themselves uncovering a long forgotten story of the dragon-charmers, a family of Atlantis that possessed the power to (obviously) charm dragons - and realise that there is every chance a dragon still exists somewhere in the world, waiting to be hatched. Whoever possesses such a powerful creature will wield a weapon that hasn't been seen in the world for centuries, and there are several parties determined to get their hands on it.There have been complaints that Fern's decision to turn her back on her powers is frustrating after the story arc of the previous story in which she gradually had to come to terms with them. To a point this is true, but I find it much more realistic that Fern would desire to forget the supernatural aspects of her life. Siegel has a good grip on Fern's personality, and the actions of this twenty-something Fern is certainly true to the persona of her teenage-self. The events of \\"Prospero's Children\\" were traumatising for a young girl, and it makes perfect sense that the sensible and practical woman she's grown into would reject her powers in day-to-day life - using them only when necessity demands it.However, I do agree that the book is somewhat slow-paced to start with: it is not till chapter five that Fern's adventure really begins after she's put into her magically-induced coma (and since the chapters are quite long, it takes a while). But the mystery, intrigue and suspense of the rest of the novel more than makes up for it. Intricately plotted, we are introduced to figures and conceits that are fully revealed later in the novel, at exactly the right time and place, some of which may or may not have a place in familiar mythology. Images, dreams, symbols, plot-twist, action - all are painstakingly strewn throughout the story and explored in Siegel's beautiful poetic-prose. It isn't just a gimmick, it fully enhances the story and is comparable only to Patricia McKillip.The range of ideas at work in the story is truly breathtaking: its so tempting to start listing them, but that of course would ruin the enjoyment you would get out of discovering them yourselves. Let's just say that \\"Dragon-Charmer\\" is a tapestry of rich and intricate ideas and concepts; you can almost sense that even the minor characters have lives (no matter how strange) outside the context of the story that is told.But then again, you may hate \\"Dragon-Charmer\\" and its predecessor \\"Prospero's Children\\", as they are so unique that it's hard to categorise and compare them with other books. All I can to is recommend you take the time to read them and hope that you'll like them as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"_The Dragon Charmer_ is the second novel in a (recently titled)Fern Capel Trilogy written by author Amanda Hemingway under the penname Jan Seigel. The first book being _Prospero's Children, sets the characters and stage for this novel, as a sequel more then ten years after the original novel._Prospero's Children_ told the tale of Fernanda Capel and her well intentioned but bumbling father Robin and precocious but thankfully not cliched younger brother Will as they inherit a house from recently deceased and very distant relative. From this setting, we weave a tale of Fernanda who is, as it turns out a witch or rather someone with \\"The Gift\\" of magic as a matter of fact. First truly seen in the mythical and ancient civilization of Atlantis. _Propero's Children_ centered around the search for a key made from a magical stone that can open the gates of death itself. Sixteen year old Fern, whom in _Prospero's Children_ was introduced as a slightly prudish, responsible and prickly herione was at the center of this tale who later came forwards to see it's completion as she; at the last half of the novel travels back in time to Atlantis where she discovers the kind of true love that happens once in a life time and ends up witnessing the downfall of Atlantis and inadvertently starting up the events that lead her adventures over a thousand years into the future._Prospero's Children_ had a magnifiscent tone, brought on by Seigel's beautiful and boardering on purple prose that fit the novels dreamy feel and easy pace. While each character was well developed with their own voice and solid place in the story. Never a character that seemed to struggle to fit into the rest of the story or exist simply as support for the protagonist. One of the major delights of the story was the character of Alison or Alimond, the antagonist or secondary antagonist. An ancient witch of some power whose motivations for searching for the key were at once heartbreaking and entirely selfish. Alison remains in this reader's mind as a prime example of how to make a three dimensional antagonist. While the Oldest Spirit, existed as a good almost omniscent force to keep events moving for Fern and the characters.The novel ended with a bit of sadness and budding hopeful future for Fern whose is just now coming into her own as a powerful witch.However _The Dragon Charmer_ begins nearly ten years after that novel ended, and shows the reader that the potential and hopeful future for Fern as merely stalled out completely. As if the author couldn't think of ways to rise Fern to a higher level and merely left her as an uninspiring adult who has returned to her formerly prudish ways. If going deeper into them as all the growth and potential Fern had as a child has dissapeared with adulthood (which as we see is a common theme in these novels, the loss of potential and shinning of youth for the boring depressing future of adulthood).Nearly ten years later Fern Capel is a college graduate engaged to be married to a man nearly twice her senior. Fern's reasoning for this arrangement isn't true love or even comfort, but a simple unwavering determination to stick to the \\"natural path\\" that she had imagined for herself as a child. A suitable career, a prudent marriage and possibly children in the distant future being the entire scope of Fern's future. Fern's fiance is a fluttery and distant character who it seems does exactly what the author avoided so wonderfully in her first novel and that is make a secondary character merely for the sake of supporting the main character. However not even Fern takes true center stage in this novel as her chapters are infrequent as we see most of this novel from the very, very uninspiring and useless main character (I hesitate to even call her a protagonist), Fern's friend Gaynor Mobberly. Brought forth as a love interest for Fern's younger brother Will, now college age and every bit the precious rake he was as a child. Gaynor, while not an unlikable character, is simply put...boring. Useful to the story only as a way for new readers to the series to catch up on what happened before hand, if they didn't read _Prospero's Children_. Even that is haphazardly done as we hear only second hand brushby accounts of what occured in the first novel. New readers to the series will perhaps get the bare bones idea as to what happened in the first novel but loose the full scope and emotional impact of it on the characters or what should have been the emotional impact on the characters.For Will, Robin, their housekeeper, Ragginbone and even Fern have simply stalled as characters and lost what original voice and sparkle they have. The novel's main theme is Fern's forceful return to her destiny as one of the gifted, as the weekend of her wedding she is taken (in spirit) from her body and forced to become the prodigy of a familiar legendary figure. Morgan le Fey (called Morgus) in these novels. A power bloated witch, eternally stuck in the mideval mindset and cold hard determination to rule the ancient kingdom of Britain, in her mind called Logrez. Morgus and her partner in crime exist out of time underneath the world tree (Yddragssil in Norse Mythology) where the heads of the dead must spend a season for every evil deed committed. Morgus awaits for the head of a particular person. The only person in existence gifted with the ability to charm Dragons. As Fern learns her new craft, reluctantly from Morgus she must use all of her wits to ellude becoming a mindless pawn for Morgus and eventually make her escape. Morgus is a one dimensional villain, who is shown as being irredemably evil without the true motvation for her desired conquest. Unlike Alison whose motivations were, in some twisted sense reasonable. Morgus has no true inspiration, no real reason to want to conquor Britain. She merely wants to because she *can* and her twisted obsession with Fern evolves to a rather squriming climax as a rather uncomfortable and barely brushed upon and non violent rape scene seems to serve no purpose other then to show just how *evil* Morgus is.As Fern struggles to free herself, with the help of a twisted child of Morgus. Will and Gaynor back in the real world, struggle to find a way to save her and keep her body safe. Mean while the looming figure of the Oldest Spirit isn't present in this novel, a noticable lack in the plot itself._The Dragon Charmer_ is a charmless, sparkleless \\"second novel\\" in a trilogy that had complete promise in the beginning as being a true fantasy classic. While it will perhaps remain a prime example perhaps of true urban or modern fantasy, the second novel in the series is noticably lacking from the first. All the character growth and potential lost under an uninspiring plot that leaves the reader mildly unsatisfied. For those readers whom truly loved _Prospero's Children_ and wish to finish this series it is only partially reccomended."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"ooooh this book was so fun!!!! well...maybe not FUN but it was really exciting. I can't wait to read the third. I had a little trouble with getting into it. I still finished the book in two days. I also hope that Jan Siegel includes yet another poem in the third book of this trilogy. I got The Dragon Charmer when I went to england and she was right about the weather, at least while I was there.I HIGHLY recomend this book for anybody who likes Science Fiction and Fantasy and look forward to seeing and reading the next and last book in the trilogy. I can't wait to see what happens with Kal, at least I hope something happens with him. He seems like a key charactor and wasn't mentioned much in the end but surely he'll be mentioned in the next book."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"I liked the first book very much, but &quot;The Dragon Charmer&quot; was a big disappointment. I thought that the characters were unevenly and unconvincingly drawn. The author seemed too enamored with her own lofty and pseudo-poetic prose (which was intermittently applied), and not sincere enough in giving each character a unique and appropriate voice. The writing style seemed to me to be awkwardly self-conscious and pretentious. Many points seemed somewhat plagiaristic or imitative to me. I had a hard time caring very much what happened to any of the characters, because they seemed so flat. I'm not sure what changed between the first book and the second (I would need to reread both of them, probably, to put my finger on it) but I the sequel did not seem to me to be anywhere near as convincing, involving, or unpretentious as the first book."},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"This book took forever to get moving and at first I wasn't sure how I felt. But when it did pick up, I thought it was awesome. :)"},{"Title":"The Dragon Charmer","review":"Not quite as brilliant as the first novel in the trilogy, I still found this to be one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read. Fern's personality may have taken a small step-backward from the young woman she had seemed set to grow into in the end of 'Prospero's Children', but that only meant she left the stage open for her brother and her friend Gaynor. A few secondary characters in 'The Dragon Charmer' do feel a bit two-dimensional but for the most part the new characters are interesting and the old ones are fleshed out a little more.The magical world Jan Siegel creates is a dark, dreamy place that feels unlike any other. She draws you in with gorgeous prose, weaving together bits and pieces of various mythologies to create something unique and endlessly fun to read about."},{"Title":"Just an Accident","review":"Amy Montgomery does a great job of capturing the experience of Scott Remington, a logger who suffered a life-changing accident. Close to death, Remington's family and friends immediately form a tight circle of support for him which has only strengthened since the accident. Montgomery provides an intimate look at the physical and emotional challenges faced by Remington and his family.The writing style is comfortable and enables the reader to quickly identify with all of the people in the book. After a few chapters, the book no longer is about an accident. It is about Remington's character, his capacity to change and his willingness to do so. More importantly, as we see parts of ourselves in the people around him, it is about the ability we all have to become better.Buy one for you and one for a friend."},{"Title":"Just an Accident","review":"Mrs. Montgomery has written an amazing story of survival and courage. With her clear and concise writing style, she has let the strength of the story be her guide - the author tells the story of Scott Remington's horrific accident with a simple clarity that is most impressive - she brings us into the homes of the Remington family and friends and gives us a glimpse of what they all endured after the accident.Where many authors will throw extraneous adjectives and superlatives at each character or event, Mrs. Montgmery possesses the writing discipline to let Scott Remington's story stand on it's own merits - Well Done !I look forward to her next book !"},{"Title":"Just an Accident","review":"Amy Montgomery really brings to life both the suffering and humanity of Scott Remington without ever stooping to pity or clich&eacute; as is so often found in these books. The \\"heart\\" of Scott's parents, children, and friends, as well as the heartbreak and confusion of his wife are brought to life in a clear and precise voice. The graphic description of Scott's medical condition and therapies balanced against the journal entries kept by his parents and friends bring a real humanity to his story.The author has put forth a great first effort and created a book well worth reading.

While I've been heavily influenced by many of Thomas H. Davenport's books, I've found a wealth of fresh ideas in this book because each chapter is a paper written by one or more experts in a specific aspect of organizational change. I also like the way the book is organized into four sections that examine change and process.Part I is among my favorites because each of the five chapters build upon each other to provide a clearly defined map for defining and implementing change strategies. Part II's three chapters drill down into the mechanics of processes and how they fit within the context of a change management strategy. I especially like chapter 7, which covers gap analysis and a framework with which to identify, define and understand business processes at a level that allows you to see the dependencies and impacts of proposed changes. I also like chapter 8, which links IT strategic planning to enterprise processes. This is a major gap that I find in one consulting engagement after another and the information in this chapter will provide a clear--if briefly described--approach to closing that gap.More advanced process management topics are covered in Part III, are each of the five chapters can be read as standalone papers. My favorite was &quot;The New Waves of Business Process Redesign and IT in Demand/Supply Chain Management&quot;, which reflects professional interests. Other chapters that are equally valuable cover process innovation, reengineering effectiveness and business process impact case studies.The final four chapters that comprise Part IV are predictions about the nature of IT and services in this century. Each are interesting and will contain ideas that can be incorporated into current projects or future plans.Overall this book is invaluable because it provides the points of view of a large number of academic and industry experts, and all of the material can be put into practice."},{"Title":"Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959","review":"I'll admit it. I was drawn to this book by its cover, which, after dragging thru the first few pages, I sorely regretted. Being somewhat of a vampire purist, I couldn't reconcile Newman's &lt;at times&gt; irreverent handling of one of my favorite subject matters. So, slightly disgusted, I put the book aside. Several weeks later however, I caught the thing winking laconically at me, as it waited, patiently, comfortably nestled between Rice and Yarbro. So I gave it another go and, to my pleasant surprise, found myself acquiring a taste for Mr. Newman's rather unorthodox style. The complex dynamics between the three main female characters, old grudges which forced them apart, and even older obligations which drew them together, were, for me, the cornerstone of the book's appeal. And, being a James Bond fan from way back, his appearance was an interesting and cleverly wrought addition to the story line. The major flaw of this otherwise enjoyable read was its hastily concocted ending. I felt as if I were watching a cleverly directed big budget film, which falls a little flat at the ending, its financing cut short by a disgruntled investor. Don't let this little glitch deter you however. Mr. Newman spins a pretty good yarn."},{"Title":"Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959","review":"Ciao Bella!Ye Gods! Newman is a fiendishly clever polymathic (sic?) confabulatory yarn spinner. Do ya like Alternate History? Do Ya like Vampires? Do Ya like Fellini, Il Maestro? If the answer is yes or even 'well maybe' to any of the above questions, then check out Newman's Anno Dracula stuff. Prior installments not neccassary, but recommended. Never have Vespa Scooters, sunglasses and blood drinking been so amusing, sexy, fun and witty. If you love playing 'spot the reference', you'll have a ball (Clark from Kansas and Gomez Addams, anyone?) Also features an exteneded cameo, nay a supporting role even, by a character stand in for the late great MARCELLO MASTROIANI, for my money to coolest thespian even to commit his immortal soul to celluliod, although I'm not sure I've spelled his name correctly (!).

Having recently announced his engagement to thevampiress Princess Asa Vajda of Moldavia, vampire elders aredescending upon Rome. This has upset the natural order of things, andvampire elders are being slaughtered by a mortal known as the CrimsonExecutioner. Also in Rome are the dying Charles Beauregard and hislover, 500+ year-old vampire Genevieve Dieudonne. Charles is beingquestioned by England's top spy, a vampire with a license to kill,about Dracula's possible motives for this wedding.

Dracula now lives in Italy, and is about to marry another elder vampire. Kate, whom we first met in _Anno Dracula,_ is covering the wedding.There are a lot of references to Fellini movies, Patricia Highsmith's novels of Ripley, and Ian Fleming's works---as usual with Kim Newman, playing \\"spot-the-reference\\" is half the fun. The funeral that ends the book is unexpectedly poignant."},{"Title":"Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959","review":"One of the first recommendations I received from Amazon.com was &quot;Anno Dracula.&quot; I had barely even heard of the book, but my wife had bought a copy, so I decided to read it. &quot;The Bloody Red Baron&quot; quickly followed, then this latest book. I don't want to give away too much, but it does appear that &quot;Judgment of Tears&quot; may be the last in the series. I hope not, because I feel the series is getting better with each book. Many people felt that book three would be set in World War II, and that might've been good, but it might also have been a bit of &quot;been there, done that.&quot; By setting this one in 1959, with frequent references to what did happen in WWII, Newman kept continuity while breaking new ground. The setting in Rome really added to the flavor of the book. This is a serious book, but there is also a lot of humor and satire. Newman probably better hope that Ian Fleming wasn't a vampire, or he might rise from the grave to seek revenge for the send-up of James Bond. Vampires seem to be a popular theme nowadays, but Newman seems to have staked (sorry) out his own territory. Regardless of whether or not he continues this series, I am eagerly awaiting his next novel. Meanwhile, I plan to get his other novels and read them.

But it wasn't."},{"Title":"Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959","review":"In ANNO DRACULA, Kim Newman posited a world where Count Dracula triumphs over Abraham Van Helsing, marries Queen Victoria, and becomes England's Prince Consort. Newman followed this triumph with THE BLOODY RED BARON, chronicling the events of the First World War as it took place in this alternative history. JUDGMENT OF TEARS, the third novel in this consistently inventive series, takes place in post World War Two Europe, circa 1959. In Rome to cover Dracula's royal wedding to undead Moldavian Princess Asa Vajda, journalist Kate Reed, a vampire herself, witnesses the brutal public slayings of two elder (long-\\"lived\\") vampires by the flamboyant Crimson Executioner. These killings, it seems, are only the latest in a series of murders--all the authorities can be sure of is that someone has declared open season on vampire elders. Her journalist's instincts aroused, Kate investigates, and is drawn into a web of intrigue involving, among others, Dracula, undead British secret service agent Hamish Bond, and Italy's own Mater Lachrymarum (The Mother of Tears), a mythic figure who may be the force behind The Executioner's bloody exploits.As in previous works, Newman rewrites history, providing readers with an addictive mix of the familiar and the new, skillfully manipulating a huge cast of fictional (such as Iowan Clark Kent, and Drs. Pretorious and Herbert West) and historical (like Orson Welles and Anita Ekberg) characters. A la Tom Wolfe, Newman renders the political, social and cultural scene with great panache, providing generous helpings of action and humor along the way. The book can be read as an entertainment, or taken as a challenge, to see how many references readers note--Newman helpfully appends a key of sorts to the novel, so readers can gauge how well they do. Either way, the novel is consistently entertaining. You finish this book almost out of breath with the nonstop quality of the action, and with a new appreciation for Newman's considerable talents."},{"Title":"Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959","review":"As an avid fan of Kim Newman I was thrilled to see this book come out. I never fail to recommend Kim Newman's books to everyone I meet, especially Anno Dracula, which I have read and re-read joyfully.

This is an excellent read and I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959","review":"Kim Newman should be shot for doing the same thing in this novel that he did in its 2 predecessors - give it a lame ending. The fact that I still gave it a 4 star rating, and read the book after seeing what the author did to the 2 prior books in the series gives you an idea how much I like his stories.The problem is that Kim Newman can't write a decent ending to save his life. The 3 books I've read in this series are all the same - great story, interesting characters, fascinating alternate history. Then, for the last 50 or so pages, the story sputters and peters out in a bit of introspective hogwash.

Provides excellent art work depictions of historical Aztec, Inca and Mayan ceremonies as described by the Catholic priests after the Spanish Conquest. Describes the fierce Indian resistance to the Spanish and English invasions and why the Indians were unable to resist the Europeans due to smallpox and better organizations and military tactics.

She has the rare quality to be able to love and appreciate herself, while being critical of the things she sometimes does. Gifted by the insights that her daughter provides her, Ms. Ward is able to climb to a higher plane of living and share that perspective with you so that you can join her. This book has 52 essays built around the chronological year, which you can use to improve your life in many important and satisfying ways.The essays in the book are brief, are easy to read, and benefit from large type. In fact, they look so appealing that 6 people sitting near me on the airplane asked me to share the information about this book with them. They thought the cover was beautiful, asked me to tell them about the book, and noticed that the type was large and surrounded by white space. I have never had a book in my possession attract such a crowd.My favorite essay in the book is called Romance 101, and gives wonderful ideas for creating the most romantic Valentine's Day ever on less than ten bucks. Any guy can be a hero with this kind of advice!Ms. Ward is a devotee of Mr. Anthony Robbins and Dr. Stephen Covey. If you are not familiar with their work, you will find it distilled and applied in Ms. Ward's life in helpful ways. If you are familiar with these authors, her examples will add depth to your understanding.Ms. Ward has had her share of problems, and hearing about her experiences as a single parent will make any parent more sensitive to the challenging task that all parents share. But she takes away an energy and enthusiasm for the exhausting work that is very heartening to me.Ms. Ward has a very nice sense of humor, but she generally laughs at herself rather than at others. Her experience with visiting her sister for Thanksgiving is a good example. Have you ever had Vegan cooking for Thanksgiving?Ms Ward also enjoys a deeply spiritual side, and thinks about angels the way most of us think about our neighbors. Although angels are not something I am an expert on, I enjoyed what she had to say about her experiences in this regard. I think you will, too.After you finish reading this book, I suspect that you will appreciate that writing is therapy, in part, for Ms. Ward. So, too, it can be for you. I suggest that you start a journal where you write 3 or 4 pages once a week. Try this format. Write down something you liked about the week, then add an idea for how the week could have been improved. Next, note what you learned during the week and how you intend to apply that learning in the next week. Finally, write down some new appreciation you have for your spiritual life, your friends and family, and yourself.The silver lining is always there in any situation, but you do need to take a moment to find it!"},{"Title":"The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts","review":"I really appreciate that the publisher has put back in print R.O. Faulkner's translation of the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts. I have not read other versions, but many modern researchers state that this version is the definitive version of these classic texts.For those of you who do not know, the Pyramid Texts are the oldest sacred writings known, the first of them appearing in the Egyptian King Una's pyramid around 5,000 years ago! Despite their age, the pyramid texts are a lucid description of ancient Egyptian religious ceremony and belief. To have a lucid, literate translation of them brings the ancient writings forward to the present and starkly proclaims their relevancy.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that the pages appear to be copies of an original, out of print, text. Thus, the reproduction is a wee bit fuzzy. However, to have access to an excellent translation of a very important work of humanity more than compensates for this minor quibble.Lastly, the super discounted price on Amazon is a steal."},{"Title":"The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts","review":"The classic interpretation by R.O. Faulkner is available in this current edition, and while I could go on and on about the Pyramid Texts themselves, this isn't necessarily a review of the content, but rather the book. I say this because R.O. Faulkner does what he does best: stays true to the translation and interpretation of the material, in a much, much better way than E.A. Wallis Budge could ever have done. His compilation in this volume is par excellence, and it is nice to see this back in print. I highly recommend this version to the serious student of Egyptology, not only because it's Faulkner, but also because the binding is tight, this print run is quality, and it's in a format that is easy to digest."},{"Title":"Anna's Rain","review":"I read this book to my little sister (her name is Anna) and it is one of her favorites. The simplicity of the text makes it really easy to understand and the pictures are amazing and very true to life. This book is about a very common event; feeding the birds, but it also shows a father's love for his daughter. I want to point out that this is definately a book for a young audience, and the pictures are, in Anna's opinion, the best part. There is so much to look at on every page."},{"Title":"Anna's Rain","review":"I disagree with the Horn Book review. My daughter enjoyed the story and we've gotten it from the library a couple of times. I liked the different style in which the writer simply has quotes from the two characters (Anna and Dad); no &quot;he said, she said&quot;. It sounded much like some conversations I've carried on with my girls. The art was quite nice also. We're looking for a copy to have for another daughter who's name is also Anna."},{"Title":"Anna's Rain","review":"Our daughter's name is Ana Jean. Right from the beginning when Dad says \\"Anna Lee, what are you doing?\\" we started putting her into the story. She can quote this book from cover to cover, and she's not yet two years old! We absolutely love this book, and are getting it for her for her upcoming birthday. I agree with the previous reviewer who described the easy, conversational way in which the story is told. My daughter and I will often recite the book to each other, bouncing back between characters. She even sticks out her hand to \\"feel\\" the rain turning into ice when we get to that part of the book. For sentimental reasons, and for reasons of aesthetics, this book will be a perennial favorite in our house."},{"Title":"Wake Me When It's Over","review":"Howard Singer must have been or known a schnook. The story even if it seems unsaturated is too real.Russ is a schnook. Therefore if something can go wrong it will. His wife is into insurance of all kinds. She wants him to get his GI insurance while he can. After she forces him to apply (schnook), he must explain that he has two serial numbers (schnook). When he was shot down over Germany he was presumed dead and needed a second number to get discharged (schnook). So naturally realizing that the (schnook) being in the service only one-day on the second serial number, is called up to finish his time.He ends up on an island in the middle of the Sea of Japan. There he has a revelation that saves his sanity and that of 400 other servicemen. A plan so brilliant that I am not about to tell you what it is or how it is executed.At none point when he is on the island he has to relive himself and gets poison ivy. No one believes him and thinks he was the victim of hanky panky. They all stay clear of him until the doctor explains it.In the book the plan cured his shnookyness; in the movie it takes a trial. The cast includes Dick Shawn as the schnook and Ernie Kovacs as his commander and hotshot fighter pilot.I am still waiting for the DVD.I can relate to this as I also have two serial numbers."},{"Title":"The CEO of YOU","review":"The little book pacts a real powerful punch ... I loved it!Ms. Sue does a dynamite job of grabbing you over and over and over throughout the pages of this practical and motivating treatise on leadership and taking responsibility for one's success. As an avid reader on the subject I liked this book for it's straight-forward views on moving forward in life with purpose and power.I loved the numerous quotes and the to-the-point approach to the subject. The gems I learned in Chapter Three are worth the price of this book many times over ... things like the steps to move from anger to calm; taking responsibility for how I react to changes and the growth resulting therein; and of course, reminders of the power of proper goal setting in one's successful journey in life.Thanks Marsha for this real practical and powerful addtion to my library!"},{"Title":"The CEO of YOU","review":"The theme of _The CEO of You_ is take responsibility for your own life. While not a new thought, this book expresses it well, and gives some practical suggestions for carrying that out.With motivational quotations on almost all of the left hand pages, this will give you an enjoyable read, and the inspiration to get going on fulfilling your dreams!"},{"Title":"The CEO of YOU","review":"Let me say first and foremost that I have not only read this book from cover to cover but I've also seen, in person, Marsha's seminar (in particular, the seminar inspired by this book).I was given this book by her, personally, and for free. I read it through in one sitting, for the most part, and I have to say that it is almost complete rubbish from end to end, just like her seminar.Sure, there's some good general advice, a few interesting takes on some of life's nuances and how to deal with them, but by and large the book falls flat on its face. Certain pieces of information, suggestions and even stories are repeated, sometimes in several places, if for no other reason than to up the page count and make it a marketable book.This book truly reads like one of those 'get rich quick' books, written by someone who promises to make you rich, but never really tells you how to get there. You will feel the exact same thing when you read this book, because there is no substance whatsoever. There is build up, and you often feel like you're being led to some kind of a conclusion, but there's no end result. No punchline, no follow through, on key point, no unifying structure.Marsha will go on and on in this book and in her seminar about how you have to have a plan to be successful, but she doesn't seem to have taken her own advice when writing this book. The structure is terrible, the organization is awful and as I have stated before (and state again for sheer emphasis) there is no meat to be found! It's all smoke and mirrors. You will finish this book and wonder why you don't feel any smarter, why you don't have a clue what you just read or what it all meant, or how it applies to you.If I ever meet Marsha, I am going to give this book back to her. I would strongly encourage you to stay away from it and spend your money on something else. I never really read these kinds of books and avoid them just like the \\"Learn how to be a millionaire\\" garbage, and for the same reason. I read this one because it was given to be for free, but I regret having wasted the time. It is not worth it at any price, so please save your money and look elsewhere if you need help with your career, your finances or your personal life. You will get NOTHING out of this book because, just like Marsha's personal seminars, it is full of interesting anecdotes and humor but completely lacks usable substance.If you happen to check into Marsha's reviews to see the kind of books she purchases on Amazon, you might find some interesting items. Among them, I found these:\\"60 Ways to Get Rich and Stay Rich in the Speaking Business\\"\\"Confessions of Shameless Self Promoters\\"Do I need to say more? No, I think that speaks for itself. Nice job Marsha, keep the scheme, I mean dream, alive."},{"Title":"The CEO of YOU","review":"This is the first book I read of Marsha's and it was a quick read for me. Its THAT GOOD! Everyone should read this and realize that in order to be a success, you need to embrace all the parts of you and hone them to the best of your ability.I read this book in one afternoon at the beach, and then turned around and read it again. And again. And then I lent it to someone and they read it in one sitting, too. Then bought the book because they wanted their own copy.This is a book that gives you down-to-earth ways to implement self-improvement. It doesn't lead you on a path of self-discovery by way of some woo-woo stuff. Its real.Having met Marsha after reading all three of her books, the words in the pages of \\"CEO of You\\" are hers, and I know they are. She's real, and her words are real.My advice - if you can't stand to be told in real-life ways to help yourself, don't read this book. But if you want a book (and an author) that is going to give it to you straight - pick up this book and read it."},{"Title":"The CEO of YOU","review":"I don't usually start a review by arguing with other reviewers, but I feel so compelled here!Marsha has written a tremendous and practical guide to gaining power and control in your life. The CEO of YOU is full of practical techniques for taking charge of your own destiny; just as a CEO has to take charge of the destiny of a company.The scathing review by Wanderer left me puzzled, and compelled to offer a dissenting opinion. After checking on some of Wanderer's other reviews, I can see why he would feel the way he does. He or she (My apologies, its hard to tell when someone uses Avatars and Nicknames) loved \\"Modelling Binary Data, Reading External Data Files Using SAS and the Heroscape Expansion Set: Agents and Gladiators action figures.I'm sure these are fine books and products, but most of us have to deal with real life challenges in real time including creating some measure of personal success and happiness. Most of us who work in or operate small businesses are up to our eyeballs in the daily grind of trying to stay positive in the face of taking care of ourselves, our employees and our communities. Most of us don't have time to play with Agents and Gladiators action figures!Obviously, Marsha's biggest mistake was giving Wanderer a free copy of her book, a book in which she shares advice and experience obviously paid for with blood, sweat and tears. I'm sure if Wanderer reviews my book, his (or her) review will be just as negative; like Martha I do teach simple, sometimes even obvious life lessons which do bear repeating from time to time. Of course, no book or seminar has the power to change your life; that work is left to you! Books and seminars can educate, validate, and motivate; if you want to change your life you've got to get you butt off the couch and do the work.I've spent most of my adult life studying personal power. My models are people like Marsha, who have done the work and created success in their lives. Their advice usually contains simple, common sense advice and time-tested techniques. Why don't more people follow this advice? Because while success is simple; it is not easy.Marsha clearly outlines steps you can take today to truly become the \\"CEO\\" of your own life. She pulls no punches and tells you that you're responsible for doing the work; if that message is repetitive, in this age of entitlement and lack of self-reliance it is is also necessary!If you want a shining beacon of hope and practical advice for taking charge of your life in the face of real-life adversity, this book is for you!For what it's worth...Wanderer, if you want to write a review of my book it's called Dynamic Components of Personal Power. To save you some time, I do present some painfully obvious themes such as taking personal responsibility for your own success. You may also find that I'll promise you can do anything you want with your life; but it is ultimately up to you to get there.For those of you willing to do the work, read Marsha's book and others like it. She is sharing the results of years of experience and sincere dedication to success, hers and yours!

My one, and only gripe is that the left page throughout the book is nothing but a quote. It seems like kind of a waste of time and money. I love little quotes in books, but rather in a small highlighted box, or as a footnote. Sorry for griping, since this is a great little book."},{"Title":"His Duty, Her Destiny (Harlequin Historical)","review":"The book follows the relationship between Lady Nicola Coldyngham and Sir Fergus Melrose in 1473 London. Nicola has four brothers and spent her childhood runnig wild with them and trying to keep up. Fergus was a childhood friend and ring leader of the brothers. As a child, Nicola worshipped Fergus but he rarely looked her way which hurt her terribly. Their fathers agreed that they should marry when they came of age but this agreement was never made legal and both fathers have since died. Fergus has come back to claim Nicola as his bride ...On the whole I did enjoy the book but I have only given it three stars because I disliked Fergus from the outset and although he redeemed himself, somewhat, in the second half of the book, I couldn't get passed my dislike of him from the first half of the book. He is so arrogant. Pushing and pulling Nicola around, always being right and winning at everything. I wish the author could have at least made Nicola win the horse race. Maybe it's just that I've had my fill of arrogant heros in romantic novels and Fergus was the icing on the cake!However, I will read another Juliet Landon novel (this was my first). I hope the others heros aren't as bad."},{"Title":"His Duty, Her Destiny (Harlequin Historical)","review":"What a marvelous read! I was so surprised to find that this book was published by Harlequin. My impression has always been that Harlequin books are inferior. I'm happy to admit that, in this case, I was wrong. Landon has drawn truly memorable, likeable characters. Their relationship is fraught with misunderstandings as the two childhood acquaintances get to know one another again as adults. But, those misunderstandings are not frustrating to read, as is often the case in other books. Landon is such a skillful writer that she develops their relationship in a slow but satisfying way, allowing the reader to understand each of the characters better while the characters themselves are learning more about each other as well. Landon also moves plot along quickly with lots of intrigue and adventure. Very, very good read."},{"Title":"The Films of Ken Ryker","review":"This is not just a coffeetable book, and it's not just a porn book, it's an incredible insight into the adult male erotic industry. Masterful writer Mickey Skee does a tricky job of giving the good and the bad about what it takes to make (and in some cases break) a pornstar. Ken Ryker is a good example of a guy who's had ups and downs (pardon the obvious pun), in the business, and Skee chronicles it all his best job with Falcon Videos and his worst experience with Gino Colbert's hetero title. The guy's a bisexual, and it delves into his background, too, with explicit sexual detail. But, it's not a book that you'll be embarrassed to keep on your coffeetable, because it's so beautifully designed and laid out. The photos inside are not pornographic, but erotic, and do explain in living detail why this guy is such a BIG star! Even if you know nothing about the porn industry, this is a book you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"The Films of Ken Ryker","review":"These guys now hate each other after being best friends for a long time. Apparently, the author wrote the book after the star retired and disappeared for years, but he made a return, and Ryker was mad that some of the truth was told by the author. And, as it turns out the author held back some reala juicy stuff for a sequel that the star was going to participate in, but the deal broke down --- this is INSIDER info! This is the real story about a porn star stud, his eccentricities, his family, his failures, his ups and his downs. My favorite part is when they talk aout his first straight sex scene and how he was a limp dicky and Teri Weigel cradles him like a \\"little leaguer who just struck out in his ball game.\\" A very fun read!!!!"},{"Title":"The Films of Ken Ryker","review":"This is a must have book on the early career of Porn Superstar Ken Ryker.

Well, that is not precisely what happens in The Brooklyn Rose, but the heroine doesn't know that. Fifteen-year-old Rose Frampton loves her life. Her South Carolina plantation is her safe haven, a place she would never want to leave. But then the tall and dashing thirty-something Rene Dumarest, a Yankee who has spent most of his life in France, shows up and turns her ordered life upside down. He falls in love with her, proposes marriage. Rose has no idea how to take his proposal. She has a crush on him, but doesn't love him. She also possesses an independent spirit and doesn't like the idea of owning up to anyone. But when she hears that her parents are in financial trouble and that Dumarest has helped them, she accepts. Moving to Brooklyn in New York as the \\"Mistress of Dorchester\\" takes some adjusting. Her neighbors don't like her, and her mother-in-law is unbearable. To make matters worse, she might be falling in love with Rene. She doesn't want to give her heart to the man who has her family's plantation in his power -- that she swore she would never do.The diary format in this novel is great. Rose's naive ways jump out of the pages. I cannot imagine a fifteen-year-old running a house and putting up with snooty neighbors and a controlling mother-in-law without doing something someone her age would do, and Rinaldi handles that very well. It surprises me just how much young girls were forced to grow up sooner than they had to in those times. The historical aspect is wonderful. I love to read about the south and New York during the late Victorian era. My only complaint about this novel is that it is too short. You literally can read this in one short sitting (well... if it weren't the holidays and you didn't have so much to do you could). This is my first Ann Rinaldi effort, but it won't be the last. The fact that these characters are based on her grandparents makes this book all the more meaningful. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Rose","review":"Brooklyn Rose was not Ann Rinaldi's best, but was a good book. It takes place in a quaint town in South Carolina.

So recently when I found one of her books I hadn't read I was excited. However, I found this book lacking. Rose Frampton, the 15 year old main character, is based on Rinaldi's own grandmother, but she never fully materialized as a character to me. She was more like a shadowy outline that needed to be filled in. I certainly thought that the diary format would make it easier for us to get inside her head as she experienced major life changes, like her older sister marrying, and she herself marrying an older man from Brooklyn. At least it was on the shorter side."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Rose","review":"When Rose Frampton begins a diary on her fifteenth birthday in December of 1899, she doesn't expect her life on a South Carolina plantation to change much, although she is excited about the approach of a new century. And she certainly doesn't expect to marry yet. But Rene Dumarest, a wealthy silk importer twice her age, proposes marriage -- and believing it will help her family's finances, Rose accepts. Now she must leave her home to travel north to Rene's home in Brooklyn. Rose must adjust to being mistress of her own home, to being a married woman, when in many ways she is still just a child.This book is another excellent history novel by Ann Rinaldi, based on the life of her grandparents, Rose and Rene. Rose was an excellent character, and the author really showed how she was caught between girlhood and womanhood. I also loved how this book was written in the form of a diary. I highly recommend this book to Ann Rinaldi's fans, and to teen readers who historical fiction in diary form."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Rose","review":"What causes two people to fall in love? In Ann Rinaldi's Brooklyn Rose, a young girl living at the dawn of the 20th century searches for the answer to this question.Rose Frampton, though only fifteen years old, must marry a wealthy New Yorker and leave her family home in South Carolina to live with him in Brooklyn. She shares her thoughts about love, life, and growing up in a series of diary entries.Based loosely on the lives of the author's grandparents, Brooklyn Rose offers readers a glimpse into the heart of a girl on her journey to womanhood. All of the characters are well rounded and presented in a believable manner. Brooklyn Rose could easily be mistaken for a real journal.Brooklyn Rose is a straightforward and uncomplicated read. Honest and introspective, the only potential fault with the book lies in its length. It is short, and ends on a somewhat inconclusive note. But the story itself is rich enough to compensate for this minor weakness.Armchair Interviews says: Ultimately, this book is the perfect gift for any girl on the path to maturity.

I can still recommend this one highly, however."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Rose","review":"I enjoyed Ann Rinaldi's books when I was younger so I thought I'd pick up a couple more of hers since I love historical fiction.I know that times were different in the 1900s and that girls oftened were married young.

I got it yesterday afternoon and had it read in tow hours! I wouldn't call it Ann's best but still worth priase. The book is based on Ann Rinaldi's grandparents whom she never meet. The story is told through the eyes of Rose, a fifteen year old girl who enjoys very much being a child. Rose watches her sister Heppi get married and dreads the thought of it happing to her. But on the night Heppi's engagment is announced Rose's father introduces her to Rene Dumarest, a weathly silk merchant.

Through plenty of trials and errors life begins to settle into a steady pace until Rose disovers she is pregante and that her mother in law is a terrible prick. In the end all's well that ends well."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Rose","review":"The year is 1899. Rose Frampton has lived in Beaufort County, South Carolina since the day she was born. As the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, Rose has always enjoyed the finer things in life, and been rewarded with an excellent education. While Rose has not developed many friendships with people aside from her family, and the workers around her home, she has come to love South Carolina, and would never want to leave the remote little town for something unknown to her. But, sometimes, you don't have a choice.Fifteen-year-old Rose has never seen herself as a young beauty. Instead, she has always fawned over her older sister, Heppi. Heppi has always had a long line of suitors banging down the door to spend time with her; and it's no surprise. Heppi is lovely in ever way; which is why she is destined to marry well. When a rich stranger from New York City named Rene begins spending time with Rose's family, Rose pays little mind. After all, Rene is in his thirties, and is a Yankee. Unlike Rose, however, Rene sees no problem in the age difference, and is soon falling in love with Rose. They are quickly married, and before Rose knows what is happening, she has been swept away from her beloved home and family in South Carolina, and is now living in a lavish Victorian estate in Brooklyn, New York. As a mere child, Rose is confused at how to run a successful household, and finds herself stumbling over the simplest of tasks. Luckily, Rene is a kind man who is patient and loving in everything Rose does. The rest of the neighborhood women are not. Rose is viewed as a youngster, and the much older neighborhood women do not take kindly to her presence. As an individual interested in both activism and volunteer opportunities, however, Rose refuses to let the women walk all over her; and begins proposing different charity events to her neighbors, hoping that they will assist her in making the world a better place. And, as Rose becomes more comfortable in her living situation, she finds that, even when things get tough, all it takes is one person to make a difference.Ann Rinaldi has a knack for penning historical novels that put the reader into the same era and location as the main character. BROOKLYN ROSE is no exception. Rose is a delightful character who warms your heart from page one. The descriptions of her life in South Carolina, and the time she spends with her horse, and family bring to life the close-knit environment young girls held with their parents and siblings back in the late 1800's. When Rose makes her way to New York City, however, the reader is given a different glimpse into Rose's personality. She is less cheery, and more self-conscious of being the mistress of her own home, and creating a happy life for Rene. Yet, even with adjustment difficulties and problems with some of her neighbors, Rose's bright outlook on life never wavers. As a woman of privilege, Rose is determined to be involved in philanthropic work, and to provide a better environment for those who are less fortunate than herself. This trait alone makes Rose a beautiful person, and an appealing character. Her relationship with Rene doesn't hurt much either. The two have such a loving marriage that they appeal to you wonderfully as a couple. Rene's ability to make Rose feel stronger as an independent woman is quite unexpected, but delightful, nonetheless. The sprinkling of New York City history throughout the story is an added bonus, and the descriptions of buildings provide a wonderful glimpse into the New York City of 1899 and 1900. One of Rinaldi's sweetest smelling books.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Brooklyn Rose","review":"This book is a great book for girls of all ages.

At the time, I had been quite a believer in objectivism but completely irked by the Peikoff-style iron fisted approach to philosophy (that Rand was indubitably a part of). Objectivism was not much better, it seemed, than the very religous dogma it rebelled so much against. Then I read Kelley and decided that one could actually have a more tolerant and open objectivism. Unfortunately, as objectivists say, A is A - Objectivism is Objectivism (still with a capital \\"O\\") and my new found optimism only lasted about another six months. The \\"movement\\" will never change; it never could; the intolerance Kelley wants is built into the fiber of Rand's philosophy. Despite Kelley's efforts, I decided to quit.This is NOT to say that Kelley doesn't put forth a noble effort. In fact, for those that admire Objectivism, this is really a great book and you should read it. In it, Kelley's main target is objectivism's assertion that as all ideas are moral to some degree, we as right thinking people should always - ALWAYS - condem those who hold \\"immoral\\" views - whether it be Kant, Marx, your co-workers, or your college professor.Kelley tries very hard to draw a distinction between when it is appropriate to morally condemn and write off, and when it is not. Unfortunately, his argument is pure rhetoric and fails to do much except, as another reviewer nobley said, belabor the obvious. The problem, as that same reviewer said, is that intolerance is simply built into the system of objectivism.So as to explain only enough not to bore the reader, there is an odd and unresolved tension in Kelley's simultaneous view that (a) \\"there is no dichotomy between fact and value\\" and (b) his dislike of the belief that things have intrinsic values discovered through Reason (natural law and the like). He correctly notes that it is a hard line to keep straight, but fails to mention that he doesn't ever actually draw the line. When one believes that values are a form of fact and that those facts can only be discovered through reason, one is - no matter how one sells it - a believer in the very intrinsicism one is preaching against.Secondly, Kelley talks of toleration as, to a decent degree good, because 'there is a difference between error and evil.' We tolerate others because they (he never says 'we') have a right ot err. That is not tolerance that anyone wants; it is rather like a heterosexist tolerating her flaming gay cousin or someone tolerating a buzzing fly. That is not tolerance; it is condescension in 'tolerance's' clothing.(And if objectivism isn't supposed to be Leonard Peikoff's religion anymore, then why does Kelley still capitalize the \\"O\\"?)What Kelley, I think, doesn't realize is that, as Greg Nyquist below writes, the moment one suggests that there is no dichotomy between fact and value - between is and ought - the tendency will always be to suggest that \\"since I'm right and you're not, you should go my way; or I could just tolerate you by silent condescension.\\"Read the book. See if it makes sense to you. I cannot tell you what to do (as I have given up those Randian pretensions). But for my money, Kelley is running against a current that is so fast and strong that while he might feel he is making good speed, he will still do nothing but lose ground."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"Perhaps someday someone will correct Dr. Kelley's understanding of Objectivism and help him eliminate the title of Grand Second Hander. He so changes the underlying tenants of Objectivism (as he expresses in this mediocre book), that he should call his work something other than &quot;Objetivism&quot;. Why must he call his work the same thing as someone else's work? I am thankful that I borrowed this book from a library instead of buying it as I would consider it to have been a complete waste of my money. Better to leave Ayn Rand's work to Ayn Rand's books and ignore second-handers."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"Kelley endorses a concept of \\"tolerance\\" that includes the \\"toleration\\" of the comprehensive dishonesty of Nathaniel and Barbara Branden. A \\"Big-L\\" Libertarian is almost by definition one who uncritically embraces the Brandens or Rothbard in their dishonest slams on Ayn Rand, just as Kelley has now embraced the Brandens.Politically, the valid concept is \\"rights.\\" Morally, the concept of \\"tolerance\\" is meaningless. Debating, discussing or working with someone depends on having an honest colleague or rival to do it with, whatever you agree or disagree about. Nothing positive can come from cooperating with the dishonest. \\"Tolerating\\" the dishonest, in any non-political sense, means endorsing it -- voluntarily giving it the very credibility it does not deserve. Would Kelley debate flat-earth advocates or those who deny the Holocaust, if he found in a particular case, he wasn't totally sure whether the advocate was evading or not...?"},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"This is a truly wonderful book. In it, philosopher David Kelley analyzes several issues that have haunted the &quot;Objectivist Movement.&quot; In particular, he discusses whether Objectivism is an open or closed system of ideas, and whether the practice of toleration is in fact consonant with the principles of Objectivism. Kelley answers that it is an open system of ideas, and he shows that the practice of tolerance is consonant with the fundamental principles of Ayn Rand's thought. [I give this book 4 stars, rather than 5, because its thesis - though correct - is of peripheral philosophical importance].Moreover, this book serves as a manifesto and rally-point for Objectivists who are reasonable people. There is every reason for healthy, reasonable human beings to be interested in Ayn Rand's thought. She outlines a secular, life-affirming, benevolent morality that offers valuable, principled, fundamental guidance in making decisions. She also has many interesting philosophical theories on, e.g., the nature of historical and cultural change, concept-formation, philosophical methodology, and politics.But historically, Rand's followers have been an odd cult of self-effacing, thought-policing, paranoid sycophants. Many of the Objectivists I have met were, well, blustering, inarticulate, wrathful nutcases who liked Rand mostly for her wholesale condemnation of contemporary society. These individuals hated all other people (and Rand did, too); they also hated themselves (Rand, in her worst moments, gives them an excuse for doing so). So basically, Rand's writings gave them a great swift sword to exercise in their dealings with others. These sorts of people delight, above all, not in creating values or living happily and productively, but in acquiring and exercising the power to CONDEMN, EXORCISE, REBUKE, VILLIFY, and EXCOMMUNICATE all of mankind. Rand gives them this power, in the form of rationalizations for militant misanthropy and unreflective, religious &quot;commitment&quot; to her ethical dicta (with no knowledge of their basis in reality). Such Objectivists - concretized in the person of Peter Schwartz - are a variation on the mentality of Jehovah's Witnesses and the Hezbollah.Well, Kelley is - in letter and in spirit - the antithesis of this approach to Rand's work. He is a sane human being who wants to critically examine arguments and views. He thinks that Rand's fundamental framework is true and the proper superstructure for philosophical inquiry, but he is open and honest and invites the reader to explore philosophical issues in this spirit. David Kelley - more than Peikoff, Binswanger, or Schwartz - knows the meaning of the passage in Atlas Shrugged that reads:&quot;The vilest form of self-abasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptance of his assertions as facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as middle-man between your consciousness and your existence.&quot; (AS, 1019).If the &quot;Dark Side&quot; students of Objectivism at the Ayn Rand Institute ever discovered the meaning of this passage, that organization would of necessity cease to exist."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"A number of the reviewers here of Kelley's book are water-carriers for the ARI and their curious claim that NOBODY (except them, of course!) can speak for Objectivism and the legacy of Ayn Rand. Echoing Leonard Peikoff, they claim that Objectivism is a \\"closed system\\" that is perfect, complete, above criticism, and comprises ONLY the writings of Ayn Rand or those she endorsed (although ARI tries to ignore the Brandens' pre-1968 writings that Ayn Rand herself, endorsed). Ironically, this means that not only is Peikoff's own book on Objectivism excluded from the \\"canon\\" (as Peikoff admits in his Preface), BUT SO ALSO IS EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT OBJECTIVISM, PRO OR CON, SINCE RAND'S DEATH! So even the Ayn Rand Institute's authors cannot claim that their writings are \\"Objectivist.\\"However, this attempt to stifle or disqualify any critical commentary on Ayn Rand's remarkable contributions to philosophy is doomed to failure, as has been repeatedly demonstrated in the history of ideological movements. The early followers of Saint-Simon, Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud (to name a few examples) all tried to limit or disqualify any criticism or revision of their founders, but to no avail. In fact, such attempts inevitably lead to even more criticism, more revisions and additions, and the proliferation of schools of thought, all claiming that only they have found the \\"true\\" interpretation of what the original philosopher \\"really\\" meant.Sadly, the ARI people just don't get it. I guess we will just have to let history teach them. For everyone else who has read Ayn Rand and are looking for a deeper understanding of her ideas and their implications, I suggest that they read this revealing book by David Kelley (-AND Nathaniel and Barbara Branden, AND the Objectivist Center/Atlas Society authors, AND Leonard Peikoff and other ARI authors, among others) and then, judge for yourself as to who is more true to Ayn Rand's vision of reason and individualism."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"David Kelley was \\"excommunicated\\" (so to speak) from the \\"official,\\" Leonard Peikoff/Harry Binswanger/Ayn Rand Institute school of Objectivism for his sympathies to Libertarian sentiments. He then founded the Institute of Objectivist Studies in 1990 (which co-founder George Walsh described as \\"a home for homeless Objectivists\\"; pg. 11), which later became The Objectivist Center and The Atlas Society.This 2000 book is a revision and expansion of Kelley's 1990 monographTruth and Toleration; he has also written books such asThe Art of Reasoning (Third Edition),The Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of Perception,A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State, etc.Although Kelley was an active Objectivist (he was even selected to read Rand's favorite poem at her funeral), his \\"refusal to denounce Barbara Branden'sThe Passion of Ayn Rand, and his openness to libertarianism (which he views as \\"two sides of the same committment to reason, objectivity, and respect for the independence of others as indivdiduals\\") \\"led to a conflict with other leaders of the movement.\\" (Pg. 10-11) After being exiled from the movement, his 1990 monograph \\"was my attempt to answer the arguments... (and) provide the full philosophical case for my own position.\\" (Pg. 11)His key idea is that \\"while Objectivism is a magnificent system of ideas, it is not a closed system.\\" (Pg. 71) For example, later philosophers \\"will address issues that Ayn Rand did not consider, and put forward ideas that were not hers.\\" (Pg. 77) He argues that Objectivism \\"has an essential ... set of basic doctrines that distinguishes it from other viewpoints... anyone in substantial agreement with those doctrines is an Objectivist.\\" (Pg. 85)He offers other criticisms of Objectivism; for example, he observes that he has met Objectivists \\"who casually denounce Kant as the most evil man in history without having read a word of what he wrote.\\" (Pg. 57)Regardless of which side (if any) of the TAS/ARI divide one is on, this book is challenging and provocative reading for anyone interested in Ayn Rand, Objectivism, and/or Libertarianism."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"... I actually found _The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism_ far from dull. Why? Because it instilled in me a sense of excitement and appreciation for well-reasoned arguments that I had not experienced since I first started reading Rand's works in the early 1980's. Back then, the more I read, the more my excitement waned. By the time I finished reading every book written by Rand and Peikoff, I decide to give up on Objectivism for two main reason: Intolerance and Dogmatism.But in this book, Kelley addressed the issues of Moral Judgment, Sanction, Toleration and the nature of Closed/Open Philosophical Systems in such a carefully reasoned way that it has given me a desire to renew my interest in Objectivism. As an Open System, Objectivism can grow and flourish, and is worth investing Time and Rational Effort on. And with the immergence of the Objectivist Center, and other Objectivist organizations independent from Peikoff's Orthodoxy, I believe the Movement is headed in the right direction. If Objectivism remains a Closed System under Peikoff's stewardship (his \\"Tribal Leadership\\"), then it is not worthy of any additional expenditure of time, money or energy.&lt;P..."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"In 1989, David Kelley spoke at the Laissez Faire Supper Club, a libertarian organization. Although he was an Orthodox Objectivist at that time, he was denounced and driven out of the movement by its second-hand leaders. Kelley responded to the ouster by writing Truth and Toleration in 1990. In The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand, Kelley reprints this work without changes and adds a preface and a postscript bringing the discussion current to 2000.A split in a minor, quasi-religious cult like Objectivism wouldn't justify an entire book, but that's not what Kelley wrote in 1990. Rather, Truth and Toleration is an interesting discussion of Objectivism and also of how one judges people and their ideas. For example, is a person who advocates an evil idea (Marxism) as culpable as those who murder millions of people in the name of Marxism (such as Stalin and his henchmen)? Even if we consider Kant evil, are we justified in laying at his feet the errors that his followers developed as a result of his flawed premises? Am I prohibited from doing anything that benefits an evil person, no matter how incidentally? Kelley gives interesting and basically common-sense answers to these and other questions.Kelley also has an interesting discussion of Objectivism as an &quot;open&quot; versus a &quot;closed&quot; system. As Kelley notes, Rand's published writings on philosophy (excluding the philosophical selections in her novels) was fairly small (not more than 600 pages). Although she wrote on many issues in philosophy, some she only touched on briefly. For example, in her misnamed Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, she only mentioned in passing the accuracy of the senses. She never published her major work on metaphysics. She didn't have much to say on propositions, the mind-body problem, or the philosophy of science. (Some of these are my examples, not Kelley's.) So even if an Objectivist attempts to follow Rand's philosophy as closely as possible, he still has to apply her ideas to new areas if he is going to do any creative work. Whether any development of Rand's philosophy in a given area is a legitimate extension of her ideas will therefore be subject to dispute. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the output of Orthodox Objectivism has been rather slim -- best stay on well-trod ground than venture out for fear of excommunication. It is only Objectivists outside of the official movement and those who are sympathetic to her ideas who have published a lot, from what I can tell.This book isn't perfect. It contains typical Objectivist snide (and ill-informed) attacks on religion, for example. However, it is well-written and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"A ground-breaking work in philosophy, this work shows why toleration is an important virtue for rational and objective discussion. It also explores why some followers of Rand end up dogmatic and authoritarian. Kelley shows that a true Objectivist is an independent thinker who is not only reasonable and objective but tolerant of others in the realm of ideas. It is both clear and cogent.Some obviously confused people call Dr. Kelley a second-hander, but Kelley is a first-rate thinker who is one of the few Objectivist philosophers to do any orignal and independent work as an Objectivist. This book along with Unrugged Individualism are path-breaking works that already have inspired thousands and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"It is hard to believe that a philosophy which preaches individualism, benevolence, and rationality would oppose toleration, but that is what Objectivism, in the version preached by Leonard Peikoff, actually does. Objectivism, according to Peikoff, is a closed system and anyone who dares to question any tenet of Objectivism is immediately to be ostracized and declared a bad and evil person. Kelley refutes this appalling view. He explains why toleration is a positive virtue and why Peikoff's view of Objectivism is guilty of tribalism. This book contributes a much needed corrective to dogmatic, cultist tendencies in Objectivism. Kelley has respect for people as individuals; he doesn't view people in terms of whether they agree or not with Ayn Rand. It is only in this way that Rand's ideas can be helpful. To be rational is to think for oneself, not to blindly follow some intellectual authority. Kelley shows that the true &quot;objectivist&quot; thinks for himself, even if that means he must disagree with some tenet of Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"Objectivism is the name that Ayn Rand gave HER philosophy. If you change it's fundamentals around, it's no longer Objectivism. If I want to change Objectivism so it includes religion, or astrology or faith, that new philosophy I created is no longer Objectivism. Kelley wants to do just that. Change fundamentals, but still get away with calling it Objectivism. That's about as dishonest as you can get.If you want to understand Objectivism, read Ayn Rand's books.If you want to learn about Kelleyism, read Kelley's books.But do not confuse the two."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"Immoral conduct has something to do with what used to be called \\"bad character.\\" Rand knew that beneath it all, our habits, emotions, and characteristic attitudes are largely the result of our thinking or failure to think. If Rand was right -- if thinking is a volitional choice -- then, of course, EVERY idea one believes is either honest or dishonest (taking into account the context of available knowledge, of course.) EVERY belief is, therefore, moral or immoral -- no matter how difficult this may be to determine in a particular case. Dishonest thinking is morally bad even BEFORE it is acted on, precisely because it helps shape behavior. ... Rand believed that intellectual dishonesty of this kind is the result of volitional choices and that intellectual dishonesty of this kind is causally related to bad behavior. It is, all by itself, a bad thing. One might even say that the simple-minded confusion between political \\"tolerance\\" and moral \\"tolerance\\" by smart people is likely to be dishonest. It also shows just how much damage the Popper-Hayek crowd has inflicted on the libertarian capacity to think. Another bad result of bad thinking, hmmm ..."},{"Title":"The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism","review":"The great philosopher Karl Popper once noted that any denial of the dualism between fact and standards (or fact and values) &quot;is dangerous,&quot; because those who believe they have found an objective morality may seek to impose it on other people. Ayn Rand, in her so-called &quot;Objectivist&quot; philosophy, believed she had found a way around Popper's stricture. By combining an objective morality with an uncompromisingly individualistic, anti-aggression politics, Rand could argue that her philosophy escaped the totalitarian taint of previous ideologies that denied the fact-value dualism. Although morality is objective, this doesn't mean, Rand contended, that the government should used force to impose moral values on people. One of the most important moral values in hierarchy of ethics are those supporting the freedom of the individual, even if this means the freedom to be immoral. Freedom, then, must come first. But this doesn't mean that the individual himself must approve of how other people use (or misuse, as the case may be) their freedom. As an implacable moralizer, Rand insisted that everyone, morally, had an obligation to &quot;judge&quot; other people. This passion of Rand's inspired in her a hatred of tolerance, a value essential to democracy and freedom. Rand's faithful protege, Leonard Peikoff, has followed Rand's lead and waged furious and uncompromising polemical war against tolerance. In an essay entitled &quot;Fact and Value,&quot; Peikoff attacked fellow Objectivist David Kelley for not appreciating how immoral it is to be tolerant of other people. Kelley had been pushing the envelope for years within Objectivist circles with his &quot;outrageously&quot; tolerant attitudes. He had suggested, for example, that not every academic marxist has horns and tail or is dripping with evil and that it is possible to learn from someone you disagree with. Peikoff would have none of it. He charged Kelley with defending the &quot;dichotomy between fact and value&quot; and boasted of having broken off all relations with so reprobate a thinker.&quot;The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand&quot; is Kelley's reply to Peikoff's &quot;Fact and Value.&quot; Kelley attempts to use Randian conceptual analysis to defend a kind of mitigated tolerance. He argues that ideas, in and of themselves, can only become evil once they are acted upon. This being the case, he concludes that we should not necessarily judge a person because he or she espouses bad ideas. We must first determine whether the person has acted on those ideas. Kelley also warns about the difficulty of distinguishing between a person who mistakenly holds bad ideas and one who holds them maliciously, with intent to be evil.I fear many readers will find all this a rather tedious exercise in belaboring the obvious. What is extraordinary is not so much that Kelley should write a book defending tolerance but that such a debate should be taking place at all, or that advocates of a philosophy that supposedly supports freedom and opposes any initiating of aggression should be arguing over whether tolerance is a virtue. Tolerance may not be the most immaculate and perfect of all virtues, but the alternatives to tolerance are very much worse. Intolerance breeds hatred, social division, senseless rivalry and, ultimately, violence. How can any decent person possibly support that? Nonetheless, I believe that &quot;unimatrix&quot; has a point in accusing Kelley of being confused about Objectivism. If you believe, as all good Randites are supposed to believe, that &quot;reason&quot; can discover objective moral absolutes that can be validated beyond all doubt, then I do not see how one can escape Peikoff's position that tolerance is essentially vicious. And if you add to this espousal of moral certainty the view that moral ideas are important factors in political and social change and that bad moral ideas lead to widespread misery and death, then the moral obligation to practice intolerance seems unavoidable. For if the existence of civilization depends on the espousal of the right ideas, then of course bad ideas must not be tolerated. In the final analysis, Peikoff is a more logical thinker than Kelley. If Peikoff can be criticized at all on this issue, it is for not being logical enough: for if it is really true that the espousal of a bad idea can lead to widespread devastation and misery, it is hard to escape the conclusion that bad ideas must be put down by force. The Objectivist view of moral certainty, if taken to its logical extreme, would lead to a totalitarianism of the most uncompromising sort. We can only hope that Rand's followers will continue to be poor logicians. Otherwise, they would seek to become grand inquisitors intent on stamping out heresy!"},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","review":"This is a very bizarre book indeed. Schuller's ideals are laudable in themselves: don't tamper with scores and don't let your ego get in the way of what the composer is saying. But his attempts to prove his point are flawed in almost every way, mainly because he constantly breaks the rules that he set out himself to start with. He obsessively analyses recordings of a number of famous great works with the score in hand, and points out the innumerable sins, blunders and stupidities that in his view virtually every conductor allows himself in virtually every bar. For some reason the author presumes he is just about the only one who knows how it should be done, or cares about doing it well, or even more amazingly: knows what the composer actually meant. E.g.: Changing anything in a score is a mortal sin, because the composer knows best - only Schuller knows better, pointing out where the composer 'forgot' something or is 'obviously' wrong, and changing instrumentation, tempo or dynamics accordingly. For some unspecified reason (a personal hotline to the hereafter maybe?) the author is the only conductor allowed to make such decisions; be sure he will hurl accusations of incompetence or arrogance at others who do the same thing! These inconsistencies are an inevitable result from the assumption that scores are fairly unambiguous and composers well nigh infallible. Of course, they aren't and they aren't.Schuller claims objectivity, but his methods wouldn't hold their own against even the mildest scientific criteria. How can one realistically compare recordings from the '30s to state of the art CD-sound from the '90s? Can one really, objectively and consistently, judge the difference between pp and ppp? And if Schuller can't hear a particular detail, is that proof of an inadequate performance - or does it say something about differences in recording techniques, about the (unspecified) playback equipment Schuller used, or even about his hearing? Worse, Schuller's reasoning is rarely other than subjective: 'Any intelligent reading of the score will make it obvious...', and arguments like that. Also he will point out how 'natural', 'thrilling' or 'perfect'something will sound if done the right (i.e., Schuller's) way, forgetting that these are all matters of taste. Where he really gives himself away is in his vitriolic attack on the authenticists, which is so poorly argued and random that I find it hard to understand without wondering about personal motives (Schuller pulls all the stops here, and enjoys adding a footnote in which he points out that in a supposedly 'expert' booklet note on an authentic Beethoven recording the term 'mezza voce' is misspelled as 'mesa voce'. This turns out unexpectedly funny seeing that Schuller himself also misspells the term, as 'messa voce'!).Maybe for some this book invites a new look at some scores, but it also turns music-making into a scholastic exercise at the risk of draining all feeling out of it. The useful points that are made could have been made in under 50 pages; the rest is just obsessive repetition. It might have warranted 2 stars, maybe, but I felt the overenthusiastic average rating needed some reduction towards a more realistic level."},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","review":"This book was recommended to me during a conducting workshop. The teacher, an extremely knowledgeable musician and gifted and hardworking conductor, hated this book upon FIRST reading, and as he explored the concepts and analyses further found more enlightenment and wisdom. You can tell the folks who didn't like this book are writing off the cuff.In The Compleat Conductor, Gunther Schuller gives us his philosophy and a short history of conducting, and then goes into some real detail analyzing eight great classical works and how even the greatest maestros can fail the composer's wishes and ideals. Schuller is VERY straightforward and covers all of his bases well, and defends his points and decisions and pickiness. A quote: &quot;The secret of great artistry and true integrity of interpretation lies in the ability to bring to life the score for the listener (and the orchestra) through the fullest knowledge of the score, so that the conductor's personality expresses itself WITHIN the parameters of the score.&quot; Schuller maintains that composers like Beethoven and Brahms were very explicit in their desires, and that their music doesn't need all of the extra bells and whistles conductors use to manipulate an audience, and in fact a good number of conductors in the process ignore the finer points of the music.Quote again: &quot;...all those deviations from the score do not necessarily make the performance 'more natural,''more human.' They may create that illusion--or delusion; they may fool the unknowing, unwary listener into thinking that it was 'exciting,''moving,''authentic,' when in reality the excitement was superficial and the work was grossly misrepresented.&quot;There are points in the book where Schuller then recommends changing this and that in various scores. But in these sections he more than backs up his reasons--perhaps there is conflict between the manuscript and printed scores, or maybe there is truly a problem in balance due to the power of different instruments, etc.I am now listening to recordings with a new critical ear, and approaching my orchestral work with a refreshed perspective."},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","review":"Schuller has got an ax to grind here, citing laundry lists of &quot;incorrect&quot; tempi from the pantheon of conductors. Abbado is too fast, Bernstein too slow, Boulez too fast. On and on and on, like he is piling corpses,referring that everyone is wrong, yet he is right. Schuller is arrogant as well, claiming &quot;Brahms never meant that tempo&quot;,claiming how stupid conductors have been by not following what the composer had indicated. If we did that, there would be little to listen to of interest within the classical canon. The grand masters knew nothing of performance of their new works, they guessed at tempi many times, it has only been through continuous performance up through today that such a thing as tempi has come to be affix in a somewhat loose way. Schuller knows his orchestration however with a focus upon blending of winds and strings and the problematics, like in the opening of the First Symphony of Brahms.I had wished he would have included a new work, even one of his own would have been fantastic to discuss,i.e. the conducting problems of a new work. Ravel's Daphnis &amp; Chloe is a great example which he utilizes here. That work with string harmonics and virtuoso wind writing in multi-layered textures is again a great example. I suspect the editor perhaps cut out a chapter on Ligeti or Boulez or Babbitt. He should follow-up this book with another strictly devoted to music after 1945."},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","review":"This book often inspires a fresh take on the standard repertoire,more alive than the average analysis book.It's easy to understand why Schuller has carved a reputation as a composition teacher-Bainbridge,Weir and Knussen from the UK alone!Alas,the central thrust of 'The Compleat Conductor'-that conductors often deviate from the letter of the score(shock,horror!)....becomes weary and pedantic in the end.Schuller really doesn't see the wood for the trees and his arguments aren't as watertight as you might think as some of the other reviewers have shown."},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","review":"Many might frown at Gunther Schuller's lengthy, and by no means completely coherant, work on orchestral leadership. This book is not for the beginner. Here is a book for the music lover - to prove once and for all that great conducting does not come from the conductor's own ideas alone - as he [Gunther] restates something Ravel once told musicians: &quot;do not 'interpret [what has been written in the score] ' - &quot;REALIZE&quot; what the score itself is saying to you!&quot; Just one of Gunther's many messages: The score, written by the sole person who fully understood it, tells you what it wants.

But in these sections he more than backs up his reasons--there may be a conflict between the manuscript and printed scores, maybe there is truly a problem in balance due to the power of different instruments, or else there may be problems in the publishing. His point being that you have to make informed, intelligent decisions when you bring music to life with an ensemble. Every single nitpick Schuller has with the world's greatest conductors is backed up by examples in the score and historical musical analysis. I have to admit it is a little bit fun to read some of the barbs he throws at the \\"great maestroes\\", and to know that they are fallible and not necessarily automatically superior interpreters of every work. A conductor can get a sound thrashing for certain points of his interpretation of a piece, but then on the next page be commended as being the ultimate purveyor of good taste in another passage over all others. So each conductor is only judged on their actions within the music and get equal consideration (with the exception of Bernstein who gets a poke or two for his ego and podium gyrations).As a violinist in a couple of local symphonies and someone who has studied to a small degree the art of conducting, I have to agree with Schuller that most musicians have no idea what actually goes on within a score and that that is a real disservice to the music. Most musicians, I have discovered, also have no idea what makes the difference between a great conductor and teacher and someone who can go through the motions and look really good--without actually transferring much meaning into the music for the musicians to work with. This is why The Compleat Conductor is important for musicians to read. And if you are simply a classical music lover this could get a little bit pedantic at times, but if you also like to follow scores can be an eye-opener when you go back to listen again with your favorite recording.By the way, Schuller does make exceptions for the different sound qualities of recordings of different time periods and does note those places where he couldn't be sure of problems because of those difficulties. There are also a couple of unfortunate editing errors, but they are small considerations within the large scope of this work."},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","review":"This is a wonderful expose of symphonic performances based on detailed study of hundreds of recordings.

Twain describes his adventures in Germany, Switzerland, the French Alps, and finally northern Italy. His account of Germany takes up half the book so the coverage is somewhat lopsided, but I think this was simply a result of realism setting in: It's an awful lot of work to write a daily journal in detail and I'm sure that Twain began to grow weary of having to take time out of every day to record events. Time spent writing could be better spent living and enjoying one's vacation. I know the feeling since I do keep a daily journal; I let it slip for days or weeks and then have to catch up, and that takes a lot of time.Ok, the main thing to note is that the account is absolutely HILARIOUS. A delightful way to pass an hour reading during lunchtime or on the beach during a vacation. I read this quite a few months ago so I've forgotten much of the content. The stories that I still remember pretty vividly:- The bloody fencing matches at the university in Heidelberg- The raft ride down the Neckar- A couple tragic accounts of past failed attempts at climbing certain mountains- The over-the-top story of Twain's expedition to climb the Riffelberg- The hilarious appendix on the German languageI sell most of my books after reading them but I have such fond memories of the stories in \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" that I'm hanging on to it."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"A Tramp Abroad provides an insight into Europe, in all its guises. In many ways, this sparkling guide is as relevant today as it has always been. Many elements of Twain's &quot;character&quot; are portrayed in the book, including, at times, his innate childishness. His tendency to ramble, both in text and in journey, far from being irritating, quickly becomes indeering. The only thing that a reader has to fear from this book is either being late for work, or losing ribs. The most notable point about this book is the wonderful commentary Twain passes on his own artistic skills, and the way that the wholly imagined nature of the above serves perhaps as a metaphor for the whole of what he sees on his journey.

But if, like me until recently, you aren't familiar with him beyond reading Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn when you were in school, you may well not realize how hysterically funny he very often is. In &#34;A Tramp Abroad&#34; he alternates between lyrical, poetic descriptions of things like awesome vistas in the Alps on the one hand and truly laugh out loud passages satirizing his own drawing &#34;talents&#34;, mountain climbing prowess, or an endless parade of other absurdities, real or invented. He also displays here little of the misogyny and cultural chauvinism that makes the otherwise wonderful &#34;The Innocents Abroad&#34; sometimes hard to take.

Twain satirizes both the tourists and their writings with deliciouswit. Ever a man to play with words, his &quot;tramp&quot; refers to both himself and the walking tourof Europe he purports to have made.

Hisjudgments are vividly conveyed in this book, standing in marked contrast to his morereserved approach in Innocents Abroad.

Twain was deeply interested in people, andvarious &quot;types&quot; are drawn from his piercing gaze, rendered with acerbic wit. Some of theseare contemporary, while others are dredged from his memories of the California mines andother journeys. He also relished Nature's marvels, recounting his observations.

It is part travel guide, part commentary on European culture, and part tall tale. Like many of Twain's less-known works, \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is rather uneven -- the chapters in the book range from rather boring to laugh-out-loud funny. Yet on balance, the humorous moments make up for the dull moments, and the majority of the less humorous chapters are still interesting. Apart from a few slow chapters, it provides a good read from beginning to end.Some of the highlights of \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" are Twain's exaggerated account of his ascent of the Riffelberg (a mountain in the Swiss Alps), his comments on the peculiarities of the German language, and a hilarious episode in which Twain spends half an hour pretending to know a woman who remembers him though he doesn't remember her.I have read most of Twain's works, and in my opinion \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is not his best work, but it is definitely one of his most underrated books. It is not as good as his most popular works of fiction (i.e., Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn), nor is it as good as \\"Life on the Mississippi.\\" But I found it to be the most entertaining of his purely travel-oriented books (the other books in that category being \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" and \\"Following the Equator\\"). The bottom line is that if you are a fan of Mark Twain's style, then you should find this book to be well worth reading.Finally, if you are going to read \\"A Tramp Abroad,\\" I highly recommend obtaining a version that contains all 328 of the original illustrations. While I normally would make this recommendation for any of Twain's works, it is especially important for this book since the text makes several references to the illustrations, and since some of the jokes in the text would not make sense without the illustrations. The only current edition I know of that definitely contains *all* of the original illustrations is the Oxford Mark Twain edition (ISBN 0195101375). Also, the Modern Library Classics edition (ISBN 0812970039) apparently has retained some of the original illustrations, since it contains a note stating that \\"... some illustrations have been omitted\\" (thus implying that some have not been omitted).

His account of his mountaineering expedition, together with a staff of almost 150 people, is hilarious, as are many of his anecdotes (which, incidentally, are randomly inserted). Still, this book is not nearly as amusing as \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" or &quot;Roughing It&quot;--but that should not come as a surprise. Most of Twain's best work came early in his career, before his pessimism took over and before he was deprived of his entire family through death. This work fits somewhere in the middle of Twain's career, before he completely burned out but after he had already lost a bit of his incredible zest for life and capacity for humor.All in all, this is an excellent book by one of the greatest writers the North American continent has ever produced."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"First of all, this is a great book that has made me laugh countless times. I live in Germany and Mark Twain's observations are so insightful and witty that this book is truly timeless.I give one star to the 2008 version published by \\"Quill Pen Classics.\\" The typesetting in this book is atrocious. It's like someone printed it on their home computer. It is an uneven eyesore and very unpleasant to read. Actually the cover of mine looks like the one available for the Kindle version, but it is a 2008 version from \\"Quill Pen Classics.\\" Apparently this company takes books in the public domain and sells overpriced, poor quality versions of them. $16.95 is a crime both to the consumer and to Mark Twain.I will not buy another book from \\"Quill Pen Classics\\" without looking inside first. I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"I purchased the paperback version of the book. The binding is of exceedingly poor quality. The first pages fall out one by one as they are read. I expect the book itself to be very good. Don't buy the paperback."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier. I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the \\"awful\\" German language was hilarious. In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing. The scene \\"riding\\" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face. It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or \\"typical\\" American's attitudes today.I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe. It's way funnier than his \\"Innocents Abroad\\", which is also a good read on travel in Europe."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain's tongue-in-cheek, semi-fictionalized account of his second European trek, is, despite it's 600+ pages, a lightning quick read. Twain's singular wit is on full display engaging the reader to such an extent that pages swiftly fly by. Though not his best piece of travel writing (see Innocents Abroad), I devoured this book in large chunks eager to see where Twain wandered next. When he arrives in the Alps, A Tramp Abroad vaults from an amusing piece of travel writing to a supremely satisfying form of entertainment.If there was any disappointment it occured with Twain's unexpected exit from the stage. A Tramp Abroad covers Twain's travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, but concludes quite suddenly with mere mention that the Netherlands are next on the docket. Yet, wishing a book to continue confers no blackmark on an author. It is further confirmation that A Tramp Abroad easily merits 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"Follows Twain's odyssey during and extensive European vacation in the late 1800s. One must pay attention at times to separate the pure fantasy-humor from actual experiences and observations. The book jumps around quite a bit and has no consistent theme, but Twain's writing skills, imagination and imagery are wonderfully on display. If you were only going to read one Twain book, this should not be your choice. But as \\"another side\\" of Twain, it was interesting and entertaining."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"Excellent writers also have bad days. The travel accounts are often repetitive.I have not seen a paper copy of this book so I wonder,where are the pictures mentioned throughout the book? Add poor proof reading, and you get stuff like this that another reviewer wrote for a different book: \\"I too would like to mention the FACT that emphasized WORDS are all CAPITALIZED in this version as AMAZINGLY annoying.\\" I confess I skimmed over a LOT of this book."},{"Title":"Kilims: Decorating With Tribal Rugs","review":"The high quality of the photographic reproductions and the high book publication production values make this book. If you've ever begun to look at so-called Persian carpets, you've no doubt been bewildered by the huge variation in price and quality in these things: Hand woven, powerloomed, hand tufted, machine made, vegetable dyes, artificial dyes, cotton, silk, wool, gabbeh, kilim, rug, Indian, Pakistani, Kurdish, Iranian -not to mention the various tribal and trade names for these things. In other words there is just a head-spinning, mind numbing variety of &quot;Persian&quot; carpets available today and it is super easy to pay too much for inferior quality rugs without knowing a bit about them. Thus, this book is a great first step toward finding some excellent floor covering for your home (and, as evinced by this author, for your pillows, furniture, walls and windows). The book is done in roughly two parts. The first half of the book is a discussion of the history of the rug, with a description of how rugs are made and what goes into them. This discussion is accompanied by a large number of excellent color reproductions to inform the reader. The last part of the book is given over to decorating tips also with many photographic examples, and while this part held little interest for me because I'm not into such things, I suspect a few of the author's many great ideas will be employed by a large percentage of those who read this book. Don't expect a discussion of values, costs, etc. Also, do not expect a reference guide to symbology or a guide to specific tribal motifs, etc. Look for that kind of info instead in more formal studies or books about collectible carpets. Having said this, the author does thoughtfully include a list of carpet retailers at the back of her book, a couple of whom I recognized as well-respected carpet merchants with international reputations. Presently there is a fair number of this book available from Amazon sellers for less than the original publication price and as such I believe this presents an excellent value; kind of like paying for the author's output and getting the great pictures and high quality paper, binding and printing of the book for free. I highly recommend this book to the beginning rug buyer, or perhaps a decorator who wants a great coffee table book for an excellent price."},{"Title":"Kilims: Decorating With Tribal Rugs","review":"It's so frustrating to decide to buy a book without being able to page through it so I put several pictures in Images above to help. I have many, many books on oriental carpets and rugs with glorious pictures and detailed histories and explanations of every element of a rug. But this is my only book on kilims specifically and that shows modern-day great suggestions for decorating my home. I would love to be able to own a genuine hand-made carpet but until I can afford it, I salve myself with machine-made reproductions and reading books like this. This book provides such wonderful detail of the peoples who make these rugs and warns of how this is becoming a vanishing art as the nomadic tribes stop traveling for a living. You will be able to find pleasing suggestions for how to decorate your home or just accent a room with a kilim. Every page is filled with color photos of not just rugs themselves but of their use in houses and by their makers. There are many photos of every step of making the carpets from harvesting the fibers to dying them and the weaving. The accompanying text is engaging and rewarding to read."},{"Title":"Kilims: Decorating With Tribal Rugs","review":"kilimsdecorating with tribal rugsby elizabeth hillard\\"Woven with rich, jewel-like colors and intricate symbols, tribal rugs have a timeless quality that fits into any decor. A handmade rug adds comfort and pulls a room together. This is the story of Persian rugs both ancient and modern. It delves into their history and manufacture, and explores their decorating potential and care. In addition, the foreword explains how to select and purchase these rugs wisely -- a major concern of North American consumers. With their vivid colors and patterns, kilims, decorating potential is not limited to the floor. They can be used as pillows, curtains, and wallhangings or to cover tables, beds, and sofas. From the oldest known rug found in a frozen Siberian tomb to modern weaving done by women nomads and village dwellers, kilims are living art.\\""},{"Title":"Eyewitness: Goya","review":"Janis Tomlinson, the writer of this book, seems primarily concerned in showing that there is a continuity in Goya's work, that it did not suddenly change from light-hearted to dark after Goya went deaf. For the most part, I feel she achieved this end, I for one am convinced. I wish she wrote more on Goya's technique and his personal life, both of which she does not go into much. The 300 or so colour reproductions of Goya's work are excellent, and there are many good close-ups. Unfortunately, Goya produced around 1,800 works, so it is disappointing that only a fraction of them are in this book."},{"Title":"Eyewitness: Goya","review":"Nice more compact size and absolutely full of pictures and descriptions of his style and his life and his artwork."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"Very good reading on background of the disease, thoughts on how to treat/prevent for family members (there is some genetic component) as well as sufferers of the condition themselves."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"Only after three years of treatment for his problem with the macular degenerarion, and thanks to this wonderful book, my father begins to understand clearly how to face life onwards"},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"Very good detailed book.

The disease is fully discussed with treatments although since 2003 there have been advances not covered in this printing. It is still an excellent resource for understanding the emotional aspects of the diagnosis and dealing with life style adaptations to fully enjoy life. Dr. Mogk's life serves as an example. Prevention is stressed for family members not yet affected with a strong focus on diet and nutrition. Practical suggestions and resources for low vision patients are covered.The print is good sized and easy to read.I've recommended the book to others with the diagnosis as a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"This is one of the most comprehensive books on macular degeneration. It is written by an eye specialist who treats macular degeneration. Dr. Mogk writes from the unique perspective as also the caregiver to her elderly father who has advanced macular degeneration.With this family history, she is at a greater risk for developing AMD so she has included lots of practical information on prevention and diet and nutrition.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has macular degeneration or who has a family member with AMD.Leslie Degner, RN, BSN[...]"},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"This book is clearly written, covers a lot of material and is a really nice resource for people with macular degeneration. Much of the emphasis is on patients with vision loss and the font size is large to aid in reading. However, it also offers calm advice and information to the newly diagnosed. In fact, it offered me much more useful information than did the retinal specialist. The authors avoid getting too technical and this is both a plus and a minus. That is, most readers will have little trouble understanding almost everything in the book. On the other hand, if you want more detail, more up to date medical information, and more a more critical approach, you will need to use this book as your starting point. The only other negatives that I can remember are a very non-critical description of 'alternative' medicine and a somewhat confusing description of visual rehabilitation methods.On the whole, if you have been newly diagnosed with macular degeneration or have been facing it for a long time, this is must reading. However, this should be your first book on the subject and all are advised to expand beyond this as a reference."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"I used this book as one of my sources for a research paper on macular degeneration(AMD). It was my most useful and most cited source. I see it as a must read for anyone facing AMD, whether they have AMD or someone they care about has it. The writing is clear and informative. It explains the disease very well, as well as giving great information on what you can do now that you are diagnosed."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"This is a beautiful book and I think it saved my father's life. Not only that, but he could read it with vision loss. The print is bold and well spaced, so with his 20/80 eyesight he could read it. We both read it because we got relatively little help from his doctor and there was so much good information -- the first really clear explanation of macular degeneration that I've seen, recipes and a prevention plan for me, a whole rehabilitation program for my father, and a whole section on emotional coping. This book is so well written that it is really one of the most touching books I've read -- very practical but very moving. I want to thank the authors from the bottom of my heart -- I think they have really helped my father to keep his spirit and extent his life. Everyone should read this book. It's a mistake not to."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"Anyone who has recently been diagnosed with macular degeneration, or who has a family member or friend with MD, will treasure this book by the Mogks. It was one of the first books on the subject I read after my doctor told me I had early dry MD in one eye. I was terribly upset to be suddenly faced with a future totally different from what I'd expected. When I picked up the Mogk book, my attention ws immediately riveted by Dr. Mogk's description of her father's happiness and independence despite late-stage MD. This was what I needed to hear: that people could be happy and retain independence in the face of low vision. That very positive beginning is an excellent way to pull the reader into what for most people is an unfamiliar medical problem.As I read further, my first impression of &quot;Macular Degeneration&quot; as an invaluable resource for those who have the disease was reinforced. The Mogks approach the subject of MD from a problem-solving perspective as well as from a professional point of view and from Dr. Mogk's father's experience. The book is very well organized, and the appendices are chock full of good resources for readers to pursue.Dr. Mogk also discusses ongoing research, letting readers know there is a keen interest within the medical-scientific community in macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. As I read of the various efforts afoot, I felt a sense of hope that before too long there will be effective treatment for this devastating disease that affects one-third of those over 75 and also younger people.The message I came away with after finishing the book is that there IS life after MD, and it can be a good one. I enthusiastically recommend this book to everyone who has MD."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD)are hungry for information about this eye condition, which is the leading cause of legal blindness in people over age 60. This volume is a wonderful reference book for anyone dealing with AMD. Dr. Mogk not only provides valid medical information, but also dispenses useful tips for day-to-day living. The chapter on low vision aids is particularly helpful. She and her co-author write in an engaging, warm and personal manner. Her own experience with AMD in her father lends a note of credibility. She obviously cares for her patients and is anxious to give people the knowledge they need to deal with this devastating eye disease. I recommend it highly to anyone who has macular degeneration or is helping a family member or friend."},{"Title":"Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight","review":"This book is absolutely great, without evoking false hopes it provides all the information and support people with ARMD so badly need and usually don't get from their doctors.

I feel so much better both psychically and physically since I've read the book; the diet is easy to follow (and not at all expensive, everybody can afford it), tips and recommendations are extremely helpful. I've lost my panic to become dependent on other people, I feel I'll be able to help myself and be active in many respects, for a long time to come. And this feels so good. Thank you Dr. Mogk!

It is NOT for beginners. I was looking for a book with fun songs for me to play on the piano w/my 2.5 year old daughter, but this is not what we were looking for! It may be what you want though.Here's the contents: There are 8 categories of songs: Down Memory Lane (Roaring 20s, World War I, Jazz Age), All-Time Broadway Hit Parade (Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter), Great Music from the Movies (Dick Powell, Humphrey Bogart), Swing Years (late 30s and early 40s, Louis Armstrong, Guy Lombardo), Treasury of Operetta &amp; Semi-Classical Hits (Victor Herbert, Sigmund Romberg), Gaslight Varieties, Greensleeves, and Music to Lift the Spirits (anthems, hymns).The book says each song has been arranged for piano, guitar and organ. It says the arrangements can be easily adapted to any treble-clef C instrument such as accordion, chromatic harmonica, violin, flute, mandolin, banjo, ukulele, recorder, marimba and xylophone."},{"Title":"Reader's Digest: Family Songbook","review":"I quit piano lessons in the eighth grade (the familiar story of the indimidating piano teacher) but I kept playing on my own all through high school and this is the book I played over and over. It has a fantastic overview of many American musical genres of the first half of the 20th century, occasionally dipping slightly back to the late 19th.The arrangements are fairly easy to play for the intermediate piano player yet they sound deceptively impressive. Guitar chords are also present.The only reason I didn't give it a five-star rating is that, in keeping with the Reader's Digest tradition, this book is condensed; only the choruses of the songs are present. Having grown up with this book, I had no idea that most of these songs had verses not included here. So if you need the entire song, this book won't help you. But if you want a great, playable overview of American songs from the 20th century, then this book is a good choice."},{"Title":"Reader's Digest: Family Songbook","review":"I bought this because I wanted a book that had a lot of the standards.

But I am not sophisticated enough to really know what I am doing here, so I have to make it up. Some of the the Gershwin stuff was better, but still cut down. I would call it just beyond beginner. It reminds me of the kind of stuff you hear kids play at piano lessons (year 2). Still, even I am confortable with adding a little here and there, so you can too. OR if you just want to open the page and play a whole new song with few or no mistakes, a novice will like it.

As the song selection in the two books is almost identical, both are superb. Actually, a couple of the songs are exactly the same arrangment. The worst thing about having both books is the occasional key changes from book to book - it hurts my fingers.This is a very good book - like all of the Reader Digest song books.

Capaldi's book goes a long way to correcting these errors.For instance, Capaldi provides strong reasons to think that Utilitarianism should be read in light of On Liberty, not vice versa, as contemporary textbooks tend to present Mill. In addition, Capaldi provides an in-depth examination of Mill's intellectual growth. He starts with Mill's early education and exposure to the philosophical radicalism of his father and Jeremy Bentham, and describes how Mill spent a large part of his life struggling to keep what he believed was good about their hedonistic utilitarianism while rejecting its inadequacies. Capaldi shows us how the style of education Mill received permanently influences Mill's manner of thinking. Capaldi demonstrates how Mill is essentially a dialectical thinker attempting to synthesize Romantic deontology with its emphasis on autonomous self-development, with empiricist ethical methodology with its emphasis on pleasure and associationist human psychology. At the same time, Capaldi illuminates the precise ways that figures like Carlyle, Hegel, Comte, Coleridge, and of course Harriot Taylor influenced Mill. Capaldi helps us learn how to read Mill, based on who Mill's audience was and the purpose of his various texts. One's view of Utilitarianism, for instance, will be radically changed in light of Capaldi's biography. This text, taken as the definitive statement of Mill's theory by most contemporary philosophers, emerges as a rather restrained attempt to defend a general class of philosophies, will Mill's own beliefs quite hidden under the surface.The picture of Mill that emerges is that of a powerful mind with continually evolving ideas. For the typical philosopher who has read at most a few of Mill's works, this book is very valuable indeed.As an aside, by way of illustrating what the reputation of Capaldi's intellectual biography is, let me relate the following. I recently had a paper defending a thesis of Mill's accepted for publication in a major philosophy journal. The reviewer asked me to make some revisions in light of this work. This book is quickly becoming the authoritative source on John Stuart Mill. In comparing Capaldi's work with that of others who have written on Mill, one gets the feeling that Capaldi is the only one taking Mill--and intellectual history--seriously.As such, I highly recommend that any philosopher interested in ethics or the history of philosophy read this."},{"Title":"John Stuart Mill: A Biography","review":"From the view of philosophy departments, Mill is frequently read as as figure in the line of traditional empiricists stretching from Locke to Russell. In that context, some of his teachings, such as the quality of pleasure and the primacy of social good seem like, well, mistakes. In fact, that's how it was presented to me in school and I'm afraid I may have passed that view on. I always wondered how a guy so smart could be so dumb. By bringing in the French connection (and Mill's intellectual environment in general), Capaldi presents the complete thinker. That's a service. Of course, given their format, no title in this series from Cambridge can be either a full scale biography or a full scale commentary."},{"Title":"The shy princess: The life of Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter and constant companion of Queen Victoria","review":"It doesn't spill secrets (it was written in 1957 after all), but it's interesting, informative, and well-written. Beatrice was a good Princess and a good daughter, wife & mother (in that order, actually), and an intelligent woman who was molded by her straightlaced upbringing as the youngest child of her mother, Queen Victoria. There is a particularly interesting appendix regarding Prince Alexander of Battenberg, his reign as Prince of Bulgaria, and the Princess Victoria of Prussia, which has information that I'd never seen in any other book. Recommended."},{"Title":"Managing for World-class Quality: A Primer for Executives and Managers (Quality and Reliability)","review":"This book is an excellent, easy to read resource.

I liked how the characters from the first book were incorporated into the second. I also liked that some of the characters were more complex (some bad characters were really good, and some of the good characters were really bad). There were certainly twists in the story that I was not expecting, and the action heats up in the second half of the book."},{"Title":"The Destined Queen","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Destined Queen. The sea battle was exciting. The love elements are passionately written. The danger elements are mixed in perfectly. Deb Hale keeps you in suspense while her characters struggle to find a way to succeed in their individual quests. If you enjoy romantic adventure, you should buy this book."},{"Title":"The Destined Queen","review":"When Maura Woodbury started on her quest to find the Waiting King she was destined to marry him as she was THE DESTINED QUEEN. She is accompanied by outlaw Rath Talward. They fall in love but it is not until the Sacred Glade that Rath is revealed as the Waiting King, the reincarnation of King Elzeban who is destined to return to help Umbria in the darkest hour which is now as the cruel and oppressive Hans rules with an iron fist.A small bird carrying a message tells them to go the Vestan Islands. When they arrive, the islanders, who fled Umbria when the Hans invaded, give Rath an army to free his countrymen. As the rightful king returns to the homeland Maura must find the staff of Velarken which will grant Rath one wish he must use wisely if he is to defeat the Hans without turning into a tyrant like them.THE DESTINED QUEEN is romantic fantasy at its very best. The love between the two protagonists gives them the strength against overwhelming odds to believe they can defeat their enemies if they listen to their hearts as well as to their heads. The common people rally around this legendary king but more is needed to oust the enemy from their homeland. Deborah Hale's romantic fantasy is a moving and beautiful tale showcasing two characters who capture the readers interest because they are flawed people trying to do the right thing ever when they are not sure which course that is.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Destined Queen","review":"This is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read, and that is saying quite a bit as I read about two books a week. The only thing I would recommend if you intend to read The Destined Queen is to first read it's prequel, The Wizard's Ward. It will help you to better understand it's sequel so you are not as confused as could possibly be. I let my sister read both books, but she read The Destined Queen first and was greatly confused. However after she read the Wizard's Ward, she understood a lot more of the book."},{"Title":"The Destined Queen","review":"I read The Wizard's Ward, the 1st book in this series, and fell in love with the fantasy world that Deborah Hale created. I had trouble finding this book (I purchased it before I purchased my Kindle), but it was well worth it! This book is even more fantastic than The Wizard's Ward. I didn't think it could get any better! Maura has awakened Rath, the \\"Waiting King\\", and she is indeed the \\"Destined Queen.\\" Maura & Rath must travel into the unknown to search for and fulfill their destinies. The two evolve reconciling themselves to what they need to do and become - to free their beloved Umbria. Along the way, they learn more about themselves and each other and the Old Ways. This book is a wonderful story of adventure, romance, magic, witches, wizards, paranormal creatures, action and much more... I didn't want the story to end. I would not recommend that you read this book on its own... you need to read the 1st book, The Wizard's Ward, first to set the stage. I do highly recommend this series... it's one of the best I've ever read... If you love the Harry Potter series, the Twilight series, Discovery of Witches as I do... you'll have found another series to love."},{"Title":"The Destined Queen","review":"It was a little predictable in parts but overall it was a really good conclusion to the story.

On the contrary, it is a very useful little volume and gives quite a lot of new information which I did not find elsewhere. The tactic of assembling contributions from eight different authors (over eleven chapters) is very effective, and most of them write clearly and concisely. Possibly the best chapter was the one by Edward Marolda on Operation Neptune - an aspect of D-Day often neglected by other books. The sixth chapter has some provocative views from Charles Kirkpatrick in which he is critical of the performance of both American and British soldiers in Normandy. I am always rather uneasy about armchair generals who are disparaging of the prowess of troops, some of whom now lie in cemeteries in France. In any case these opinions tend to contradict the evidence of some later chapters about the Normandy campaign (by other authors). However,I would recommend any D-Day enthusiast add this book to their collection."},{"Title":"D-Day: Operation Overlord from Its Planning to the Liberation of Paris (Classic Conflicts)","review":"Eleven authors, eleven chapters in 202 pages. A very concise and no doubt fully accurate account of the Overlord Operation: The cross-channel attack initiating the grand plan to destroy the Germany army on the continent of Europe. My interest in this book was initiated by its mention of the plan &quot;Bodyguard&quot;. Churchill observed in October, 1943: &quot;In wartime truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies&quot;. The purpose behind such design was to confuse the Germans and force them to spread their defenses. The overall disinformation and deception plan was codename Operation Bodyguard. The Allies initial assault was to be made with 5 divisions. In France the Germans had 60 divisions available or otherwise identified for defense of its Western Wall. Although the Allies had achieved both air and sea supremacy, the Axis ground forces could readily defeat a 5 division frontal assault -if they knew where it was to be. (Bodyguard refers to the overall disimformation and deception plan. Central to it was Fortitude, a plan to make the Germans think the Allied army was twice as large as actual.) The importance of Patton to Overlord is related to the following passage, quoted verbatum: &lt;Some of the forces for Fortitude were completely fictitious, like the American Infantry division in Iceland reported to the Germans by &quot;Twenty Committee&quot; agents But most had some type of real existence, and many were fighting formations intended for another purpose. Troops training in Scotland were exaggerated by &quot;Fortitude North&quot; into the nonexistent British Fourth Army poised to invade Norway, a threat which kept 27 German divisions waiting in Scandinavia almost until July. &quot;Even more impressive was &quot;Fortitude South&quot; which created in southern England the U.S. 1st Army Group or FUSAG to rival 21st Army Group and threaten Pas de Calais, as the Germans expected. Allied cover plans encouraged the Germans to believe that command of FUSAG had been given to the Allied general they most feared, Lt.Gen. George S. Patton, Jr. In fact Patton was marked to command U.S. Third Army, but even after D-Day the threat of FUSAG kept the 15th Army in the Pas de Calais., waiting for an invasion that never came. When, 3Rd Army did appear in Normandy &quot;Twenty Committee&quot; agents passed to the Germans the story that Patton had been demoted from command of FUSAG after a blazing row with Eisenhower, and had been replaced by the head of the U.S. Army Ground Forces, Gen. Lesley McNair.&gt;Thus, the Germans focused on Patton as the certain leader of the main invasion If any one piece of the deception and disimformation plan had been discovered the whole of Bodyguard likely would have crumbled and from the pieces the Germans would have divined or discovered the need to concentrate their forces in Normandy and most certainly would have driven the invasion forces back into the sea. Gen. Patton was the center jewel of the deception plan and since it worked he should have received far greater credit for the success of D-Day than history has chosen to give. NOTE: THE COVER'S PROMISED FORWARD BY Winston S. Churchll IS MISSING FROM THIs EDITION."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"This is a beautifully written book on the life history of Mrs. Albright. I knew little about her prior to reading this, and the book filled in what I wished to know. I was aware that her father was a mentor to Condy Rice and actually am interested in knowing more about him, now.Actually, I wasn't aware on buying the book that there was so much focus on her Jewish relatives, and found myself relatively uninterested in Mr. Dobbs's efforts to inform the Secretary. For every one of us interested in distant relatives of whom we know little, there is one of us who isn't.This book was a pleasure to read even without the Secretary's co-operation. However, for those interested more in her political development than her personal history, a look at other books would be suggested."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth Century Odyssey is a wonderful read. It is packed with new material about Madeleine Albright and insights into her life, beginning with a painfully vivid reconstruction of the deaths of many of her family members in the Holocaust. It shows how Albright has drawn on the drive and resourcefulness of her ancestors in Central Europe to make it to the top in America. The Blackman book, to which the previous reviewer refers, pales by comparison.Dobbs has interviewed many more people than his competitor, and his research is much more thorough. If you only have time for one Albright book, make it this one!"},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"What a fabulous book! I couldn't put it down. Having read this book, I have a new appreciation for Madeleine Albright as a woman who raised her children and then started a career which took her to the top. Dobbs is deeply sensitive to this, and you get the feeling that even as she climbs the ladder to her ultimate success, she wonders whether she is up to the job that lies ahead. Don't we women all have this experience at one time or another, even as we stop what we are doing to raise our children? Dobbs seems to have presented Albright with the only family tree she has even seen. He found branches of her family she never knew existed. The tragedy which befell her family in the Holocaust is not in vain - at the end of a century which molded and shaped her family, she has found them all again. A riveting story and it's beautifully written - I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"This book is a model of biographic research. Dobbs tracks Albright's family 4 generations back across Europe and through WWII.I greatly enjoyed learning more about Albright's personal rise to the top, which was inspirational to me as a woman.But due to Albright's lack of cooperation with Dobbs in the project, it didn't have a lot of detail from her personally. It was almost all from friends, enemies? and others.The facts around Dobbs writing this book bother me. It started with him digging up the fact that she was Jewish (Haven't we progressed beyond caring whether someone is Jewish?) After Dobbs discovered this fact and it broke in the news, he decided to write a book. He describes a tense meeting with Madeline in which she is not at all pleased with his intrusive findings.This detail bothered me as I read the book. Is Doobs impartial? Was he possibly angry that she basically shunned his project? It undermined my faith in his opinions slightly.If you want to learn more about Madeline and don't mind that the first part is pre WWII, you'll enjoy this book. But I think Dobbs could have gone about it in a better way. I would have enjoyed hearing what Madeline really had to say about everything."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"This is a fascinating book which covers the Holocaust through one family's silence and nominal conversion to Catholicism to survive. Certainly it presents the Holocaust in a different light than usual. The tale of a refugee female's attainment of the post of Sec. of State is riveting. Even the analysis of Albright's divorce explains one of the tragedies of twentieth century life. The book is subtitled a twentieth-century odyssey and that is what it is. Read it!"},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Dobbs has produced an amazing piece of research and journalism. Practically half the book is devoted to a meticulous charting of Madeleine's parents, the Korbels, and their narrow escape from the Holocaust and later the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. Following them to America, Dobbs shows how Madeliene's drive and natural intelligence lead her to assimilate seamlessly into American culture and graduate from Wellesley College. I think the author also does an excellent job charting the conflicts for women of this period and demonstrates how Albright succeeds in constantly acquiring new skills and a network of influential friends and colleagues during a time when she could have been simply a &quot;supportive housewife&quot;. His insider look at her political career in New York and Washington is fascinating and very informative.Perhaps Dobbs deserves to be best congratulated on developing a three-dimensional picture of a complex woman - no saint but instead a powerful human figure in our time."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Michael Dobbs is the journalist who broke the story of Madeleine Albright's Jewish roots: his new book on America's first female Secretary of State is fascinating and masterfully written - THE book on how a Czech refugee girl made it to become the most powerful woman in the U.S. government. Dobbs has done a great deal of legwork, uncovering a number of new and revealing facts about Albright's past and her role model father.Based on his extensive research Dobbs now argues that Albright almost certainly knew she was from a Jewish family - many of whom perished in the Holocaust - well before she has said that she did. Like many immigrants from Europe, Joseph Korbel, her father, wanted to put a fire wall between the tragic past and his new identity in the West. He instilled that drive for a new identity in his ambitious daughter, Dobbs says, and it propelled her to the top.In light of the current Kosovo situation, with Albanian refugees fleeing their homeland in a harkening back to WWII, this first-rate book is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to understand the mind set of the Secretary of State and why we are involved in Kosovo."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Madeleine is truly driven by the need to assimilate, succeed, and do something great with her life. Her life has not been ordinary. She was shaped by life altering experiences that many young Americans do not understand. In fact, some probably cannot even imagine the depth that Madeleine arose from. Her strength, vision, and tenacity have guided her to become one of the leading role models in our modern society. However, she's also become an icon to women who so desperately need female role models. She questioned whether she had the ability to succeed in a predominantly male world. Her doubts are echoed by women across the country. However, she also demonstrated that it was possible to achieve dreams despite overwhelming odds against success. The Odyssey is truly inspiring. The only reason I wouldn't rate this book as &quot;5 stars&quot; is because of the author's cold, calculated, intrusion into Madeleine's most private moments-such as finding out she was Jewish. Yes, Madeleine's past is what makes her story so remarkable. However, I found Dobbs to be only concerned with &quot;breaking the story&quot;, and not necessarily caring how it hurt Madeleine and her family. He was looking for the scoop."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth Century Odyssey was a joy to read. It was well-written, in precise, easyily read prose. The research job was obviously fantastic, as Dobbs uncovered facts that even Madeleine was at least at one time unaware of. This history of Madeleine Albright's life is detailed and amazing. She is truly a person to be admired. Her history is laced unremovably with the history of the countries she lived in. Her native Czeckoslovkia underwent Hitler, the rise and fall of Communism, and later the dis-integration of the country into the Czeck Republic and Slovakia. Her political views were shaped by Munich and the appeasement, by the consequences of inaction rather than by the consequences of action, such as the Vietnam War, the one event which primarily shaped the foriegn-policy views of her colleagues. Her father delivered her and her immediate family from Hitler, as they were Jewish. Much of the rest of her family perished in the death camps. The Albrights moved to the United States and converted to Catholicism as a protective measure. Madeleine was drived by an incredible urge to assimilate, to please, and to succeed. Sometimes, these instincts came into conflict with one another. Dr. Albright is an amazing woman. I have seen her speak at a college in my area about terrorism and about the effects of September 11, and the myth of a bipolar world. She talked about women's rights and about the Balkans War. She said that \\"a country that lives only for itself is like a person that lives only fo himself.\\" This defines her foreign policy image. I highly recommend this book, both for its research and for its subject matter."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Dobbs deserves credit for breaking the story of Albright's Jewish roots. but this book is little more than a collection of previously published stories that draws no new conclusions. I read another Albright biography, Seasons of Her Life, that was better written and contained lots of fresh material about this fascinating woman. I would recommend it over this Dobbs book without hesitation."},{"Title":"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey","review":"Grab a tissue and get ready for the first chapters of this wonderful book. Dobbs succeeds not only in conveying the confusion and pathos of Albright's early life, but also in giving readers a vivid, heart-rending view of one family's devastation as it confronted the Third Reich. The Korbel's (Madeleine's parents) narrowly escape death, rebuilding their life in America. The story of Madeleine's assimilation as an American and her marriage into one of the country's most powerful media families is nearly as riveting as her rise to professional power in Washington, D.C. Dobbs knows how to get the inside facts, tell a great story and give enough analysis to be insightful but not overbearing. The parts which deal with the revelation of Albright's Jewish heritage, and Dobbs' confrontation with Albright about her history, are fascinating. The additional intrigues around possible stolen art work turn parts of this great biography into a good mystery as well. Thank you to Michael Dobbs for being bold and fair in revealing the inside story of one of the most amazing women of our time."},{"Title":"Snakes of North America: Western Region (Gulf Publishing Field Guide Series)","review":"Together with its companion volume, Snakes of North America: Eastern and Central Regions, this book provides a complete reference to snakes north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It is the weaker of the two volumes, however. It is slimmer, less detailed and lacks the eastern/central volume's bibliography and glossary. It covers snakes on a species-by-species basis (rather than by subspecies, which is the case in the eastern/central volume), which leaves most subspecies with a paragraph of description at most. (Are western subspecies less well-defined than eastern subspecies?) The difference probably results from the fact that the eastern/central book drew upon Tennant's earlier books on Florida and Texas snakes; this book did not have the same advantage. As well, errors in the book suggest that more careful editing was needed. At least one set of range maps was reversed, and there have been reports that some of the garter snake photos were mixed up. Accuracy in a field guide is essential; errors here can compound themselves down the road. Still worth having."},{"Title":"Snakes of North America: Western Region (Gulf Publishing Field Guide Series)","review":"The collaborative effort of veteran herpetologist and herpetoculturist R. D.

Unfortunately, Friedmann's book has little to say about such matters. It does contain a lot of information for businesses who wish to schedule more specifically targeted events (such as consortium meetings) for clients or potential clients. One particularly interesting section discusses methods of identifying and scheduling appropriate speakers for such events. The book also contains information on how a business' representatives can optimize the effectiveness of their appearances at trade shows. I found the book a good starting place for such information. It is current enough to have a variety of references to useful Websites, most of which appear current. (I have not reviewed them all.)

That was over 30 years ago; she recently came to mind again and so, when one of her books became available through an online book swap, I decided to give her a try and see how she held up all these many years later.Unfortunately, I have to be totally honest and say she doesn't hold up well; Christmas Carol Kauffman's writing is unpolished, stilted and simplistic. Her characters and setting are lacking in development. However, in Not Regina she had an excellent story line and that is what kept me reading. The writing itself probably deserves two stars; however because of the plot I'm giving it three.The setting is 16th century Switzerland; Europe was roiling in the Reformation, and in Switzerland the government had followed the reforms of Luther and instituted an official state church under the leadership of Ulrich Zwingli. However, a group of people emerged called Anabaptists who took Reformation a step further than the official church, rejecting the baptism of infants and asserting that only adults should be baptized upon their confession of faith. For this they faced imprisonment and even death, and many fled or went into hiding. The battle between the Anabaptists and the official church divided friends and neighbors, even close family members. Eighteen-year-old Regina Strahm lives in a village in northern Switzerland that is torn by this strife; as she sees good people being led to prison she is led to question her own faith and the church in which she has been raised, but which doesn't seem to bring her any peace or answers.Besides an excellent story idea, Not Regina contains many other characters and elements that could make for a really gripping tale; Regina's own family torn by this conflict, with one brother converting to Anabaptism while another remains loyal to the state church; the pastor she goes to live with as nanny, who has no peace, struggles with what to preach to his congregation, and who increasingly turns to drink for solace; the young and handsome groomsman of the local lord who falls in love with Regina; the lord's kitchen maid who is herself in love with the groomsman and therefore jealous of Regina and out for revenge. This is a time and place that hasn't been covered much in Christian fiction; I would love to see what a story like this could become in the hands of a truly gifted writer."},{"Title":"Not Regina","review":"I love ALL of Christmas Carol Kauffman's books and this one was no exception!

The writers demonstrate that U.S. labor councils have a long history that veer from their counterparts elsewhere, they represent powerful building blocks toward a stronger workers movement.Now that the U.S. national unions are examining structure once again, they must take note of the work of this book, which is as relevant today as ever. Unions simply will not expand through using their leverage unless they view see labor in its new iteration--one that is dispersed throughout metropolitan regions. Perhaps the most daring AFL-CIO effort is the restructuring of its own house. The editors and writers of this book provide a field guide on how to transform unions and build worker power. This book provides concrete studies of Los Angeles, Milwaukee, King Conty (Seattle) and San Jose and Silicon Valley.Among the contributors are the leading analysts of American labor today: Stephanie Luce, Immanuel Ness, Joel Rogers, and Stewart Acuff."},{"Title":"Social Welfare Policy and Social Programs: A Values Perspective","review":"Great price for the book even though we did not use it at all.

He is so stricken with Alzheimer's that he cannot even remember his own name, Andrew, but the four pages in which Jane Urquhart describes his situation are almost poetry: \\"The whole unnamed world is so beautiful to him now that he is aware he has left behind vast, unremembered territories, certain faces, and a full orchestra of sounds that he has loved.\\" He is walking, as one of the other characters later remarks, toward his past. The book that follows will be the slow uncovering of that past, not only as it applies to Andrew and his forebears, but by extension to the whole of Canada, its natural resources, and the way of life that squandered then vanished with them.All this will be the subject of the central section of this three-part novel, an elegantly-told family saga beginning with an English immigrant, Joseph Woodman, who founds a timber and ship-building empire on an island just where Lake Ontario flows into the St. Lawrence River. But the main focus is on Joseph's son, Branwell, Andrew's great-grandfather. Trained in Paris as an artist, he spends the rest of his life on an uneasy balance between art and commerce, two opposing viewpoints that emerge as one of the philosophical axes of the book. Branwell's sister Annabelle in a way has it easier, because as a woman she is not expected to enter the business and so can devote herself to painting -- but all she paints are her father's ships and their destruction by water, fire, or time.Were the novel confined to this historical story, it would still be a very good one. What makes it remarkable are the framing sections set in the present. Andrew, it turns out, was a landscape geographer, a kind of archaeologist who reconstructs earlier lives from the traces people leave in their surrounding world. Jerome McNaughton, who finds Andrew's frozen body, is an artist engaged in similar pursuits, making careful excavations, taking photographs, and building imaginative reconstructions. Both, in their different ways, make maps. So does Urquhart's primary character, Sylvia, who makes tactile maps for a blind friend, Julia, so that she may explore her landscape by feel. It is Sylvia's closeness to Andrew that brings her to Jerome's studio and begins the process of linking past to present -- a linkage that Urquhart reinforces by a web of subtle cross-references that are intricate without ever being obtrusive.Julia is blind; Andrew developed Alzheimer's; Annabelle was lame; Sylvia appears to suffer from a form of autism; even the young and apparently healthy Jerome will turn out to have been spiritually crippled by the legacy of an alcoholic father. The most amazing of Urquhart's many feats of alchemy is that she manages to turn these apparent disabilities into gifts. The reader turns the pages with wonder, enthralled by the writer's inexhaustible ability to see familiar things in a new way. Central to it all is Sylvia, whose social limitations and fear of change will nonetheless turn her into the virtual author of a story of love and family whose very subject is change.A MAP OF GLASS is even greater than Urquhart's excellent previous novel,THE STONE CARVERS. Both share a three-part structure; both go back into Canadian history; and both are centered around a work of visual art. The underlying inspiration here is a 1969 piece by Robert Smithson entitled \\"A Map of Broken Glass (Atlantis),\\" an 18-by-15 foot pile of broken window panes that suggests the debris of lost civilizations, but which nonetheless catches the light in unexpected ways and glistens with a mystery of its own. Urquhart's MAP is also a lament for the past, but its quiet glow of consolation is nothing short of a miracle."},{"Title":"A Map of Glass: Library Edition","review":"Map of Glass was a tough read for me. Very respected reviewers enjoyed this very much which gave me pause to see what was it that did not appeal to me. The book centers around a married early 50's woman who explores the details surrounding the death of her former lover; Andrew. Sylvia lives in a rapidly developing exurb far from Toronto with her physician husband in the same house she grew up in. She appears to have agoraphobia. Other commentators have speculated that it may be autism. It's left vague and for the reader to interpret.The story moves between the current day where Sylvia searches for the people who found Andrew. Andrew's death is neither a mystery nor crime but it awakens strong memories in Sylvia and a desire to share them. This is done first through her dialogue with Jerome who had previously come across Andrew's body and then through more subtle drifting back in time. From there the story takes a leap back a further 100 or 150 years to life on the eastern side of Lake Ontario which was just beginning to boom with agriculture, mining, forestry all from a booming immigration from Europe.There were a number of things that bothered me as I continued to read. How did this woman with clear phobias if not outright illnesses suddenly find the ability to leave her house and venture into a a big unpredictable city (Toronto)? Orderliness and predictability are dwelled upon as critical to her and for her. She has an episode as a child where she cannot adjust to even a breeze moving through an open window. Still later how could she possibly have had a intimate romance when she again is so challenged to have any relationship deeper than a brief discussion let alone a physical encounter?These thoughts lingered on. Further on I found myself drifting constantly from the page. The timeline bounces from present, near past and far past which I think adversely slowed down the pace.One character takes a full chapter to travel for work which seems to only result in the author introducing another minor character (Ghost).When Sylvia and Jerome talk about Andrew it provokes Jerome to recall his own sad childhood ruined by an alcoholic father. He recounts his father's death leading ultimately to his mother's death. At which point Sylvia says \\"she died for him (the father)\\". It seemed too strong. The conversation was too elevated. It strained credibility.Sylvia constantly has second thoughts about sharing memories of Andrew with Jerome. She realizes he is young (25). At one point she makes a self-deprecating comment about her bad cooking or coffee. It's unlikely that someone with the myriad of socialization problems brought to light at the beginning of the book would have such capacity for insight, empathy or humility. Gentle poking humor at oneself is generally a sign of a very high functioning adult which she clearly is not supposed to be.How all this plays out was again in conflict. Slyvia's husband is a very intelligent and compassionate man and he has an extremely high EQ and yet Urquardt would also want us to believe that is he condescending and somehow suffocating Sylvia keeping her somehow locked in mental trap but it just does not seem to be the case. His role seemed inconsistent to me.The book is often tedious. It felt like every word or phrase had a double with metaphors and symbolism that I was missing. The snow, vision, the way a flower might be picked or some of the dialog (Says Jerome at one point commenting on art: \\"It's strange, now that I think of it, how much attention is always given to construction when decay is really more pervasive, more inevitable\\" to which Mira responds \\"Decay and change,\\" said Mira. \\"People moving from place to place. leaving things behind.\\"). Syliva. I was constantly re-reading to see if I was supposed to understand more than was what literal. It frankly became nearly unreadable in parts.What I'd suggest to the curious is to read a page or 2. The writing style is consistent throughout the book. If you like the random page or 2 than this may like it. I think it's really a question of personal taste."},{"Title":"A Map of Glass: Library Edition","review":"... even if it is just a trace - all but invisible - it is there for those willing to look hard enough.\\" Like her protagonists, Jane Urquhart delights in following those traces in a landscape. Southern Ontario, an important backdrop in her previous, exquisite novel,The Stone Carvers, is explored here primarily as an essential part of a family history. Going back some hundred years, \\"Timber Island\\" is the intricate setting for this profound and brilliantly developed multi-faceted novel that explores a lot more, of course, than the interdependence between human beings and their land.The central figure providing the glue, so to say, for the story's different threads is Sylvia, middle-aged and apparently suffering from a \\"condition\\" that, while not defined, suggests some form of autism. Since childhood she has been more comfortable with objects rather than people, preferring to touch their permanent and solid surfaces. The unpredictability and change that human beings represent made her withdraw, until... Nevertheless, she has married her doctor who had moved into the family home, taking over her father's surgery and the gentle and considerate treatment of the \\"patient\\". Under his guidance, Sylvia slowly learns to move cautiously beyond her familiar territory into the wider neighbourhood, concentrating on establishing clear landmarks for herself. During one of these outings, she meets Andrew, a landscape and historical geographer, a man \\"who walked into the past\\", who has been researching his family history. A secret friendship ensues that lasts on and off for many years, until he disappears from her life.The novel opens with Andrew, suffering from Alzheimer's, attempting to return to the island where his forbears had created their timber business. This is one of the most delicate and evocatively beautiful passages in the book. \\"...The palms of his gloved hands are open to the sky as if he were silently requesting that the world come back to him, that the broken connections of heart and mind be mended, that language and the knowledge of a cherished place re-enter his consciousness...\\" While there are many other sections of moving lyricism and rich imagery, making reading Urquhart's prose such a delight, this first passage draws the reader right into the mysterious connections between Andrew, Sylvia and a young, \\"conceptual artist\\", Jerome. Jerome had found Andrew's body, frozen in ice during a visit to the now abandoned island. In his art he attempts to capture civilization debris, remnants of earlier human habitation. To some extent Jerome symbolizes Urquhart's own exploration of Robert Smithson's aesthetics. The novel's title is derived from Smithson's sculpture \\"Map of Broken Glass\\"; Smithson's contention that \\"the artist seeks.... the fiction that reality will sooner or later imitate\\" can be interpreted as one of the novel's underlying motives.Sylvia, having learned of Andrew's death, seeks out Jerome, who she feels is holding \\"the end of Andrew's story... in a way, the last thing he told me\\". For the same reason, Sylvia feels compelled to share her life story, reluctantly at first, with this young stranger and finds an increasingly attentive listener. Jerome has his own demons to battle and, maybe, they can both help each other at some point.Embedded in the present-day narrative, Andrew's journals form the middle section of the novel. They stand on their own and delve into the fascinating saga of his great-great grandfather, one of the early timber barons in Southern Ontario, and three generations of his offspring. Urquhart brings out Andrew's distinct voice: his description of the family's changing fortunes and long-term destiny is completely captivating. Their reign over the island leaves the land dramatically altered with consequences far beyond the landscape: symbolic for the impact of destroying its natural beauty and for the family's greed is the image of their fancy hotel, now almost totally submerged in sand. As a counterbalance to those driven solely by profit, there are those with more redeeming features, such as family values and, in particular, artistic talent and expression.Art and artists always play an important role in Urquhart's novels. Sylvia is an artist of sorts: she creates tactile maps for her blind friend Julia. Maps are important to her as they establish some form of solidity and permanency. Her own maps reflect her very personal sense of landscapes, shapes and markers that she shares with her friend. Julia asked her once, how she could be sure that what she sees is what other people see. Maybe a more profound question than intended, it turns out as we, the readers, are encouraged to follow the fluid lines between her imagination and reality. Sylvia's version of her life's story, of her relationship with Andrew, with her husband, may not match the one the reader is being led to believe. Or is it? And, as Jerome muses: \\"maybe landscape -- place -- makes people more knowable. Or it did, in the past\\". This is a novel to absorb slowly, to ponder and to be carried away into different mental and real landscapes, rich in symbolism and breathtakingly beautiful at times.

It was a very interesting exploration of memory, loss, impermanence, and the fragmentary nature of life. It was a very atmospheric book, evocative and descriptive, not a driven by twists and turns of plot or dialogue, but it is thought provoking, and multi-layered. I am surprised by how long it has stayed with me, and how many times I find myself thinking about it and recommending it to others..."},{"Title":"A Map of Glass: Library Edition","review":"In a haunting, topographically rich novel that transports the reader to a disappearing region of a rural, Canadian peninsula, two narrative time periods tell a story. The novel, textured with the natural world of impermanence and change, progresses with an almost hyperreal cohesion, drawing out its themes under drifts of snow, sheets of ice, bare-branched trees, windswept sand, and glassy lakes. The map of this region moves from macrocosm to microcosm, from the mutations of the landscape to the private storms of it inhabitants, from early nineteenth century to recent times. The story flickers beneath the earth and through the air.Sylvia is a middle-aged woman with an unspecified \\"condition\\" that sounds a lot like Asperger's. She has one friend, who is blind, and a husband, Malcolm, who is blind to her secret life. She stays shuttered in her house, images of tables and bibelots running through her head ceaselessly, the light from the windows casting shadows and reflections that play on the artifacts and with her consciousness. She is an autodidact of esoteric knowledge, of the entire history of this isolated, disappearing, glacial town, and she makes luxuriantly detailed, three-dimensional maps of the area. One day, she gets her driver's license and starts combing the peninsula. She meets a historical geographer, Andrew Woodman, and has a long, secret passionate affair that becomes the focus of her existence. Time passes, (their affair is interrupted by a seven year separation) and she knows that Alzheimer's is eroding his mind and his life, until one day he just disappears. A year later, she reads in a newspaper that he had died (a year ago), was in fact found floating in an ice floe and discovered by a three-dimensional wilderness artist named Jerome McNaughton.Jerome is a young man suffering from an unresolved past--an alcoholic, abusive father and withering, spineless mother--who now has difficulty committing fully to the woman he loves (Mira), of sharing all his private sorrow and rage. When Sylvia contacts him to meet and discuss Andrew, he reticently agrees. The series of meetings between Sylvia and Jerome and Mira focus on Andrew's ancestral journals--the history of the Woodmans going back to Andrew's great-great grandfather and the timber industry. What the journals reveal about Andrew and his family forms a cynosure between Jerome and Sylvia. And, in turn, their tenuous, brief bond becomes a niche where history, love, and home are revealed and a palpable epiphany takes place.The novel's most transcendent attribute is the poetic fusion of the landscape with the themes of loss, identity, and home. The story of Andrew is told in reflection. His profession as a historical geographer cleaves with the history and geography of the region (much of it contained in the journals) and progresses to his relationship with Sylvia. Time vacillates between static and dynamic as events almost pour out of time, while the present feels stagnant until the journals' history can influence the ones left behind. There is never an immediacy that the reader feels between Andrew and Sylvia, because Andrew is already a piece of history when the novel opens. I believe the author intended that, and she effectively placed Andrew as a polestar for the healing of others.The nineteenth century sections were, for me, the most vivid and electrifying. It was through that lens that I was able to visualize the landscape evolving by unchecked capitalism--from forest to deforestation, from rich soil to topsoil for barley, and, eventually, to sand. The tycoon daddys were reminiscent of the American robber barons J.P Morgan and J.D. Rockefeller, steely tycoons who were often tyrannical. The female characters are particularly well fleshed out here. Annabelle, Andrew's great-great aunt, and Marie, his great- grandmother, added pathos to the grandeur of the industrialists. The parallels between characters from both centuries were finely drawn and the fusion of all Andrew's ancestors into his psyche gave the story its most authentic depth of character.I did have a hard time believing that someone as cloistered as Sylvia for thirty-odd years, who is afflicted with a pronounced social disorder, could go out and have this passionate affair of tremendous life-altering proportions and yet be unnoticed by her husband. I cannot believe that Sylvia has the capacity to live a double life unobstructed. However, she is effective because of the momentum she creates around her and how she is contrasted to the changing environment, as well as paralleled to the history of this region--the hyperreal context I referred to at the beginning of my review.The story also suffers from a clumsy construction at times. Some of the events are told in a hurried narration and some revelations are telegraphed rather than experienced. There is also a character named Ghost, an archetype who enters late and feels forced into a centerpiece arrangement.Fortunately, the grace of this story resides in the timeless humanity that is poetically and symbolically rendered. I recommend this unique novel for its astonishing beauty, breathtaking prose, and moving themes. The flaws of this novel dissolve into the scintillating landscape."},{"Title":"A Map of Glass: Library Edition","review":"Jane Urquhart's new novel, A Map of Glass, is a richly rextured and complex work of genius.

Map of Glass ties in some beautiful Canadian history and a wonderful description of the landscape intertwined with a socially challenged woman and her understanding of the world surrounding her. A great read for a patient and reflective reader."},{"Title":"A Map of Glass: Library Edition","review":"The first chapter of this book is unusual and interesting, describing a photographer, Jerome, and the photos he takes on an island near Lake Ontario. Then the story switches to the other main character, Sylvia, an autistic woman in her 40s or 50s. Both characters' stories eventually become preposterous, told in a poetic language that got on my nerves.Everyone speaks as if they were characters in a pretentious novel. What a surprise -- they are!I also couldn't make sense of all the \\"meaningful\\" descriptions of scenery and all the metaphors about maps. And who is Sylvia's friend, Julia? Why does this character need to be blind? Must be another metaphor I missed. We never meet Julia. As far as I could tell, she's just an excuse for revealing things about Sylvia.Then, in the middle of the book, I encountered a 140-page \\"novella\\" about people living in the same area in the 19th century. This cursorially told tale is full of cliches including the rich family's son who impregnates the maid, and the old maid sister who has a sudden, intense ridiculous love interest. This novella is like a sketch for a real book.Then we're back to the future, so to speak, with Jerome and Sylvia, who continue to speak in either stilted or unnatural language. Plus Jerome's too-good-to-be-true girlfriend, Mira, and Sylvia's pompous not-believable-as-a-real-person husband, Malcolm.Come on. What is this stuff? The author does everything possible to connect up all this baloney in some meaningful way.

Donald Hanna, the editor and principal author, has brought together an unusually qualified group of persons in the fields of educational technology and distance learning to comment on the developments and implications of these changes for organizations providing higher education, whether traditional non-profit institutions or new for-profit and corporate players.Hanna himself synthesizes and brings clarity to the plethora of comment on the challenges facing higher education in the digital era and takes note of changing approaches in the classroom. He argues that, rather than leading to impersonality in learning, technology may enable study in smaller, more intimate groups than traditional, large scale lecture halls. In subsequent chapters, he and other authors discuss implications of distribution learning by technology, while reminding us that technology and distance delivery are the means to the goal of learning, not the end in itself. They consider issues of intellectual property, ethical practice and learner access, faculty roles, and institutional leadership, and they provide numerous case studies of current practice that illustrate future directions. In a final chapter, Hanna poses a series of trenchant questions that can frame leaders' consideration of future directions for their organizations to take.All in all, the book does an excellent job of capturing the ideas currently available on this dynamic topic and framing the issues so that readers can get their arms around them, rather than being overwhelmed by what often seems unfamiliar."},{"Title":"Higher Education in an Era of Digital Competition: Choices and Challenges","review":"Donald Hanna and his supporting authors have done a fine job illuminating some of the interesting aspects and issues of the growing technological world of higher ed. I enjoyed the organization of the book. It is a compilation of interesting essays on various topics, all of which are relevant to the online university.I found Chapter 3-Advanced Technologies and Distributed Learning in Higher Education by Chis Dede to be facinating. This sort of vision and creativity to picture what is possible is essential in moving us forward into new and uncharted territory. Dede offers \\"vignettes\\" to illustrate creative uses of technology for distributed learning and visions of how technology may be used in the future. These sort of changes have the possibility to make substaintial changes to the higher education model.Other chapters such as Chapter 8-Who Owns Knowledge in a Networked World? by John Tallman offer current practical knowledge. As a professional engaged in course development, it is valuable to become knowledgable regarding such issues. As questions and debates arise as to the equitable ownership and allocation of revenue from distance learning materials, it is important that faculty are well-versed in the applicable laws.Chapters such as Chapter 10-Global Access to Learning: Gender, Poverty, and Race by Janet Poley address concerns of equity and ethics. It is essential that these conversations occur now during the development of digital learning. Some choices and decisions can not be undone. It's important that each twist and turn in the growing path of distance education is subjected to thoughtful consideration. The potential benefit to everyone is great. But also the potential to further alienate certain populations exists. Only through careful consideration can the appropriate foundation be laid to benefit all.Overall, this book addresses some facinating and pressing issues in the growing world of distance education. There are many facets to consider and various points of view. Hanna's book is a great place to start the conversation."},{"Title":"Higher Education in an Era of Digital Competition: Choices and Challenges","review":"Hanna, with a group of fantastic authors, have put together this wonderful book that can guide us through the many choices, challenges and changes we face in the future of Higher Education.This book is a valuable resource for faculty and administrators who are involved in redefining learning, policies, and practices.

The overt theme of the book is to relate advances in technology to their current and future impact on Institutes of Higher Education from the perspective of the institution, the faculty, and the students. Yet, the book is also valuable for those entrepreneurs looking for opportunities and ventures in higher education.Dr. Hanna presents the idea that universities need to evaluate, analyze, and evolve their current practices to reflect the current educational environment. Dr. Hanna has done an excellent job bringing together experts, such as Dr. Chris Dede a nationally recognized leader in Distributed Learning Environments, to contribute thoughts, views, and opinions to this book.

It surveys the entire field, looking at what is happening, analyzing it against sound educational theory and taking it to the future by asking the tough question of where will traditional higher education be if it doesn't adapt to the new millennium.Although it's an easy book to read, it doesn't lend itself well to a summary review. Each chapter is unique, touching on different issues related to technology and innovation, such as change, organizational structure, leadership, ethics, faculty policies and practices and instructional design. Any of these chapters can easily be a book in itself. But in the breath of topics covered resides the book's greatest benefit, which is the ability to provide the reader with a \\"one-stop\\" understanding of the entire topic.If you're interested in going beyond a survey of the field and are committed to changing the status quo, this book will help you navigate the basics of bringing technology to the classroom, dealing with resistance and staying motivated as a change agent for the future.

Emphasis is given on the following aspects as they challenge the global education in the 21st century:1. Learning: Roles, Access, Emergent Approaches, Role of Technology and Assessment2. Organizational Models: Design and evaluation, policies and practices3. Leadership in the Knowledge EraLearningWith the emergent digital era, the learning process undergoes reconsiderations that will shape our concept of education forever.Access. Due to the improvements in the technological area, distances are being shortened making possible for more students to access education from different locations. This is demanding from higher education institutions to acquire and use technology efficiently in order to provide educational programs that reach out to students and are sensitive to cultural diversity.Emergent Approaches.The following are some of the trends that are driving educational institutions to provide innovated educational experiences for their students:The constant and emergent changes worldwide are demanding from students and professionals continuous education or life long learning. According to the author, Americans could be changing careers six times during their professional lives.The improvements in communications capabilities are moving the market toward a global economy, which according to the author, will impact the continuous learning process worldwide. This will lead us toward a global learning community.Today it is not sufficient to acquire information. The learner must be able to appreciate and understand its meaning, in addition to be able to use it in problem solving situations.Emergent educational trends lead organizations to leave behind the traditional organizational approach.The increase of two-career families in America and single parents leave little time for students to enroll in traditional educational experiences, at the same time there is an increase in the pressure to learn and become better educated.The changing workplace is demanding new skills and abilities that ease people to work together in problem solving situations that requires critical analysis and a personal touch of creativity.Three steps toward change in institutions in order to achieve effectiveness in the competitive era:1. Identify the external trends that are forcing institutions toward change. 2. Study the forces that resist change. 3. Develop a rationale for organizational change considering the previous steps.Higher education institutions should create effective learning environments under the emergent educational approaches and advances in technology. An effective learning experience should encompass an active and engaging process based upon a &quot;constructivist&quot; approach. According to this learning theory, supported by thinkers like John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, is based on the construction of knowledge by the students allowing them to begin from their previous knowledge and experiences on the subject, being engaged in active and meaningful learning experiences in social activities in which reflection and metacognition will encourage personal, varied and unique outcomes.The book discusses the basics for the following major constructivist approaches:a. collaborative and cooperative learning b. problem based learning c. learning communities d. communities of practiceTechnology. One of the major challenges of higher education institutions in the 21st century is the use of technology in effective ways to encourage the creation of knowledge based upon this theory, including the development and enhancement of virtual collaborative environments.Assessment.The author differentiates between assessment and traditional evaluation methods, in terms of what they intend to determine about the learners progress. It is the belief of this author that the evaluation and assessment performed in class should &quot;include strategies that value how students think as well as what they think.&quot; As the global learning communities enhances, more sophisticated evaluation strategies are needed. This will guide the educational process in accordance of standards of quality.Organizational Models&quot;New forms of universities will emerge,&quot; in order to meet the demands of the new millennium.Due to the learning demands, world trends and the emergent advances in technology that are characterizing the competitive professional area, new models will be considered in order to satisfy the educational needs of students, and professionals seeking continuing education. These will be conceived in new environments that promote alliances between universities world wide, organizations with global scope and impact, creation of institutions in which shorter certification or degree programs are based on specific competencies, and those in which technology is the foundation of the educational process.Leadership in the Knowledge EraThe leader in the knowledge era must be highly motivated toward innovations and changing, eager to watch, understand and make decisions considering the dynamic nature of the world society in which we live. She ought to understand the meaning of the mission in her hands instead of seeing the final outcome as a monetary reward for her or the institution. According to the author the leader should: encourage shared leadership. be culturally sensitive. demonstrate ability to keep up the pace with world trends. have the necessary technological skills. be capable of networking and developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships efficiently.In addition to these, the leader should be aware that nowadays trends and changes will demand from leaders to consider the creation of new and modification of existing policies concerning the workplace and its personnel.Finally, in moments in which technology is becoming an essential component in our lives, leaders in higher education institutions face unique challenges that will require new technical and human approaches toward the organization's model. With all the advances in technology, the leader ought to remember that values and human virtues are the foundation of any corporation."},{"Title":"Higher Education in an Era of Digital Competition: Choices and Challenges","review":"Donald Hanna was formerly the chancellor of Extension for the University of Wisconsin and is currently on the UW faculty.

Both are about Wedtech, a good scandal story. It's telling that the only way you can read a book about a company in this industry is through scandal. But if you want to understand the industry, you can do worse than getting this book.As a disclosure, I should state now that I'm in the industry. For the most part this is an unglamorous industry, government contracting. I suppose that's the reason it takes a big fraud story to create a book interesting enough to read.To me, Wedtech's fraud is just a hook to get the reader's attention. It's not a literary device. This is a journalistic book. But the real story is the context. The reader gets to know how this enormous, insider's industry operates. All the characters are present: project managers, contracting officers, government customers, lobbyists, business development folks, operations staff, owner-CEOs, politicians and an accountant.The motivations that drove the perpetrators to commit their deeds are universal. They all started out innocently enough with the possible exception of the politicians and lobbyists. Many people would find this an important book. Wedtech is not a household name. I can't find anybody that heard of it. The book is excellent and I recommend it."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"This is the best book I've found on the topic of addiction. I liked it so much, I've bought multiple copies and handed them out to people in need. It is full of compassion and remarkably free of blame for both the person with the addiction and the family members who suffer the effects. Furthermore, it offers direction and hope rather than the advice to detach while the addiction takes your loved one down and you with him or her.This book is well-written (clear and concise) and easy to read (which is a good thing if you're in the chaos of an active addiction), but it is also thorough and profound. I especially like that Jay takes a detailed, but not overly-complicated look at the brain processes that lead to addiction, manipulation, hypervigilance, and other ill effects.The last portion gives information about putting together an intervention (and why talking to the addict on your own is likely to be met with frustration). Confronting an active addiction requires a group effort and careful planning. Debra and Jeff Jay's book \\"Love First\\" goes into greater detail about how to do an intervention. Both books are excellent, but I recommend this book over \\"Love First\\" as a starting point.Addiction is a medical issue, not a moral issue. It is a brain disease that causes immoral actions. Your loved one cannot pull themselves up by their bootstraps because, if they are addicted, they lack bootstraps! Even if your loved one is taking illegal drugs, it is likely they began taking drugs (illegal or legal) at a young age, before the decision-making area of their brain was fully developed.One point that I especially liked (and which has steered me away from divorce on several occasions) is that if it is the parent of your child that suffers from addiction, even if you divorce, you will still likely have to deal with him or her and the behavior that results from addiction, so perhaps seeking help is a better course of action than letting go.My one suggestion to Ms. Jay is to write a book on recovery and relapse. I hope one is in the works."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"Debra Jay has been on Oprah more than a few times. She's the blond lady with the glasses who is always so direct with addicts and their families. Her new book is a revelation. Basically, her idea is that there should be zero tolerance for untreated addiction in the family. After all, why should the alcoholic have the right to \\"hit bottom\\" in their own sweet time, when the family is suffering?She brings up an interesting analogy. Twenty-five years ago, drunk driving was tolerated. Bartenders even gave people to-go cups! Then, two women who had children killed by drunk drivers, started MADD and everything changed. Now, even the beer companies say \\"friends don't let friends drive drunk.\\"Debra Jay is proposing that the same thing should happen with alcoholism and drug addiction. Treatment works (it worked in my family) and so we should have zero tolerance for untreated addiction.She makes some good points about how an alcoholic is like a magician who uses misdirection to fool everyone. If you've ever tried to talk to an addict, you know how they blame everything and everybody but themselves. She shows how to take action to stop that kind of thing, and how to start organizing an intervention.If one of your family members is an alcoholic or a drug addict, you should read this book. It is amazing."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"Borrowed this book from the library and after reading two chapters had to buy it! Sat with my highlighter and immersed myself in this book. I really liked the short chapters and the way Debra Jay makes this information so personal. There is so much information for everyone who has ever had someone in their life with an addiction. The information about how we are also immersed in this disease is invaluable. If you've never come to terms with addiction being a disease, read this book. If you want your lives to change, there's lot of information in this easy to read book."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews and the description on the website. I have to say I am somewhat disappointed. She initially talks about how the idea of detachment, loved one's detaching themselves from the addict and living their own lives, is incredibly difficult if not impossible to achieve. I am in total agreement with her there. However, she then kept referring to this idea and after a while I got the feeling she was trying to prove something, but I'm not sure to whom. As a reader I felt that I had purchased her book, I was willing to be open to her ideas, so why beat the same drum over and over again? Was she writing for the wider audience of, perhaps, other addiction specialists out there? Anyway, it went on for too long.The other criticism I have is that her discussion of an intervention supposes that we all have large families and a wide network of friends to draw from in staging one. I find this view a bit limited and naive. From my own experience, I can say that my husband comes from a family of substance abusers(not ideal candidates for an intervention)and that his network of friends includes, guess who?, a wide network of users. So, the book did not give me the answers I was looking for. I will have to search elsewhere. She alludes to working with a professional if you can't build up a large team, but I think she could have put a little more into this alternative.That said, I do think this book is worth reading. Her descriptions of interventions are good and offer hope to those of us struggling against the disease of alcoholism/addiction.Keep strength."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"This book is a must in the world that we live in today.

I wanted to understand what the heck is going on and really learn more about the disease at least. Debra Jay's book is so excellent both in helping to understand the disease, and giving you realistic, helpful ways to try and help an alcoholic in your life. She so clearly outlines clear facts and scientific information about this disease, and why is it so maddening and confusing to deal with. This book helped me sort out my understanding of the disease before we did an intervention.If you are thinking of doing an intervention, I recommend their intervention workshop videos [...] - they are super detailed, so helpful.

For a person who operates on understanding, this book gave me a wealth of information on the way substance abusers think. If you can understand how they operate, then you can plan your actions based on that information.I have purchased several copies and passed them along to family members. This book helps with understanding why substance abusers do what they do. It also helped in setting realistic expectations and understanding why you may or may not have the effect you might want to have on your situation. This book is about not letting the substance abuser take you down with them. It's about understanding their illness and providing love, hope and an opportunity for recovery."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"Debra Jay's book is the most poignant, incredible book I have ever read on addiction. She helps you to understand this complex disease through her experience as an addiction counselor at Hazelden and her husband's alcoholism and recovery. It is also beautifully written.

It is empowering."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"I have used this book in my capacity as a therapist as well as recommending it to friends who are dealing with addiction issues. I recently bought 3 copies so I could loan some out and still have one for myself.The premise is that it's not necessary to let the family be destroyed while waiting for the addict to \\"be ready\\" for recovery. With drug and alcohol use starting at early ages, families are dealing with the crisis more and more and this book is invaluable in discussing how to set boundaries and get the person into treatment whether they think they're ready or not and if that's not possible families can see how important it is to not sacrifice every member of the family to the addiction."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"I love this book. Here's what Debra gives us in the first pages: \\"The Best-kept secret about alcoholics and addicts is that they can't survive in their addiction with the cooperation of others.\\" Wow--so true, yet so few seem to get it.The spouse is not the cause of the drinking, and even if she learns to stop enabling, the cunning alcoholic will always--always--be able to find someone else to fill in. Debra Jay's book takes us inside our own heads to see if we have been abusing the \\"Let go\\" motto from recovery groups. She shows us that abuse is using it to be lazy, or to avoid having to stand up to the difficult person, or to avoid conflict. But worst of all, we can use \\"let go\\" to buy love--letting go so we appear like a wonderful person to the problem person. Or maybe we're using it just to keep from losing more of their love. All of these ways we can use \\"Let go\\" are abuses. Learning to let go is a mental exercise, a spiritual approach that is an indispensible tool for both recovering alcoholics and addicts and their spouses.The difficulty we all have with it is knowing when to to Let Go, and when to Act, Not React. Debra also gives us great guidance here. Especially helpful is her list of \\"don'ts\\", and ways to get the mind off that obsessing about the drinker.As a psychotherapist dealing with drinkers and their families for some 40 years, I make a point of studying what others write (I write about it too), and especially of letting others know about books that can be especially helpful to them. \\"No More Letting Go\\" is one of those books I recommend to all--not just families of alcoholics and addicts. The information here is very good and will be helpful to anyone."},{"Title":"No More Letting Go: the Spirituality of Taking Action Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction","review":"Would a doctor or nurse or social worker recommend that the patient with a broken leg, drag and hobble about until they are \\"ready\\"? Hope and action before it is too late? Yes! Read this book if there is addiction in your house or in your family or in your nursing or medical practice. Drugs or alcohol, adult or child. Read it! While most authorities, at least the ones that I have heard, keep repeating the mantra \\"When he/she is ready\\" and \\"He/She must hit the bottom\\". The information in this book supports the concept of using all our brain cells and intervening before the proverbial bottom. If we are smart enough to recognize a problem, surely we are smart enough to formulate and work toward an action oriented solution. The concepts of intervention in the book support all the concepts that one can learn in AA and Al-anon; the success of loving detachment and of letting go and letting God are supported by intellectual human activity here on earth of working toward a healthy solution. This is a must read for doctors, nurses, and social workers and households victimized by active addiction.

He also uses religion to gain access to his clients. Addiction and those around the addict need support. His type of support is beyond unprofessional . He suggests names of mental illnesses along with the addiction which horrendous and inappropriate. He has no qualifications nor any skills to diagnose any human being. This behavior is very disturbing. Then add his religious views entangled with the mess I have mentioned. There should be law against these scam artists. Of course this is my own opinion. He did scam my own family. Research addictive behaviors and treatment.This country has no success rate . Relapse is 8 out of 10 . We have no answers . This is sad . What we do know is this : an addict can begin to heal when he wants to begin this process. The targeted addict is just one member of the family with behaviors so obvious ;the drug.

If you like the outdoor look you'll like all the projects in this book"},{"Title":"Quilting the Lodge Look: 24 Quilts, Wallhangings, and Companion Projects in Patchwork and Wildlife Applique (Granola Girl Designs)","review":"Abraham Lincoln once said (I paraphrase), \\"For the kind of person who would like this sort of thing, this is just the sort of thing they would like.\\" That's the best description I can give of Quilting the Lodge Look. If you're seeking a collection of woodsy, bungalow-ish quilts primarily for home decoration, this may be the book for you. If you were hoping for larger quilts suitable for beds (as I was), you may be a little disappointed.The quilts are ALL pretty. The colors and fabrics chosen really do elicit the feeling of a cabin in the woods: flannel plaids, sure, but plenty of woodsy dark reds, browns, deep blues. Not that you're stuck with Debbie Field's color choices (I've never made a quilt that matched the picture), but she gives good guidance, here.Most involve applique, usually with the predictable \\"lodge\\" theme (such as one with a canoeing picture); I find they make me think of camping, cooking over a woodfire, dappled sunlight. If you're not into applique, though, you'll probably find yourself saying, \\"pretty quilt,\\" as you flip the page to the next option.Several of the quilts (well, \\"several\\" given that we're talking about only 24 quilts) are sampler quilts, with 4 or 9 different blocks. The smaller projects include a set of placemats, pillow, etc., which are designed to match others, such as a canoe pillow that would go nicely with the sampler wall-hanging that includes a canoeing block.This book's weakness -- or strength, depending on what you're looking for -- is its emphasis on small, hang-able quilts. I think there are only four larger sizes, and they're all \\"snugglers.\\" None are big enough to put on a queen bed, and I'm not sure they'd cover a double. Great for wrapping around you in front of the fireplace on a cold winter night, but we don't have too many of those in Phoenix.I'm not sure if I'll ever get around to making one of these quilts. I may; I have a sister in New York (where it *snows*, can you imagine that?) who would probably love one of those snugglers.

That two impecunious upstarts could take on the Prince of Wales with no worse damage than a lifetime of poverty from heavy fines was a tribute to the fact that England was considerably liberalized before they got started.Anthony Holden seems more interested in Hunt's sponsorship and criticism of and feuds with literary stars of the Second Romantic Period. The feuds, like politics on condo boards, were bitter in proportion to their inconsequence. The Romantics and their foes were a touchy bunch.Since they dwelt in the literary world of the Regency and Victorian decades, they scribbled endlessly, and Holden appears to have waded through stacks and stacks of letters that -- judging by the numerous excerpts -- were unbelievably tedious and pretentious. Few men of even modest attainments did not leave enough correspondence to fill at least a double-decker volume, and a real pro like Byron left letters that fill dozens of volumes.As a result of a hand-to-mouth lifestyle, Hunt emitted a vast amount of journalism, plays, poems, essays, collections, biographies etc. Most of it was windy, as if he were being paid by the column-inch.His importance was as a facilitator and encourager and publicist. Holden admits that even Eng. Lit. pros often have never heard of him.The puzzle of this book is that Hunt seems to have been a lovable man, although a jerk.He had nine children and a drunken wife, who lived in modest style (for a middle class family, they were far better off than a working man's family), although Hunt got through hundreds of pounds a year at a time when a skilled craftsman got about a pound a week.Some he earned only modestly by his restless writing, much came from literary friends who admired and -- inexplicably, at least from the evidence here -- loved him.Only the extracts from Nathanial Hawthorne's letters give any sense of what it was that attracted the sophisticates. Surprisingly, it was his childlike attitude.He doesn't come across as someone I'd have liked for a friend. Holden finds him \\"one of the finest essayists in the language,\\" and I find him almost unreadable.But if your taste is English Romanticism, \\"The Wit in the Dungeon\\" will be a page-turner."},{"Title":"Tara's Healing","review":"I have read all of the books written by Janice Holt Giles, both the Piny woods series of which this is one and the moving west series many times.

I did not remember the previous book's story line (Enduring Hills) - only remembered that I liked it. This book got my attention right away as I started to read it. I finished it in a short time. I discovered after I finished it, that it was the third of a trilogy. The Enduring Hills being the first. This was not a problem in reading the book. The background information was nicely taken care of. The story was good and the characters interesting. I rated this book Very Good!"},{"Title":"Tara's Healing","review":"Tara's Healing is on of Janice Holt Giles BEST.

In the book they try to debunk evolution by showing its absurdity with an illustration of how cow turns into a whale by swimming a lot. DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS CARTOON.

Heed my warning for the love of God DON'T LET THEM SEE THE COW!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dinosaurs & the Bible","review":"Yes, after so many wasted hours with National Geographic and other devil sources that try to tempt you into sin with annoying facts, this book really helps to settle one's mind. I now know that things such as \\"The process of fossilization take incredible amounts of time\\" or \\"If there was a world-wide flood, wouldn't all the plants have drowned?\\" or \\"Bibical references to 'dinosaurs' aren't even close to what dinosaurs would have really looked like\\" are lies, that the thousands of missing-link fossils which have been discovered were all invented in labs by evolutionists, and that it is perfectly reasonable to assume we will eventually find living dinosaurs in the African rainforest, thus proving every word out of Pat Robertson's mouth is correct.Seriously though, this book and those like it are the absolute funniest things in print I have ever read! Listen folks, I believe in God as much as the next person but if you seriously believe that the world is 4,000 years old and that humans existed alongside dinosaurs THEN YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MINDS!!!!!!!!!!! I look foward to having a civilized, rational debate with those opposed but have the feeling instead I will just get a few dozen messages about how I'm going to hell..."},{"Title":"Dinosaurs & the Bible","review":"This book is an excellent book for children ages 7 or 8-12 and gives us the Biblical perspective on what the Bible says about dinosaurs and the age of the earth - much younger than what they will hear in most schools. There are also pictures and full color and black and white drawings for the children to look at while you are reading to them. The book explains that most of the fossils of the world occurred in the world-wide flood of Noah's time, and that Noah took dinosaurs on the ark (baby or juvenile ones of the large types). The book shows scientific evidence that man and dinosaur lived together at the same time: footprints found together in the same layer, cave drawings by Indians of dinosaurs, eyewitness accounts of fishermen and sailors who have seen dinosaur-like swimming creatures in the ocean in this century, including an occurence in World War I. Our attention is also pointed to the fascinating Biblical descriptions of behemoth and leviathan. It also gives accounts of the natives in the Congo of Africa who have seen an animal they call the &quot;mokele mbembe.&quot; When these natives are shown pictures of a brontosaurus-like (diplodocus) creature, they become excited and say, &quot;mokele-mbembe!&quot; They do not do this for pictures or drawings of other animals, like the elephant or the hippo. A good way to get kids started - &quot;There was no death until Adam sinned.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dinosaurs & the Bible","review":"This is one of the most hilarious books I have read in a long time.

It looks as though it was made in the early 70's and kids may not think it's flashy or cool enough.It also cites a few highly controversial evidences such as the \\"plesiasaur\\" that Japanese fisherman found near australia - this find was very likely a basking shark (look up pictures online / also look for an explanation of this find on www.answersingenesis.org to help explain the controversy)It also cites the very controversial dino/human footprints found near Glenrose, Texas. These prints are not the \\"magic bullet\\" evidence for creation that many hope for. There are sufficient historical evidences for the coexistence of dinos & man, but few are mentioned. Find some and share them with your kids when you read this to help supplement the material.Overall, this book is a fine add to a young persons library and IS a good book. Buy it! Just don't expect anything particularly amazing.I reccommend Dinosaurs by Design - by Duane Gish, or Dinosaurs of Eden - by Ken Ham as well.

She grew up believing a devastating fire twenty-five years ago took her family home and her mother's life, sending her father into a reclusive recovery in Nova Scotia. Her father's dementia has allowed clues to past surface -- a past about which Tori knows nothing. When her father dies, Tori returns to the family home to learn that it had not burned down; instead, it was the site of a double homicide.When the cop next door sees lights in the old house, he assumes teens have slipped in again. He certainly never expects this ghost from the past. When he was eight Ian Montague discovered the bodies, shattering his life forever. The town has not forgotten the Blake family, nor does it offer forgiveness to the daughter of Russell Blake. Nevertheless, Ian had obsessively searched for little Vicky for years and had finally concluded that she was dead. Now her sudden reappearance threatens to resurrect dangerous secrets that could tear their worlds apart.Author Jenna Mill's consummate skill of creating fascinating storylines with memorable characters once again dazzles readers in THE COP NEXT DOOR. As the intricacies of the past meet the passions of the present, the careful complexity of the plot will keep readers guessing until the end. When he looks at Tori, Ian invests the deadly sins of the father on the daughter, unable to separate her from the past. Unfortunately, so does the whole town, casting Tori into an unexpectedly dangerous game. On the other hand, years of an over protective father's care has made Tori fiercely independent and terribly reluctant to rely on the cop next door for safety. Despite their past, however, neither Tori nor Ian can simply ignore the other. The result is an intense, fast-paced and cleverly crafted tale that will appeal to readers who like their romance on the dangerous side. THE COP NEXT DOOR earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"The Cop Next Door (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1181)","review":"Jenna Mills writes a great romantic suspense that has Victoria LaFleur, or is that Victoria Bishop, returning to Bon Terre to uncover the secrets from her youth that died with her father. After twenty-five years, she is not welcomed with open arms. Victoria struggles to solve the mysteries of the past while not running scared from those who are now trying to run her out of town. Meanwhile, Sherriff Ian Montigue is messing with her emotions, and she's not exactly sure how she feels about that, either.The characters are tightly drawn - Victoria is trying to break free from the mold her father fit her into for so many years while Ian takes his job as sherriff very, very seriously. The plot is filled with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end.On the down side, the author had a tendency to repeat certain descriptions to the nth degree. I finished the book a few weeks ago, and I still remember pecan colored hair, soap and sandstone, and being a doll on a shelf. They were repeated so often they were distracting. Also, there was such a glaring error during the cemetery scene, it made me wonder if I had misunderstood a major plot point during the book. It didn't help that it was in all capital letters at the top of a page. It should have been caught by an editor! All in all, minor things to detract from a great effort.The Cop Next Door is a fast-paced, easy read that expertly weaves together all the necessary elements of a romantic suspense novel."},{"Title":"The Cop Next Door (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1181)","review":"The Cop Next Door is a keeper for sure.

The dialogue in this book is positively silly. Pelon, the brutish half-Mexican, half-Apache, one hundred percent outlaw bandit speaks as if he was educated at Oxford, and has a sense of honor not normally found in your average outlaw bandit/murderer. Mackenna knows the map to the gold, so Pelon can't kill him, at least not until the location of the gold is pointed out. Mackenna, of course, is busy trying not to fall in love with the beautiful young hostage, and avoiding the amorous intentions of Pelon's Apache sister. Western escapest literature from the early sixties."},{"Title":"MacKenna's Gold","review":"While never a cimena classic, the 1969 film adaptation has always been one of my favorite \\"nothing special\\" movies, so that was enough for me to read the Will Henry novel when a used copy passed through my hands.The novel is radically different from the film, the novel is much slower and less exciting, but still good-enough escapist Western fiction on it's own terms. The previous reviewers have done a good job detailing the differences, so I have nothing to add there.If you are a fan of western fiction, you'll not be bored,and Henry is an established name in the genre. If you've seen the movie, check out the novel and see how different it is from the film adaptation."},{"Title":"MacKenna's Gold","review":"This is Will Henry's novel that was the basis for the movie of the same name from 1969 starring Gregory Peck and Omar Sharif. The movie is a fine adaptation. I love the movie, and found the book entertaining, if only for discovering the differences between it and the movie. For example, Heshke, the fetching but nasty Apache girl is called Sally in the book. And her nose has been cut off. And she doesn't meet her demise anywhere near like in the movie. The movie version is far better. In fact, all the characters are better developed in the movie. Colorado is called Pelon in the book and the deadly encounter between him and Hachita is much different in the book. And the words of Pelon, at the end of his fight with Hachita, are truly laughable. Cartoon dialog at its finest! In the book, there is no band of Apache's who enter the gold canyon while MacKenna is there. And the white girl helps out MacKenna much more during his fight with Hachita (in the movie, the final fight is with Colorado). Let's just say that she handles an ax better in the book than she does the belt in the movie.A character completely missing from the movie, Mal-y-pais, Sally's mother, survives along with our two heroes. She is one of the more interesting characters in the book. In the book, almost ludicrously, MacKenna cusses and beats the white girl at one point! And earlier in the book she suggests they get married after this is all over! MacKenna's treatment of the white girl (i.e. the cussing and beating) in the book might be more realistic, but definitely not in keeping with Gregory Peck's image! The movie wisely avoids these character defects. Tibbs is an Apache half-breed in the book. Pelon/Colorado does a lot more killing in the book. Watch out for that serape!"},{"Title":"Erica White's Beat Candida Cookbook","review":"The book is definitely of little use to me.I have a severe case of Candida, everytime I eat carbohydrates of any kind. i.e. Potatoes, whole wheat, oats, my Candida flares up.The book is completely FULL OF WHEAT AND CARBOHYDRATE recipes.

In addition, she uses modern methods, enabling her to help hundreds of patients from around the world via phone consultations, mail testing, and consultaion, and, of course, email.

Even that, as these photos show, covers a fair range in itself.Many of these photos focus on the hair, the curves, the lovely faces, and other features that distinguish black beauty from the other kinds. The net effect, to my eye, does not set black beauty apart. Instead, these photos display the beauty common to women everywhere, with a few genetic highlights to remind the viewer just varied that can be.

Jeff Davidson has filled each page of Breathing Space with insight, practicality, and specific advice. To get your hands back on the controls of your modern life, no book is better.Life in the today's world is busy, full, and rife with distractions. Satisfaction can easily slip away without special efforts to create an environment and habits which support our own goals and priorities. Fail to do so and you life will -- as Jeff Davidson amply demonstrates -- be thoroughly colonized by advertisers, entertainers, and co-workers. It has often been said, and is even more true today, that if you are not working your plan you are working someone else's plan. Breathing Space is the most succinct and useable approach I have seen to get back on your own plan. I have used his methods myself and with many clients. They not only work but keep working.I call my variation of the organizing techniques &quot;Clutter Buster.&quot; I noticed that before I organized my workspace, it gradually got less usable until I was moved to clean-up. My cleaning blitzes never quite got the space up to snuff, however, and each succeeding cleaning frenzy had poorer results than the last, for a picture over time like the &quot;Before&quot; graph below. I was spending more time &quot;getting organized&quot; and less time feeling organized. After an extensive and thoughtful re-design of the workspace based on Davidson's principles, I noticed that my area stayed more workable longer plus (1) the messy phases were less horrible, (2) my office was easier to re-organize, and (3) I spent much more time enjoying the peaks of organization. Bottom line: more productivity and greater satisfaction.My home office was something of a disaster before I thoroughly organized it with the help of a consultant and this book. Not only did it look great afterward, but it stayed that way permanently. The considerable time and expense invested in that clean-up has been more than repaid. I have since applied the techniques to my garage, briefcase, car, and other parts of my life.Getting Breathing Space can give you your life back and even create space for the life you always wanted."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Societyby Jeff DavidsonDuring the early nineties when I was embarking on my departure from the corporate world & entering the Corridor to pursue my entrepreneurial interests, one book caught my personal attention. At that time, I was told that \\"information doubled once every eighteen months\\". Alvin Toffler, John Naisbitt, & Richard Saul Wurman were already riding high on the information anxiety phenomenon, even though each of them has his own perspectives.The book I am referring to is 'Breathing Space'. I am gratified to note that this book is still available. Although some stuff may be dated as it was written during the pre-internet era, a lot of the strategies & tools advocated by the author are still applicable in today's context.First, the author defined 'breathing space' beautifully as: \\"You know it when you have it. It is the feeling of having time & space, of being in control, or content or relaxed. It is the room to be, to explore or to do nothing.\\"Let me outline here the major parts of his work:1. The root causes of the pressure you feel;2. Hand tools;3. Power tools;4. Cerebral tools;5. Metaphysical tools;Back in the early nineties, the book fueled me with a lot of valuable fresh insights, which empowered me to live & work at a comfortable relaxed pace in a 24-hour society:- information only becomes knowledge when it's applied;- choose to acquire knowledge that supports or interests you;- about 80% of papers retained in office environments are never used;- periodically, the sweetest choice is choosing from what you already have, choosing to actually have what you've already chosen;- whenever you catch yourself making a low-level decision, consider: Does this really make a difference? Get in the habit of making only a few decisions a day - the ones that count;- consider the value of any product, service or plan as two fold: (1) the intended benefit & (2) the ease with which you can understand, receive & enjoy those benefits. If it doesn't, don't buy it;- Rules of Thumb: any item that saves you one hour per week for a minimum of one year & costs US$1,000 or less is an excellent buy; never mind if you purchased the latest or fastest model; there will always be later & faster models;- any activity consuming 30 minutes of your day consumes two solid years of your life;- to get to know someone better, ask him what his life priorities are;- if you don't know what you have & you can't find it, it is of no use to you;- just because it is interesting or expensive doesn't mean you have to keep it;- being neat & being organised are not the same thing;- a powerful way to gain breathing space, perpetually, is by seeking completions;- preserve your weekends for recreational activites. You're worth it!;- if you're serious about having more breathing space, give up fast food forever!- you can increase the likelihood of experiencing time warp effect by removing yourself from the time measured environment - by hiding the clock;- one hour of uncluttered thought can yield more benefits than days of common desk work;- jump starting often enables you to capture your first & sometimes best thoughts;- use the day units as a convenient measure for charting progress in pursuit of your goals;- living in the moment does not mean living for the moment or living to get to the next moment. It means total, unconditional acknowledgement that what is now, is your life; that now is the only moment there is;- the relentless quest to move on to what's next keeps you from fully enjoying what's here;- longing more strongly for what you no longer have, rather than reveling in what you do have, is a guarantee that you will miss the present & all the magic it holds. Revel in what you have;- how you elect to feel is always your choice. the act of choosing is a simple but powerful technique that will further aid you in attaining breathing space;- when people make decisions based on instinct, they end up happier than those who make decisions based on careful analysis;- choosing to feel at home frees you to experience the present moment, wit its surrrounding scenery, to the fullest;- when you are off course, re-direct your energies. Ask: \\"What do I want right now?\\"- go for a walk if you are stymied;- most decisions you could make are of little consequence. Not choosing can be restful!- some people remain poor is that they accommodate poverty...as difficult as it is for them to live in abject poverty, they are not willing to accept the difficulty of making a better life for themselves (according to Prof Kenneth Galbraith);- get ruthless, drop what doesn't support you;- constantly read your priorities & goals list;- clear all your files of deadwood;- count twice; look for all the ways to re-apply the work you have already done;Even up to today, the insights from the book still work for me! Many thanks, Jeff, for a wonderful exposition!To conclude my review, let me say this: Read this book & see how much more you can accomplish in a day & how much more you can enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"Stress, busyness, information - it's all around you and it seems there's so much of it, and it's so insistent, and it's so loud, an it's so invasive.And in reading Jeff Davidson's latest resource for leaders, managers, and just about everyone, it's clear that the pressure is here to stay, at work and at home - and it will get worse. There is no returning to an earlier, simpler, unhurried time.So....we need some strategies, some tools, and some...breathing space.Fortunately, Jeff Davidson makes good on his title. Breathing Space starts with a clear and compelling analysis of why we feel so pressured. The reader is then focused on very positive, healthy strategies to deal with a world where 565,000 books are published each year, 95 million printers are spewing paper from at least 95 million computers, and the typical executive receives 225 pieces of unsolicited mail each month.In 22 succinct, comortably paced chapters, Breathing Space offers practical and innovative strategies for clearing up the clutter, breaking through procrastination, organizing your workspace, managing your reading, and choosing your priorities wisely - among other work and personal challenges.Breathing Space attacks paper clutter with a vengeance, as in - get rid of it! Eighty percent of the paper we save will never be needed. Most importantly, the reader learns how to conrol paper at the intake point, so that it never piles up in the first place.Davidson's insights are especially powerful on the widespread perceived need to keep up with information overload from print, media, and electronics. He draws our attention to how much we are exposed to information that does not really support us but which, day after day, robs us of breathing space. His sensible strategies leave the reader feeling that this too, can be handled, and that we need not waste energy in guilty responses to an information overload which we can never posssibly keep up with.Chapters are broken up with short messages labeled &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, that put our need for breathing space in perspective. One Fresh Air message captures a theme that radiates throughout the book:&quot;Telltale signs of being too busy: If you're too busy to enjoy life, you're too busy; If you're too busy to stay calm, you're too busy; If you're too busy to stay in shape, you're too busy; If you're too busy to see your friends, you're too busy.&quot;Breathing space is really about quality of life, or more accurately - learning to leave enough space in your life so that you identify what matters to you, and then allocate your life efforts accordingly. It is about taking control and creating environments that support your choices in life, as opposed to reacting to useless information, negative people, and distracting but ultimately unfulfilling stimulus of many sorts.Without a doubt, Breathing Space is must reading for anyone who wants to master the art of dealing effectively with more information, pressure and time crunch. From the looks of what is to come, that is just about all of us."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"\\"Breathing Space\\" is a wonderful concept and is laid out nicely by the author in this easy-to-read book. It's only about 210 pages but mercifully, most pages don't contain a lot of text. So it's easy on the eyes, and easy on the mind. I agree whole-heartedly with the author's premise that the pace of life has sped up because of what he calls \\"macro-realities,\\" a sort of mega-trends that are here now and continue to impact every element of our lives. Buy this book for yourself and for people you care about. It'll give you insights and perspectives that are unique and vital. More important, you'll have a broad-base understanding as to why we all seem to be in such a hurry all the time, and have a real good chance of getting past this trap."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"This is a very insightful book and one that is unlike most others that I've encountered. The author maintains that the typical person in our society today is in a super-rush because of forces that uniformly impact us all. He then proceeds to lay out in a very logical fashion how to counter-act these forces and take control of your day as well as the spaces in your life, like your desk, your car, your closets, and so on, so that you're in control more of the time. I particularly like the sections called \\"Fresh Air\\" which are bulleted points offering innovative ideas for getting back in charge of your life."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"I read this book several years ago, and whenever it seems that information and paperwork and clutter sneakily inches its way back into my life, I immediately refer back to this book. And when I say, &quot;refer&quot;, I most likely will not reach for the book but remember the tips and quips that allow you to easily recall the helpful hints. It's a fun read with information that any packrat (Myself included)can use to turn vertical filing to horizontal, or remove unneeded info without guilty feelings. This book will change your attitude about a lot of things."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"This book is nothing short of a sensational. It is one of the most forward-thinking texts I've encountered in quite a while. Starting with the premise that an over-populated world creates more information and communication than the typical person can keep up with---more media, more paper, and more choices---you begin to gain a sense of why each day feels as if there's too much to do, too much to know, too much to keep on top of. With this book, you gain a perspective that enables you to approach your day, your week, your month and so on in a more common and reasoned fashion. Some of the tips in the middle and latter chapters I have seen in otherbooks, but in this context they seem to work particularly well. I like theauthor's approach in giving out the tips based on hand tools, power tools,and cerebral tools. If you are experiencing increasing time pressure or stress, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"This is a very good book on a topic that a lot of people will start to be aware of.

It focuses on things how all got into this culteral rat race, the imprtance of balance, rediscovering aspects of yourself, cultivating new interests and new hobbies and taking appropriate personal risks that you weren't up to taking before reading it."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"* I would give this book an 11, if the scale went that high. From the opening gun, right through to the last words, I found this entire book to be easy to read and extremely helpful. The author doesn't preach, or get into technical gobbledygook. He stays on course, for the most part, addressing root causes of the situations that most of us face on a fairly regular basis, and then providing very doable suggestions to achieve desired results."},{"Title":"Breathing Space: Living and Working at a Comfortable Pace in a Sped-Up Society","review":"The selection in our living room bookshelf is, admittedly, &quot;eclectic.&quot; And maybe it's that good salt air, or the thoughtful mode you slip into when you're on an island. But our guests just DIVE for this book. Jeff's onto something when he cautions against attempting &quot;time management.&quot; He's right...it WON'T be managed. Yet Jeff's notion of SPACE management can make a difference. Even when you're not 12 miles out in the ocean."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"I love and agree with a LOT of what the authors have to say in \\"The Successful Child\\". However, the authors really push the idea that a baby must be breastfed and carried in a sling 24/7 in order to be \\"connected\\" to his or her parents. I don't buy that. I don't practice what the authors call Attachment Parenting, and my son and I are extremely connected.One other thing that bothers me about the book is that in some of the stories it is so obvious that the author is lying. Many of the anecdotes are clearly made up. For example, in one of his anecdotes Dr. Sears is talking about how he was watching a couple and their toddler son in his office waiting room one day, and he watched them long enough to be able to tell that they were excellent parents, and went over to tell them such and have a conversation with them about their parenting. How many doctors do you know who have time to sit in the waiting room watching patients who are waiting to see them, and carry out conversations? NONE. If I had been in a waiting room for a while, and I caught the doctor I was paying to see standing around IN THE WAITING ROOM watching instead of taking care of appointments, I would be very upset and would probably never visit there again. This is just one example of instances in which I think the authors are flat-out lying.Most of what's in this book (aside from the repetetive AP talk, which gets old quick) is advice on how to practice positive parenting. If that is what you're interested in, then definitely give it a try. I checked this book out from the library but will probably buy it because there are a lot of ideas and methods in it that I don't want to forget, and that I have used on my son since reading it. I especially like the sections on sexuality, communication, and compassion."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"The first Dr. Sears book I read was &quot;The Baby Book&quot;, which I found helpful and somewhat insightful as many other parents that are gentle in raising their children. But I became very turned off by this book and the entire Dr. Sears following that has thousands of parents looking to him as the guru of child care. This book, like all the others in the &quot;Sears library&quot; of books is a carbon copy of his other books and reiterates the same beliefs. He uses this book as a medium to promote his attachment parenting beliefs and uses the title &quot;the successful child&quot; to make parents believe that his parenting beliefs are the rule rather than the exception. Yes, I know that Dr. Sears has eight kids and is a well renowned pediatrician, but that doesn't make him the authority on parenting and child development and other issues that he has written books on including family nutrition, pregnancy, and childbirth, and to suggest so would make his books utterly self-congratulatory other than proven techniques that work across the board. I hope the parents of his patients don't feel that they have to conform to his beliefs in terms of how they choose to raise their children. It is good to take what is useful to you as a parent from various sources such as this book; but I refuse to see Dr. Sears as an authority on my child's development and on my role as a parent just because he has written dozens of books that are regurgitations of each other. As a parent, you must learn to think for yourself as well as seek out information from other sources."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"Readers of &quot;Dr. Bill's&quot; books should realize that receiving a medical degree and being able to put a &quot;Dr.&quot; in front of your name does not suddenly make you a global expert on all subjects. Dr. Sears is a medical doctor, not a psychologist, so how exactly does his advanced knowledge of human anatomy make him aware of what it takes &quot;to raise a responsible, compassionate child in a society whose overbearing media celebrates and encourages violence, promiscuity, and gluttonous materialism?&quot; Absolutely nothing. This book is the equivalent of me turning to my proctologist for marital advice.It's amazing that you would need a 27th book to tell you to &quot;follow your instincts&quot;. Am I the only one who sees this as a contradiction? It's yet another preachy tome from Dr. and Martha Sears' that simply regurgitates many of the same opinions from previous books. Again, these are opinions, and not fact. But advocates defending Dr. Sears will say, &quot;But he has such experience!

However, it has several fundamental flaws in its execution. The first and biggest is that, as many other reviewers have noted, the entire book is little more than a propaganda piece for attachment parenting. Because of this, there is never a moment in the book where he addresses ANY of the challenges his theories have faced. It is also filled with endless gross generalizations such as \\"The connected child will do what's right because doing what's wrong makes him FEEL wrong.\\" [\\"Connected child\\" is his term for children who are raised according to his dictates. If you disagree with any of his tactics, you're in danger of raising a \\"disconnected\\" i.e. sociopathic failure of a child.) And \\"Children who are on the receiving end of sensitive parenting become sensitive themselves.\\" Ad nauseum. Literally.The book is filled with obsequious overgeneralizations. There are dozens of little \\"interviews\\" from, I guess we're supposed to believe, patients (although the speakers are NEVER identified, making it very confusing when the sidebar refer to \\"our son Matthew\\" while knowing Dr. Sears has a son Matthew too). These \\"interviews\\" produce hysterically unbelievable and melodramatic accounts of miraculously empathic (and boy howdy, ARTICULATE!) 2 year olds, shrewd psychological insight imparted by kindergarteners, etc. Oh, and of course, the book is riddled with obliquely validating comments such as \\"Research has shown,\\" yet the book fails to have a bibliography or reference section. One eventually has to question why the book ends up seeming more like a sales pitch for attachment parenting than any real compilation of advice.As the parent of a 6yo child with high-functioning autism who DID/does practice many of the things the Sears deem as \\"attachment parenting\\" to the letter, I can tell you that while I don't disagree that his child-sensitive approach to parenting does engender trust and emotional intimacy between parent and child, it is in NO way a blueprint for raising \\"successful\\" children, nor is it a recipe for producing any kinds of desirable traits in your children. There is little room for variables in Dr. Sears' tract, if any. I don't think following these practices would hurt any child, but I think that the claims Dr. Sears makes are, at best, spurious, and should be questioned and challenged a lot more than they currently are."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"Becoming a mother has made me remind my childhood, all the goods and bads.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to be who I am, but I could've turned out better!!!This amazing book tells you how children are affected, positively or negatively, with the behavior of their parents and their surroundings. With this book, I am finally understanding why, for example, I like to study, why I don't like to hug people, or why I didn't really obey my parents, etc. With astonishing simplicity it explains it all.

This is a genuine effort that I do believe will help many in many various ways. Parents and children will both reap reward and joyfully sow contribution from this diverse method labeled AP. The book does have some very fundamental teaching, however the art of being a good parent is revived in those common sense teachings. This is a book that gets us back to Grass Roots America which in truth is direly needed. A cumulative guide touching many subjects of upbringing. May have a little weakness in choosing between teaching God spirituality and human spirit. For that I recommend a very unbiased book that is for all ages which could help parents on that subject with their children, teaches contribution as well, SB 1 or God by Maddox."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"I've read quite a lot of Dr. & Martha Sears' books and agree with some previous reviewers who have said that some of their most recent releases are just rehashes of old stuff [something I began to find very frustrating!]. However, this book was well worth my money!I was pleasantly surprised to find a well organized book taking a \\"bird's eye view\\" of childrearing - not getting so bogged down in babyhood, but looking at the long term goals and results. I found the research quoted throughout fascinating and really enjoyed their synthesis of scientific study. I liked seeing their logic on how their suggestions for raising babies, preschoolers, and elementary age kids on up are likely to result in the attributes I want for my own children.I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Siblings [something they are obviously experts at after 8 children!], Raising Moral and Responsible Children, and Sexuality; as well as the numerous suggestions and ideas for raising older children. This book is an excellent follow up to \\"The Baby Book\\" - what to do when the baby isn't a baby any more!Even if you are not the least bit inclined towards Attachment Parenting, this book would be an interesting read just as a counterpoint to your own philosophy.

The first six years of a child's life greatly influence one's life in the adult world; however, the authors have taken that theory one step further and deemed that the FIRST YEAR, will critically determine how the child develops emotionally.This is a book for every parent no matter how experienced or inexperienced one might be. By the time we just begin to \\"think\\" we have all the answers, our children have flown from the nest! \\"The Successful Child\\" contains plenty of good advice on how to enrich your child's growing years nutritionally, spiritually, intellectually and emotionally. You will find constructive and positive viewpoints on the importance of instilling moral values into the upbringing of our children. The book is quick to point out that materialistic wealth is not a priority in the overall plan of raising a healthy, well-adjusted child into adulthood. Rather, the Sears focus on the critical element of teaching children the importance of touching the lives of others and, by doing so, making their own lives more fulfilling.What impresses me the most about the book is the straight forward, down-to-earth manner in which the book is written. The Sears not only speak from a professional standpoint, but one based on personal experience - they have raised eight children! This will definitely be one book I will be highly recommending to clients searching for resource material in childhood development. There are a vast variety of topics covered between these pages on development from the stages of birth through the teen years to adulthood. The material will give parents much to contemplate as they embark on one of life's most challenging and rewarding experiences - raising a healthy, happy, well-adjusted child.

Sears examines the many factors which influence a child, from the important first year of birth, to diet, to discipline.There are many small highlights scattered throughout the book on issues such as homeschooling or playing video games. As with all Sears books, parental anecdotes are used liberally, keeping the book personal and interesting. Frequent references to medical and psychological studies (though, sadly, lacking references) give the feeling that you have the cutting edge of parenting, right in your hand.I found this book very helpful for looking at the big goal of parenting--What kind of person do I want my child to grow up to be? With that goal in mind, Sears gives the tools for how to tackle individual parenting issues. A book like this is great for days when the little annoying parts of parenting are getting you down (like cleaning dried cherrios off of your shoes).Frequent Sears readers may find parts of the book familiar. There is the obligatory &quot;introduction to attachment parenting&quot; that is found in all Sears books. The chapter on nutrition is an overview of The Family Nutrition Book, and much of The Discipline Book is scattered throughout.Parents in any stage of the game will find this book helpful."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"I bought this book and \\"The Child Whisperer\\" by Matt Pasquinilli on the advice of a professional.

We spent a lot of time with her, spoke to her all the time, and did not ignore her when she cried. But I wasn't sure if we were doing the right thing. Upon reading The Successful Child we were relieved because the authors promoted a method in line with ours, and we used the book to refine our method further.Most importantly, the book also helped us to understand our baby's behavior. For example, babies are not trying to manipulative us when they cry, they are communicating their needs to us. Ignore their cries and you are essentially teaching your child that their needs will not be met and that their attempts at communicating with you are futile, so they may stop communicating. This may result in a quieter child (which some books advocate) but at what cost?The book is a little bit repetitive at times and I wish they would have listed the sources for the research they cite, but do not let this stop you from purchasing an excellent book..."},{"Title":"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","review":"This is another really well done book by Dr. and Mrs. Sears.

Detective Tyrone Williams would like nothing more than to see Night behind bars, especially after Night's female pimp, Raffaella, fingers him as the man she sent to the home of a now DEAD client. Now, along with everything else, Night is the number one suspect in a MURDER case, which definitely won't be good for his business. Night's dubbed as a \\"Black American Gigolo,\\" in the headlines. D of D's Security, Night's friend who has saved his life more than once, can hopefully do it again.There is a history hinted at here between D and the Detective. D refers to Detective Williams as \\"Fly Ty\\". The tension between them is almost palpable BUT once Night asks the \`million dollar question' D replies, \\"That's a long story, Night. We don't have enough daylight left to tell it and I wouldn't talk about it after dark. You feel me?\\" Well, neither Night nor I understand what that meant. Which left me wondering, \\"What's the deal?!\\" So, that's a loose end for me.However, I would definitely recommend Night Work. It was a quick and easy read, capturing my attention from the very beginning and held it. You will get a glimpse into the life of a gigolo and a well-developed character. Night Work is more than Night's sexual escapades, dealing also with relationships between his family and friends. It's a suspenseful story of self-acceptance and HOPE with a little drama and a \`whodunit'.FeliciaR.E.A.L.

I'm looking forward to his nrxt book. Great work!!"},{"Title":"Night Work : A Novel","review":"I was looking for something to read for my plane trip a few weeks ago, so I picked this up. I always gravitate to Nelson George novels, as well as fiction about 'subcultures'. So this book was most definitely a perfect fit. I knew the protagonist, Night, was full of bu-ull when justifying his job as getting back at \\"the man.\\" But by the middle of the book, not only did I understand where he was coming from, I felt he encompassed the valid feelings most Black men (esp. dark-skinned) have about being objectfied and always suspect."},{"Title":"Night Work : A Novel","review":"This is a GREAT novel. I read in 2 days. It is about a black handsome dude who makes his living as a gigolo to rich white women in NY. George breaks down how the children of the militant 60's generation have grown apathetic to politics and have grown up willing to get dirty for the dollar, it talks about his exploits in the sexual underground world in NY where \\"vampires\\" (freaky white rich people) pay the poor to do the most sick things from S&M; to group sex where the husbands watch black men take thier wives.the only thing I wished he did was have a chapter explaining how he researched for this book. I am so CURIOUS because I thought it was real. I wonder if he opened the Village Voice and called up some escorts for real life stories.I also wish he would have not made this a book about NY underworld, and chose LA since that is the mecca of porn because a lot more danger and dirt is there and could have made for more drama in the book. BUT I LOVE IT. Read it in 2days!I appreciate how for once he chose to not be political correct and act like only black people deal drugs. The ISRAELI drug dealers are real, and as a kid in the innercity I know. This book is great kind of novel like coldest winter ever because its part fiction, part history of todays generation, and part gossip expose about the lives of the rich and their sick behavior behind close doors. It was like a reading a history of music non fiction book, post 60's black power book, and a entertainment tabliod magazine all rolled up in one.It also taught me about interesting tips on beautiful people, male or female and how disturbed and vulnerable they are in this world. He had so many pithy comments, mostly from characters that popped up.Finally what I loved most is that I was FORCED to finish this book in 2 days. The way he wrote it was kind of like pulp fiction, it skips from one time period to another. I did not have the luxury of pausing and waiting to read it next week or when I had time. I swear Nelson George just wrote the first REALITY TV novel.It was real, it was exciting, it was informative. Thanks Nelson and PLEASE write a novel on the black pornography scene. If you have heard of jake steed, or woodburn they are VAMPIRES destorying poor gullible black women's lives with false promises of wealth in porn. Investigate it and write about it like you did in this book. You are the people's journalist, and the revolutions great novelist. HOLLA."},{"Title":"Night Work : A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gave us a look into NYC night life that outsiders rarely see...some of it down-right seedy!! From the beginning, Night was someone we could empathize with. Nelson tells us of a young dark-skinned youngster being disparaged as he grew up. He didn't become someone that was Cool until being &quot;Dark-skinned was in&quot;, (eg. Michael Jordan, Wesley Snipes, etc.)I like how Night's character developed. You learned clearly what lead him to be a male escort. As time went on Night's take home pay increased as his clientele became more &quot;upscale&quot;. However, through out all of this, one can feel that Night still had genuinely good intentions.Night's true dream was in the music business. But his sister was his number one concerned. There was nothing he would not do for her. His night life, however, almost gets in the way of his family life when dealing with the wrong people gets the NYPD looking for him.This book is a page turner. It's suspenceful and exciting. I look forward to reading more of Nelson George's books."},{"Title":"Night Work : A Novel","review":"Dark as the midnight, smooth as milk chocolate and sexy is the gigolo named Night. In Nelson George's Night Work, he takes the reader into Night's world.

On the way to realizing his dream he is side-tracked by side jobs which include being an exotic dancer and then he gets into the business of \\"pleasuring\\" wealthy clients. One night while out in a nightclub he meets the supermodel Beth Ann. She gives him a cold shoulder until it is apparent she needs him as much as he wants her. Unbeknownst to him, dealing with Beth Ann could have a detrimental effect on his life. His paying job could also have a detrimental effect on his freedom.Nelson George has the ability to provide wild and witty erotic twists to his stories. In this novel, Night's escapades into the underworld are delved into as well as his estranged relationship with his father. The journey into the world of the sexual deviant and the underworld bosses of New York streets provides a kick and adventure to this novel.

It certainly comes from a black perspective. I'm an older conservative white guy, so why would I like this novel?Well, for one, it was a real page-turner, a book which grabs your attention early and keeps it. The lack of profanity impressed me. The writer could express himself, in the form of narration with the lead character of \\"Night,\\" a male prostitute, in an edgy but yet non-offensive manner. That narration reminded me of a good film noir of the '40s or '50s, but updated.This is unimportant, but I thought it was kind of cool that each chapter was typed in a different font.

Quandt, Omar M. Dajani, and Aharon Klieman) and bookended with an introduction and conclusion by editor Tamara Wittes, closely examining cultural attitudes, norms, beliefs, and other factors influencing the delicate and sometimes disastrous Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Essays are titled \\"Israeli-Palestinian Peace Talks: From Oslo to Camp David II\\", \\"Surviving Opportunities: Palestinian Negotiating Patterns in Peace Talks with Israel\\", and \\"Israeli Negotiating Culture\\". Extensively researched an pinpoint accurate in its critiques and scholarly assessments of deadly serious political problems, How Israelis and Palestinians Negotiate is a vital and welcome contribution to international political studies and reference shelves."},{"Title":"How Israelis and Palestinians Negotiate: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Oslo Peace Process (Cross-Cultural Negotiation Books)","review":"Wittes book provides and in-depth look in the Oslo Peace Process from both the Palestinian and Israeli side. She lays down the foundation on why the negotiation failed. It heavily focuses on the mindset and complexity of both nations. The Palestinians base their demands on their desire for domestic legitimacy and their experiences from the Nakba (when Israel was established and thousands of Palestinians left their homes in the Israeli territory after the Arab nations declared war on Israel). On the other hand Israel's mindset is heavily on national security, and fear of actions by the surrounding Arab nations. In the conclusion Wittes clearly lays out her thoughts on why the negotiations failed and what she recommends to do in the future. This book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in trying to understand where the violence in the Middle East stems from and why the negotiations during the Oslo Peace Process have failed. I strongly recommend this book to anyone studying global negotiations as it clearly lays out a great example of the complexities of negotiation."},{"Title":"How Israelis and Palestinians Negotiate: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Oslo Peace Process (Cross-Cultural Negotiation Books)","review":"For the reader who is already well versed in the Oslo and Camp David II negotiations much of this book will be rehash because much of the information is a thumbnail sketch of the negotiations, so in that sense the book isn't revelatory at all, but what the book does do very well is give readers insight into why the negotiations played out the way they did. One of the aspects of these negotiations that is so wrenching is the fact that so many times the two sides came so very close to agreement that it seemed to be an assured thing, but then failure would inexorably but freed from the jaws of success time and time again. For those who read in detail about these negotiations or study them intimately it is excruciating.What this book does is help answer some of those questions about why the two sides could come so close only to see, seemingly, trivial items lead to failure. Tamara Cofman Wittes brings experts from the U.S., Palestinian and Israeli perspective into this volume to discuss the cultural problems that confronted each side in their respective negotiations. Once again for the intitiated reader much of this will be common knowledge such as Israeli over reliance on security matters, to Palestinian paracholiasm and back biting, to the U.S.'s misunderstanding of the needs of both sides, but this work focuses in on these factors and eplores them exclusively which really brings them into a new light. Instead of isolated incidents creating small ripples in the negotiating waters, one really sees how these cultural cues had a much larger role to play becoming waves that helped to sink the negotiations.What is really good about this work is that each expert really explores their sides mistakes with an honesty rarely found in this dispute. This honesty and focus provides a clarity to the role cultural elements play in this dispute. I found this work to be highly enlightening and a very quick read as well. All four contributors write do a great job, and Tamara Cofman Wittes does and excellent job tying all the threads into a single idea that is cogent and powerful. I definitely recommend this important book."},{"Title":"How Israelis and Palestinians Negotiate: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Oslo Peace Process (Cross-Cultural Negotiation Books)","review":"I certainly was wondering what a book with this title could be about. After all, Israelis want and need peace. But they can accept no substitutes. Arabs probably want peace too. But some of them prefer to deny human rights to Jews. And that includes Arafat's gang of thugs. When those folks make it to a negotiating table, nothing good comes of it.But let's see what the authors have to say about all this!William Quandt seems to exist in a fantasy world. To him, all the negotiations so far, UN resolution 242, Madrid in 1991, the Oslo accords, the Beilin-Abu Mazen understanding, and so on, are reality. To me, they are a big and silly joke. And the issues they discussed: Hebron, Gaza, Jerusalem, refugees, and so forth, are to my mind minor and irrelevant. If Arabs are willing to abide human rights for Jews, these issues will be settled easily. If not, there will not be peace.Quandt speaks of \\"painful concessions.\\" That indicates to me that he's not playing with all 52 cards. Is peace and prosperity somehow more painful than death, destruction, and poverty?Omar Dajani explains that the Levantine Arabs see themselves as deserving of victory. After all, the situation is that a giant is facing down by a dwarf (actually, I have no idea which one he thinks is the giant). He complains that the Arabs often had no plan in the negotiations, and sometimes agreed \\"to concessions at the eleventh hour.\\" Really! I can assure him that I would have given his team all the time in the world, and more, to prepare a plan. My feeling is that Dajani made some good points: the Arabs did indeed give many people the feeling that they were not serious about reaching a deal. I know that had I been on their team, I would have wanted to reach a deal, even if I intended to break it. And I think there it was a real problem for the Arabs to decide what they really wanted as well as to decide if they ought to ask for what they actually wanted.There is a strange article by Aharon Klieman. He suspects that the West Bank is being used as little more than a bargaining chip by Israel for \\"security tangibles.\\" That's possible, of course. And he lists four things that bothered the Israelis about the Arab negotiators:1) Arab insistence on sole victimization and full entitlement2) Arab refusal to accept compromises or make counteroffers3) Arab intolerance for fundamental Israeli rights and claims4) Arafat's demand for the \\"return\\" of Arab refugees not to a new Arab state, but to Israel, as well as Arafat's absurd claim that there was never a Jewish Temple in JerusalemStill, isn't there something missing here? Such as the constant anti-Israeli rhetoric by Arab leaders and media? And the hate taught to Arab schoolchildren? Klieman seems to have overlooked all this. And we see the result when Klieman is unable to understand Barak's reaction to the failure of the Camp David talks. Barak complained that in Arab culture, lying creates no dissonance. \\"Truth is seen as an irrelevant category. There is only that which serves your purpose and that which doesn't. They see themselves as emissaries of a national movement for whom everything is permissible. There is no such thing as \`the truth.'\\" Klieman wonders why Barak would say such a thing. I'm not wondering at all: he observed the Arab negotiators doing just this and he didn't like it. He was frustrated with all the lies. Klieman must be blind not to realize this. And it is outrageous for Klieman to find fault with what Barak said without even discussing how accurately it might apply to the Arab negotiators.Tamara Wittes talks about a \\"clash of worldviews\\" between Arafat and Barak. I think she's right about this. I think we're not talking about a disagreement over facts. I think we're talking about a more fundamental issue. And I think Arafat was a racist who believed that Arabs had a Divine Right to oppress non-Arabs in general and Jews in particular, while Barak believed that Arabs and Jews ought to treat each other as fellow humans with equal rights. Of course, that's not quite what Wittes means. She seems to think of Arafat as wanting to focus on \\"justice,\\" although I must admit that she did use the more accurate term \\"pan-Arab issues.\\" And of Barak as wanting to focus on security issues.I claim that the reason there was no peace was that the Arabs refused it. But why was there no piece of paper? I have to admit that I expected at least an agreement, even if the \\"peace\\" it produced lasted for only a few microseconds. Wittes offers three explanations:1) It was just too hard; the gap between the two sides was too great on issues such as the Old City of Jerusalem or Arab refugees2) The personalities of the participants was too much of a problem3) There was a failure to communicateWell, that's enough for this book. I'd prefer a more stimulating and academic topic. I think even a tome about the number of angels that can dance on a microdot would be more enlightening."},{"Title":"The Jews of Prime Time","review":"'The Jews of Prime Time' is a fine analysis of Jewish characters in prime time television going all the way back to The Goldbergs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Zurawik shows how few Jewish characters there have been, notes that between 1955 and 1972 there were virtually no such characters, and describes how many of the characters reflect stereotypes about Jews, many of them negative. Particularly interesting is his analysis of the virtually complete absence of marriages between Jews--almost every marriage involving a Jewish character since the 1970s has been an intermarriage. What's especially remarkable is that all this took place when a high proportion of network and production company writers, producers, directors, and executives were Jewish. Thus, The Jews of Prime Time shows that television was like the movies--Jews were very important as creators of the medium and played a great role in its development, but were so ambivalent about their own Jewishness, and so fearful of anti-Semitism, that their impact on the image of Jews in the U.S. may very well have been negative. And this is not just a matter of history, either. There are few positive portrayals of Jews even today, and, ironically, the entry of more Jewish women into responsible position in television may be associated more with the reinforcement of negative stereotypes about Jewish women than with undermining them.This is a serious book, published by a university press, but that shouldn't scare anyone off. It's easy to read, the narrative carries the reader along, and it's fun reading the inside story of an aspect of television history--even if the story is depressing in some ways. I read it in a day."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"This book I bought and read for my Principles of Revival class in bible school.

The author does that by quoting people and texts step by step through history. As such, it is valuable in pointing one towards where to look for further study. However, that is all it does.What I miss is two things. First, he does not argue very well. Just by quoting one does not prove much. I get the feeling he puts more that due into some quotes, especielly when he does not give the context. He does not manifest the critical attitude that should accompany all historical research. Second, I would have wanted much more reflection over WHY the phenomena became so scarce, why it re-appeared in some contexts yet not in others. Also, he finds the phenomena a lot in movements that have been considered heretical by the Church. But he declares them all more or less Not Guilty. But is it not probable that demonic instances of charismatic phenomena would have appeared in these sectarian minds? Hyatt interprets everything to his own benefit.I am myself a charismatic, yet I believe in doing history with true honesty.Finally, this is not a Church History. It is only interested in the charismatic issues through out 2000 years."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"This is an informative but misguided book. Hyatt tries to show that Charismatic Christianity is nothing new, but in fact has been around for 2000 years. To do this, he provides some fairly radical re-interpretations of accepted ideas. Augustine was charismatic. John Wesley was charismatic. Even Luther was charismatic: \\"the Spirit and the gifts are ours...\\"Hyatt comes out in favour of some of the schismatic and heretical sects in Christian history, like the Montanists in the early centuries, and the Cathars in the high middle ages. He is rather selective in his evidence: one amusing example of this selectivity concerns Cyprian, bishop of Carthage. Hyatt tells us that Cyprian explained the action that he took during persecution by appealing to visions he had received. Hyatt does not say, however, what this action was. It was, in fact, getting out of town when the persecution came - something for which Cyprian was and continues to be roundly criticised.Methinks he doth protest too much."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"Historically and spiritually, it is a fact that Jesus Christ founded the Church, the one Church, that later became known as \\"katholikos,\\" or \\"Catholic,\\" the Greek word for \\"universal.\\" This meant, of course, that people from many nations had accepted Jesus Christ as the Savior, the Son of God Who came to redeem them from their sins, both Jews and pagans.That Church continues on today, and whether Eddie Hyatt wishes to believe it or not, it continues on it the way He meant it to proceed, with the giftings of the Holy Spirit, including the manifestation of people speaking in tongues along with it.That's really my major problem with this book. Eddie Hyatt doesn't choose to believe, so history goes right out the window. He went so far as to state that bishops weren't a part of the early Church, when it ought to be perfectly clear to anyone who professes the doctrine of sola scriptura that bishops were very much a part of the Church from the very beginning -- from the first Council of Jerusalem, to be exact, with Peter at the helm.St. Paul continues in, explaining to Timothy (a bishop) what a bishop ought to be, what kind of character he should have and what kind of family he should be leading (in those early days, since there were so many converts to the Christian faith, most of those men ordained as priests and bishops were already married men with children.)But Hyatt is so determined to prove that the Catholic Church, serving as the villain of the piece, just in case you hadn't noticed, that he completely ignores the clear teaching of Scripture. Why would he do that?In another place, he talks about how churches were built (as if that was a bad thing, to have places big enough for the multitudes of Christians to meet together, worship God, and receive the Eucharist?) so that the people could be separated from the Holy Spirit, not one with what was going on during the Mass.Anyone who could make such a statement has obviously not done his research.He also states that the bishops had \\"thrones\\" placed at the front of the churches so that the bishops, the supposed arbiters of the Holy Spirit, could apparently lord it over their congregations, completely and neatly ignoring the fact that the bishop wasn't up there on the \\"throne\\" like a Protestant preacher. The bishop (or priest) was praying the Mass, accompanied by the people for whom the great Offering -- Jesus -- of sacrifice and thanksgiving was being presented before the Father in Heaven.I don't know what the reason is for such determined misrepresentation is. In my opinion, it indicates that Eddie Hyatt is threatened by the truth of the Church, because if he read the Early Church Fathers and studied the Didache and read his Bible and about the councils of the Church, he might find himself so immersed in the historical and spiritual claims that he'd have to.....I don't know. Convert? That seems like a reasonable position to me.But instead of approaching his subject with the objectivity and intellectual honesty of a scholar who wants to discern every bit of truth the Holy Spirit has to offer, Hyatt makes do with shoddy scholarship, a completely closed mind filled with preconceived prejudice against the Catholic Church, a tendency to quote Early Church Fathers out of context and a decision to either change or ignore factual history when it doesn't suit his agenda.The fact that remains is that the Roman Catholic Church, to Eddie Hyatt's sorrow, is still the one established by Jesus. It's still where He told the disciples that He would send the Holy Spirit, Who would guide them into ALL truth, not just the truths that suited them. It is His Church, and as He is \\"the same, yesterday, today and forever,\\" that hasn't changed and never will.Is it a perfect Church? Of course not. But He knew that, remember? He had the experience of knowing at the Last Supper that some leaders/members would be faithful until the end, some would deny Him for a time and then return; He knew that the majority would often stumble and fall, and that some would betray Him altogether.It this way of looking at things -- His way -- there's no excuse for writing such a book. Or actually for remaining Protestant, for that matter. Eddie Hyatt is of course always welcome to come and learn about the gifts and graces God has for him, a beloved son, in the Church that is One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"This is a wonderful book that traces the miraculous moving of the Holy Spirit through the church age. The author has done a wonderful service for the church, and especially for the charismatic community. It brings together a lot of fascinating information into one place. The down side of this book is its heavy reliance upon secondary sources for quotations from primary sources. This makes further study very cumbersome, if not prohibitive. It also raises suspicions about the reliability of its conclusions. Not withstanding, it is a book that should be in every charismatic student's or pastor's library."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"This book brings much of the charismatic history of the church between two covers. Its not hard to read, but enjoyable. Hyatt not only takes us through church history but helps us see that God is alive and desires to move among His people. It births a desire in the reader to see a move of God and the work of the Holy Spirit."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"\\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\\" - George SantayanaThere are numerous foundational lessons contained within the history of the church. So many repeating occurrences of individuals being overcome with fear, no longer willing to trust their Heavenly Father. Then endeavoring to save themselves with their own inadequate power, invariably triggering destructive repercussions. Rarely, if ever, has a human been able to retain his purpose and vision in the midst of either relentless persecution or utter adoration. Even during times of peace stumbling blocks will arise, many in the church allowing pride and misplaced determination to cause needless and damaging separation of the body. Despite each of these seemingly insurmountable obstacles, God has continued to care and plan for His children. Always seeking willing souls to hold aloft the torch of charismata in this dark world. Bringing enlightenment and revival continuously through the ages. Revealing the true value of the Holy Spirit's gifts by His careful preservation of them since their inception."},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"I recommend reading this book and I agree with the premise of this book. However, the author does an amazing disservice in his presentation of certain observations as \\"facts\\" and other assertions as conclusive, at least in the first half of his work. I, therefore, highly recommend extreme caution for readers of this book! The Preface is genuine. The Foreword backwardly describes the book as part of a growing number of \\". . . scholarly works...\\" against cessationists. This first half of this book not only defies reasonable scholarship, it is a perfect example of the very need for genuine scholarship! The absence of an Index for this type of book is deplorable. Cataloging the historical evidence of the working of the Holy Spirit should be a \\"no brainer.\\" Even though the cessationist doctrine is more than likely a misguided response to defend or preserve more fundamentally erroneous beliefs or practices, extolling the virtues of certain historical figures who seem to support the premise, while ridiculing or casting aspersions upon those who seem not to, reveals a very disturbing trend in the book that belies its serious lack of research, and could easily be used to undermine the author's integrity and credibility. This is wholly unnecessary. This book, though well intended, does prove that reading Church history for one's self is far better than reading it third or fourth hand! Today, with such resources available, there really is no excuse for continuing ignorance about such a vital topic as the historical experience of the gifts of the Holy Spirit within the Church. One example on page 21 suggests moral decline as a primary cause of the Church's loss of spiritual power. How does that square with the Corinthians? This is a common mistake repeated throughout history. On page 29 the author quotes others who state that the Church never recovered its balance after rejecting Montanism. One is left with the impression that Montanism is good. This is a recurring theme in the book where either the baby is thrown out with the bath water or we accept the tacit approval of a movement based on \\"some\\" of its doctine/practice. Both are serious errors of logic. Montanism, for example, rather than being the champion of revivalism alone, through its strict ascetic practices and holding chastity over marriage, becomes one of the chief driving forces for the birth of monasticism in the Church! An agenda that I think the author would not openly endorse. It is not a simple \\"all or nothing\\" as we are led to believe There is some redemption on pg. 30 but it adds to the overall confusion of the original point. Church and sate issues in Chapter 4 are a good introduction to those wishing to pursue the topic. But at the end of the chapter, the author drops a bomb by stating: \\". . . monastics . . . became a vital force during the Middle Ages and preserved the miraculous dimension of the Christian faith\\" an apparent contradiction. The title of chapter 5 \\"Monasticism: the Rise of Another Charismatic Movement\\" is where things start to heat up. The author has Athanasios clearly recognizing the gifts of the Spirit. Contrast that to pg. 35 where he has John Chrysostomos indicating an ignorance and cessation of the gifts of the Spirit. Both of these are contemporaries and both held the same doctrinal positions. It is, therefore, another example of statements out of context. The author cites Augustine for his positive views on the \\"charismata\\" so, in this respect, he's a \\"good guy.\\" However, it is Augustine who delivers a near death blow to the Christian faith as the chief proponent of the \\"sovereignty of God\\" doctrine (please see a REAL scholarly work on this: God At War, by Gregory Boyd). The conclusion of this chapter states another astounding misconception: \\". . . these miraculous gifts became the sole possession of those mystical saints who had withdrawn from the world and society.\\" To the contrary, the larger historical record clearly shows that the charismata were performed throughout society, in public, if one knows where to look, by those who the author categorizes as hermits and recluses! I suppose the author might be correct if he limits his scope of Christianity to Europe only. In the beginning of chapter 6, the author trots out Thomas Aquinas as a witness against Rome's charismatic bankruptcy - well done. Thomas is a \\"good guy\\" since he points out the obvious and helps to support the original premise. Among his other doctrinal corners that he painted himself into, Thomas Aquinas was the personification of \\"scholastic theology\\" at its apex. He closely linked theology with worldly philosophy and even Aristotelian metaphysics! When metaphysics later collapsed in the West, it took down a good deal of faith and related issues with it. He believed human knowledge and reason to be superior to revelation and experience! Aquinas believed that ALL his writings and ideas had to conform to Dionysios the Areopagite! On the very next page, the author cites the same Dionysios as the proponent of mysticism and monasticism - bad guys. Side note: page 52 spouts another gross misconception about monasteries being, at the time, \\". . wealthy. . laziness, avarice, and gluttony also crept in.\\" Where is the supporting data(?) one reference book! This remark perpetuates a common characature along the lines of a \\"Friar Tuck\\" view of all monastics. Monasticism throughout the Byzantine and Arab lands during and after this period do not support this narrow minded view. Another huge flaw is found in the inadvertent use of a misquote from another source on Gregory Palamas. Palamas is described as a thirteenth century monk who taught a meditation technique for union with God by \\"staring at one's navel.\\" Very cute, and a common cliche. Problem is, he never taught that.That's it. On to another observation about extreme unction! The eastern half of Christianity never developed such a notion. Let's just lump them in all together shall we! Here's an excellent example of where this book fails to follow its own legitimate premise in the most egregious manner. Gregory Palamas is very easy to research, unless you rely on the loose research and opinions of others. It is true, at one time, he was a monk on Mt. Athos. He came from a devout family that recognized the charismatic power of the Holy Spirit in their lives. He eventually became Archbishop of Thessalonika. He taught that \\". . we have no political power, land, revenues or wealth. . . we cannot be satisfied with more than our daily food and needs.\\" He is a champion Christian apologist of the first order. Rightly dividing the Word of God, he silenced Gnostics, Bogomils (they rejected the miraculous and taught \\"healing\\" was for spirit only). He taught against monastic excesses that are mentioned on the very the same page of the book! He taught that the \\"gifts\\" of God are poured out in an \\"inexhaustible\\" manner, and that one must not neglect to distribute openly what the Lord has entrusted.\\" Gregory Palamas was an outspoken authority on Greek philosophy as incompatible with the Christian concept of a living God (compare that to Aquinas)! He would cite James 3:15 to affirm that: \\"Greek wisdom is devilish because it arouses quarrels and contains almost every false teaching, and is alienated from its proper end, that is, the knowledge of God. The pursuit of knowledge and science are not evil since our Father and Creator have given them to us.\\" How about this: he taught that EVERY Christian is a temple of God \\"by reason of Grace\\" that dwells within him. He was also against \\"nominalistic humanism.\\" He preached the following: the saints were \\"born of God by the Word through Grace in the Spirit, and who keep the likeness to God their Father, participating in the very life of God.\\" \\". . In Christ, we ALL have communion with God. . . when one shares in the uncreated sanctifying gift, he acquires SUPERNATURAL ATTRIBUTES, he is a new creation AND A NEW MAN!\\" Gregory Palamas was such an outspoken witness against Islam that books have been written explaining Islam's having to evolve its doctrine in response to his Gospel teachings! Another quote: \\" Christ is the head of the Church Who, WHILE GRANTING US THE CHARISMATA OF THE SPIRIT . . . continues to live and manifest Himself in the whole Body!\\" How could such a teaching be overlooked - what a shame! In his later years, he had a worsening illness, and he began to preach on the origin and cause of human illness and suffering - THE DEVIL! To be fair, there are some of his beliefs that many Christians would find objectionable. Point of fact: Gregory Palamas had the gift of miracles which he performed in public. He was a clairvoyant. He had many of the \\"gifts of healings\\" which he performed by \\"LAYING ON OF THE HANDS\\"! When the Great Plague reached his locality, he boldly quoted Psalm 145:19 AND HALTED THE PLAGUE IN HIS AREA, ON THE SPOT! That is in the historical record - not legend!OK, so all of this just doesn't square with what's in the book. Too many inconsistencies. The introduction stated that 2,000 Years of Charismatic Christianity was \\"by no means exhaustive.\\" That's not an excuse for poor or sloppy scholarship. On page 55 it states that during this period the reading of Scripture by the common people in their own language was discouraged. That is true, but only in western Europe! If that's your only vantage point, I guess you're right. You're just writing off millions of other Christians throughout the world at that time who are reading the Bible AND worshipping in their native tongue! Bernard of Clairvaux is cited as an example of a good guy charismatic - yes. A near total disaster encouraging people to take up arms to fight heretics in the second Crusade (by their fruits you will know them). Dominic speaks in tongues (he's a good guy supposedly) whose main objective is to preach to and convert the Cathars (wait a minute - aren't they supposed to be the charismatic good guys) even though the Cathars rejected baptism and eucharistic commemoration in opposition to Jesus' direct mandate! Heretics or heroes is the question indeed. Just because someone is charismatic does not guarantee they have a saving relationship with Jesus and vice a versa- sound confusing? If both camps have examples of \\"good and bad fruits\\" one must exercise sound judgment to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. In making the point that the Gifts have continually operated, the author, wittingly or unwittingly has created straw men to build up and knock down in the process of supportring his thesis. I promise to finish the book. However, Considering how far off and contradictory the author is regarding just the example of Gregory Palamas alone, for my sake, I hope the second half is more accurate than the first!"},{"Title":"2000 Years of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st Century Look at Church History from a Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective","review":"I have heard this man preach for many years, and read several of his books.

In many respects, many of the people mentioned might not be considered \\"charismatic\\" in the way that the term is frequently thought of today. I found D.L. Moody's record of his own baptism with the Holy Spirit--and the dramatic change that it had upon the fruits of his evangelistic efforts--to be particularly fascinating. I had to follow up what I read in this book by going to the primary source and read about it myself!

If we could do this, we would find an up and coming philosopher by the name of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche who has recently befriended an aging composer; Wilhelm Richard Wagner. Thanks to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, we are able to make this impossible journey and breathe the crisp German air alongside this philosopher & composer.The correspondence and friendship that developed between these two intellectual and artistic giants is examined in great detail by Fischer-Dieskau. We learn of their mutual love and admiration. We're let in on the jealousy that each of these egoists had for the other. Wagner would have liked to have been remembered as a great philosopher as well as a great composer. Nietzsche, likewise, would have liked to have been known to posterity as a great composer as well as an influential thinker.Unfortunately, things did not work out that way. Fischer-Dieskau relays for us the letters of rejection that Hans von Bulow sent to the philosopher; the insults that ended Nietzsche's musical ambitions altogether. As a sidenote you can get some of Nietzsche's piano works @ Amazon.com...P>This is an opportunity to explore a friendship that is every bit as fascinating as that between Beethoven & Goethe. All of the intrigue of the famous splitting up & subsequent animosity, the wonderful discussions about Schopenhaur as well as Nietzsche's infatuation with Cosima Wagner - all if it is included in this biographical work.

The open-minded doctor who reads this book will surely think otherwise. The possibilitly, nonetheless, of promoting an EXISTING prostate cancer is candidly discussed and precautions are advised. One must know his prostate before proceeding.To this end there are two chapters on the prostate, the most definitive and complete discussion that I have seen (and I have read hundreds of pages on the subject).Most authorities will contine to withhold this information from the public on the pretext of its being scientifically unproven.

I bought this book because I'd seen it quoted in several other books about Japan that I had greatly enjoyed. Even though it turned out that I knew several of the best anecdotes, I still found the book to be wonderful in its evocation of how a different culture approaches something as all-American as baseball. (The aside about British tutors having to teach their charges baseball instead of rounders or cricket during the 1870s made me laugh. How odd.) The book seems a bit dated, with some of the stereotypes that mark the bubble years still in evidence. But Whiting's prose and research combine to make it a solid and accessible contribution to popular writings about Japan."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Having spent a number of years living and working in Japan and being a big Japanese baseball fan, I found this book both entertaining and educational. Whiting has taken baseball, something both cultures understand, and shown how different both the USA and Japan treat their national past time. I highly recommend the book to anyone not just interested in baseball, but also Japan-US relations. This book was released before the recent influx of Japanese pitchers into the major leagues (Irabu, Nomo, Hasegawa, Yoshii). With their successes in the big leagues it shows that Japanese players can compete with any in the world."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"The author covers the differences between Japanese and American baseball, but sort of goes over and over certain things, with little regard to chronological order--Americans in Japan, Japanese in Japan. But the difference between the Japanese and American point of view, personality, and tradition is very interesting."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Even casual American baseball fans are aware that they play what we call \\"our national pastime\\" in Japan. We see players such as Ichiro, Dice-K, Godzilla (Hideki Matsui) and Kosuke Fukudome join the rosters of some of the best-known MLB teams and, especially in the case of Ichiro, do well. Casual fans also know of the great Japanese home run king, Sadaharu Oh, who hit more home runs than Babe Ruth (but they are aware of the differences in the level of play and the dimensions of the ballparks). White Sox fans will never forget the contributions made by second baseman Tadahito Iguchi to the White Sox's 2005 World Series championship. And most casual fans are also aware that occasionally middle-of-the-road American ballplayers, or older players on the downside of their careers, decide to play in Japan for whatever reason. This creates curiosity about the state of baseball in Japan: what is the game like there? How does it compare to the American game? What is it like to play baseball in Japan? \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\" does an admirable job of answering these questions and more.As portrayed in \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\", there are some very significant differences in baseball as played in the United States and Japan. Japanese baseball apparently draws upon the martial arts and samurai warrior tradition in Japan. The culture and work ethic of a Japanese baseball team, whether at the high school, college or professional level, is a product of the hard-working, self-sacrificing, master/pupil culture of the Japanese people. The most interesting aspect of \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\" is how it uses Japanese baseball to illustrate aspects of Japanese culture. \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\" should appeal to more than just baseball fans - it also should appeal to readers interested in modern-day Japanese culture.My only complaint about \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\" is that I was hoping the book would be a bit more in-depth and slightly less sensational. The chapters read like a series of magazine articles, and I have a hard time believing that the Japanese fans are quite as fanatical as portrayed in the book, or the coaches as demanding. I suspect Robert Whiting exaggerated a bit for maximum effect. The book also could have benefited from an index, as the chapters are organized by topic, and many players and story lines appear in multiple chapters - hence an index would have helped the reader chase down everything about a particular player or incident.Those minor flaws aside, \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\" is definitely worth reading if you at all interested in Japanese baseball or Japanese culture."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Wow, this book is a real eye-opener. I had no idea Japanese baseball mentality was this extreme. Since this book is 20 years old, I'm curious if anything has changed. I sure hope so because the players go through hell and the people are portrayed as extremely racist. The bias against \\"gaijins\\" (any player who isn't Japanese) will have your blood boiling if you believe in fair play.However, there are a lot of laughs in here, too, and a lot of fascinating looks at baseball in Japan, from the owners, to the front office to the players and to the fans. Frankly, at least prior to 1990, most of them sounded like crazy people and generally mean-spirited. Then again, there have been crazy people in Major League Baseball, too! However, it's nothing like reported here by author Robert Whiting. Some of these accounts are absolutely shocking, and you'd think it was all exaggeration. But it isn't, and Whiting always gives both sides of every controversy. The players who have gone over to Japan and played say this is the way it was....and they either adapt or come home bitter and angry. Most of them wound up the latter.Overall, this book is absolutely fascinating reading."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"If you are looking for a book about Japanese baseball - this is it!

It also gives a lot of insight into society and the psyche as well."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Sure, the book is dated, but the truths and cultural differences highlighted remain in tact. The Japanese way, the concept of the group, the irrational approach to practice, still remain. Few books get to the idiosyncracies of the Japanese as well as this one does. Not a lot of \\"eastern wisdom\\" or \\"zen baseball\\" but the cold hard truth about the weaknesses of the Japanese way."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"With the influx of Japanese stars into the US Major Leagues, many sports fans are becoming intrigued by the league across the Pacific and the ballplayers who play in it. Reading this book, along with Mr. Whiting's two others, Chrysanthemum at the Bat and The Meaning of Ichiro, will give you the best understanding availible. This book focuses more on the relationship between Japan and the American ballplayers who play over there, but there is a lot on Japanese players, the history of the game in Japan, and the culture of Japanese baseball. It was written in the late 1980s, but still is informative to a reader 20 years later."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"What a fun book this was! It's very quick and easy reading - a fast reader can get through it on a plane trip or on a Sunday afternoon. I also gave it to a family member who was laid up with an illness, and he found it to be a good distraction. I myself picked this book up originally because I was interested in Japanese-American cultural conflicts and issues. I also just so happen to enjoy Dodger basu-baru.This book has some very entertaining stories and pictures. My favorite is a picture of a Japanese catcher being taught how to crouch behind the plate by squatting above a board with spikes pointing up toward his privates! Ouch!...that's one way to keep focused! There's also a funny shot of all the Japanese team managers dressed up in samurai armor and sort of scowling at the camera - they look fearsome, all right!The book did give me the kind of information I was seeking, though. Through the prism of baseball, it deals with some of the most important contrasts between American and Japanese culture. For example, the Japanese are much more likely to play when injured, for to do otherwise is \\"weak\\". This book tells the story of a pitcher with a torn ligament in his pitching arm who tried to \\"pitch through the pain\\", and could not get help from the Japanese sports doctors. He finally had to go to the US to get treatment, starting a rush of Japanese athletes who sought consultation and surgery here in the US that they were ashamed to seek in Japan.I was also very interested in the story about how baseball came to be introduced to Japan (though an American schoolteacher). Before long, Japanese youth were being subjected to intense training in baseball which rivals that for martial arts.Some posters here have mentioned that the book is two decades old, and somewhat out-of-date in terms of the players discussed. I didn't really mind that, and found it, all-in-all to be a very enjoyable and interesting read."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"If you love baseball, then this book is definitely for you.I enjoyed this book, but the statistic details were a bit much for me. Other than that, the details about foreign players playing baseball in Japan, their culture shock and other tidbits were interesting. Living in Japan, it made me understand some of the quirky things that occur outside the baseball stadiums."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Robert Whiting has done a terrific job giving an overall flavor of Japanese babseball. If you have an interest in baseball and Japan, you'll enjoy \\"You Gotta Have Wa.\\""},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"This is a great book on one of the most beautifully esoteric topics out there. This is a subject that can be appreciated more now than ever. Japanese baseball rocks! Let's all just admit that. This history is academic and detailed, yet fun and nostalgic at the same time. In addition, it was written in an era that was void of any present day marketability or \\"hip\\", as oppossed to the era of Ichiro and Matsui Hideki, in which commmentaries will certainly contain those oppining in a way void of knowledge or appreciation of that which went before. Thank God that the pure and noble notion of this wonderful sport will always trancend the fraiailties of predjudice.Go The Tigers!"},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Whiting's first book on J-ball is tremendous but this one he relies too much on stereotyping stuff and pulling theories out of nowhere to fit his slant. It's certainly worth buying Wa; just don't buy into all the opinions. The one saying that the PL and CL MVP awards were both given to foreigners in the same season due to some weird theory that it had to do trying to reduce with trade friction between the U.S. and Japan at the time is laughable. Like anyone back in the U.S. in those days noticed J-ball nor even correlated baseball with trade issues.The book though is spot on on capturing the spirit of '80s J-ball and the characters really come to life and especially for anyone who lived here during that era, it's a great read.Just take things with a grain of salt on his trying to tie other non-baseball issues in with the baseball bits."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Professional baseball is as important, if not more so, to Japanese culture as it is to American culture. Whiting humorously demonstrates the &quot;culture clash&quot; that has happened so many times when American Major Leaguers get lured to Japan to play on professional teams. The history of how the game developed in Japan is also well told here. If sports indeed mirrors society, as I believe it does, this book tells us as much about Japanese society as it does about Japanese baseball."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"By far, this is the greatest baseball (if not sports book) ever written. And with today being Opening Day, it would be most appropriate to have on hand. A+ classic! Bob Whiting sure does grasp the essence of baseball! Good Deal.A true classic. GET IT!"},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"It is said that the UK and the US are divided by a common language. As veteran journalist Robert Whiting shows, the United States and Japan are divided by a common sport. Judged by American standards, Japanese baseball is a totally different world with its own set of assumptions and values. As foreign players who are lured into one of the twelve Japanese professional teams soon discover, it takes a special kind of person to play in Japan. A man has to deal with a different type of pitching, a wider strike zone, and unpredictable umpires. The life of a ballplayer is regimented by detailed club rules, strict discipline, and endless training sessions. The goal is to increase the fighting spirit and team cohesion. There is a belief that if a man tries hard enough, he can do anything, and players are taught to \\"pitch through the pain\\" until their arm aches so badly they can no longer raise it.People who have worked in a Japanese environment will recognize some familiar traits. There are the incessant meetings, for example: daily pregame preparatory meetings, impromptu midgame strategy sessions in which the players huddle around their manager in front of the dugout, and nightly postgame conferences to review the team's mistakes. The game requires total concentration and is played with dreadful seriousness. Japanese bring to it their sense of organization and attention to detail. There is a rigid sense of hierarchy, and a player never questions a coach's decision. As the history of the game shows, there is a desire to learn from outside but also the imperative to adapt a foreign import to Japanese mores.According to Whiting, baseball's grip on Japan's collective psyche is due, ultimately, to the fact that it suits the national character. Introduced to a people whose very identities were rooted in the group but who, oddly enough, had no group sport of their own--only one-on-one competitions like kendo and sumo--, baseball provided the Japanese with an opportunity to express their renowned group proclivities on an athletic field. Unlike other group sports, baseball also comes with a built-in individual confrontation--a test of wills--which also gave it its initial appeal to fans of the martial arts and sumo. The \\"get-set\\" ritual in sumo, for example, with its squatting, stomping, and fierce glaring, has its equivalent in the war of nerves the pitcher and the batter wage, which involves delaying tactics like calling time and cleaning spikes.Perhaps another reason for baseball's attraction for the Japanese is its relatively slow pace and frequent pauses. The natural break between pitches and innings allows ample time for long strategy sessions, responding to the need to fully discuss and analyze a problem before reaching a decision. Baseball is a commentator's sport, suitable for discussions that provide a wealth of detail on each player or each team. The use of ma, or time interval between two actions, is not unlike a Kabuki performance.But baseball has also transformed the Japanese and introduced a kind of American way of life in everyday Japan. Like American military bases, it has reinforced the umbilical link to the US and perpetuated an American presence on Japanese soil. American ballplayers, most of them refugees from the major leagues, have been an active part of Japanese baseball since the postwar era. Baseball has brought to the Japanese language a rich vocabulary of borrowed terms and metaphors. Knowing the rules of the game is often a requisite for participating in discussions about politics or business, and media commentators are as keen as their US counterparts to interpret current events in baseball terms. This adds another cultural barrier for foreigners who do not share Japan's or the US' enthusiasm for and familiarity with a sport which, unlike soccer, has never commanded a global audience."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"This book is a fun read about American players in Japan. From my experience seeing a game in Japan, it is a bit dated, but I'm glad I read it beforehand. It gets repetitive at the end. The chapter about translators is a hoot! A great companion volume to the movie, Mr. Baseball."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"like the warren cromartie book slugging it out in japan this is another must have book as up until 1988 it tells you the crazy goings on and stories involving americans baseball players in japan from the army type practices to the americans wider than a cadilac strike zone you can't even hit that ball with a boat oar(bob horner yakult swallows) this book tells you all.i wish someone would write a even newer version of this book as i've heard alot of stories involving kevin mitchell and rex hudler among others in japan.great book.if you are curious about japanese baseball get this book."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Bravo Robert Whiting for composing the greatest baseball book!

For that I would give him five stars. His knowledge of baseball is only passing for a professional writer, and make cause hard core baseball fans to be left wanting for more detail.The book was written in the late 1980s and reads a bit dated, but the stories of how a select group of American ballplayers attempt to integrate into Japanese style baseball is still interesting and worth a read during the long baseball-less winter. It was also written before the days of all-star players like Ichiro came from Japan to America and dominated. During the 1980s, you could be a semi-over the hill overweight American and still hit 340 with 40 homers in Japan.The author's knowledge of Japan was first rate and his obviously lived in the country for a long time. The book is about baseball, but is really about how the Japanese culture is still struggling to integrate culturally with the rest of the world. I would reccomend it for the baseball reader who is looking for something unique."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"On the surface, this is a treatise about baseball in Japan. Only slightly underneath, it's a fascinating work on the difference between Japanese and American culture. The title word Wa comes from the Japanese word for team unity, as opposed to the American interest in individuality.The book goes through both a history of baseball in Japan, as well as challenges American's deal with over there. It covers the trials and tribulations of Americans like Bob Horner, who thrive on the diamond, but struggle off the field. It covers the adverserial relationship between Japanese coaches and their foreign (Gai-jin) charges. Any American going to work in Japan is well advised to pay attention!How is Japan changing over time? Compare how the approval of &quot;different&quot; antics of foreigners changes over time. Learn how some Japanese players follow the model, but as the exception and not the rule. Is the Japanese culture changing, or a surface appearance of change part of the Japanese character? Read the book to find out. Again, it's only about baseball on the surface.How does training differ? The American model suggests individuals can improve, but only to the limit of their ability. The Japanese model in both the field and the office is that there is no limit - strength and success is limited only by effort. This drive leads to a 10-11 month season counting training camp, as well as several hours of strenuous exercizes every day before practice. This is essential to developing the fighting spirit. Again, someone travelling to Japan for business is well advised to understand this.The book is a must for baseball lovers as well as people interested in learning more about Japan. The book is a fascinating work that hides great learning behind Japan under the story of America's pastime."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Baseball is baseball, right? Not when it's played in Japan, it seems. Pitchers pitch &quot;until their arms fall off.&quot; Fielding practice is done until players drop from exhaustion. Fans chant highly organized and rhythmic chants at the same piercing volume, all game long, regardless of the score. It's not &quot;play ball&quot; in Japan, it's &quot;work ball.&quot; And into this arena come the foreigners. Often bench-warmers and minor leaguers in North America, they are expected to become instant stars in Japan. The pressure and the intense work ethic drive many away after only a few weeks or months. Others, like Randy Bass, become national heroes, appearing on TV commercials nightly. However even Bass must have felt his outsider status when he was intentionally walked for the rest of the season when he challenged Sadaharu Oh's single-season home run record. If you are interested in baseball, or in what happens when Japan meets the outside world, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"I have had the fortunate experience of visiting Japan twice and seeing some Japanese baseball. It was an experience I shall never forget. Curious about the subject I picked up and read this awesome book. However, as much as this book is about baseball. And it is filled with some great stories and information. I wonder how much this book is really about the cultural differences between the United States and Japan. Using the history of Japanese baseball and the rough experiences of many of the American players who have tried to play in Japan, the author does an awesome job teaching about Japanese culture. This is much more than a baseball book. Its about baseball and culture, and cultural diffusion, and the differences between Americans and Japanese. This is a funny book, a fun to read book, but you will learn alot about Japan by the time you are done. I have even assigned this book to my students. This book is worth it. An unforgettable read."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"Longtime Japan resident and journalist Robert Whiting's classic book on Japanese baseball is as fresh today as when it was published. The book begins with the arrival of Bob Horner, a 29-year-old bonafide all star who was still in his prime when he arrived to play for the Yakult Swallows. Waiting for him when he landed at Narita Airport were 200 journalists, a team owner who confidently predicted--and expected--that the overweight Horner would hit 50 home runs (Horner was assigned the number 50 on his uniform as a not so subtle reminder), and a year contract worth $2 million. What Horner did not know was how different yakyu (literally, field ball) would be from the baseball he knew in America. The regimentation of Japanese teams, the rules governing many aspects of life both on the field and off--and the adjustment of moving around the world to live in a very different culture--had been and still is the undoing of many players. Whiting's work is about more than baseball and sports; it is about how Japan and Japanese approach things, how that which is imported must first be Japanized. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"If I were teaching a college course on Japan, this would be my text book. Readable, funny and right on the mark. The way Americans and Japanese approach baseball provides an excellent illustraion about how we differ in our approach to work and life in general."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"As a long-time Japanese baseball fan, I was very excited to finally receive this book and start reading it. Robert Whiting has done an excellent job of finding material that is usually not accessible for the average foreign fan of Japanese baseball, simply due to the fact that everything is written in Japanese.Whiting has succeeded in creating a very enjoyable and very interesting \\"summary\\" of Japanese baseball as a whole, and really portrays just how differently the game is played and thought of in the East. In particular, the mentality of Japanese baseball that he describes, along with the accounts of many of the players were eye-opening.It's just such a shame that the book is published in 1988, with no revisions forthcoming since then, because, as is inevitable with time, baseball in Japan has moved on.In the modern game, the popularity of the \\"Yomiuri Giants\\" which Whiting talks at length in his book are declining - so much so that they have trouble filling the stadium or even getting good ratings on TV. In fact, baseball as a sport in Japan as a whole has been on a gradual decline in the face of Soccer, which, when Whiting wrote \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\", was unthinkable.There have also been great shifts in terms of the power of Japanese baseball: away from the Giants to other teams, and the players union even went on strike in objection to the loss of player jobs following the merger of the Orix Bluewaves and Osaka Buffaloes. Whiting wrote however that the player's union would never consider striking, as that was the Japanese player's mentality. This signifies just how much the game has changed in Japan. Further, the systems have been edited to incorporate playoffs, and foreign coaches in Japan are now found at three clubs - a vastly different landscape to the one which Whiting reported on so excellently twenty years ago.Even though the book is outdated however, it is still a very enjoyable and very thorough account of baseball and the mentality of baseball in Japan. For anyone with an interest in the sport in Japan, I would highly recommend reading it, as very little else is available which is of a similar quality to \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\".But when reading, I just cant help but feel how worthy a book this would be if updated with information on the modern game. With stars like Matsui, Matsuzaka and Ichiro now plying their trades in the US, Whiting would have a lot to talk about.I recommend it: Just realise that the game has moved on a little from then."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"In describing the Japanese game of baseball and the problems it has caused Americans attempting to play that game, Whiting succeeds in painting a vivid picture of the differences between the American and Japanese cultures. After reading this book, I came away feeling that both countries could learn from each other: by learning about how the Japanese live their lives, Americans could become more dedicated to their jobs and less self-centered; meanwhile, the American way of life could teach the Japanese to be more independent and less willing to always sacrifice their own well-being and that of their families for the good of their teams (or companies). A happy medium between the two extremes of the cultures would result in better environments for everyone. In reaching these conclusions about the two countries, I realized that this book was much more than just another volume on baseball. If you're looking for a pure baseball book, you may want to try something else; however, Whiting's effort is a memorable one and I would advise that you don't pass it up. The stories of Americans trying to play baseball and acclimate themselves to the new, strange environment of Japan are both humorous and unsettling at the same time. Because these players are foreigners -- and especially because they are American foreigners -- they receive a special stigma and must deal with much more pressure than a normal Japanese player. The Americans are usually paid a lot of money to play in the land of the rising sun, which only adds to the widespread belief in Japan that these players are primma donnas who care more about the money than they do about winning. Some of the Japanese training methods will strike American readers as bizarre, if not completely ridiculous. Subjecting players to the thousand-fungo drill and making tired starting pitchers throw 200 pitches on their off-days are just a couple of the off-the-wall ideas championed by Japanese baseball's greatest thinkers. These methods may seem more harmful than beneficial, but one has to respect the work ethic and the dedication of the Japanese players. Even if you are not a baseball fan, you will probably find this book interesting. One of my only beefs with it is that there is no index. That may seem nit-picky and it obviously has nothing to do with the actual content of the book, but once I'd finished the book, I wanted to go back and read about certain incidences that occured with specific players. It would have been nice if I had been able to refer to an index to find the stories about these players instead of having to skim several pages trying to locate those stories. Oh well, it's still a great read."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"but it helps. I'm not the world's biggest sports fan, and while I could get the gist of some baseball specifics like sacrifice bunts from context, some more esoteric points went over my head. Not many, though, certainly not enough to significantly diminish my appreciation of this book. Anybody (well, anybody American) looking for an entertaining and accessible introduction to some major differences between Japanese and American culture could do a lot worse than \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\". Managerial styles, notions of work versus play, team spirit, and many other topics of broad interest that transcend baseball are touched on in this book and used to illuminate the differences between our cultures.Ten+ years after the Japanese economic bubble burst, the book does occasionally seem dated. Assumptions about inevitable Japanese global domination common to much of the writing from this period do occur, but don't significantly detract from the book."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"This book is fun to read even if you are not into baseball, but if you are, then its awesome! Its mainly made up of many different stories and experience from American baseball players who played over in Japan. The stories are about the clash in cultures whether on or off the field and most of them are really funny and you could just picture it happening. I feel that the book is more about the cultural differences between east and west and they are just using baseball as a vehicle to illustrate them. There is a movie starring Tom Selleck called Mr. Baseball that I think is a take off from this book. It is also very fun to watch."},{"Title":"You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I went out and did quite a bit of research on my own about the Japanese leagues.

MSK's reputation has sorely damaged by owner, Mac Stuart, whose unsavory operating practices border illegal. Despite Mac's seedy operating tactics the FAA has not been able to prove any negligence thus far. However, Mac's seemingly unscrupulous conduct has brought MSK to its financial knees and just may knock him out of the Alaskan sky.Ironically, Mac receives a call from archrival, Evan Gibbons, of North Air Charter offering him a charter flight from Grizzly Bear Tours to Nome Alaska. Mac knows that MSK's capital has dwindled to the point that he can't make payroll. Additionally, the only aircraft open at MSK is currently in maintenance getting and a past due overhaul. Mac uses all his conniving powers of persuasion to convince, threaten, and browbeat those in his employ to get the aircraft soaring by twelve noon the following day.MSK flight 76 departs Anchorage on a three-hour flight to Nome at 1:30pm. Less than twenty-four hours after take off the Alaskan airways are buzzing with news of the downed and missing charter, which carried forty souls, thirty six passengers and four crew members.Reading Ms. Parke's Vacation turned survival, I felt as if I were a passenger on that flight.

I either get bored or side-tracked. This novel grabbed me from page one and never let me go! I read non-stop all weekend until I finished. I can picture it becoming a movie. I fell in love with the lead detective, Lindsey. Now I'm trying to figure out what actor would be best suited to play him. Absolutely loved Voices and recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Voices","review":"In VOICES, author Ann Garber creates a plot so realistic, so mind-boggling, so exciting ... I was compelled to finish it!A serial killer is on the loose in the Orlando, FL, area. He leaves his trademark on his victims. But, where is he? The police are baffled. I was baffled, too! Each time I thought I had uncovered the killer, Garber hit me with another surprise! Even in the final pages of this gripping novel, I found myself waivering between characters for the identity of the killer.VOICES is an excellent read. It's every bit as good as anything John Grisham has written. I would suggest buying a first edition copy, since there are hot off the press. Then, when Garber is famous - as she is destined to be if she continues writing in this vein - you'll have a treasure!"},{"Title":"Voices","review":"Voices is about a serial killer &amp; the lives he touches. It's also about the investigators trying to find him &amp; the family &amp; friends of the suspected killer. It is written from different angles &amp; the author has created believable characters - likable &amp; not so likable.The book begins with the investigators at a crime scene &amp; Garber holds nothing back in her descriptions of the scene. The killer's signature is an &quot;X&quot; carved over the victims mouths &amp; eyes &amp; a rope around their neck, held in place by an old style clothespin. Gruesome!The tidbits about the killer's movement are strategically placed so it keeps you guessing. As soon as you think you have it figured out Garber throws another curve at you.This is Garber's first book &amp; I hope it isn't her last. This writer has talent!"},{"Title":"Voices","review":"Garber makes her characters come alive. I really like Lindsey and Cross. Hope this is the first of a series. The author has a knack for keeping you tuned in. Her writing style and abiliity to keep it fast-paced made me flip pages like crazy.Voices is about a serial killer and a cool detective who we men can identify with. And a no nonsense female criminologist who women will like. The book is graphic at times in its crime scene descriptions but doesn't have many violent scenes. It leaves a lot to the imagination, which makes it,in my opinion, even more frightening.It also doesn't leave you depressed like some psychological thrillers. Actually,I got a good message out of it. I have to wonder if that wasn't perhaps the whole reason for the author writing the book in the first place. It's pretty deep and you do have to pay attention to the details,subtle clues, etc. because they all come together at the exciting end."},{"Title":"Voices","review":"I really like it when a book not only refuses to let me put it down but also catches me off guard. Words I'd use to describe this book would be clever, witty, suspenseful and exciting."},{"Title":"Voices","review":"Anne Garber's book, Voices, is phenominal! The pages kept turning. The characters seemed so real. I loved John, disliked Allen and was annoyed with Anthony. The women; I admired Carol's devotion to her children and have known women like Linda and Debbie. I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Voices","review":"This is no doubt one of the best books I've read!! I literally could not put the book down. It kept pulling me back to read more. I would compare Garber's writing with Patricia Cornwell. While reading the book, just as you think you have the murderer figured out, you begin doubting yourself. The book takes many turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's one of those books that you are sorry when it ends. You want more, and I for one can't wait for her next book. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Voices","review":"From the beginning this book pulls you in and holds you until the murders are solved. I really got into the police characters and their personalities. It's obvious Ms. Garber did some background work here (just like a good detective). As soon as I thought I knew who the seriel killer was the plot provokes you to keep reading because it could be one of several well defined characters. The clues mount up and you still aren't sure who it is. Even before knowing the Orlando areas she writes about, this book creates outstanding visual images. The detective's race against time makes you as anxious as they are to solve this one. Pick it up and you won't put it down until it's solved. A good read in a well developed mystery."},{"Title":"Voices","review":"Ann Garber kept my interest going strong thru the entire book. I just had to find out who the killer really was. I couldn't put the book down until I knew. I was on the edge of the seat till the end. Garber has real talent and should write more books like Voices. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Voices","review":"I live in St.Cloud, Fl. where most of this book took place. Needless to say,that made Voices all the more frightening to me. I stayed up until three in the morning reading it with every light in the house lit. Went to bed, tossed and turned. Couldn't get it out of my mind. I kept trying to figure out who the killer was. I was obsessed! Finally, I just got up and read until I finished it the next morning.Wow! There's some deep psychological stuff going on in this book! It really makes you think of things with a little different perspective. Made me get off my high horse. It will be a long time before I take another nightttime stroll down the streets of my town. Even in daylight, I'm looking over my shoulder. This book is incredible. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Way Down South: Stories from the Heart of Dixie","review":"If it is true that all good writing may be said to be regional writing, then Way Down South is a regional book that will speak to a wide audience. Nina Hepburn and Beverly Williams manage to capture a Southern voice that is warm and complex and centered in the chest. At their best, their characters will hold their kinky and complicated shapes in the presence of such immortals as Big Daddy and Blanche DuBois. &quot;Mama's Elvis Story,&quot; wickedly funny and heartfelt at the same time, has already assumed a near-mythic stature for me. Southern readers will recognize their own in this book, and yankees such as myself will be touched by a soulfulness that can cross the Mason-Dixon line most effortlessly; for Way Down South captures a local truth that casts a wide net."},{"Title":"Way Down South: Stories from the Heart of Dixie","review":"Incredibly written book of short stories. The authors have defined the characters well. Some make you laugh, some make you cry--but all make you think. It touches all your emotions."},{"Title":"Way Down South: Stories from the Heart of Dixie","review":"Award-winning writers Nina Salley Hepburn and Beverly Williams pool their considerable literary talents in Way Down South: Stories From The Heart Of Dixie, a short story anthology with a distinctively Southern flavor.

Beverly Williams contributions include: Old Maid; Crasher; Backslider; Hotsy Totsy; Rose-Colored Glasses; and Grandmothers On The Bach. Fully fleshed characters inhabit skillfully rendered settings of the South with the writing so vivid and reader engaging that one can fairly feel the sunshine's heat. Way Down South is a expertly crafted, delightfully entertaining, and impressive collection showcasing two outstanding and distinctive literary talents."},{"Title":"Way Down South: Stories from the Heart of Dixie","review":"Having been raised in the South, I can truly relate to these stories first hand.

It definitely kept my attention, and I congratulate these fine southern ladies on a job well done."},{"Title":"Way Down South: Stories from the Heart of Dixie","review":"This compilation of short stories written by two accomplished Southern writers is truly the spirit of the heart of the South. As a Westerner who has spent time visiting through the South and making Southern friends while doing so, and listening to their stories, too, this book is thoroughly engrossing, both with the sadnesses and humor that characterize the South. For me, these &quot;Stories from the Heart of Dixie&quot; reflect my experiences with the wonderful people that are true Southerners. And the writers easily evoque those experiences."},{"Title":"Way Down South: Stories from the Heart of Dixie","review":"&quot;Stories from the Heart of Dixie&quot; gives the reader a chance to step into the lives of multiple personalities and experience life in the South like so few writers are able to depict. You can almost smell the honeysuckle wafting thru the trees as you read the antics of some of the characters.The writers of this book have truly done a great job of letting the reader know just how life in the South is different than life in any other part of the country. You get the feeling that you've actually been there.If you want to enjoy being Southern, whether you are Southern or not, you need to read &quot;Way Down South&quot;.

God bless the Church of Christ but not all those other denominations, heretic factions or the nonbelievers."},{"Title":"The Champagne Companion: The Authoritative Connoisseur's Guide","review":"Michael Edwards' guide is neatly laid out in sections that briefly and without being overly technical explain the uniqueness of Champagne -- the region, the wine and the process by which it is made -- and a series of profiles of the major Champagne houses with comments on specific wines and insights into the various house styles. When this guide was first released a few years ago, it was a good replacement for Serena Sutcliffe's book &quot;Champagne&quot; that had recently gone out of print. Unfortunatey, Edwards book is now out of date as well.This offering is deceptive since it is billed as the third edition and the flyleaf carries a 1999 copyright, but the text is almost entirely lifted from the earlier edition and most of Edwards' tasting notes are from 1993 and 1994. There have been substantial changes in the Champagne industry since the early 90s and some of these are ignored in Edwards' book. He writes clearly and has good tasting insights, but his notes won't be of much help to consumers just getting into Champagne and wondering about wines currently available, not those released five years ago.I give it five stars as a general reference, but only 1 star for topicality."},{"Title":"The Champagne Companion: The Authoritative Connoisseur's Guide","review":"This little book is more than worth its minimal cost. As a general guide to the history of the great drink it's somewhat sketchy, but if you want the word on what Champagne to order and what not to (for the same price), it will provide just that. Follow its 9 or so top marques and you almost cannot go wrong. More than that though, it identifies some superb non-vintage Champagnes from less-well-publicised houses. Some I found in Epernay sell (unbelieveably) for less than 90 francs ($11) at the cave door -- half the price of the book. Though the 3 category ratings are relatively useful, a more finely discriminating set (say 5) would have been much better as a guide, particularly where the 2-star marques are concerned. Reading between the lines though you may be able to tell which 2-stars are better than others. As other reviwers have noted, it is now a bit dated: the '99 edition surprisingly fails to mention the '95 vintage at all. A well revised edition would be welcome."},{"Title":"The Champagne Companion: The Authoritative Connoisseur's Guide","review":"The sub-title of Michael Edwards book does not lie. It is most definitely the authorative guide in the great beverage, Champagne. Edwards gets to the point in the beginning of the book, giving precise and accurate details about the origin of Champagne, then moves to another level. Edwards examines all the Champagne houses ever heard of, and more, while continuing to interest the reader. If it is ratings of champagnes or a quick idea you need, it is given in quick abbreviateed symbols and words. A real treasure, I have not found a better book when dealing with each champagne house in writing.

In the same fashion as the other alphabet books and counting books, a fact is given corresponding to each letter. But, this book is about all of Asia rather than only China, helping children to place China into a larger context. In addition to China, Japan, Korea, India, parts of the former Soviet Union, parts of the Middle East, and Pacific Islands are mentioned. We like the interesting illustrations--my kids are fascinated with the map on the cover--and you can stretch this book out by using some of the facts to come up with some fun activities.

Note that there's some content you might have to debrief about (i.e., Q is for Qur'an, \\"singing praises to Allah, a child's voice, pure and clear, rises to heaven.\\" and Z is for Zen, \\"Zen culture practiced throughout Asia, emphasizes peace and simplicity and a thoughtful, disciplined way of life.\\")If you want to read my reviews of 35 kids books having to do with China, visit my 7.2.2012 post on myoverthinking(dot)com"},{"Title":"A Is For Asia","review":"Eclectic celebration of the diverse languages, cultures, and religions of Asia.

Correctly pronouncing German is very difficult to master, but practice makes perfect ... regularly imitating the words, phrases, and sentences on this tape will make you sound more like a German!There are some great tips on this tape for pronouncing all vowels, consonants, umlauts, including the &quot;ch&quot; sound in &quot;ich&quot; (an extremely often used sound). The dreaded German &quot;r&quot; is covered, but tape or no tape, I still think it's a matter of finding the right spot in your mouth (through trial and error) and and repeating 100's of times in a quiet place to reinforce the muscle memory. The easier Bavarian alternative (just like the flipped Spanish &quot;r&quot;) is also introduced in case the &quot;back of the mouth r&quot; is too hard.I often reccomend this to others who are learning German, since correct pronounciation is SO important. If you can speak German well, but your pronounciation is bad, no one will ever recognize that you know the language. However, if your pronounciation is really good, and even you make some grammar mistakes (which are hard to avoid) Germans are usually really impressed and won't revert to English as soon as you open your mouth!This is a great addition to any German program!"},{"Title":"How To Pronounce German Correctly Audio Cassette and Book in clamshell Case","review":"This is an excellent program for those who want to speak german perfectly.

One side note, though, the program says that you should pronounce all your -ig endings as an ICH sound.

Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!MichelinFamous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations. However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information. These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.Rick Steves' books are not recommended. They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor. They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.Frommer'sThese are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually. Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.Lonely PlanetLonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides. They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.Blue GuidesWithout doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have. If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you. This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.MapGuideMapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date. It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system. The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth. I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences. MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.Time OutThe Time Out guides are very good. Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre. Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!Let's GoLet's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience. Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.

Tucker has an interesting, breathless, and detailed way of telling a story that I have to admit intrigues me.Meet Hazel Chamberlayne. She is almost forty, beautiful, divorced with one child who is about to enter college. Being that she is a divorce lawyer, you would think that she was hardened and not looking for her true love. But strangely that isn't the case. She has a tight circle of friends (known as \\"the girls\\") all with their own lives and love problems. And things are OK.Then Joe Ryan starts at her firm, and she is forced to work closely for him. Despite the fact that Joe has a girlfriend of 12 years, they are instantly very attracted to each other. After a date and a non-kiss, Hazel tries to distance herself from him. Joe meanwhile decides that he is in love with Hazel, and breaks off his 12-year relationship with his girlfriend.At the same time as all of this, Hazel's friends have dramas of their own. One of her close friends is getting married, and one of her other friends discovers a malignant lump in her breast.The Younger Man has the elements of Tucker's first novel that I liked: the first-person, present-tense narrative, the in-depth (sometimes too in-depth) details and conversations, and the suspenseful romance sideplot. The writing itself however is a bit to digest at times, what with the single quote marks around dialogue that can be confusing to American readers. The character also often goes into thoughts in the middle of a narrative, which can be confusing. Somehow though it comes together as a decent novel.I was a little disappointed with the plot and choices that Hazel makes.But overall, this was a decent, if unusual, British chick lit novel that many henlit fans will enjoy. But don't be fooled by the title; this book is barely about dating a younger man, but more about a woman turning 40 and deciding what to do with her life."},{"Title":"The Younger Man (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"The English really do do it better. I discovered the delightful Sarah Tucker when I first picked up her novel, The Last Year of Being Single. It didn't seem like my type of story, but after reading the first page, I was eager to find out what would happen by the last. When I finished it, I felt sort of changed. I felt like I had to do something; I felt like it wouldn't be quite right for me to just close the book and put it place it on my bookshelf and forget about it forever. So I went online and bought two of her other books. When I was through with them, I contacted her, telling her what a fan I was, and how much I enjoyed her stories. I also asked if she would mind \\"autographing\\" the books for me. She doesn't live in the country, so bookplates seemed to be a good idea. She enthusiastically agreed to send me a few, thanking me for being a reader on the way. Two weeks later, I received something in my mailbox, but it wasn't an envelope of bookplates. Sarah had sent me two of her books, two I didn't have, and they were SIGNED! That very same day, I started and finished The Younger Man, and I am thrilled to be able to share my review. It makes me so happy how generous and loving to readers that authors can be these days. This one is for Sarah Tucker.Blurb: Does life really begin at forty?Successful, divorced lawyer Hazel Chamberlayne is sexy, independent and about to hit forty. Hazel also has a group of friends she loves and trusts, who love and trust her...and she doesn't need a man.Not, that is, until the intelligent, engaging and ten years younger Joe Ryan becomes a new partner in the law firm. It's one thing to spice things up with the occasional passionate indulgence, but in a job where the path of true love runs straight into the divorce courts, Hazel isn't sure she can believe in her own happy ever after.Though, just like a bikini wax, isn't love supposed to be less painful the second time around?The first idea you get when you read the blurb is \\"cougartown\\". It's an idea that seems to be overrated these days, called hot by tabloids like E!News and People magazine. I personally find it annoying because of how \\"cool\\" it's made out to be. Why should age differences in relationships be cool? After reading The Younger Man however, I could tell why.Hazel Chamberlayne is me. I'm not Hazel Chamberlayne, but she's me, she's you, she's every girl who has ever gotten her heart broken. Her love life has been through hell and high water, so at forty, she knows what she wants in life, and it's definitely not a new husband. She's got a beautiful daughter going off to college soon, a tight-knit circle of friends that you and I would both die to have, and is a successful, confident woman with a fantastic high-salary job. She already has a happily-ever-after life, one that began when her marriage ended, so who the hell is Joe Ryan, showing up at her firm like nobody's business? Who the hell is he to make her forget all of that, and to make her want to start over again?Well, for starters, he's eye candy. Major eye candy. Jaw-dropping, eye-popping, saliva-inducing eye candy. And you know what? This bastard is nice too! And dare I say it --funny! (collective gasp!!).Before she can tell herself not to fall for this guy, she finds herself falling for him anyway. It's bad enough that's he's so darned perfect; why must he be ten years younger?I winced, I smiled, I teared up, and I damn near fell off the sofa laughing, while reading The Younger Man. Tucker's charming, goofy British style is sure to make you as well. I have to warn you though, there was some pretty funny English lingo that I didn't quite understand, but it wasn't awful; I could figure out most of it by context. I love Sarah/Hazel's voice, though. British people are so suave and cynically hilarious. I enjoyed this one a lot. I also now love them Brits :)Radical Rating: 9 hearts- One of my all-time favorites! :)Review by: Stephanie ([...])"},{"Title":"The Younger Man (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I read it because I thought it would get better.

A plotline that sounds like it will provide plenty of excitement. Yet it was not to be.Expecting a great read after enjoying Sarah Tuckers \\"Playground Mafia\\", I found this book to be a waste of my precious time. I found it to be a story lacking any real plot or a main character that I liked, let alone emphathised with. I persisted with the novel over a long period of time hoping for an improvement in the story. That didn't happen.

Hazel feels quite good with being a senior partner and believes life begins at forty, but also feels somewhat lonely having not dated since her own divorce.The firm has a new legal partner, Joe Ryan, who Hazel, shocking herself, finds quite desirable as she has not felt that way towards a male in a long time. Joe, though he has a live-in girlfriend and is ten years her junior, reciprocates her feelings. Though Joe makes efforts to prove not all men think with that head as he is falling in love, Hazel refuses to step out of her safe zone as she knows an affair with a junior partner could cause havoc on the firm and besides he has a lover; no sloppy seconds for her.This is an interesting look at a boardroom romance between a senior female partner and the junior male newcomer; part of the profundity is the woman being the older person in the potential relationship. When the story line focuses on Hazel and her relationships with her ex, her daughter, her staff, and now Joe, the tale is top rate. When her zillion friends share the lead, the plot slows down under overload. In spite of too many sidebars tidbits, Sarah Tucker provides a compelling relationship tale between an older woman and THE YOUNGER MAN.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Younger Man (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"This book was a fun look at life and love and the perfect timing. Life is all about choices and this book illustrates this perfectly."},{"Title":"The Younger Man (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"As Hazel Chamberlyne's fortieth birthday approaches, the English lady lawyer is not depressed, but feels like a success, except for the lack of love in her life. Then, she finds herself working with a handsome younger man who is attracted to her. That's when the insecure moments begin to arise. Joe Ryan just seems too good to be true, and why would he want to be with a woman ten years older than himself? It would seem Hazel's worst enemy is herself.Though there are a few bright moments, for the most part, this seems to be a fairly plotless story. Joe is too much of a beta hero. If he and Hazel go dancing, I'd expect her to lead. One thing that does count for this story is though set in England, the British slang is not incomprehensibly used to the detriment of American readers.Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Sisters in Spirit: Iroquois Influence on Early Feminists","review":"I strongly disagree with the reviewer who gives Wagner's book only 1 star. While the book is by no means flawless, it also has important strengths. Wagner offers an accessible history of one small portion of feminism and corrects the mistaken assumption that feminism is a \\"white women's\\" idea and movement."},{"Title":"Sisters in Spirit: Iroquois Influence on Early Feminists","review":"While I found this book offputting at times, with its hardly subtle bashing of Christians and the church, I still think that it is a useful text because it covers subjects that we all too often forget. The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) were here first.... the European pioneers, and we their descendants, did not create our society ex nihilo, out of nothing, by our own genius. Our forefathers borrowed heavily from the Five Nations, as we are reminded in this book, and it is to our detriment, and that of our society, that we have forgotten that and grown so far away from it.Just as Dr. Wagner plays up the good and the genius of her main feminists, so she conveniently leaves out the good works of the church. Thus I feel that there are likely other areas where she has exhibited extreme bias. However, this book is very easy to read (accessible) and thought-provoking. If you live in the New York State area or find yourself in the Adirondacks, I highly, Highly recommend that you visit the Six Nations Indian Museum in Onchiota, New York. It has limited hours, but is still run by the Fadden familiy, who are familiar with this material and also offer a nice selection of related titles, such as \\"White Roots of Peace: The Iroquois Book of Life.\\"I would also very highly recommend going on from this book to read more about the Haudenosaunee, and about native agriculture, and going out to plant the Three Sisters (corn, squash and beans) in your own garden.

During my undergraduate education, I was honored to attend her lecture on women's history struggles.Thus, imagine my surprise upon seeing this book would be used for a graduate Women's Studies class, much less, in conjunction with an academic's name. I simply could not believe this was the same person from whom I had heard an authoritative, professionally delivered lecture.Both in length, layout, and depth, the work easily resembles junior high school offerings. That a PhD could produce such harried work in 2001, and pass it off as excellent scholarship is a sad testament to remaining difficulties 'enlightened' white feminists have attempting to study 'other' women.Claiming to \\"celebrate diversity\\", her heavily edited history just happens to present sanitized multicultural interactions as the idealized norm.Nowhere in the book does it mention the complicity the aforementioned women (or other white feminists--including those who admired the power structures) exhibited in the eventual destruction of tribal culture and people.However inspired early feminists may have been by Haudenosaunee society, this inspiration clearly had limits, as the American women's movement demonstrated susceptibility to racist and ethnocentric ideologies. Roesch Wagner's failure providing critical examination of 'first wave' feminists ulterior motives undercuts what could have been a very interesting read.No, Stanton's later comments (omitted from this book for whatever reason) disparaging men of color for receiving suffrage while white women lacked the ballot are not 'nice', 'progressive', or 'enlightened' but they do show history as it actually happened, and would paradoxically provide a 'road map' for today's feminists so we can self-identify and stop making the same old mistakes.Just because it is a project involving 'women of color' does not excuse Roesch Wagner from meticulous research. Ironically, it demands far more because of exclusionary traditions that made histories about women of color the least known.Failing to show history in its full complexity is grossly irresponsible. As a professional whose work has built on publicizing the lives of traditionally subordinated (and silenced) groups, Roesch Wagner owes society an enormous apology.While she claims the book was produced with full tribal cooperation, I highly doubt it."},{"Title":"Windows on Learning: Documenting Children's Work (Early Childhood Education Series)","review":"Now in a newly expanded and updated second edition, \\"Windows On Learning: Documenting Young Children's Work\\" is the collaborative work of educational consultant Judy Harris Helm, educational resource specialist Sallee Beneke, and classroom teacher Kathy Steinheimer (Valseka Hinton Early Childhood Education Center). \\"Windows On Learning\\" provides teachers with a proven method for collecting, analyzing and displaying children's work at school.

In my admittedly limited experience, the books put out have a tendency to spend more time than necessary discussing the importance of defending your marital vows and not enough time providing guidelines to produce an effective personal defense. A the same time, churches all too often spend their time on this subject teaching rigid steps that all listening are expected to utilize with very little consideration for personal weaknesses or Biblical steps that are to be taken in this fight.Jerry Jenkins, in his book \\"Hedges,\\" takes a wonderful step toward righting these scales. He does this, not by calling for congregations to be exhorted any more than they are, but by providing a written call to all men. It is a call for us to examine ourselves Biblically, as we seek our potential weaknesses and plant hedges around our greatest vulnerabilities. The hedges we plant are to be personalized, for what works for one man may not work for another. We can determine our own hedges, Jenkins asserts, through prayer and open communication with those who are directly at risk, should our hedges not be strong enough to withstand the inevitable feints and direct attacks on our egos.One of many important steps toward shoring up our defenses that I brought out of his book contradicted much of what you hear from marriage councilors, both Christian and secular. Jenkins acknowledges that marriage is to be treasured and defended, but stresses that the greatest defense does not call for us to rush into battle or to withstand the temptations we all face. Rather, he reminds us that the battle against sexual immorality is won, not on the battlefield, but in our retreat.2 Timothy 2:22So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.As I consider this, I am reminded of my own struggles with lust. I am aware that I am not the only Christian man who has tried to face this challenge and lost. Failing this battle just once can overshadow a hundred victories. The enemy is patient and relentless. Attacks on my ego can come from any and all directions and even a victory wears on me, setting me up for the next attack. Jenkins offers scenarios that I am familiar with, even though my life doesn't mirror those in his examples. It doesn't have to, for the strategies used against me are the same as those used on others, even as the excuses that have entered my own mind not all that long ago are all written in black and white on these pages.The book is not alarmist, but it is painfully sincere as it shows how even a marriage that seems ideal on the outside can be eroding from the inside. Trends in the church do follow trends in society, much to our shame. We can take society's stance that any correction must come from victories won or we can take God's stand and flee the immoral situation, even if it was our own doing that brought us to that place. We can accept the same excuses from our friends that society finds perfectly acceptable or we can tackle the issue head-on by telling the next person in the church who is prepared to abandon their spouse that this will not be tolerated, based on the response given to the last person who pleaded the Lord's will that they divorce.Marriage vows are taken before God and man and are not to be taken lightly. Jenkins does a great job of underscoring this fact, but no amount of emphasis on this can ever be enough. Once the reader has an understanding of how to face this threat to the sanctity of their vows, we are given some wonderful examples of the blessings others have experienced by obeying the mandate to defend their marriages at their weakest points.Jenkins clearly defined his purposes for this book and met each one of those purposes with boldness, truth and practical tips. If I have any complaint, it is that he apologized to anyone who feels that his guidelines may seem prudish or old-fashioned. In fifty years, the stigma of divorce has changed from that of a cultural anomaly to become something that is expected. Nobody walks down an aisle hoping their marriage will fail, yet so many people are completely unprepared to defend their vows. The advice in this book is neither prudish nor is it archaic. Jenkins does not claim to be anything other than what he is, a loving husband and father. \\"Hedges\\" is one book that I fully recommend, not for its deep message but for its simple approach to help any man who is sincere in his desire to make his marriage one that will withstand the test of time."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who had picked it up after looking for some advice on keeping the fidelity in his marriage.

He had asked for it and was very pleased with his gift."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"In the past couple of years I have read several books written for men to address the issue of sexual purity. I have found these books useful to varying degrees. The solutions that authors suggest to deal with this issue - which, as far as I know, is common to all men - vary greatly. Some books forbid men to engage in even a single look at an attractive woman to whom a man is not married. Some books teach a process of \\"bouncing\\" the eyes whereby men learn to avert their gaze from any feminine beauty other than the one to whom they are married. Some teach what is little more than the repetition of mantras - a Bible verse a man can repeat when he sees an attractive woman. Hedges, by Jerry Jenkins, does not fit any of those categories.Jenkins, best known as half of the writing team which brought the world the Left Behind series, is a gifted writer. His book is fun, easy-to-read and will connect with the average man. The book is premised on Paul's admonition to Timothy, found in 2 Timothy 2:22 that he \\"flee youthful lusts.\\" Jenkins tells us that this verse teaches that \\"We are to run. To flee. To get out. To get away\\" (page 45). He believes that God does not give victory over lust in the same way he allows victory over other sins, such as temper, greed and pride. While we can learn to avoid stealing, gossip and lying, he contends that no man will avoid a peek at pornography if he was convinced that no one would find out.And this is where his book varies from the rest of the seventy or eighty titles on the bookstore shelves that share this theme. All the other books (or at least all the ones that I have read) teach that men can gain a victory over this sin. The problem is, that many of them teach technique that in reality tries to convince us that we can win the victory if only we repeat the proper Bible verses and learn to bounce our eyes.Jenkins' solution to sexual temptation is to realize that we cannot avoid being tempted, to learn to appreciate beauty, and to plant hedges around us to guard against sexual sin. He teaches that the first look is not sinful. There is nothing inherently evil in a man looking at a woman and appreciating her beauty. \\"I know that some people may laugh at my notion of looking at women to appreciate God's creativity and would accuse me of inventing a spiritual reason to leer. I maintain that after years of steeling myself to avert my eyes from something made attractive by God, developing an appreciation for it is far healthier. Clearly it would be wrong to gawk and dwell upon some stranger's beauty, especially when I have vowed before God and man to put my wife ahead of all others. Dianna knows that I am attracted to pretty women (she is one, after all). She also knows that I know they are off-limits and that even entertaining a lustful thought is wrong...My gaze doesn't linger and my thoughts stay in check\\" (page 50).Thus the first look, a glance which appreciates a form God made deliberately to appeal to men, is fine. It is the second look, designed to soak in details and provoke lustful thoughts, that is forbidden.Jenkins goes on to suggest the importance of hedges, which are boundaries we put in place to safeguard ourselves from sexual sin. He describes each of the six hedges he has planted in his life, but is careful to point out that each man will have different hedges appropriate to his situation. A man who travels will need to guard himself in ways different than a man who rarely leaves the house. Here are the author's hedges:1. When he meets, dines or travels with an unrelated woman, he always adds a third person to the group. When this is impossible, he is always the first to tell his wife.2. He is careful about touching women. He embraces only relatives or close friends, and only in the company of others.3. If he pays a woman a compliment, it is on clothes or hair, not the woman herself.4. He avoids flirtation and suggestive conversations, even in jest.5. He often reminds himself and his wife that he remembers their wedding vows.6. From the time he gets home to the time the children go to bed, he does no work in order that he might spend quality time with the family.While not a hedge per se, he also promotes the importance of a man sharing his story - the story of how he and his wife met and fell in love. These stories are a powerful reminder of the love a man and wife share and it is important that these stories become a part of the family's heritage.Some will object that this book does not interact with other obvious passages of Scripture. In fact, the book is quite short on Scripture altogether. But I would suggest that Jenkins' purpose in writing this book was not to produce a volume that thoroughly examined all that Scripture teaches on lust and sexual purity. Instead he sought to write a book that teaches men the safeguards that he has found successful in his own life. As such this book is not the whole story when it comes to sexual purity, but it is a good place to begin. Were a man to use the strategies in this book, and only this book, as the foundation for his pursuit of sexual purity, he would miss out on the importance of renewing our minds. Unless our minds are filled with the Word and our heart is filled with the Spirit, our pursuit of purity may just be destined to fail.Planting hedges ought to be a priority in every man's life. As I read this book I realized that while I had never considered the term \\"hedges,\\" I had placed boundaries in my life that work in the same way. For example, shortly after my wife and I were married, I blocked many of the channels on the television that have a lot of inappropriate content or just never have any useful content whatsoever (see ya later, MTV!). I had my wife set a password which I do not know. And even now I still can't watch MTV (or Showcase or a handful of others). And I can just see those who know me laughing as I write this, but I don't hug or touch women (or men, for that matter - no Promise Keepers for me!). I have often been chastised by friends for not hugging enough! Of course this has more to do with an aversion to hugging than it does with sexual purity, but it functions the same.I enjoyed this book and can recommend it. It is not the complete story of sexual purity and the author could certainly have gone into far more depth. But the suggestions he provides are valuable to those who desire to live a life of godliness and purity, and to avoid the sin and temptation that our culture provides, promotes and even condones."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"Hedges by Jerry Jenkins is a book of practical strategies to guard your marriage. It is one man honestly speaking from his struggle to urge all men to take seriously the chance that they too might fall to sexual immorality.It is a vital subject, and this is definitely an area where men need to be very careful if they think they are standing, as a sexual fall according to this book is not so far from any of us.One central theme of the book is that no mature how mature a man is he will never stop finding women attractive and that he shouldn't even try. Indeed the book even argues that it is possible to admire the handiwork of God in womankind without lusting. The author implies that by trying to deny this natural attraction for the female form and attempting to not even look atwomen we meet in the street, we merely encourage lust. Men are encouraged to be released to recognise that they will never stop being drawn to admire the beauty of women other than their wife.The supposition that men will always be drawn to women like bees to honey is I am sure true. I have never yet met a heterosexual man who claims to have totally conquered lust. I remember I think it was John Piper stating how a single image of a woman accidently seen can be imprinted on his mind for months. Is the answer to steal a brief look at a decently clad beautiful woman we randomly meet, thank God for his handiwork and remind ourselves that, if married, we have better things waiting for us at home?This advice reminds me of some that was passed to me as a young man apparently orignally from Billy Graham \\"Its the second look that's sinful\\". I will never forget the glint in the eye of the man who told me this and went on to elaborate \\"...he never said you couldn't have a long firstlook!\\"Some may disagree with the pragmatic honest approach of the author. Indeed at least at first sight one has to ask is it consistent with Job 31:1 \\"I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?\\"However, I doubt any of my male readers can honestly say that they are free of the urge to admire the beuuty of women. Certainly the bible says we should \\"flee from the temptation of lust. Hedges explains a number of practical ways the author has found to do thisI am pleased that the \\"hedges\\" are not offered as law but merely an example which each man shoulld adapt to his own personal circumstances. In many ways the most important issue is not that you adopt these hedges, but that you go through a process of working out for yourself what your hedges should be.Here are the authors \\"hedges\\"1. Not to dine or travel with a woman alone unless an unavoidable complication makes this impractical, and then to tell his wife first2. To only ever hug another woman in front of others3. To never compliment another woman on her looks, only her clothes4. To avoid any kind of flirting except with his wife and to engage in as much flirtation as possible with his wife.5. To remind his wife often of his wedding vows orally and in writing6. To get home early and spend time with the children every day before bed7. To share his story oftenNot every hedge may seem practical, necessary or helpful, but to consider each of them is surely helpful for evey marriage. The book is full of other practical tips, which again need to be taken in the way they are intended- as helpful pointers and not unchangeable laws. As an example, the writer suggests asking a hotel room receptionist to lock out porn channels on check-in. Personally, I have a totally different strategy which also has the advantage of not requiring terrible embarassment at checkin- I simply never turn on the TV. If I have a few good books with me, why would I want to channel hop anyway?This book is a useful read for any christian man, I am not sure whether women will want their illusions about the spiritualiuty of men shattered. Indeed, one area where I am less sure about is the idea that you should speak about your struggles with your wife. My wife of ten years says she would rather not know if there are other women I find attractive. She knows that if necessary I have men I can talk to about these things. Having said that, there is even a danger in talking with other men as it could degenerate into a conversation focussing on the merits of various women and become almost tittilating! Sometimes the best apprioach as advocated in this book is to simply run and then fill your mind with something else.As helpful as this book is, it only contains one half of the story. As Piper says in Sex and the suppremacy of Christ (which incidently is a book I am currently reading)\\"There are many practical strategies for being sexually pure in mind and body. I don't demean them. I use them! But with all my heart I know, and with the authority of Scripture I know, that the tiny spaceships of our moral strategies will be useless in nudging the planet of sexuality into orbit unless the sun of our solar system is the supremacy of Christ.\\"Hedges is a book that is well worth a read, but must not be seen on its own as the answer for our struggle with lust. Actually, probably a major solution to our problem is learning to grow more in our quietness and trust in Jesus."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"I received Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough To Protect It by Jerry B. Jenkins two days ago. Not only have I completed the book, I have read the study guide and watched the DVD that comes with it. It is that good. Honestly, it is better than good. The book is totally awesome! I really had a hard time putting it down.The book is about loving your marriage enough to protect it from infidelity and how you can do that. The author uses \\"hedges\\" to protect his marriage. He not only shares what those hedges are but also explains how you can build your own hedges and what those hedges can do for you and your family. The book is bible based and author tested.Jerry Jenkins wrote Hedges with husbands in mind. Let me tell you now that this book will bless men and women alike. Not only does Jerry share his own weaknesses but his openness makes it easier for you to admit your own. Which is the first step to determining what hedges you need and where you need to build them.This book really should be required reading for all married couples. Christian marriage counselors and pastors would do well to recommend this book. Not only does it cover how to prevent infidelity, the impact of infidelity on a marriage, but also great tools to make your marriage better and how God wants it to be. The study guide is packed with wonderful ideas to strengthen your marriage and add a little romance to it.I really enjoyed the author's writing style. Jerry Jenkins is the co-author of the Left Behind series of which I am a big fan. His writing style really gets your attention. It is like he is talking to you. He totally pulls you in.The DVD is entertaining as well. I laughed out loud a few times! It really brings the book together and elaborates on some of the points of the book. I really think that together with the study guide it would be perfect for group study or even a class for newly married couples."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"I have to be honest I read this book right after I got married. At 25 My perception of marriage was if it didn't work out I will just divorce her. AFTER reading this book my eyes were opened. Marriage is for Life. Thank God For Jerry B. Jenkins.

The DVD is fantastic and is a great intro to the book. I would call this book a MUST for married and engaged couples."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"When I first heard I would be given the book Hedges to review, I thought it would have something to do with gardening, and I began to sweat. There was a call to my mom to ask her what they call the person who's the opposite of a green thumb. She said it was a brown thumb. I'm a brown thumb. I couldn't possibly review a book about gardening. But, before asking for a different book, I decided to give it a chance.I received the book a couple of weeks ago and was stunned to see the author's name across the cover: Jerry B. Jenkins. Knowing his other books, Left Behind and his new series, including Soon and Silenced (among many others), I was thrilled to see it was one of his books! I read the sub title: \\"Loving your marriage enough to protect it.\\" This looked exactly like something I would want to read, so I dove in.He opens with a story about a man and a woman who are co-workers and friends. They talked a lot, spent time together, even a business trip in which they were in the same hotel (different rooms). Jenkins tells how this couple made some seemingly minor mistakes and found themselves in an unexpected lip lock. They were \\"just friends\\" - as so many men and women are, particularly those who work together.Through more illustrative stories and personal anecdotes, Jenkins takes the reader through exactly what mistakes people make when dealing with the opposite sex, including what many see as mild flirting. He talks about certain rules like, never be alone with a person of the opposite sex who is not your relative. He explains, without preaching, the importance of planting \\"hedges\\" around your marriage to keep your odds of infidelity at bay. It is just amazing how many people believe they're completely safe from cheating, but can find themselves in a compromising position without these hedges.This book touched me unlike any marriage book I've read. Jenkins is, in non-fiction, still a powerful writer and story-teller. He made me think more seriously about my own marriage, and my relationships with other men. I was convicted, and freed at the same time. Though the book is primarily written with men in mind, women can gain from it as well."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"...for any man wanting his marriage to last longer than on lap around the sun. Jenkins plunges into the heart of men's struggles with promiscuity and offers great insight into how to shield your marriage from the storms that will certainly rage.Get it for any man you know about to make the commitment!"},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"My sister gave this book to me and said as she handed it to me \\"don't be offended\\". I think she thought that I was going to feel like she was saying something (negative) by giving me a book about protecting marriage. I didn't feel offended. I think any Christian husband ought to read this book, as well as any husband that at least believes in some of the same Judeo-Christian beliefs that guide most believers.It's not that long, nor that complicated, but it does pack a punch, especially if you're a husband that's not giving the appropriate amount of love, affection and emotional support to your wife.The basic idea here is to put up \\"hedges\\" or lines in the sand that you won't cross in order to protect yourself from going down a path or course of action that will hurt yourself, your spouse and/or your children.The hedge may have to do with other women, but it could just as easily be with time, money or any combination of things that are distractions in your marriage.While not at all an exciting read, the writing is solid enough and the information important enough to get my strong recommendation."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"This a great book. It shows you how to set realistic boundaries around your relationships so that you don't find your self slipping into an affair. More peole need to understand that certain behaviors lead to inappropiate relationships. Too many people say I am secure in my relationship I don't need to worry about affairs ect.. The fact is that if you spend more time with an attractive coworker and get more intimate with them than you are with your spouse you can kiss your marriage good bye."},{"Title":"Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It","review":"Long before he received acclaim for his popular Left Behind series of books (and films), Jerry Jenkins was helping couples solidify their marriages. This volume of HEDGES: LOVING YOUR MARRIAGE ENOUGH TO PROTECT IT, is an updated version of Jenkins' book originally published in 1989.The primary focus here is teaching couples how to avoid falling under the pitfalls of infidelity, which permeates far too many marriages. Many young couples might scoff at the notion, but before you do, just stop and think of how many other young people you grew up with who came from single parent homes. For many of those children of broken homes, infidelity was the cause. This is not just a problem that faces only a select group either. Prominent evangelists, judges, even US Presidents have fallen prey to infidelity. This is a growing problem that can and does affect us all in some way or another.Here, Jenkins teaches how to, as he terms it, plant hedges to protect ourselves, our spouses and our children from becoming victims to a temporary wave of seemingly uncontrollable libido. The advice is practical and easily implementable. Given that over the past couple of generations, almost all men and women find themselves interacting more and more with the opposite sex, coupled with a rather cavalier social attitude toward infidelity (thank you Mr. Clinton), it is more important today than ever before to know how to prevent falling into such situations.Don't think for one minute \\"this will never happen to me\\". It certainly can happen to anyone. Knowing how to plant the hedges of protection will prepare you to know how to avoid such possibilities. You made a promise before God to be true and faithful to your spouse. You owe it to him or her and you owe it to your children to be prepared if and when you are tempted.Pastor Monty Rainey"},{"Title":"Eneas Africanus","review":"I first read Aeneas Africanus when I was a child in the 1950s. I thought it was a delightful book and a wonderful story. Fifty odd years later, I came upon it on the bookshelf and read it again. I was astonished to realize how my perspective had changed. It was embarrassing to remember how I had felt about this book so many years back, and a relief to realize my perspective has changed. I do recommend this book to others because we must never forget how our culture viewed African Americans in decades past. While many may view this book as offensive (and it certainly can be viewed as such) I think the story still has value. We cannot erase the way things were. It's best to confront our attitudes and move forward."},{"Title":"Eneas Africanus","review":"A quick read about a slave who is separated from his \\"master\\" and spends his entire life trying to get \\"home.\\" Not the typical read of tales between slaves and masters.

Brown, who grew up on a backwater ashram in India among what Nicholas Basbanes has called (referring to book collectors) the gently mad, writes of her formative years with an incisive wit and a truly twisted sense of humor. Any book that makes one chuckle and cringe simultaneously is doing something right. This book does it all too often.More than anything, I find it unfortunate that I found nothing here hard to swallow. Religious wingnuts worshipping a dead guy in a diaper? Check. Pervasive physical and emotional abuse at a Catholic school? Check. Rampant prejudice? Check. Crazy drivers? Check. (Though it is tough to believe that there are worse drivers than those in and around Boston.) Adults who treat kids like they're idiots? I remember that one all too well. Brown reminds me of me as a kid, in many ways. Early and voracious reader, picked on a lot, much preferred being alone to the company of others. My parents were less crazy, but it's not too hard to extrapolate.Because of this, and because of some of the less glowing reviews of the book I've seen, I wonder if there isn't more of a vertical market for this book than one might expect in our current memoir-crazy society. If you, too, are that kid, then I can't recommend this book highly enough. If you were the person who picked on that kid... eh, maybe not for you. ***"},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"Not only is it well written, the story is entertaining, absorbing and fascinating.

She keeps you intrigued and interested in her entertaining way of telling the story."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"I read this book on the high recommendation of a friend. As an Indian-American, I have first hand knowledge of the general chaos and disorganization that one can encounter in India. In this book, compounding the India experience are the eccentric personalities that are drawn to the ashram where the author spent her adolescent years. The first few chapters seemed to poke humor in these aspects. Then, the chapters become more dark, with scenes of child abuse and neglect. Most of the numerous characters didn't have any appeal and, while you could feel how disconnected Mani was growing up, the reader is left feeling disconnected from the book. The alternating time periods in the book from her growing up years in the ashram to flashes of her current life made me think there would be some rekoning with the pain and sadness of her early years. But I did not find it."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"I hate to disagree with my Fellow Readers, but I found this to be an insufferable diatribe about how intelligent the author is. Yes, we know she was an early reader. Yes, we know she had a terrific vocabulary by the age of 7. I was so tired of hearing how bright this child was that I found it hard to finish the book. As an American Educator, I found her mother's quote insulting as well; \\"American schools don't know how to deal with kids as bright as you are.\\" Give me a break; we are trained to enrich as we are trained to remediate~her experience shouldn't be fodder for such an unfair generalization. Maybe she should have elected to edit her mother's comment or leave it out altogether. At any rate, I have better things to do with my summer vacation than finish this essay. I did enjoy some of the snippets into Indian and ashram life so if you can get by this author's attempt to hit you over the head with her brilliance, it may be worth your while."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"A memoir of a young girl growing up in an ashram (a religious retreat) in India during the 1980s, All the Fishes Come home to Roost is hard to get involved in. The memoir doesn't have an actual story line beyond the day-to-day experiences of Brown as a child. This doesn't give the reader reason to keep turning the pages to find out what happens. It is more a diary of what happened during Brown's childhood. She had an unusual life, true, but I just wasn't drawn into the story. She tells the story from the vantage point of someone self-absorbed with herself.Brown tells about \\"Baba,\\" a self-proclaimed spiritual leader, all through the book. The spiritual leader her parents followed is part of the story, but this entity was mentioned in the first 10 chapters to the point of distraction - several times on each page. Brown makes him a central character along with herself and he is not quite worth that much attention. Then at the end of the book Brown makes a surprising confession about her feelings toward this person, whom she or her parents never met.While attending the Holy Wounds of Jesus Christ the Savior School, Brown was harassed by the other students because she was an n American, a foreigner. Sad and regrettable, of course, but in the book, she depicts herself as a child who wouldn't have been easy to warm up to and that made it hard to become emotionally involved with what happened to her.One reason for this is that Brown was a precocious child and we are reminded of that many times. In some instances she makes it clear, she knows more than most adults. This may have been true, but a reader only has to be told once.Brown says that she tried to write this memoir several times. \\"I'd try a few times, but all my attempts had gotten bogged down in fury, self-pity or wild speculations about my parents' motivation. I was bored reading them.\\"Reading All the Fishes Come Home to Roost left me with the same feelings she experienced reading her first drafts. I don't think she has yet overcome the obstacles from her past.Finally, from chapter 29 forward, the memoir becomes more intriguing. Brown starts to reveal herself, not in a self-indulgent way, but as who she really is. She reveals her thoughts about and interests beyond those of herself. Perhaps she will try to write another memoir, starting from chapter 29 of this one."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"I heard about this book from a friend and read it out of curiosity. Brown really has a way with words and a gift for evocative description. However, from the very first, I was struck by her deep-seated resentment and bitterness, and the impression that as a child she wasn't much fun to be around. Although Brown tries to be funny, I find it hard to forget that she is vilifying real flesh-and-blood human beings, not her own imaginary characters. True, she changes their names, but I doubt this makes them hard to recognize by the people who know (or knew) them.This is not a story, but a series of episodes that are linked together by Brown's need to condemn her parents for taking her to India to live in an ashram with a collection of oddball spiritual seekers. When it comes to plot in the Aristotelian sense, there is no \\"there\\" there.In this work, Brown is critical and derisive towards everyone, while portraying herself as a special, heroic, and misunderstood victim. Reading between the lines, she needs to rationalize her own bratty and hostile behavior towards everyone around her except, I think, one kid named Walter. I can understand a child being self-centered, and utterly devoid of compassion or tolerance, but it's hard to understand these traits in an adult looking back on her life.Given what's happening in today's world, I was especially disappointed by Brown's gross insensitivity to the principles of religious tolerance. I'm not a religious person myself, but I respect the beliefs of others, and especially their Constitutional right to religious freedom in America. There may be abusive nuns and priests, but that doesn't give anyone the right to abuse a religion that encompasses millions of sincere Catholics. It's just plain wrong to make fun of people -- even those who follow the teachings of an obscure Indian guru -- based on their religious or spiritual convictions.In addition, I was quite disturbed by Brown's veiled implication that one of Meher Baba's disciples touched her with sexual intentions. If the disciple touched Mani inappropriately, then this is a very serious charge that should be addressed by her parents and the entire Meher Baba community. If he didn't touch her inappropriately, then it's very wrong of Brown to make this implication. Brown is honest to the point of cruelty throughout the book, so why the sudden coy ambiguity surrounding such a serious issue?This book was not a page-turner for me, but I kept hoping for the kind of insight that often arrives to people who make an inquiry into their own lives and behavior through the medium of writing. I'm very sorry for the suffering that Brown went through as a child and hope that writing and publishing this book was a way for her to find personal healing. It's just too bad she had to hurt so many other people in the process. In some cases this was revenge, but in other cases she was exposing innocent people who never meant her any harm to contempt and ridicule."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"\\"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India\\" is Rachel Manija Brown's enchanting chronicle of growing up in an ashram in India. In 1980, when she was 7, her hippie parents moved her with them from Los Angeles, Calif., to Ahmednagar, India, to worship a deceased Indian guru named Baba, whom they referred to as \\"God.\\" (Baba's the one who coined the phrase \\"Don't worry, be happy.\\") In Ahmednagar, she tells us, \\"the seasons consisted of Unpleasantly Hot, Unbearably Hot, and for two months every few years, Soaking Wet.\\" Her parents sent her to a Catholic school, where she was forced to endure punishment at whim from the sadistic, \\"ruler-wielding nuns.\\" Add to that the unending poverty in India and the constant dangers from the hostile environment - including king cobras - and there was plenty for a young girl to find disagreeable.Brown describes her travels with her parents around the countryside and introduces us to the eccentric disciples of Baba and their bizarre rituals. She talks about Indian religion and history and has an interesting insight into Hindu mythology. I identified with the young girl who, from a very early age, found companionship in books. In the funny coming-of-age memoir, she reveals honest feelings: \\"I took malicious pleasure in things that freaked out Mom. It was nothing personal. I would have also enjoyed things that freaked out Dad, except that nothing ever did.\\" It reads like a novel because of her easy writing style, and she often comes up with strange but lovely phrasing, as when, after a big rain, she says, \\"The air smelled of fresh water that is still but not stagnant, a green smell touched with blue.\\" She made me laugh out loud, and several times I audibly gasped at the surprising, even shocking, events.It has instantly become one of my favorite books. As soon as I?finished it, I wanted to call the author and thank her. Visit www.rachelmanijabrown.com and you can read the first chapter. Brown's account of her family's vacation at a hill station reminded me of \\"The Great Hill Stations of Asia\\" by Barbara Crossette. In that travel book, the author visited hill stations - basically, a throwback to colonial times - which are resorts built atop mountains to let the people find relief from the constant heat and humidity of the plains."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"Brown wreaks a cathartic revenge on her self-involved hippie parents in this mordant, laugh-out-loud memoir of her formative years in an ashram in India. She was a precocious seven when her parents announced they were moving from Los Angeles to backwater Ahmednagar.It was there that the guru they had been devoted to since their drugged-out Berkeley college days, Meher Baba (who Brown credits with the saying, \\"Don't worry, be happy), had established an ashram. \\"Its residents usually explained where it was by saying, \`Get on a train in Bombay, and go east for nine hours.' \\"From the start, Brown was appalled. \\"I didn't care about Baba....But I knew there was nothing I could do. There was already an envelope in Dad's dresser drawer containing three one-way tickets to India.\\" Over the next five years a deep component of sheer misery would be added to that feeling of shock and helplessness.She opens the book with an account of one of their rare vacations. The ashram \\"was located in what I had previously thought of as the most desolate place in India. But the expanse of brown-baked weeds about a hundred miles west of Ahmednagar was giving it some serious competition.\\"Stranded, Brown reads a fantasy novel while her parents squabble about whose fault it is there is no train to their mountain hotel.\\"The novel's heroine, Harry, was a foreign girl who gets kidnapped by desert nomads and learns to ride bareback and do magic.\\"Certainly I could identify with the \`kidnapped and taken to a foreign desert' part, though I wished I were enjoying my experience as much as Harry was enjoying hers. I also wished three of her magnificent desert steeds would appear, so we could ride them up the mountain.\\"Mom poked me. \`Don't just sit there with your nose in a book. Pray with me.'\\"On second thought, perhaps only one steed.\\"This pretty much sums up the family dynamic. Brown spent as much time as possible buried in a book, while her mother's response to everything was to chant, \\"Baba, Baba, Baba,\\" and her father kept clear of the fray as much as possible.Even the escape into books was made difficult. The ashram librarian was an unkempt, irascible Indian who took immediate exception to the compound's only child snooping around his tiny, dusty domain and began screaming at her to \\"Get out!\\" before they were even introduced.School was even worse. A Catholic school where Brown was the only foreigner, it had English textbooks but classes were taught in Hindi. Brown, who had been an exceptional student, was soon failing. She might have overcome the language barrier if not for the sadism of her teacher, a type (not rare enough) whose professional zeal seems focused on the opportunity to bully those who can't fight back.On her first day Brown took comfort in the thought that \\"Manija,\\" the hated name that set her apart in America, would not be a problem in India and neither would its diminutive, \\"Mani,\\" which rhymes with money. But after Mrs. Joshi introduced her to the class, she had the students open their books to a comic rhyme that poked fun at \\"Mani Mao,\\" baby talk for \\"Mrs. Cat.\\" Brown was thereafter known as Mani Mao and pelted with stones in the schoolyard and whenever spotted alone on the streets of the town.As for her name, Brown changed it to Rachel the minute she graduated high school back in America and now delivers a word of warning: \\"Parents, if you do not want your children to write tell-all memoirs when they grow up, do not name them KhrYstYll, Pebble, or Shaka Zulu.\\"The ashram itself seems primarily populated by misfits and the mentally ill, whose ranks are routinely swelled with pilgrims from America. In all her years there Brown made only one friend, a boy who stayed for some months and whose father was one of the deranged visitors. Her accounts of their role-playing adventures are the only carefree, unfettered moments in the book. The adult she most admired was, in the end, responsible for the most harrowing, disillusioning and cruel incident in her childhood.Although the life she describes is miserable, Brown herself never appears pitiable. Although resigned, she remains full of spunk and spirit, saved by her imagination. She never connected to Baba or spiritual life in general and comes across as practical, independent, driven and engaging. These qualities, along with her writing skill, came in handy at age 12 when her father left India and didn't take her with him. It took her six months of daily letters to persuade him.Brown interrupts her narrative several times, giving the reader views of her adult life (she's now an award-winning playwright and TV writer) and relations with her parents. She includes an account of her decision to confront the ashram years by writing about them, and her parents' reactions and input. This leads to a last page that is so perfectly apt it could have been fiction - but you'll know it's not.Funny, brave and sharp, Brown gives us a heroine and a writer to root for.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"Sometimes cliches come true. I simply couldn't put this book down. I had laundry to put away, chores to do, and kept saying \\"Just one more chapter.\\"I'm slightly internet acquainted with the author, so when the book came out I bought it here, to support someone I \\"know\\" -- an interesting and increasing phenomenon -- and then let it sit on the shelf for several weeks. Yesterday afternoon I picked it up as I was cleaning the house, and read the first chapter.And was riveted. Brown's eye for detail, her use of language, her humor and candour make this a pleasurable read. The circumstances she describes make it gripping. I'd cruise along, snickering at the eccentricity of the people around her, and then be stopped in my tracks, sometimes by horror at the things she and the children around her endured at school, and sometimes by the beauty she managed to find in a distinctly un-beautiful landscape.What struck me in retrospect, after reading comments here and elswhere on the net, was something I didn't really recognize as I read it, though it was in front of my eyes. Brown doesn't ridicule the people who surrounded her at the ashram, she views them with the ruthless logic of a child, and all the while looks at the adults around her with the unspoken question \\"Don't you people see that this is seriously screwy? Is it just me?\\" The question is there in the book -- Brown was clear from the start that she got that things were skewed and that the adults didn't get it -- but I didn't recognize the voice and mindset of that questioning until I thought back. Brown was a rational seven year old set down in a completely irrational situation. That she was able, twenty or so years later, to write about it with humor as well as horror is a testament to her resilience.This is an unforgettable read.

The author's childhood in remote India would be horrifying in anybody else's telling; she manages to make it both horrifying and funny. Unlike many modern memoirists, the author manages to come to some peace with her past and with her family."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"This book should be seen as part of a larger picture. I found myself incapable of reading the book as a self contained entity, but instead as a reflection of much larger issues of India, religion, culture, the publishing industry, and the memoir genre in particular. Judging from the various reviews of the book, other readers were doing the same. I feel that the spectrum of reviews going from glowing to trashing are as much a reflection of the reader's position on these other matters as they are a reflection of the quality of the book.Although I am a native Texan, (not of the same mindset as a certain ex-president), I lived for many years in India. I married there and my son was born there. From my own experiences, I found nothing remotely unusual about the incidents in the book. Everything seemed very believable and normal. However there was definitely a large degree of \\"cherry picking\\" which favoured the unpleasant and tended to neglect the positive aspects of life in India. This tended to portray her childhood as being traumatic, while I feel that in reality it was probably a very rich upbringing.Is this an indication of some deep maladjustment on the part of the author? (note the rhetorical question;-) Possibly - but not necessarily. This style has become a very marketable formula in an already troubled publishing industry. It has become so over used that it is becoming cliche. However it was still the \\"in\\" style at the time that this book was being put together.We must also remember that a book is not just the work of one writer. As the book goes from the writer to the agent, and then to the publisher, there are numerous editorial changes. At some point the author looses control of the work. One cannot help but notice that the style of the book changes in the last quarter. Although this is pure conjecture on my point, I am hazarding a guess that this change reflects editorial input designed to make the book more marketable. I am guessing that it is the first three quarters of the book which is closer to the author's original writing style. But I would love to hear from someone who is much closer to the author concerning this point.Well that is just my two bits worth.PeaceDavid Courtney"},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"As I read Rachel Brown's book it reminded me of how we took apart novels in college. If this had been discussed we would discuss how her abused mother felt drawn to, felt the need for a father figure. Is it remarkable Baba becomes her God? (A name meaning father in various languages). The mother drives away husband and daughter searching for the good father she didn't have. Religion then becomes the search for all of our inadequacies. Such high concepts in an autobiography make me feel all that discussion in school was not just BS. Overall great read, and great fun on any level."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"The memoirs that I have most enjoyed are well-written, containing elements of fiction such as a strong \\"plot,\\" which even leads to a crisis point, making it read like fiction. When I find books such as those, they trump even a good novel in my book. All the Fishes Come Home to Roost is exactly that kind of read. Rachel Munija Brown is an American misfit in India, as the subtitle proclaims. She writes about her less-than-ideal childhood, most of which was spent in an ashram (religious commune) in India. What I admire most is that the story is told for the most part without blame. She knows that it influenced who she was as a child and who she became as an adult, but she does not harbor bitterness or resentment. She tells her story in a straightforward manner, including the ups and the downs with a liberal dose of humor to lighten what would otherwise be seen as quite an unfortunate situation. It's not meant to be a tell-all, or a self-help book, or an attempt to prove what the author has overcome.One way in which I could identify with Brown was in her love of books. She grew up reading, and throughout her memoir, she is reading, and she mentions the titles of the books, and sometime the plot if it helps to further her own plot. I couldn't help but smile when she mentioned books that I have read, like Cherry Ames, Student Nurse."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"I just couldn't put the book down. I consider this one of the best books I've ever read and certainly one of the funniest. Rachel is obviously insightful as well as brilliant. I plan to buy a few more to give away as Christmas gifts."},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"The author's childhood in All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India was distinctive indeed: not only did she come of age in India, but she was the youngest resident of an Indian ashram populated by hippies and fanatics. Her memories of her childhood there are permeated not only by cultural observation of India and hippies alike, but by humorous notes on a child's-eye view of a culture we rarely get to see: hippies overseas. A fascinating memoir emerges which is hard to put down.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"All the Fishes Come Home to Roost: An American Misfit in India","review":"The author is so very descriptive that you almost participate in her childhood with her-Yikes! She has a great sense of humor that softens some of the more traumatic experiences. You laugh while at the same time thanking God/Baba/Whoever/Whatever that you did not grow up with similar experiences. She gives you great visuals of life in rural India.

My husband and I have been reading (and re-reading) Clive Cussler's novels for over 15 years. All his books contain lots of action and history. Yet, he is still able to connect all the loose ends. The hero Dirk Pitt is a man of honor and principles. He's a quick thinker with an adventurer's spirit."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Dirk Pitt is a man's man. He is the ultimate machismo. He was the Hollywood action hero before there was such a thing. Pitt is the man described in the theme song for the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The type of hero that he is has been outdated, whether wrongly or not, in our more politically correct times. It's wrong to rescue a damsel in distress now. It's wrong to be ruthless when it comes to the feelings of others. Ours is an age when we tell the truth on one hand and gently coo &quot;I'm sorry for telling the truth&quot; with the other. Pitt is a throwback to old style pulp fiction heroes and I don't see anything wrong with that.The Mediterranean Caper is the first published novel starring Dirk Pitt. It opens with an attack on Brady Air Force Base, which is located on the Greek island of Thasos. Without warning a German bi-plane identical to those used in World War I strafes the airfield, causing much damage to the facility and its aircraft. By coencidence, Dirk Pitt and his best friend, Al Giordino are flying to the base and are able to win an air battle against the attacker. The wounded bi-plane manages to fly away and disappears into thin air and so begins the mystery.Dirk Pitt is the Special Projects Director for the US National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA). What that really means is that he is a troubleshooter. When things are going wrong he is sent in to solve the problem. In this book he has been called in to investigate the sabotaging of a NUMA research ship called The First Attempt. The ship's mission is to locate and capture a fish that is considered a living fossil. Someone does not want this to happen and is sabotaging the ship's equipment. Dirk just happens to fly in as the seemingly unrelated plane attack on the base is going on.Shortly afterward, as he is lying on the beach, relaxing after all the excitement, he meets a beautiful woman named Teri. This sets up one of the more comical scenes that almost made me put down this book. As the woman warms up to Dirk she begins to reveal a little of her past. She has been in mourning for her dead husband for the better part of a decade. She starts to break down and cry. Dirk becomes so enraged by this that he slaps her across the face. I mean, he's only known for her about five minutes and he's slapping her across the face for showing weakness. Of course, instead of her running away, they make passionate love right there on the beach.It turns out that the girl's uncle is a German war veteran who basically runs the island through his business influence. Dirk is invited to dinner and the adventure really begins when he tries to ascertain whether the uncle is tied to the attack on the Air Force base. Dirk is promptly thrown into a labyrinth below his villa in pitch black dark with a ravenous dog tracking him through its depths. Will he survive to find out what the Mediterranean Caper is all about? Well, of course, there's 13 other Dirk Pitt novels. It's the getting there that's the point.Parts of the novel made me roll my eyes. Especially the slapping making love scene. Pitt tells her that her sadness is as worn out as an overcoat. There's really some cheesy metaphors and similes through the whole book. I really started to enjoy it as I realized that basically I was reading a comic book in novel form. I mean, the characters and the book were written for fun and adventure, not to spark epiphanies. The action scenes are really good and draw you in. The character depth is about that of a Dirty Harry movie, that is, practically nonexistent. At times Pitt seems very intelligent, at others very stupid. All in all, this was a fun book and I would recommend it. Hopefully, the second novel will be better."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"My names Silje, from the age of nine I have read Mr. Cussler\`s books. I love them, he is my favorite amongst Ludlum, Knootz and Christie. He writs so good, that I almost cry of exsitement. He is the best!! ( Particulary his last book, who was called Death Wave on norwegian! )"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"It's fun reading the first story. Dirk is on the edge of nasty. Plus he's cocky, horny, and not very nice. But it is a very entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This is an older boook and the writing style bears it out. My last Dirk Pitt adventure."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Clive Cussler can really spin a great tale. I wouldn't miss any of his books."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"The story was moderately interesting, but the chauvinistic attitudes of the 70s show through in Cussler's treatment of Teri, and Dirk Pitt just was not a character I warmed up to much. I remember having fonder memories of Raise the Titanic, but I read that more than 20 years ago as a teenager. Those are my only two Cussler books I've read, but I'm hoping to give a few more a whirl to see how it matures. There is promise here, it's just clearly a very early start to a writing career. The Kindle edition was fine, no gripes or complaints on formatting or ease of reading."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Another great book from Cussler with enough plot twists to hold your interest for the complete book."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"very good book to read easy to follow along with the plot. not for kids thought there are some adult situations in it. please read pacific vortex first even though mr. cussler wrote this first. pacific vortex is really the first book. there is a women they disscussed breifly in the begin that is in pacific vortex."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I PICKED THIS BOOK UP AFTER reading 4 other cussler novels. I wasn't disappointed, but this this book just doesn't grip you like the others. It is less involved and the ending was quick. A good read for a train or plane, it is short and goes quickly."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I recently read this book again for the first time in twenty years. I now realize what captivated me to read all of the Dirk Pitt novels. I have begun to read them all again. If you like action and adventure, Clive Cussler is your author and this is the book to start with."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Take it from someone who has read all the Dirk Pitt novells to date. This is by far the best, most action-packed adventure yet. If you've never read one of Clive Cusslers novells, this is also a great one to start off with."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I thought this was a very intriguing book.It fooled me until I was about a third of the way through who was the villain,.The climax was very good"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"As an avid reader of Clive Cussler novels it is always a pleasure to read a Dirk Pitt novel. The storyline and plot are inventive and believable, but Dirk Pitt actions and dialog are contrary to most other Clive Cussler novels. Case in point is his treatment of the Baron's daughter, which is crude and out of character.I checked the publication date and discovered it was 2004, several years ago. All though the book I felt as if the novel was written by someone other than Clive Cussler. Maybe it is that the main character has matured over the years."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"As a Clive Cussler fan and having Dirk Pitt as a hero this book was really good at showing some of Cussler's earlier writings and what Dirk Pitt was like back when he was younger."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"See my earlier comments. The locale and characters were first rate, but several times Cussler got too wrapped up in excessive details."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Clive Cussler needs few introductions, but here is one- I had never read any of his books but had been told good things. I am happy to say that his fans are right.This, the first Dirk Pitt story, is crisply told, full of accurate history (except some questions about a type of jet) and best of all, ends with several intricate and surprising twists.If you like action, history and mystery with a compelling prime character, all well written without an over-abundance of gore or other cheap narrative tricks, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"As usual Cussler in Mediterranean Caper keeps the reader on edge til the end . Not being a book reader in the past, I've enjoyed reading adventure books and history books."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Another reader warned us not to read this book if we had become fans of Dirk Pitt' s later works. I concur. I think I would have dismissed Cussler forthright. Sure, all of his stuff is contrived, but with a professionalism that is so much more irresistible. How could he have advanced so rapidly and corrected his later style so completely? Did he really write this one, or was he fixing a car engine while that junior high student took over?"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I kind of laugh at all the smoking that goes on in this book, but it was good. I love Clive and have read most all of Dirk's adventures. Not sure how I missed this one, but glad I found it. Short and sweet."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Clive Cussler just writes great adventure books. Some are not as strong as others but they are all great to read no matter what."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"People have shared their Clive Cussler's books with me and I have read many of them. I don't like them well enough to spend my own money. However, if I had read this one first, I would never have read another. I am old enough to well remember that being more sexist and insulting was OK with MANY men and some women, but this is just stupid and insulting: \\"he was not a man who catered to feminine wiles...loved the feel of their soft bodies...disliked subterfuge and games...little ploys it took to seduce the average woman...preferred straightforward and honest women, but there were far too few to be found.\\" Then on page 27 he meets a beautiful (of course) young woman in a modest bikini and within 3 sentences he is attempting to seduce her. Within 5-10 minutes (probably) he slaps her face (because she is mourning her late husband) and has sex with her. Of course he's doing that for her own good to help her get over her husband and get on with life! Even in 1973 if a man had slapped my face for mourning my deceased husband I would have kicked him in the genitals and walked away. What a jerk Cussler must have been to write that! There are other very disparaging comments about women in general but too many to go into details.Dirk Pitt is an egotistical, arrogant, moody, unlovable, unbelievable character. He is beat up, bleeding, exhausted to the max with no sleep and yet he goes on and on like Energizer Bunny. I finished this to see how bad it got. The story was good enough but too much garbage. Someone in that condition would know he shouldn't be diving.The other thing I dislike in books is the continual references to smoking that nothing to do with the story. In 248 pages there were 49 references to smoking. Only 1 related to the story itself. There would probably been more but with the action and impossible environments Cussler couldn't squeeze them in. Hard to smoke when you'r underwater or dressed for it. Yes, 1973.Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"love dirk pitt love clive cussler good always wins evil always looses. dirk is my husbands alter ego he loves dirk pitt books too. easy way to pass time on the airplane or on the beach."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},O={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",W,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",O,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",D,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const B=u(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-cc201162"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/19.md","filePath":"guide/19.md"}'),E={name:"guide/19.md"},j=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
