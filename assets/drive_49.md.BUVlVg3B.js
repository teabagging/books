The story is engaging, encompassing every major event and several minor events in Texas history, and the characters, mostly fictional but a few real, are vivid.Among the historical fiction, Michener manages to weave in and instruct the reader about many features of Texas life, including water rights, oil, football, the continued Spanish influence, religion, longhorns, pecans, armadillos, spring wildflowers, hurricanes, tornadoes, and blue northers. The author looks at the Texas character with its risk-taking component, and explains why Texans are inclined toward free-market economics.Michener rightly notes that many different settler groups helped make the state what it is today, with characters in the story coming from Mexico, Germany, Scotland, Michigan (I identified, having moved from Michigan to Texas in 1983), and the Deep South.\\"Texas\\" is a very long novel, and in places it does employ stereotypes that are not completely valid, but anyone who loves the state or wishes to know what makes Texas and Texans so unique would find reading this novel worthwhile."},{"Title":"Mammalabilia (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I look forward every year to Douglas Florian's latest poetic subject matter and am never disappointed!

To call it \\"primitive\\" might work, I suppose, as long as it is not a put down to the artist. The paintings are actually quite well done (I would dearly love to have some of the originals to frame for the house or office), and if you find that hard to believe, try doing one your self.

I recommend it to everybody"},{"Title":"The Great Philadelphia Fan Book","review":"I live in the Philadelphia area, but am not a native to Philadelphia. I grew up in New York and when I moved south, I adopted Philadelphia as my &quot;home metropolitian area&quot;. I have really come to appreciate and love Philadelphia as a city. There are two things I love about Philadelphia: 1) No city in America is as entrenched deep in its traditions as Philadelphia; 2) When you love the City, it will love you back twofold. When it comes to Sports, the tradition and love of the city is there among the fans. When I saw this book, I said to myself - here is the first book that explains tradition and love of the city and explains it well.The book is written by two of the most knowledgable Sports journalists in the Philadelphia region - Glen Macnow and Anthony Gargano. For several years these authors were co-hosts of a lunchtime radio show on the local sports radio station. Macnow and Gargano come from completely opposite backgrounds, but they have an incredible chemistry together. Glen Macnow is from Buffalo, NY and is a transplant to the Philadelphia region. He lives in the suburbs and sometimes has the nickname &quot;The Professor&quot; for his studius approach to Sports. Anthony Gargano is a native Philadelphian. He was born in South Philadelphia, moved out of town to cover Sports in Chicago and New York, then came back to Center City. Gargano is nicknamed &quot;The Cuz&quot; and is Philadelphia through and through. He has a less studius approach to sports and is much more from the fan perspective. The styles and backgrounds of Macnow and Gargano meshed beautifully on the radio and in this book the mesh just as well.So this book attempts to explain a lot of those traditions that exist in Philadelphia as well as chronicle the Philadelphia fans' highs and lows. What is nice about this book is it is broken down into chapters that each read like a feature article. Therefore you can pick up this book and read it at your leisure. Each chapter is devoted to a topic related to Philadelphia sports. You don't have to read the chapters in order. It also is the kind of book where you might find a topic you like and wouldn't mind reading the chapter over again. It also can even serve as a quasi-reference book for Philadelphia sports.There should be a topic for everyone in this book. Here are some of the highlights of what is covered:-Origin of the Philadelphia &quot;Boobirds&quot;-The real story behind Santa Claus getting pelted with snowballs-The Broad Street Bullies - The Philadelphia Flyers-Kate Smith - the celebrated vocalist who sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; at Flyers Games-The rivalry of Philadelphia and the Dallas Cowboys-A chapter of lists of such as &quot;Tough Guys&quot;, &quot;Classy Guys&quot;, &quot;Ugly Guys&quot;, Famous Brothers who played here, etc-The Love/Hate Relationship of Buddy Ryan-The Origins behind &quot;Wing Bowl&quot; - a Philadelphia tradition-Julius Erving-Players who Philadelphia fans loved to hate-Mike Schmidt-An interesting chapter on the Eric Lindros, Charles Barkley, and Randall Cunningham era-1993 Phillies-Embarrassing Moments in Philadelphia Sports (includes a bit on Rich Kotite's laminated playsheet getting wet)-Veterans Stadium-The Great Announcers of Philadelphia-Ed Rendell (Former Mayor of Philadelphia and Current Governor of Pennsylvania) - huge sports fan-Several Chapters on Great Philadelphia Sports MomentsThere is lots more in this book, but I would use up my limit for this review. Many of the stories of the folklore of Philadelphia sports are also embedded in these chapters and can easily be found in the index.I would have liked to have seen whole chapters dedicated to things such as the USPRO Cycling Championships (a huge Philadelphia tradition that is omitted), something on the Philadelphia phantoms (minor league hockey), and the love to hate relationship with Howard Eskin (not even mentioned). I would have liked to see chapters on Wilt Chamberlain and Joe Frazier, but these were before the author's time. In general Boxing isn't really covered much in the book, and I would have liked to see something on the 'Rocky' films. Despite these missing items, it doesn't hurt the book.This book is a winner. Whether you are a native Philadelphian, transplanted Philadelphian, adopted Philadelphian, or non Philadelphian - this book will offer something for everybody. I enjoy having it on my shelf and never get tired of reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Philadelphia Fan Book","review":"What a great book to read.

Heavy Kevy and El Wingador should never be mentioned in the same book as Wilt Chamberlain, Mike Schmidt, and Chuck Bednarik.

The only thing that I found dissapointing was the complete and total pessimism, which I should expect considering at least one of the authors worked for WIP. I understand that Philly fans are tired of losing, but sometimes (just as they do on the radio) they make it seem like Philadelphia is doomed when in fact the teams just never seem to be quite good enough. I'll stop giving my opinions on Philly sports now and let you know that if you are a Philly fan, you absolutely have to read this book. I'm 23, so i remember some of the stories such as the 93 phils, the Buddy Ryan era, and more recently the Sixers Eastern Conference Championship run. Some of the older stories were interesting for me to read as well, especially the chapter on the Broad Street Bullies."},{"Title":"The Great Philadelphia Fan Book","review":"No book has ever dared to delve so deep into the unyielding heart of a Philadelphia sports fan than The Great Philadelphia Fan Book. Anthony Gargano and Glen MacNow, staples of Philadelphia's sports radio WIP and the city's sports scene itself took on the task and produced a gritty work of art.I loved the book's humor, it's intensity, and its unflinching look at what it means to be a sports fan in Philadelphia. What it means to be a sports fan period.From Buddy Ryan to Rich Kotite; from the Broad Street Bullies to the overblown snowballing of Santa Claus incident (Which I read over and over again and laugh aloud each time), this book covers it all.This book is a Must-Have for anyone who has ever screamed their hearts out for their team.This book has it all."},{"Title":"The Great Philadelphia Fan Book","review":"As a devoted Philadelphia fan, one who only supports my favorite Philly teams, I was in the bookstore looking for gifts for some of my buds.

Somehow they pull together every one of those great philly sports moments into one great book. I recommend this for anyone's x-mas or holiday present -- male, female, young, old.

This book focuses on turn-of-the-century women's hat shapes: wide brim and shaped sweetheart brim. Author lists fabric/notion requirements and provides numerous b/w illustrations to walk you through basic hat-building technique. Geared to very basic hats, which you can put together with a home sewing machine and glue. Maybe even too basic - info hardly fills one side of each page. Trim instructions cover gathered tulle ruffles and bows, fabric roses, big bows, and ostrich plumes. I would like to see expanded trim info, principally more complex ribbon decorations, other feather types, maybe even stuffed birds and veiling. Since hats of this time period were such a huge fashion statement, I don't feel the book adequately covers the construction possibilities. But if you need to build a basic hat and don't want to take a class or buy a wood block, this is your best option. Would be perfect for the school drama department that needs to produce dozens of hats for a period production. If you're entering a costume masquerade or have ambitions toward serious millinery, you really should look for Albrizio's Classic Millinery Techniques instead."},{"Title":"The Little Hatmaking Book: A Workbook on Turn-Of-The-Century Hats","review":"It's tiny, and it's printed on one side of the page only, and it doesn't cost ANYTHING, so if you want a large-brimmed Victorian style hat, or perhaps a crownless sweetheart hat, or you think you might like to make a hat any hat and have no clue where to start, this is a good place to jump in.Given my propensity to spend $$$$ on the how-to and then not follow through, I went for this book, and it meets my needs exactly. I have the fashion fabric I want to use; BHA tells me what else I need to put it together and make a hat that looks respectable. Wouldn't have thought to put darts in the brim on my own.If and when I do make this hat, and if I decide the effort was worth it and I want more, I may well step up to the complete millenary book noted above in a different review. Until then, I'm not out much $ at all and I have massively adjusted my own \\"figure it out somehow\\" ideas about what goes into a big pretty hat."},{"Title":"The Little Hatmaking Book: A Workbook on Turn-Of-The-Century Hats","review":"There's lots of info in this little book!

That's the only positive aspect of it. The few techniques described were worthless - they actually are harder than just using correct millinery techniques.

I used Sidky's book for most of my information on Europe and found it very helplful. It was informative, well researched, well written, and well organized. It presented material in a clear manner which made it easy to understand and also helped me find which sections I needed to talk about in my essay. I also enjoyed the numerous illustrations of artwork depicting the witch-hunts/torture devices/Sabbat rites/and illustrations of medieval texts related to the witch-craze. I highly recommend this book to anyone writing a paper on the European witch-hunts from an anthropological stance, to all anthro majors and minors and anyone interested in examining a bit of dark (but fasinating) history."},{"Title":"Witchcraft. Lycanthropy. Drugs and Disease (American University Studies Series XI, Anthropology and Sociology)","review":"Sidky details all the true and horrific aspects of the European witchcraze. From the beginning to the end you will never become bored or think the book dull. Besides the written facts and charts, Sidky also encloses copies of several artworks of what people thought of witches and the devil. Everything covered is given sufficient detail and everything detailed is supported completly."},{"Title":"Witchcraft. Lycanthropy. Drugs and Disease (American University Studies Series XI, Anthropology and Sociology)","review":"If you're into everything from schizophrenia to ergot poisoning, from the black plague to the dread Malleus Maleficarum, from the &quot;thumb screws&quot; method of torture to The Devils of Loudon and demonic possession, then this is the book for you. Add to that a collection of pictures that would shock any uncouth European peasant living in the sixteenth century, and you've got the making of a most bizarre book in the most bizarre field of &quot;witchcraft studies&quot;. Here you get to see the shear ugliness of life in medieval Europe during the Inquisition up close and personal. You get to look into the mind of the &quot;witch hammerer&quot; as he singles out those members of society that alleged performed those sinister magical acts that included cannibalism, sexual contact with demons, and spreading plague and disease. Rather than arguing that &quot;witchcraft was real to the people of the time so it was real&quot; like other &quot;mentalist&quot; anthropologists in the field have done, the author condemns those who insisted on the existence of witchcraft and argues that it was used an excuse to persecute and mercilessly torture thousands. As far as lycanthropy goes, the author suggests that the mentally ill, social outcasts, and those infected with rabies may have been those persecuted as &quot;werewolves&quot;. The pictures and bizarreness of the topic alone earns the book five stars, and while there are parts of it that I'm not sure that I can agree with (for instance, the author believes that cannibalism has never been a socially acceptable practice to any great extent in any culture whatsoever) the author does an excellent job of revealing the pernicious delusions which plagued the European mind during the time."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I came of political age during the civil rights struggle here in America in the early 1960's. Part and parcel with that awakening struggle came an increased interest in the roots of the black struggle, especially in slavery times. Such intellectuals as Herbert Apteker, the Genoveses, the Foners, Harold Cruise, James Baldwin, John Hope Franklin and others, black and white, were very interested in exploring or discovering a black resistance to the conditions of slavery not apparent on any then general reading of the black experience in America. This is the place where the recently deceased William Styron and his novelistic interpretation of one aspect of that struggle- Nat Turner's Virginia slave rebellion enters the fray.No Styron is not politically correct in his appreciation of Turner or his followers. Nor are latter day Southern whites and their sympathizers who have recoiled in horror at what expansion of Turner's rebellion might have meant for the \`peculiar institution'. But being politically correct, etc. now or historically is beside the point. Slavery was brutal. Slavery brutalized whole generations of black people for a very long time. If one expects nature's noblemen and women to come out of such a process, one will be very sadly mistaken. That the white benificaries of this system were brutalized is a given. Human progress has come about through fits and starts not a seamless curve onward and upward. Nevertheless all our sympathies are with Nat and his fellow rebels.Moreover, here are some things to think about if you are not worried about your political correctness status. Outside of John Brown at Harper's Ferry Turner's rebellion represented the highest achievement of resistance to the white slaveholders in the early 19th century. Although the fight was not pretty on either side every progressive today should stand in historical solidarity with that fight. Then one will understand not only that oppression oppresses but also that the military conditions for a successful rebellion for isolated blacks in pre- Civil War American were slim. The later incorporation of 200,000 black soldiers and sailors among the Northern forces in the Civil War are a very, very profound argument that once off the plantation blacks were as capable of bravery, courage and honor as an other American. As difficult as it is, if you do not have access to the original chronicles of the Turner uprising, read this book to get a flavor of how hard the struggle for the abolition of slavery in this country was going to be."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron sheds an interesting light on the motivations of one of American history's most intriguing figures. His fictional biography of Turner seems entirely plausible, all while raising interesting questions about slave life in the early 1800s. (For instance--does Nat's unusual level of education contribute to his dissatisfaction? Nat is treated better than most slaves--what caused him to revolt?) Styron never explicitly answers these questions, but paints a broad and detailed enough portrait of the famous slave so that the reader may come to his or her own conclusions. However, what makes this book one of my favorites is the writing, plain and simple. There are some passages in this book you will read over and over (such as when Nat kills his only victim of the whole revolt--and when he watches the sun rise from his jail cell the day of his execution). The only thing detracting from this captivating effect is Styron's constant forays into explicit sexual scenes. Grrr! One or two would have been sufficient! (Otherwise, though, a wonderful book, and very deserving of the Pulitzer)."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Styron establishes himself as one of America's premier writers with this book. He skillfully develops the psychological despair of Nat Turner; a bright and intelligent man driven to madness and murder in the South of the early 19th century. Stryon's style is refreshing and engaging; he invokes empathy for our antagonist yet the reader is left with a sense of tragedy for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; and the price we have all paid for its' legacy. This is a must read for those interested in understanding our terrible past and the enduring psychological scars slavery has inflicted upon our nation."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This fictional account of Nat Turner is absolutely wonderful. He makes a wonderful protaganist and throughout the story you want him to be successful and to find happiness. I was unaware that at the time the book was released, it was panned as racist by some black writers as racist. I wish they would read it again; it is a phenomenal story. Although Nat Turner is represented as a little mentally off-balanced, he is also represented as extremely smart, extremely kind, extremely strong and talented. I am reminded of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protaganist was also a little disturbed - driven by racism and the oppression of white society. Although her protaganist isn't as thoughtful and spiritual as Nat Turner, the idea that racism and oppression inflicted such pain is there. Add to that the absolute spiritual nature and soul-searching of Styron's Nat Turner and you have the makings a one truely great novel."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This book is fiction. There are very little accounts of what actually transpire in 1831 in Southern Virginia. What the book does, is present a fairly decent account of what slave life was like in those times. Despite it being fiction, it is well researched by William Styron and is written from the perspective of Nat Turner, who lead the greatest slave rebellion in America. It was orginally praised by black leaders in this country when first released, then with underlying theme of homosexuality by slave masters, the commentary turned nasty. This is a book that is always going to generate controversy in a similar manner that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" did. Both books should be read for what they are, insights into the human condition during inhumane times."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I too, am going to have to say that many recent reviewers have said what I would say if I could express myself so eloquently. This is a powerful and beautifully written book. I had heard about it and was curious, but had no idea the impact it would have on me. As a white person I've often wondered why this degree of rage hasn't been touched on before; I've always thought I would have been consumed with it had I been treated as the blacks have been. Styron's novel will haunt you long after you finsh the book."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"With avid and unsettling detail, William Styron gives us a story that is a rich and heartbreaking look at American slavery. His Nat Turner gropes blindly for mercy and for God until finally he must try to break free from bonds that are utterly, inexcusably cruel."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"If a novel like Jakes' North And South showed an unrealistic picture of the old south, then this book is its antidote. Slavery and daily life in pre-Civil War times as it surely must have been. Telling his life story as he spends his final days in a Virginia prison waiting to be hanged, Nat Turner reveals to us his secrets and the nature of his mission from God, to free the black race and punish the sins of the white man. Because its violence is kept contained until one final moment at the book's end, it seemed more shocking and visceral to me than tales of mega-death and mayhem so common in other books that chronicle bloodshed and uprising. This novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and it earned it."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner was a great book to read. It helped relate to the history of slavery and the many horrible things that went with it. I liked Styron's use of description in this book also. One of the best points of this book is that is contains all different aspects of life including love (between Nat and Margaret) also hate between Nat and Margaret and Nat's first owner Sam Turner, it contains peace and war. Some of the events in this book are very hard to read and seem to be confusing and weird at times but as the book progresses the reader begi to see how all the connections are coming to together. The ending is also good and very touching since the reader has been with Nat his whole life. I reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This work is a must-read if you are interested in the South, slavery, and race relations. Styron's fiction is compelling. It's fiction, not history, and critics wrongly pan the work because they perceive that Styron's imagination unjustly molds &quot;facts.&quot; The novel provides readers a look at slavery through the eyes of a slave - a wonderful, mad, erudite slave. With very little historical evidence and documents to use, the author uses his vision to create a fascinating portrait of the uprising's leader, who led the only successful slave revolt in the U.S. The implications of religion and the failure of Turner's troops to take Jerusalem can be extended to today's predicament. I found the author's afterword, in this 25th Anniversary edition, particulary insightful on the reaction the book received from various critics. Styron's disappointment with critics' inabilities to distance their own personal agendas when looking at literature concurs with my own feelings about the politics of academia."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled \\"This is a racist book disguised as a work of art.\\" It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner,\\" by T.R. Gray. Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married. Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional. So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt. In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction? Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented. Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die. That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause. What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero. Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of \\"Confessions.\\" But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia. Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself. His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The book I ordered came quickly, and it was not expensive.

The fact that many Confederate apologists want the names of Turners \\"victims\\" put onto a memorial monument sails close to this joke of a book. A memorial with the names of very black man, woman child killed during slavery in the US would be closer to the truth.

As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife. William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.

I thought the book well written. It showed another facet of possible antebellum history. Styron threw in the old chestnut of a black man lusting after a white woman which made my head ache. The book opened up a complex set of moral issues for me. Who would condone murder but then who in their right mind would own another person? To juxtapose this book I'm also reading Stephen Oates' \\"Fires of Jubilee\\" which is an historical account of this same time and incident and it's helping me separate fact and fiction. I also have a copy of \\"Ten Black Writers Respond\\" on it's way. If nothing else Styron's book promotes a need to know and understand. Even if it hadn't done this for me I'd still read it because of it's literary value."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I didn't give this three stars because of the controversy around racism. It's historical fiction, fiction being the key word. And I didn't really pick up that tone from it at all. I thought it was an innovative retelling using what information we do know and filling in the blanks from there. The reason I gave it three stars is because it contained all sorts of things that I felt could have been cut from the book and it wouldn't have mattered. I almost gave up on it in the second section. I'm glad I finished it, but it was a little tough to keep interest in it."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"For me, William Styron has written the standard from which to draw the historical novel. I say draw because an historical novel is just that; a novel. But even while the reader knows this, historical novels always seem to provoke some response framed by the light of a current outlook. This is ironic because the main attraction of historical novels (at least for me) is the escapist type pleasure that is found by immersing oneself in another world and time. This is the writer's accomplishment. William Styron does this in language and in pace so artfully that his book remains on my shelf. I keep 'The Confessions of Nat Turner' for its enjoyment and inspiration."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Before I read Styron's &quot;Lie Down In Darkness&quot;, I couldn't understand the charges of racism regarding one of my favorite books, &quot;Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;. Even so, this story is great and I can't imagine how anyone could not want Nat to succeed or understand his position. The &quot;white woman infatuation&quot; charge is ridiculous in my opinion. Nat lived in the house and was treated as an equal, the woman was kind and beautiful, it would be racist to think that Nat shouldn't be attracted to her or worthy of her love. That said, the story is much greater than that side note and wonderfully written."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"It is November of 1931 and Nat Turner awaits his death in a Virginia jail cell. Nat Turner is a black slave and a preacher. He is also the only black slave to lead a group of men against their masters and accomplish what they wanted, white terror and blood shed throughout most of America.Nat Turner's confession is made under the vision he receives from God. The confession leads the jury to decide to have him hung until death. As Nat waits in his cell with his trusty sidekick Hark he begins to recall his life and of how such a truly good man went bad and the truly cruel world of slavery.Nat turner had a wonderful childhood at Turner's Mill where Samuel Turner brought Nat into his home. After realizing how bright Nat was he started to teach him to read and write. Mr. turner was a very thoughtful man who wanted to train Nat well enough that one day he could walk free. But when things change for the worse Mr. turner is forced to send Nat to Reverend Eppes's to learn more about religion.Reverend Eppes worked Nat very hard and taught him precious little about religion. Reverend Eppes did not acknowledge that Nat could do other things then work a farm but Nat still learned about the bible from the one that Turner had given him. When Reverend Eppes went back on his word and did not set Nat free he was sold to Mr. Evens and Mr. Blanding.Mr. Evens and Mr. Blanding owned a company called Evens & Blanding. This company was based on slave auctions which at once Nat was sold at to Mr. Thomas Moore. Thomas Moore recognized Nat's traits as a carpenter and often traded him out to other people. Nat usually got Sunday's off and so he would retreat to the woods where he had a sanctuary. There he had a vision from God to kill all white people. This is where the story truly begins.&lt;P... The confessions of Nat turner is a magnificent book which tells the side that we do not often see, the side of the murderer."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by William Styron (the author of Sophie&#8217;s Choice). It is based on a slave revolt in Virginia in 1831, lead by Nate Turner. Turner&#8217;s capture and confession is the basis of this book.The novel is told in a 1st person narrative and is largely the work of Styron&#8217;s imagination. While it is brilliantly written Styron does include graphic scenes of highly erotic obsessions with various white women and one of the most vivid homosexual encounters in modern literature. Probably because of these scenes Styron was savaged by many of the leading black artists of the day but the book has endured the criticism and is, in many ways, an American Classic.Slavery is an indelible stain on the fabric of American culture. It will never be washed away. Turner is an aesthetic, a religious fanatic, a brilliant, tormented misanthropic, homicidal nihilist. His band of followers slaughters 52 men, women, and children. In retribution the white slaughter 200 blacks. Turner is captured, interrogated, and executed. Instead of inspiring a region wide uprising, he is brought down by his fellow blacks fighting alongside the plantation owners.It is a difficult book to read but it is a book that really should be read."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"not in great shape but readable- the age of the paperback added to its charmIt was a gift to my son who was born the year the book won the pulitzer 1968"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron, a gifted writer outdid himself with this book. His concise detail gives us an inside view on the depth of feeling employed by the subject of this book. The book while concise and tender pulls us in as these events take place. As Mailer delves deeper into the mind of Nat Turner, we cannot help but feel a sense of the suffering this man endured and this is what gives us perspective into this tragedy as it unfolds. A compelling masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"If William Styron has done us a disservice it's that he's unleashed upon America the concept of political correctness. The backlash against this book, to a large extent, is what started it all. Some of the criticism is on-target, but much is unfair.Slaves typically have been depicted in one of two ways: as the simple-minded shuffling watermelon-eating darkie, or as the noble African struggling valiantly against the tyrannical white plantation.One depiction is overtly racist, and the secondly is unrealistically romantic (and in it's own way demeaning).What Styron gives us is \\"none of the above\\". What he tries to depict is a reality that is often overlooked or not acknowledged: that chattel slavery in the American South was a ruthlessly and crushingly effective system; so effective that throughout its history (from the 1600's through the Emancipation Proclamation) there were only two armed rebellions.Slavery was obviously a great evil; it is equally obvious that as a mechanism for suppressing the enslaved it was remarkably effective. It follows that this mechanism will have an effect on the suppressed. Chattel slavery was, in many cases, a \\"breaker of spirits\\".The depiction of the slaves in this book is not always positive. What Styron tries to show (sometimes successfully) is that slavery was a heavy weight, and that the slaves who bore this weight were not always noble. This is what many readers have found offensive, and why the book has been labeled \\"racist\\". This was not my impression (my background: I'm an African American raised in Texas.)This is a novel full of ugliness and negative characters. There is not a single fully sympathetic character in the entire book, black or white. In this way, it is an exploration of the evil of slavery.This novel is not a history lesson; and in that many readers accept the fiction as fact Styron might have done us an additional disservice. Styron himself acknowledges this in the forward of the recent addition. The controversy surrounding Confessions is not what it once was, but I'd encourage anyone who has deliberately avoided the book because they've been told it is racist to read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I have always admired Styron's bravery in handling difficult subjects. Styron is a novelist in the classic tradition, and is concerned with depth of theme and pyschological motivation--two things that are sneered at in todays academic climate. Yes, it is a problem straying into the political arena--but Styron achieves the important task of humanising Nat Turner--making him real, and not some dusty abstract fictional personage--consigned to the footnotes of History. Racism has many faces, and as I read Styron's novel, I became angrier and angrier, as the palpable, grinding and dehumanising aspects of America's slave legacy was unfolded in Nat's story. The ending was incredibly powerful. I urge people, of all creeds and colours, to read this book and keep an open mind. Styron is NOT a racist, but a HUMANIST.The story he tells has eternal relevance, and is told with integrity and great literary skill. A book should stand alone, but I hope some day that this novel is made into a film. Its story is too important to remain locked within the literary arena."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron had the misfortune to publish &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; in the late 1960s. The timing was such that Styron had the odd experience of a) being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the book and b) being shunned by many, black and white, for having had the temerity to put himself in the mind of a black slave when he himself was a white Southerner.The color of Styron's skin doesn't matter anymore than it should for anyone else. &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a brutal accounting, from Nat Turner's point of view, of the events that led up to the only long-term revolt in the disgraceful history of American slavery. We see the beginnings of Turner's musings when, as a young and extraordinarily intelligent slave, he fights mentally against his enslavement. It's when the dam bursts and he decides to fight physically that his downfall begins. There is a suggestion of perhaps not mental illness, but a messianic complex here in Styron's rendering of Turner. It works, for a character in a novel, but some readers will be taken aback by the fact that Styron makes Turner somehow mentally unstable.As with all books, the uninitiated reader wants to know: is it a good read? It is. It's propulsive and majestic and the kind of book you don't want to end. Styron handles the ending with great delicacy and restraint. &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a sustained and detailed portrait of a compelling figure in early American history. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This is one of the most moving, intense novels I've ever read. It is a fictional account of the 1830's uprising led by the slave Nat Turner in Southampton, Virginia, which culminated in the deaths of nearly seventy white men, women, and children, and Turner's own execution.The ethics of this novel are the only thing which keeps me from giving it a full five stars. I do not fully understand the controversy surrounding it. Apparently African Americans of the 60's objected to the work not simply because it was written by a white southern man, but because of the frank depictions of Nat's secret sexual desire for a white female in the story. It has been pointed out to me that many feel that this is a case of a folk hero being (deliberately?) maligned in some way by one who cannot possibly empathize with Turner (Styron being white), and while there is some merit in that arguement, I myself found the sexual aspect justified in terms of the character's development - as a fictional interpretation (although I felt it detracted somewhat from his character -and seemed a little...easy). I can see how without any empirical evidence to support the notion that Turner held this desire, it might anger some people. Yet, this is only a fictional work. If some Frenchman were to write a novel about George Washington and portray him as lusting after little boys, I could see how an American might be angered, and yet I have faith that the majority of people would shrug it off as a simple piece of fiction. Which is what this is. A brilliant, engrossing work of fiction. People seeking facts about the insurrection should not look to fiction, though admittedly there is a lot less in the way of source material beyond the actual Confessions as they exist in historical record when compared to this novel. I still feel Styron did an excellent job of extrapolating a story from a dictated (and probably heavily interpreted) confession. Sadly, no one in this world will ever know the truth of Nat Turner's early days. His history begins and ends with his Confession.Taken alone, this novel is still a very interesting read, though I'm not exactly sure if it deserved a Pulitzer Prize. If there was any book written by a white man of the sixties which DID deserve this prestigious award, it must be \`Black Like Me.' I was not around in the sixties, but I can see that this novel might have gone a long way towards fostering an understanding (at least for white people) of the horrors of chattel slavery in America.Styron's portrayal of the day to day hardships of Nat Turner's life both external and internal are extremely vivid. The characters that populate the story, both slave, free, and master, are all very human, never degenerating to the lazy stereotypes of the shiftless and abasing Stepin Fetchit or the entirely brutal Simon LeGree (though these extremes are shown to exist). No one is entirely evil and no one is entirely good, just as in reality. The internal struggles of Nat's personality are also quite well realized, as he wrestles with the question of God, and his own self-worth (and those of his people). All in all, a striking novel by a talented writer."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This is a stunningly intense and powerful novel. The novel is written as the final confession of Nat Turner following his brutally violent slave revolt of 1831. The account is fictionalized though relies heavily on historical facts for its basis.The novel is painfully tragic as Styron masterfully portrays Turner's existence within the deep south during slavery. Styron's novel is filled with many tragic ironies that mirror the strange logic of slavery and oppression. Turner is initially uplifted by the power of religion, but eventually uses the Bible and bizarre visions to justify his brutal revolt. Throughout the novel, Styron is even-keeled, never passing judgment on Turner, ultimately allowing the reader to come to his/her own conclusions. The novel is vivid and necessarily graphic in places as Styron depicts the harsh slave world where violence leads to more violence.This is an important novel to read, for it gives important insight into how history shaped American race relations. Styron caught a lot of flak for writing this book (he is Caucasian), but ultimately, I believe his detractors are closed minded. His portrayal is simply stunning, and you needn't be white or black to understand Nat Turner's plight, but merely be a human."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"It's a shame that this book has been shrouded in accusations of racism and bigotry, because it detracts from the simple fact that &quot;Nat Turner&quot; is a beautifully written, impressively narrated and horribly affecting novel. Styron's Nat is a fully realized, memorable and finely-drawn character, whose insights into slavery and human nature in general, linger long after the closing words. In the end he emerges, not so much as a hero, but as a human pushed to the brink by circumstances beyond his control. An essential read for anyone who enjoys novels which plumb the depths of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Written in 1968, Styron's &quot;Confessions&quot; delves deep intothe psychology behind Nat Turner's 1831 slave revolt. Almostunbearable in its graphic violence and Biblically-dimensionedheartbreak, the novel (for it *is* fictional) has Turnertelling the whole story in painfully honest detail. Styronneither defends Turner nor paints him as crazy; he is lessinterested in pointing out right or wrong than in trying tounderstand the broad ironies of the system of slavery and itseffects on the people who ran it and were subject to it.Styron's Nat Turner is a man who is both educated and destroyedby his masters; he is both uplifted and misled by the Bible.His hatred is not fueled by the hatred of whites, but by thepity of whites. And when he kills, he is only able to commitone physical murder, though he takes responsibility for 60.The book is often painful to read, especially for one whomight think that race relations today have little to do with19th-century slavery. But in its wealth of detail and itsability to enter into the mind of a complex and criminal mind,it is unique, and should be required reading for everyself-termed patriotic American."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"There is much to be said about this novel apart from the wrongly alleged &quot;subtle&quot; or &quot;open&quot; racism of its author, William Styron, a rare writer with the dark-red conscience necessary to firmly seat himself in the civil uneasy chair of revisionist sensitive-history. A brief overview of his work in both fiction and memoir shows civil rights to be a cornerstone of his thematic untertaking; thematic material that, for the most part, anglo writers either ignore or address tentatively with small equanimity. One senses, not only in Styron's work, but in his selection of narrative, a deep, vengeful need to understand a psychology and a violence that seems humanly irreconcilable. And of course it is not; Styron's, like any useful imagination, is boundless and capable of understanding all human action, no matter how sinister. Styron must have known many decades ago that what we are for any reason afraid to address satisfactorily will continue in a more destructive form in time. What better hero then, than Nat Turner? It is clear that Styron had as little choice whether or not to address this subject as Nat Turner had to address his situation all those years ago, and for precisely the same reason, to change it."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I just finished this profound, beautiful, satisfying novel by William Styron, which won the 1968 Pulitzer Prize. In 1831 Nat Turner, a Virginia slave and preacher, led the only sustained, effective slave revolt in American history, yet few records of the event offer much detail. The only one! After years of solemn, secret planning, into which the reader is methodically and eagerly enlisted, over the course of two days Nat and some 75 followers rampaged the countryside, laying waste to 55 white souls of all ages, including women and babies, before they were caught and, of course, hanged. Fifty-five cold-blooded murders plus dozens of wounded makes Charles Manson look like Martha Stewart. Styron attempts to penetrate the mind of Turner to uncover his motive and psychology and succeeds to a considerable degree, in my opinion.The book is told in first person, most of it directly by the chained Nat awaiting execution in his cold, dank cell, the rest of it summarized in dialogue with his lawyer, a neat way to get across a lot of plot points in a hurry while maintaining scene and drama. Story begins with a vision Nat has of an inscrutable, white building high on a sea cliff -- his version of freedom and glory (he has never seen the sea). Then back to the cell, and we get what happened in dialogue with his lawyer, a befuddled white man assigned to the case. The second part of the book retraces Nat's remarkable life story in recollections, slowly, gorgeously laying the groundwork for his religious convictions that lead to his plan to plunder the countryside that has served as the backdrop for the unspeakable horrors endured by his fellow slaves. Particularly effective is Styron's use of Old Testament martyrs and prophets who rose up against the Egyptians and whose fiery rhetoric lights a blaze in Nat's mind that cannot be put out. This leads right up to the climax, which the reader has been prepared for and can't wait to read, and the scene where he storms his master's bedroom does not disappoint. The deneoument brings us back to Nat's final meeting with his lawyer on the morning of his execution and his bidding goodbye to his last living comrade, led past Nat's cell, crying out that it will be all right, that it's \\"nuthin'!\\" The hangmen's call from behind the door to \\"Come!\\" becomes in Nat's mind the voice of the Lord at last, the Lord who has, for years, abandoned him and tested his will by His silence. Nat's vision of the mysterious white building on the hill becomes a metaphor for the peace of the finally imminent Afterlife.Interesting how Nat's retrospective first-person prose is simply scrumptious, lavish, almost insanely wonderful, but when he speaks, his words come out in the same impoverished dialect as the other slave characters. No excuse or explanation is given for this discrepancy -- a reminder of just how much you can get away with provided you set the standard from the get-go and never look back. Styron's prose, which I had only encountered once before, in his terrific novella The Long March, is what I would call transparent. Clear, perfect, to be devoured compulsively as you think \\"he can't possibly keep this up\\" and he does. When I read Styron's natural kinsmen such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Cheever, Richard Yates, I think as I read, \\"Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he clearly knows it,\\" but when reading this book, I found myself thinking, \\"Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he's sparing the reader the hint of his own swaggering ego to boot.\\" Hence, tranparency. The lily rendered as it is, no gilding required. Hence, my excitement upon emerging from this book is partly the prospect of his other novels, waiting for me in used bookstores and eBay auctions and garage sales.Styron took a lot of heat for his matter-of-fact treatment of Nat's character, mainly from black leaders who denounced it as perpetuating the stereotype of the sex-obsessed, violent black man. Maybe they had a point. It was 1968 after all. Then again, Nat's natural development, morally and sexually, was so warped and twisted by even the mundane practical restraints of slavery, as to supply reason enough for me. And the man presided over such unprecedented and widespread carnage -- it must be remembered that he was a mass murderer, no matter his skin color. Yet, amazingly, and probably significantly, Nat himself committed just a single murder -- that of a white girl whose beauty and sincere kindness toward him somehow overboiled his frustrated rage more than all the cruelty of his various masters and their surrogates. Finally, though, and most important to a writer, Nat is written with such humanity and compassion and courage and honesty and wit that, in the usual sense, it hardly matters what he did -- the reader is with him till the end. \\"Write unlikeable characters,\\" my writing teacher Ethan Canin told us. \\"The reader will always like them.\\" James Baldwin had his own take on the book when it came out: \\"He [Styron] has begun the common history -- ours.\\" Achieving a common history is something another writing teacher of mine, James Alan McPherson, often said should be the goal: \\"We must develop what Ralph Ellison called the omni-American sensibility.\\" Jim also once said, \\"There should be no limits whatever to the writer's imagination.\\" Amen!"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Have you ever wanted to say something and then discovered that someone else has said it first and better than you would have? Well, that was my experience upon reading the review written by Christopher Smith at the top of the readers' reviews section.So, rather than re-hash what has already been ably stated, I will add a few more thoughts of my own.The controversy over Styron's portrayal of Nat Turner would not be nearly as furious if not for the sheer power of Styron's writing. He drags you into Turner's tortured mind and you can feel Turner's anger, rage and lust. In my case, it pulled me in so tightly during some scenes that the rest of the world was lost to me. All was a breathless rush until that little piece of this tragedy was over and I was able to breathe again.

As well as false, misleading and uninformative. \\"Confessions,' for example, was published in 1967, amidst controversy and social ferment. I was at Merritt College with some of the Black Panthers, and the novel was a famous part of our Poli Sci curriculum.Mind you, no one had ever written, especially in such a frank and graphic manner, about this famously violent slave uprising--and from the slave's imagined point of view. That was the heart of the scandal .... never mind that Styron was white.Of course, this was back when a novel could and did have this kind of social impact.Back when we Read Books."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I was fascinated by William Styron's book;it is undoubtedly a great book by a great writer. I agree with Styron that Nat Turner suffered from a delusion. He went through the four steps described in \\"The Psychology of Delusion\\" written by the Zuks and published in 2005. Styron's book is an application of art to history.Although criticized by some as \\"racist\\",it is essentially a psychological study fully in conformity with the theory of delusion espoused by the Zuks in their recent publication."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Then again, the whole subject of slavery is disturbing. This was a far more interesting read than I thought it would be. Styron's book is well paced and well written enough to keep you turning page after page. Wouldn't recommend it for young kids, though, for some subject matter. I'd wait until late high school or thereabouts to recommend it for reading."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Whilst I would not disagree with other reviewers who admire this novel, I would point out that there is a little-known collection of essays by black writers and black activists about Styron's novel.The theme of these essays is that Styron, a guilty white liberal, has &quot;stolen&quot; Nat Turner from the negroes, and, by perverting the historical facts for the sake of his Pulitzer prize-winner, has turned a great figure into an indecisive, vacillating and sexually ambivalent creation (as a Jew, I feel the same way when Anne Frank's diary is revised by those seeking to &quot;dilute&quot; the experience of the holocaust).Perhaps their greatest criticism of Styron's blacks is that they are portrayed as docile, imbecilic animals, a comforting fiction for guilty liberals who cannot understand why or how the slaves revolted.In the final analysis, it may be the case that only blacks have access to the authentic slave experience - and therefore, as some of the critics state, Nat Turner is still waiting for one of his brothers to write his biography.&quot;What is the price of experience? Can men buy it for a song, or wisdom for a dance in the streets? No! It is bought with the price of all that man has. His house, his wife, his children.&quot; (Blake)"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I have not read Styron's novel yet, but I plan to. It has got to be interesting. It has got to be interesting to read the point of view of someone that has experienced mental illness describing a historic figure that reveals all the signs of psychosis. If you investigate the history of Nat Turner you will note that it is limited, but that he is described as a man having scars on multiple parts of his body. So his life in slavery was not as wonderful as history would have you to believe. Yet most information I have read state that his life was \\"okay\\", I guess okay considering other slaves. Not to justify mass murder but considering what the life he lived and that he probably also had schizophrenia ..it is not too far to believe the story. So it has to be interesting to read Stryron's novel, only someone that has seen the isolation of mental illness would be able to interpret it."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Most modern readers won't be taken in by Styron's subtle and sometimes open racism, but besides that this is a decent narrative.

Nat himself especially is well-developed and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Any experience can be colored by prior expectations - as was mine. I bought the book on a whim - without reading any reviews or talking to friends about it. And I suppose I was expecting a tale of hope and revolution, a story about a young man truly believing that only violent rebellion could help his people. What I got instead was a grossly pessimistic bit of story that turned a truly inspirational figure in black history into the largest \\"darky\\" hater around! (I'd like to note here that Nat Turner is not revered because he caused the deaths of so many people, but because he fought back. It's torture to sit through countless slave stories and watch black people endure terrible torture all the while screaming \\"Just shoot him and run!!\\" without any real hope for their relief.) Any heroic features that Nat Turner holds for the black community are swiftly wiped away in this book and replaced with an infuriating man who kinda sucks.I read another review on Amazon in which the reviewer felt that the story was moving and the fictional imaginings justified. I'd have to agree. Its a hard argument to say that an imagined story isn't enough like what you yourself had imagined. But I will say that the book deals a pretty low blow to a black icon. If it was The Confessions of [some random human] I would simply not like the character and move on. But to take an iconic black figure and imagine him as the crappy dude in this book speaks to the authors ideas about black masculinity, slave mentality and black community. And I don't get the impression that he thinks very highly of any of them.I'm throwing the book out."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Is there another book or novel about Nat Turner? I can see why many blacks were disturbed about this novel. Styron took many liberties with Turner's character - especially with his &quot;infatuation&quot; for a white woman. I'm not saying that there are black men who are attracted to white women and vice versa, but does he know for a fact that Turner was actually infatuation with one?"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"For me this was an unsatisfying read. Many pages might have been edited from this novel and very little would have been lost. It became a tedious read. The novel is an attempt by a mid 20th century white man to penetrate the psyche of a early 19th century black slave. Many times this didn't work. That fact challenged the story's credibility early on. I can understand why this novel infuriated much of the black community especially in the 1960's when it was first published. There seems to be a certain overreaching and perhaps unintended arrogance about it."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The 1992 Vintage edition of \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" has an afterword by the author that could be called \\"The Confessions of William Styron.\\" Here, Styron responds to the criticisms that have plagued his novel about Nat Turner, the rebel slave who in 1831 instigated an insurrection that resulted in the murders of fifty-five white people, since its initial publication in 1967. Is Styron's novel the mature, scholarly work of a man who is genuinely fascinated with an ugly historical incident in his homeland (the Tidewater region of southeastern Virginia), or just an iconic relic of the Civil Rights era? Styron would insist on the former, but posterity may judge it to be the latter.Intentionally or not, the novel is certainly a magnet for controversy simply because so few facts are known about Nat Turner's life, which required Styron to fill in the blanks with as many fictional elements as he could imagine; and many readers, perhaps misunderstanding Styron's agenda, are liable to dispute and even attack the fictional material for various reasons. Since this is not a biography, Styron was violating no ethical taboos by employing artistic license where he saw fit.The novel begins with Turner sitting in a jail cell awaiting trial for his bloody crimes and delivering to his lawyer, Thomas Gray, what will be recorded in history as his \\"confessions.\\" Speaking his bilious, violent words with precision, insight, and erudition, Nat tells the story of his life in a series of flashbacks, beginning with his childhood at the plantation of a wealthy miller named Samuel Turner, where his mother was a cook and therefore enjoyed a few more privileges than did most of the other slaves. Nat was a bright boy who, when he demonstrated a desire to learn how to read, was taught the Bible by Samuel Turner's wife and daughter. When financial ruin befell the Turner family, Nat was sold to a variety of owners until he finally came into the possession of a wheelwright named Joseph Travis.As a sincerely devout man who strove to suppress his lust and remain celibate, and as probably the only literate black man in the county, Nat became a preacher to the other slaves, who were granted some liberties on Sundays but were not allowed to assemble. The hatred he had been nursing towards white people culminated on a day he received a divine vision to kill them all, to assume the role of a murderous Moses leading his people out of bondage to the promised land. While his friend and closest associate, Hark, enlisted as many slaves as possible for a revolt, he devised plans for the most merciless of massacres that succeeded to the extent that any white Southern sentiment for abolition was consequently cooled for the time being.Styron is a meticulous, highly disciplined prose artist who writes novels that are compellingly readable and filled with savory details but somehow fail to substantiate themselves beyond the surface. The compensation for this in \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" is the selection of a loaded and endlessly discussable topic: Is a man born in chains and consigned to die in chains to be blamed if he attacks his captor in anger? Turner, in Styron's eyes, would justify the murders as evil for evil, contending that the damage done to blacks by whites is irreparable and the only remaining option is destruction. Styron calls Nat Turner a psychopath, yet composes a portrait of him that is tense but controlled and, in its thematic denunciation of slavery, roundly empathic."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The thing about Styron I admire is his astonishing talent for prose and description. I don't get the sense that he is much appreciated for his technical prowess, but he should be. If only critics will realize that great art is first brilliant craftsmanship, I think the quality of literature, in general, would be much higher. The things I liked about this book are the vivid descriptions of plantation and rural life (you could almost smell the soap on Margaret Whitehead's skin), the often hilarious speech, the shocking violence, and the staggering hypocrisy of the people of the American South with regards to chattel slavery. The biggest thing I did not like about this book (also with Sophie's Choice) is the clipped, elliptical narrative. It was often confusing to follow. I believe &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; would have been a more powerful book if its storyline had been linear. But in the end, this is a great book. Much better than Sophie's Choice in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"First, anyone coming to this book for the first time should not read it as an historical treatise, because it isn't. So far as is known, Nat Turner didn't display homosexual propensities, as he does in this book. The historical Turner was married; Styron's protagonist is not. Indeed, beyond his homosexual liaison with a fellow slave, he goes through life in Styron's historical novel as a celibate, lusting after nubile white girls when not plotting his apolcalyptic war against the white race. This was an issue that caused great controversy when the book first came out. It may still bother the historical purist. To others, this might be seen as a minor point. After all, Shakespeare wasn't above changing historical facts to make a more engrossing, dramatic play. There are those even today who assert the Bard unfairly maligned Richard the Third. For those wanting to read a Nat Turner biography, they should try Stephen Oates' \\"Fires of Jubilee.\\" Having said all this, Styron's book remains one of the great American historical novels. Writers at their very best perform a sort of alchemy and Styron has always been adept at this, evoking a time and place long gone with a vivid wizardry and authenticity that is wonderful, even though he often writes about the most tragic of events (for example, his novel \\"Sophie's Choice\\" deals with the Holocaust). And, despite Styron's artistic license with certain aspects of the 1831 slave rebellion, this is a powerful story, populated with unforgettable characters, and a part of our American history that I think everyone should study and be aware of. To some, Nat Turner was a hero. To others, he was a demented murderer. Whatever your viewpoint, Styron is one of America's great writers and this is a book that should be read by anyone who is interested in where we have been as a country and apprehensive about where we are headed. Some of the issues inherent in Turner's story, and the story of those who followed him to their bitter doom, are as germane today as they were in 1831."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"NAT TURNER This one moved me through the story of Nat Turner's life. Nat Turner led an unsuccessful revolt in southern Virginia in 1831. His confessions before hanging were recorded by his appointed attorney. So in writing NAT TURNER, Frazier uses this document as his blueprint to fill out the life of Nat Turner.I was deeply moved (and stirred) by the detail into the childhood (which I know is very freely created by the author, historical documents lacking). But the fact that at some point Nat Turner was taught to read by one of his owners and the fact that he could read and was set upon the Bible, which Nat (who had become a preacher among his fellow slaves) used as his own blueprint and justification for why the slaves must rise up and destroy their owners at all costs.The rebellion lead to the deaths of 50-some whites over the course of about three days. The rebellion was put down, fell apart, whatever. At its peak, Nat had enlisted approximately 75 slaves to his cause. His surprise came in how disorganized everything became as more slaves enlisted, and how at many of the attacks, the slaves of the houses instead of joining the rebellion, actually came to attack Nat's army and defend their owners.It's a powerful glimpse at an event which precedes the Civil War, and has been relegated to a quiet (and the book to a somewhat scorned) position in history, although its effects on slave owners everywhere as word spread about the uprising, must have had its own powerful undermining effect. How well could many slave owners sleep afterward, knowing that their slaves - once considered docile and subservient - might take them and cut them open in their sleep?I wonder..."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Many customers are saying this book helps you look at slavery differently. I agree. William Styron shows not only the pain and suffering of Nat Turner (more or less an average slave), but it also tells what kind of decisions a slave really made.You get paid pennies a week for the grueling work you are doing. In a few years you can buy your freedom and start a life for yourself, maybe a life in a humble cabin built by your own hands, a life full of racism, but a life non the less. At this point you would happy with whatever you could get. Or, there is the decision of revolting. With enough support you could overrun your owner and escape to the North. Unfortunately, that is a very dangerous proposition.William Styron tells the life of this religious slave in the early 19th centurey and why he did what he did. Many people would agree it is stupid to revolt. On the other hand, many say they would make the same decision, &quot;Give me Liberty or give me death.&quot; Nat Turner's revolt was debateably the only successful revolt. After Nat was made an example and hung, however, the revolt only caused a negative effect on slavery laws and caused other slave owners around the country to tighten their grip."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Any of us with a decent American History teacher first learned about Nat Turner in the 8th grade. If you're a part of the New York State Regents program you learned it again during the 12th grade. But so little is actually known about Nat Turner, short of the confession he \\"dictated\\" to attorney T.R. Gray on 5 November 1831 in his unheated, open to the elements jail cell. We also know of the personal witness accounts of his execution, including a posthumous article in The Southampton Insurrection by a writer named Drewry that said:\\"The bodies of those executed, with one exception, were buried in a decent and becoming manner. That of Nat Turner was delivered to the doctors, who skinned it and made grease of the flesh. Mr. R.S. Barham's father owned a money purse made of his hide. His skeleton was for many years in the possession of Dr. Massenberg, but has since been misplaced.\\"These are the facts we're given in William Styron's 1966 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\". There are so few books in print that have had the ability to bring water to my eyes. Perhaps no more than four in total. William Styron is responsible for two: this one and Sophie's Choice.Nat Turner's Confession is two fold. The first of course is literal and pertains to the God-driven war he executed against the dominant white man from his place of bondage. Mr. Styron's is very open about how he took remarkable license with actual facts, but the truth is that so many of the events he has given us in this book- all in first person and most in remembrance since the entire book takes place during the four days before Turner's execution at the gallows in the small town of Jerusalem, Virginia, but there's much here we haven't studied about, seen pictures of and certainly nothing here that is remotely worse than modern day treatment of our current sub-cultures (of which African Americans remain one.) It is not at all possible that in the some 8 million slaves who lived and died in America, that every single event of this book didn't happen somewhere to some0one. And as survivors of the Holocaust have said about Spielberg's shocking film, \\"Schindler's List\\" it isn't even 10% of how awful it really was.Perhaps the greatest injustice to Nat Turner was for his first Master to teach him to read , write and do math. Then, the Master's neice gave Nat his own Bible and began to teach him the word of the Lord. As a young \\"pickani**y\\" he was brought out for company and made to perform: \\"Go ahead. Ask \`im to spell somethin'. Nothin' easy neither- give \`im a hard word.\\" The boy grew up knowing that he was special because he was the only slave on that plantation- or any after it- who could read write and reason. Turner was a man and one of his greatest sins was that of Pride, a sin for which he went to his death carrying fear and doubt. Each of his visits from God could be explained biophysically- one after a five day fast, awakening to a full eclipse of the sun, the vision of the morning star on the day of his execution. These were enough for Turner- or just enough - because in addition, he heard the voice of God telling him that like the Jews out of Egypt the Blacks needed to be freed from the whites. Indeed, even the kindest abolitionists brought about hatred inside Nat Turner- a man who (at least in this book) chose to die chaste. Styron is very subtle about this but he manages to suggest that Nat Turner is a prophet as was Christ and Moses. The similarities are small, but they're everywhere. But Styron's Nat Turner is also sickened and embarrassed by the \\"nigg#rs\\" (as Turner calls them) who play dumb for the Massah, who ARE dumb, ignorant, foolishly chasing sex and apple wine or brandy. This, despite the fact that Turner himself modifies his speech patterns and accent around the white people but we gather that Nat Turner believes that the others are not in fact performing as they behave and speak in this way even when nary a white man is around, whose eyes he never meets, It is just such an act of indignation (a white slave owner forces to black slaves to fight each other and a crowd of black men- bond and free - cheer) that first causes Turner to stand up and admonish these men to take pride. He thus becomes known as the Reverend.Still, between the foolish bumbling of the slaves and the white skin of all others, Nat Turner feels hatred: Another sin.Perhaps the greatest element is the sin of doubt, since Turner was very sure of his mission until the very day it began. A wide-spread mass murder that would cost the lives of nearly two hundred people that began with Nat freezing up- out of fasting exhaustion or of doubt. Nat Turner was the very last execution to occur so he was, fiction and non-fiction, more than aware of the price that some sixty odd black men involved in this mass execution paid, to say nothing of the more than one hundred white deaths, some of them children from infancy to age thirteen, were to suffer at his hand.The strongest element of Styron's book is that upon careful thought we are forced to look upon the bottom line: birthright. As it has always been. In 1966, Styron's book won the Pulitzer in the midst of the National Civil Rights Movement (the first). As we think of the white two year old who died by the hatchet blow of one of Turner's men and think anything other than his death was caused by a miracle of birth? And Nat himself, as a very young boy, was forced to watch his mother raped by a white visitor at the plantation simply because of how he was born? The mind can continue on thinking: A white man in America is, by birth, the luckiest person on the planet, a white woman in America is second- though only slightly higher than a black man in America. A Jewish child born in Poland in 1930 was no more lucky than a Jewish Child born in 4145BC. A black man born in the Congo from any time in history right up to this writing is incredibly unlucky.Birthright. Birthwrong. And a million stories that exist as a result. It is hard to draw the line between fiction and non-fiction. If you want to live through reading in the time period here through non-fiction, then read Elizabeth Dowling Taylor's recently published A Slave In The White House which not only outlines the same domesticity for both skin colors but even touches upon Nat Turner. The difference is that a story that is told well is remarkably rare. And William Styron, the generation between Faulkner, Hemingway, Steinbeck and Irving, Lamb and Kingsolver has written a book well worthy of study. Do not read it fast. Treat yourself to some self- education. Rest in between sections and when you find yourself breathless, put the book down instead of turning pages ahead to see how long before there is a break of some kind- a literary park bench on which to rest- because writers like Styron are rare and books like The Confessions of Nat Turner even more rare.Rarer still is a reader who does the book justice. This book is just as relevant today as it was in 1966. A pity? Yes. At the same time, it was just as relevant in 4145BC and that too is a pity. Things aren't better. Yes, we have a black person, but I've heard him called a \\"nig#er\\" by more than a half dozen people- one in writing. My daughter is a white woman who is married to a black man and not only do the whites in her town brandish them with words of hate but so do the blacks.My first submission of this review was returned as \\"unpublishable\\" because it did not make the computer scan for obscenities. To me, the act of hatred is far more obscene than the word nig#ger in quotation marks.There are many reasons for all of you to read this book. Joy. Appreciation of art. Responsibility. There but for the Grace of God. History. Thinking. Future. Many more reasons. And if that isn't enough, simply because this is one of the four most powerful books ever written. Even if you read this back in the 70's, it's well worth picking up again. Aftrer all, you're 45 years older now."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This is an extremely controversial book. Before one comments on racism, it seems best to explain who you are. I am a caucasian male who would be classified as liberal. I acknowledge that, from my perspective, I don't always see racism or feel it in the same way as many minorities do. As with anyone, I can only view things from my perspective.I found this book to be beautifully written, heartbreaking and with many layers.As a previous reviewer wrote, this was a book where no character was portrayed as fully good or fully bad.Nat Turner was highly intelligent and his rage and actions were understandable given the horrific injustice of slavery. I think his portrayal was complex and sympathetic. I felt I understood why a man exposed to what he had been exposed to and treated as chattel would act as he did. I was horrified by some of the choices to kill children but again I can't say how I would act in his situation.This is a very hard hitting, disturbing work and I admire it tremendously. A point that is made very clearly is that slaveowners were different. Some were sympathetic and some were abusive. In the end, their characteristics did not save them. They were all slaveowners and were targets of the uprising. There were no good slaveowners and I like that this point was made.There is a segment where Turner lusts for a young white girl and some believe that this is a demonstration of racism in that it propagates the idea that all black men want white women. I think it is a lot more complex than that. As Styron writes in his afterword, Turner only killed one person personally and it was a young girl who he likely knew. Styron invented a story to connect the two and it made for a very powerful scene when Turner kills her.Whether you think this is racist or not, I'd encourage you to read it.I think it's an absolute masterpiece and viewing it as racist seems a very twisted interpretation."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Upon it's publication, William Styron's \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" was hailed by The New York Times as \\"a triumph\\", and described as \\"the most profound fictional treatment of slavery in our literature\\" by The New Republic. Despite these and other glowing reviews, the book was also denounced as racist garbage which perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about African-Americans - particularly the stereotype of the sexual aggressive black male.I will talk more about this in a moment, but first I would like to say that I did not find anything racist about this novel. I found it instead to be a raw, brutal, yet strangely beautiful, work about the horror and injustice of slavery. While there are several scenes of physical brutality and deprivation between masters and slaves in this novel, Styron, through the voice of Nat, focuses more on the grinding psychological and emotional toll of slavery. Even in Virginia, the setting of the novel, where the condition of the average slave was considered \\"not that bad\\" by the standards of the time, the soul-crushing, mind-annihilating condition of being human chattel was an overwhelming burden. Nat's description of this sort of \\"life\\", and his fiery rage at the white characters of this novel are truly terrifying and unforgettable.Nat himself is portrayed as a complex and (usually) sympathetic character. He is neither a zealot or a mad-man or a one-dimensional symbol. Styron notably leaves out some of the known biographic details of Turner in his narrative - Turner's wife and child, for example - perhaps in order to develop (the fictional) Nat's inner-conflicts regarding love, hate, sexuality and sanctity, all of which are central to the novel. To return to the above-mentioned allegations of racism, it will not give too much away to reveal that Nat at one point fantasizes about raping a white woman after she reveals her own vulnerability to him and several other slaves. I saw this, and similar scenes, not as a stereotypical portrayal of uncontrollable, animal lust (a la \\"Gone with the Wind\\") but rather as a symptom of mental and emotional confusion/frustration stemming from a cruel lifetime of hatred, betrayal and deprivation. Other, perhaps less \\"self aware\\", black characters I believe are similarly meant to be viewed as products of their environments. This was my interpretation of the more controversial aspects of the novel, and I hope that other readers will not have their views towards an entire race of people diminished or altered by scenes which, I believe, are meant to shock the reader into a deeper understanding of the iniquities of human bondage.This is a deeply haunting work of fiction (and I emphasize the word fiction, as other reviewers before me have) and one that will be hard to forget. Read this with an open mind (and a copy of the historical accounts of Turner's revolt near at hand) and hopefully you were be brought to a deeper understanding not only of slavery and early American history, but also the strength and frailty of the human soul."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I read this book for my book club and I thought it was beautifully written. It has stayed with me for weeks now. I love when a book does that. I'm glad I wasn't swayed by controversy. I had no problem with the fact that the author was white and using a black voice(maybe because I'm white - but I do like when an author gets the voice right and I thought Styron did that). I didn't understand the charges of racism after reading the book. Sometimes I wonder if, what some people find uncomfortable, they label as racist or sexist or whatever. Anyway, I would encourage everyone to read this book because it gave me a fresh awareness of a huge part of U.S. history, it reminded me that there are always gray areas to consider and it was a great novel. You might think so too."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This book is captivating. Its reflection on a history that too many people have forgotten (or at the very least pretend happened longer ago than it did) is something that people should be required to recollect. The perspective that Styron gives through the eyes of slave revolt leader Nat Turner is chilling- regardless of to what degree it reflects the &quot;real&quot; perspective of Turner. The truth is that we have no idea how closely it resembles Turner's perspective. But to have perhaps been given a glimpse of such an interesting piece of American history is something to not be missed.If you do nothing else, pick up this book and read the first two paragraphs of Part III (Study War). Not only is it an excellent example of Styron's ability to write gracefully, but the content left me speechless. It is beautiful and frightening and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"When I got the book I thought is was a true diary of Nat Turner, then when I got to the end it wrote about speculation of whether or not even his confession was true. However the book was interesting and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The maxim in writing is to write about a topic which you know: this author violated that principle when he chose to write in the first person singular the view of a black man who lived in the south (Virginia) about 100 years prior to the white author's experience in North Carolina.Yet, knowledge can be gathered. A Davidson/Duke-educated liberal arts major made a great, if not titanic-sized, effort to be \\"real\\" when delivering to us what Nat would have seen in the early 19th century. And, that effort was well received with a Pulitzer Prize - probably the highest acclamation this author perceived in recognition of his craft.But, sometimes the well educated writer cannot leave the typewritten page and his vocabulary transcends into the dialogue or thought passages of the uneducated but bright eponymous protagonist. For instance, would a slave of the 1830's use these words in everyday language?: sedulous, caparisoned, bruited, analphabetic, empyrean, and many others. I know he read the Bible front to back. I know he memorized many passages of the Bible. And, this education occurred later in life, without much help, and probably with a very limited access to a dictionary - thereby making many passages of the Bible readable for phonetic fun - but not necessarily understood prose.What is important is that we know this murderer is a good man. What led to the revolt which is the focus of the book is more important than the revolt itself. By the time you have followed his 20th birthday, you realize he is the victim of not only slavery--but of capitalistic greed and false representation which make acceptance of future white person's promises everything false.Only one person in the book speaks to him as an equal and ultimately as a mentor. A young pretty girl says about black people , \\"I happen to know that where I live n Southampton my mother hires a darky slave who is almost as intelligent and refined and clean and religious and profoundly understanding of the Bible as Doctor Simpson (the local preacher) .\\" That was her description of Nat Turner.In the end that girl dies, as does Nat. And, about 50 white and 50 black people - most of them innocents. A bad stewing insensitively ordained lifestyle centering upon slavery was the cause of the horrible result. That was well delivered by this author. Very well delivered."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Employing one of the ugliest chapters in American history, William Styron created something in \\"The Confessions Of Nat Turner\\" that transcends racial and political boundaries even as it defines them. It is a haunting rumination on the sadness of the human condition.Nat Turner is a slave in Virginia in the early 1830s. All his life he has been better off than most slaves, sometimes even comfortable, to the point where he once looked down on his fellow blacks. But slowly he changes, a moment crystallized when a master promises Nat his freedom while a coffle of slaves en route to Georgia pass by. Nat's reading of the Bible enforces a calling he hears to serve God by freeing his fellow men. It's a calling that will leave hundreds dead, and Nat a broken, self-questioning man in his cell awaiting execution.A magnet for controversy since its 1967 publication, \\"Confessions\\" is a white secular liberal's take on a black religious zealot's life a century-and-change later. As many reviewers here point out, it's not meant as history but fiction. Turner himself is something of a mystery to historians, his only words come down to us through the writings of his oppressors. Styron wasn't writing here to fill a hole, however; he wants to employ Turner in a different cause than Turner's own, to examine how one might find meaning in a meaningless existence full of strife and injustice. Once you go with that, rather than fight it as a vision perhaps different from yours or the historic record, \\"Confessions\\" becomes a helluva ride.A central riddle of the story is why the rebellion happened where it did. Virginia in the 1830s was a far milder place for slaves than was the Deep South. Styron portrays Jerusalem, where Turner led the slaves to not just rise up but indiscriminately slay every white, as almost pleasant. The greatest harm done Nat by a white is by a well-meaning owner who simply doesn't follow through on his good intentions. Styron's point, I think, is this: It's not the individuals but the institution itself that brings the wrath of centuries down upon man, woman, and babe alike.\\"Does it seem a hopeless paradox that the less toilsome became the circumstances of my life the more I ached to escape it?\\" Turner asks us, his silent audience in his cell. \\"That the more tolerable and human white people became in their dealings with me the keener was my passion to destroy them?\\"Styron writes with an easy eloquence and a direct point of view that makes the pages whiz by. As his character of Nat is the narrator, we come to know him from the narration as much as by his actions. There are moments of uneasy levity, like some of the antics of Nat's various white masters, but overall the tone is serious. Even when action is sparse, you know it's coming, and when it does, the descriptions are ferocious.Styron spares no one's sensibilities. Nat has an explicitly rendered dalliance with another male slave, and sexually tangled feelings about white women, one in particular, which seems to influence his religious visions. His rebellion is presented as a take-no-prisoners escape attempt, rather than a suicide mission of retribution, which undercuts how many radicals prefer to see Turner today. White Southerners, which Styron was himself, are depicted in various shadings of damned and depraved.Styron struggles, as do the historians, with the concept of who Turner was and what he wanted, but I think where he succeeds, brilliantly, is in finding some principle for his existence. If there is any hope for man, it is in the passion to right wrongs against impossible odds. Alas, another brilliant aspect to Styron's book is its suggestion of ultimate hopelessness.Bleakness does not equal greatness, but when backed up by the depth of knowledge, of human feeling, of pure nerve and biting wit, that \\"Confessions\\" contains, you don't put it down, let alone argue with it. The arguments come after, which is where they should with works of art like this."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner, published in 1967 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, is one of the best known works by William Styron. Turner was the literate slave who plotted and led the rebellion against white families in southeast Virginia in 1831, \\"hastening 55 persons to their grave\\", as Styron phrases it from the mouth of Turner's court-appointed attorney. Styron bases his novel on the actual confessions of Turner, recorded by the same attorney during Turner's short incarceration before hanging. Styron offers up his intention \\"to try to re-create a man and his era, and to produce a work that is less an 'historical novel' in conventional terms than a meditation on history\\".Styron's powers of description are on considerable display. He pulls you into the story as surely as if he were there. He thoroughly captures the burning resentment and ultimate hatred produced by a lifetime of degradation under the institution of human slavery. Styron takes the time to portray several types of slaveholders, from Nat's first enlightened owner who helped to educate him and made extensive plans for his ultimate freedom, to a pair of surly and benighted men into whose hands he fell, and ultimately to the benign but traditional master who was the first victim of the uprising.Styron made me thoroughly identify with the slaves all the way up until the actual murders began. At that point he describes the brutality in such detail that my horror buttons all went off and I saw the perpetrators as ruthless criminals. It's clear that slavery was the original mortal sin of our country, and that one cannot sow the wind without reaping the whirlwind."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I found this book to be quite challenging. I wasn't sure of the message that it was sending. Nat Turner's &quot;owner&quot; by the account treated him well. Yet, Nat Turner killed him. Why? Is the very act of owning a slave justification for the killing of the owner? Was Nat Turner just a madman as the book seems to imply? Or, was he so mistreated that he was a product of his times?This is a very thought-provoking book. Regardless of what may think of the main character or even that terrible period of our history in which people were enslaved, you should read this book. It gives a different perspective of that time. It is excellent fodder for discussion of not only Nat Turner and what happened in that particular revolt, but the entire institution of slavery. I am not sure I really understand this issue and its long term implications on our society. This book, however, helped me understand that I don't understand."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"A most interesting book written by a very intropsective author. Much like the book &quot;A lesson Before Dying&quot; it's focus is on American slavery but it's message is global. when we oppress others our crimes destroy the fabric of society. Yet it is wrong to place Nat Turner in the pantheon of Revolutionary heroes as some would like to see him. Nat Turner was more than likely unbalanced, he had a non-existant plan of action or behavior and his primary victims were children and women: a true sign of cowardice in any culture."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Good read. Can understand why some readers consider this contraversial. Trust we never go back to &#34;slave owners&#34; or their likes."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I read this novel when it came out and was aware of the criticisms of it at the time. I would have preferred to read a novel about Nat Turner's rebellion written by an African-American man or woman because I think such a writer could more deeply understand and depict the pain, rage, hatred, and justified rebellion that a Black slave would feel. However, I had and have no objection to reading such a novel written by a Caucasian man or woman. It's the truth of the story that matters. But on this level -- the story -- I feel that Styron didn't write a compelling book. The book is 480 pages long and felt like 680 pages long. It goes on and on, repeating things over and over. It seems unfocused. And the Nat Turner who emerges isn't knowable in any way that I could discern. Styron was a great writer: this book was not his best."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I really liked this book. It sat on my shelf for awhile, because I was worried that it would be too painful to read. And it wasn't easy in terms of content, but it was definitely worth the time. I blogged about my reading experience a little more fully at [...]"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"My objection to this book is that it takes a real person who lived and breathed, and began the U.S.'s only &quot;successful&quot; slave revolt, and turns him into a fictional character. People read this book and figure it IS the history of Nat Turner, and THAT is damaging to our common perception of history. Styron says repeatedly in interviews on the subject that he used all the historical information available, and only invented the parts of Turner's life that he couldn't find in history. And that's just not true. He didn't look at the trial record at all. He dismissed newspaper accounts as unbelievable, and he even veers far from the &quot;Confessions of Nat Turner,&quot; as told to Thomas Gray by the real person Nat Turner. In those &quot;Confessions,&quot; Nat doesn't repent for what he's done. He says he doesn't feel guilty at all. This is a far cry from the basis for Styron's character Nat, who feels estranged from God for some sin he has committed. The whole idea that he killed Margaret Whitehead because he lusted after her is ludicrous. It ignores the relationship that Nat had with his real-life wife -- and it perpetuates the old racist idea that we have to protect our white women from black men who want to rape them. When all along, it's Styron and other white guys who have those fantasies. They merely project them onto black men in order to justify their own behavior which is supposed to protect women and children. Of all the hundreds of lynchings that occurred after the Civil War, only 2 involved a white woman being even threatened by a black man, yet that charge of rape was the pretext for so many outright murders of black men.Nat Turner was a hero for leading that revolt. Slavery was abominable, and I'm glad some slaves finally rose up to deplore it. The murders they committed were harsh, but nowhere nearly as harsh as what African-Americans, as a whole, endured day after day as slaves. Styron tries to make Nat Turner into a quivering would-be rapist, who has killed the only person he loved, when Turner was really a man who rose up against the heinous tyranny of slavery. Every time someone reads this book and buys it as the real story, Styron succeeds in keeping the myth alive that what Turner did was wrong -- conveniently forgetting how wrong slavery was, and how much it took to stop it, and then forgetting that it took another hundred years to end segregation in the South, and even now, we don't have equal rights for all. Styron tries to turn Turner's success into failure. It's racism at its noxious core."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner is one of Styron's most powerful works, a fascinating exercise in imagination. Styron begins with a true historical event -- a slave rebellion that struck terror into the hearts of white southerners before ultimately being quelled. Styron sees in the psychological tinder box ignited by the rebellion, and in its leader, Nat Turner, a little-understood passion play. Critics who complain that Styron doesn't answer some historical questions: &quot;Gee, Nat's owner didn't treat him so bad, why'd he rebel?&quot; miss the point. What fascinates Styron, and a careful reader, is what the fact of rebellion does to the minds and emotions of those it touches. Besides, anyone who finishes Styron's novel without a sense of why Turner led the rebellion wasn't reading very carefully; the whole novel turns on Styron's hypothetical answer to this question. One of the central conceits of the book is Styron's imagination that Turner could have been fueled by his sense that he had been chosen by God to lead his fellow slaves in an uprising. Styron paints a powerful picture of one driven by the conviction -- whether divinely inspired or delusional -- that he is a vengeful avatar called upon by a higher power to wreak vengeance on the perceived enemies of God. There is an obvious parallel here to the Harper's Ferry uprising led by John Brown (whom Russell Banks, in Cloudsplitter, depicts as similarly driven by mania), as well as to figures like Joan D'Arc. Styron, who wrote a moving memoir discussing his own struggle with mentally illness, has a special fascination with, and sensitivity to, such issues."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"\\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" was written from a jail house confession that Nat Turner made and which William Styron turned into a novel. Like the other reviews here say, Nat Turner led the only somewhat successful slave rebellion in the South.William Styron was very brave to write this book. And he was much pilloried by Black intellectuals for having done so.The novel is beautiful written and the prose is lyric. We are drawn into Nat's life, the life of the slaves around him, and his masters. They taught Nat to read and treated him kindly. So it is with unexpected horror that we see him lead the blacks there in Virginia to rebel against and hack apart their masters with axes. According to Styron, Turner never butchered anyone. But he lost control of his rebel army and stood by as his owners and friends were hacked to pieces by the most violent slaves. That is the great irony depicted by the novel. On minute we have peaceful chariot rides with the mistress of the plantation. The next we have brutal decapitation. The reason that Turner rose up in rebellion is never clearly explained. The reader is left to draw his own conclusion. That men can turn to monsters is very much thematic here.I think what upset the black intellectuals so much was that William Styron broke two taboos. First he depicted the slave owners in this novel as benevolent-there is not supposed to be any possibility of that so say the revisionists. (Styron points out that slaves in the cotton fields of Missippi suffered more. Farming in Virginia was not so large-scale so the work was or a different nature.) But perhaps Styron's greater sin was describing in vivid detail Nat Turner's affection for a white female. That this part of the novel was made up and that is touched on an unmentionable taboo got Sytron into much trouble. A group of black intellectuals wrote essays that attacked Styron's novel. Sytron could not understand their dismay and was hurt by their assault. I cannot remember if James Baldwin was among the vengeful. I know that he and Styron were friends."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"I initially purchased this book to read for two reasons: First, it was written by William Styron, who wrote the great \\"Sophie's Choice;\\" and second, it won a Pulitzer Prize. It was only after I was into the book that I learned that this vintage sixties' book was the subject of a major controversy over the depiction of the title character, Nat Turner.I learned that Styron openly acknowledged fictionalizing large portions of Turner's life, including his motivations for leading the slave revolt. I also learned that Styron's largely fictionalized portrait of Turner outraged many black leaders of the time. Rather than painting Turner (entirely) as a hero, called to action by the injustices of slavery, Styron created a darker picture of a man fixated on religion, a vision of himself as a prophet, and frustrated by lust and desire (particularly, for a young, blond haired white girl).As I read the book, I search my own feelings, and felt that if I were black, I would certainly have objected similarly. We all need our heroes, who become much larger as symbols than they could ever be as people. For the sake of those that come after, such icons are perhaps entitled to be treated with a greater level of sensitivity and care--even at the cost of literary restraint.It is here that the story gets fascinating. After I finished the novel, I read Styron's Afterword. Styron was truly stung by the criticism and in the Afterword, provided an elegant and persuasive defense of his writings. While I will not say that Styron entirely changed my position, he definitely made me see the other side of the argument. The dialogue between Styron and his critics not only allows the reader to consider one of the great social and political issues of our time, but permits the reader a unique insight into the thinking of a great writer--and suffices, in and of itself, as a reason for reading this novel. MAKE SURE YOUR VERSION OF THE NOVEL HAS THIS AFTERWORD.Putting the issue aside as to the real \\"Nat Turner,\\" the novel itself is beautifully written. The characters are fully developed and believable. The description of the system of slavery and the relationship between whites and blacks feel very real, and very accurate. Styron shows us good and bad of each race, and how all of them are bound by the system of slavery and their actions directly the product of it."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"being or is this book written by a white guy about an entire ethnic group? I have to be able to talk to you all about slavery, the buying and selling of human beings in the United States of America, a peculiar institution abolished by law only a few generations ago. Styron's book was a fictional account dealing not peripherally with these issues and specifically with one man, a United States of America slave. If there is a problem with the scholarship, judge the book by whatever incoherent and misguided poor writing that is to be found. I was moved with sympathy, tears, anguish, anger and ultimately love by this sublime novel. I wonder what Nat Turner would have said about Styron's adaptation? It is preposterous for anyone now living to decide the man's opinion for him. Styron is an artist. He is a brilliant writer of fiction. Obviously an opinion of my own, I'm jublilant we may each agree or disagree with my analysis. What am I hearing from critics that proclaim Styron's, Confessions of Nat Turner, racist? Am I hearing the equivalent of, &quot;You can't write about that! You're the wrong shade of human!&quot;? Let's keep talking and agreeing and disagreeing. William Styron initiated another dialoge of magnificent proportions."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"Styron's fictional account of Nat Turner offends because his man is neither the pitiless avenger of racial injustice nor the hapless victim of events completely beyond his control. If you're looking for the tale of a superman or mythic hero, look elsewhere. This is a novel of an ordinary man who just wanted to live as other men do: to make of his life what he chose. I was deeply moved by Styron's portrayal of Nat Turner as alternately inspired and defeated, honorable and cowardly. I'll always remember Nat's anger and pain as they carry his compatriot off to hang him - &quot;Leave him ALONE! You're hurting him. You've been hurting him all his life!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"In August 1831, in a remote region of south-eastern Virginia, took place the only effective and sustained revolt in the history of American Negro slavery. That year, a black man, Nat Turner, awaits death in a prison cell. He is a slave, a preacher and the leader of the revolt. Mr Styron based his novel on the single significant contemporary document concerning this insurrection, namely a brief pamphlet of twenty pages called &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, published in Richmond in 1831. The confession Turner made to his jailers under the duress of his God is a narrative describing a good man's transformation into an avenging angel even as it encompasses all the betrayals, cruelties and humiliations that made up slavery - and that is still present in the collective psyches of both races.This magnificent book brilliantly depicts the American past in a dazzling narrative."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner is an excellent historical rendition of Nat's psychological and physical rebellion. Although he was unsucessful from wiping the white race out of Jerusalum and off of the planet, during the antebellum his failure makes an informative read. Styron writes a chilling account of Turner's revolt, and insane biblical visions.As a boy Nat was well treated compared to the majority of the slaves and was even taught to read by his owners wife. Eventually his owner introduced him to carpentry, which became his successful trade. However it is obvious that Turner was mentally unstable due to whatever harsh circumstances he might have delt with as a child, young adult or even adult. This book, and the rebellion itself, really produces a picture of how disturbing America's actions were during that period. It also illustrates how slavery can kill a persons mental integerity, breaking them down to the point where they create such a heinous crime.The Confessions of Nat Turner by, William Styron, is an admirable piece. Styron lyrically produced a galvanizing, well written book, that is a great read for anyone, not just history buffs."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"From the perspective of a 41 year old white woman, this is a book that will change your life. My understanding of the state of black/white relations in the U.S. has been altered fundamentally and forever by this work. Styron strikes an incredible balance, making Nat Turner a formidable, realistic, character belivably touched by God, even as he is also a man of failings and inconsistancies. The book is beautiful, horrific, unforgettable.What strikes me most about it is how Styron, years before he wrote Sophie's Choice, writes about another Holocaust in a way that forces readers to confront the history \\"we\\" (meaning the white wielders of power) have made for ourselves through our complicity in slavery.I've just begun to research African American readers' in the general public and academia responses to this work. I would love to talk with people of color to hear other points of view on this book. ..."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"This novel gives the reader a lot to ponder about a figure in American history, and because this history is our history it is important that we read and imagine and try to explain what this country has done.

His ultimate salvation, then, comes only when he has no more pain to bear."},{"Title":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner","review":"A journey back in time to the pre-civil war south to visit a slave called Nat, who was blessed and cursed by being able to read.

His genius shines fully in these pages -- exquisite writing, compelling story, and wonderful characters, all set in a time of turmoil and transformation in this country's struggle with a terrible system of wrongs. Styron brings all his formidible talent to bear in these pages, and the result is a work that is mesmerizing, haunting, and utterly unforgettable. On my all-time favorites list.

While this is a soft cover book, with large print, it contains simple and separate information about the world, the continents, and their relationship to the world.It's important to explain to the child that a specific country is not the color on the page, but that color is used to separate one country from another. The individual continents are labeled, the countries are marked, and the differences in the sizes of the words, that is, the names of places, represent their size within that country.For a first atlas for a child who is just learning about the world, this one provides some information about each continent, giving specific details about the resources and importance of the continent, as well as pictures of the flags of all the countries in the world. Since the Olympics are unfolding in Vancouver, British Columbia, this year, February 2010, and if your children are watching some of the events, that is, competitions, they can search for the flag of the countries in the competitions; the flags are displayed in alphabetical order in the continent they reside. Watching the Olympics can be the first step to opening the doors of learning about other countries and identifying both the location in the world, as well as the flag that represents the country.Grab a torch and join in the Olympic fun.

I am reviewing the smaller format book that came out in September 2009 (6.6 inches by 6.1 inches by 1.5 inches). Unless you don't care what size your photographs are, I recommend you spend the extra money and get the larger size version that came out in October 2003 (10.7 inches by 10.1 inches by 1.8 inches). I think in the larger page size the book is a five-star resource for any photography lover. If you are a National Geographic subscriber or admirer, why wouldn't you want to own that book?Like many books of photographs, many of these reproductions will appeal to you more than others. I happen to like nature shots that provide me with a new perspective on life against a backdrop of stunning beauty. Obviously, National Geographic could have filled many volumes with just such images. A boy diving backward off a water buffalo into a muddy river filled with water buffalo perfectly captures the sort of thing I mean (James P. Blair, 1993, in Bangladesh), as does a meerkat keeping watch (Mattias Klum, 2002).There are also some marvelous wilderness shots that take the civilization out of you in meditative ways (Maria Stenzel, 1996, islands on the Fond du Lac River; Steve Winter, 2001, jaguar in Belize; and Jim Brandenburg, 1987, arctic wolf)More typically, these images are about people. I particularly liked the ones that put nature's scale against human accomplishment (Hiram Bingham, 1912, portraying Machu Picchu; Gordon Wilstie, 1994, mountaineers in Chile; Michael S. Yamashita, 2003, the Great Wall of China).Much of the book is social commentary. Depending on your point of view, you'll be amused, outraged, or left musing.For my taste the book could have included a lot more space and ocean images.Inevitably, there are images of bare-breasted women from lesser-developed countries, views of whom have provided such controversy over the years about National Geographic.

There were a few problems for me.1) The photos in this book are surprisingly grainy. They are not printed on high-quality glossy paper like the NatGeo magazine itself. This simply makes some of the great photos in the book look amateurish (through no fault of the photographer).2) The book seems more like a collection of historical photos than simply the greatest. It's nice to see historical photos, but I don't think they're really better than most modern photos. Moreover, a lot of the older photos seem stiff, with people sitting or standing stiffly posing.3) I'm a big fan of NatGeo's wildlife photos, and there are only a few wildlife photos. Those few are good, and I noted several by Michael Nicholas. However, of all of NatGeo's wonderful wildlife photos, the handful contained in this book simply isn't enough. Moreover, I find the photos of people relatively boring. In the NatGeo magazine, photos of people are usually included along with an article, giving them context and life. However, in this book, the photos of people are simply isolated and don't stand well by themselves.In short, if you want a book of wildlife photos, there are better books out there. If you want a book of NatGeo's best of, you'll probably want to wait for a different book altogether."},{"Title":"Through the Lens: National Geographic's Greatest Photographs","review":"I came across 3 National Geographic photo books while doing some Christmas shopping.

Wide Angle was actually boring photos with no information in the captions to help romanticize the photos. IN Focus has better quality photos. It will make a great gift for someone who loves National Geographic but may not impress the aspiring photographer. The captions aren't fantastic, but if you love National Geographic, you don't need someone to spell out for you what the beauty of each picture can show. My complaint is that the caption isn't always on the same page as the picture. You may have to flip forward or backward to find out what you are looking at which is some what distracting to the flow.

The editor cut the edges, and only show the &quot;main&quot; part of the photo in this book. This causes two problems. First, I believe that when the photographer took the photo, he/she has special purpose for framing. Different photographer has different style. But now, the style of all photos look consistent!!!

It also makes the book seem like there are more pictures than there really are.

There's no index, so you can't look for pictures with a specific theme. The majority of the pictures are centered in the middle of the two pages, so the middle of the pictures disappear into the binding. The pages are another problem entirely. The book is printed on glossy paper that absorbs liquid (apparently). Oil from your fingers is left as prints or smudges, even if you only are touching the page for a few seconds. These marks DO NOT disappear over time, and you can espeacially see them on the black pages.

The contents are simply (!) rich color photographs for which National Geographic is so widely respected and well known. Divided into sections - Europe, Asia, Africa & the Middle East, The Americas, Oceans and Isles, and The Universe - the editors have selected a terrific cross section of images from the depth of underwater photographs (apparently these were the first ever made!) to images of the distant most stars. And of course including images of the planet's surface and habitants in the fine tradition of the magazine.Some of the photographs will be familiar to readers of the magazine while many will be the first glimpses of how fine the representative 84 photographers truly are.

I cannot speak to the technical craft of photography because I know nothing about that. Since I also have not looked at other National Geographic Collections, I cannot speak as to what is included in those collections and how it compares to this collection. What I can speak to is what I thought about this particular collection.Bottom line: I liked it. Since I am not a regular reader of National Geographic, all of the pictures were new to me. This is an excellent collection of photography for someone who just wants to look at some wonderful pictures. One can look through the book casually and enjoy the pictures (as I did), or one can study the pictures and see exactly what is going on and find nuance within the pictures. Either way works. Good pictures, good book, and it was an enjoyable time looking at some of the best of National Geographic's photography."},{"Title":"Through the Lens: National Geographic's Greatest Photographs","review":"Our world, its people and the animals that share it all with us, as captured thru the years by National Geographic photographers.

More than half of the featured photographs were recent, many taken in the last 5 years. So many of the breath taking pictures that I remeber were not included. I cannot even guess at what the critera was for photographs to be included in this book but, in my opinion, these are not the best of National Geographic."},{"Title":"Through the Lens: National Geographic's Greatest Photographs","review":"Through the Lens is a collection of some of the best photographs that were stored in the archives of The National Geograhic society.

If this book has most of National Geographic's greatest photographs, then 100 years of adventure and discovery has, well... I dont want to say that it has the rest of them, but it at least has another large chunk of NG's greatest photographs. Oh, and did I mention it's cheap too?

The skill and the vision of the photographers is evident throughout.The book is a companion volume to two other National Geographic books - Wide Angle and In Focus. All the books are excellent."},{"Title":"Through the Lens: National Geographic's Greatest Photographs","review":"I am an aspiring photographer. I was actually in the book store the other day just browsing and I picked up this book as well as the other 2 in this series (which are on there way). I was very impressed so I came home and got on Amazon. I got mine used (in great shape) for 10 bucks shipped...How can you go wrong there.The reason I purchased this book is because I think it is really good to see what has made it to print and to get a feel for what a huge magazine deems good for print in it's pages...that alone is worth studying and again 10 bucks shipped, is a killer deal!!!!!! Also another great thing about this book is that it has photos from 80 years ago and for those photographers wanting to gain that feel in their photos, it offers a great place to reference to see how it was done in print (not on some tute from the internet).Another great aspect to this is that if you ever entertain and have this on the coffee table it is great for guests, creates conversation and also makes you look very well versed! ;-)"},{"Title":"Through the Lens: National Geographic's Greatest Photographs","review":"The 250 photographs in this book represent the best of the travel, cultural, geographical, and scientific photographs ever taken.

Recently I ordered the second edition, distributed by Autonomedia.org and this time I READ it and I thought I was reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez...if I had known this book was this impressive, I would've read it the first time.

His peformance, aided by soulful jazz vocalists and a world instrumentalist, was nothing short of breathtaking. Rux ripped through his emotionally charged modern adaptation of Sophacles' Oedipus with revealing intensity and commanding emotion, leaving a small audience mesmerized and yearning for more poetic prophecy from the young writer. The power of Pagan Operetta is its recital for a larger movement that, as universal as it is, still captures the socio-imaginative experience of the individual, whether it is Rux himself or the reader. This piece opens eyes not only to different shades and hues of the canvas we call experience, but to new colors altogether."},{"Title":"Follow Your Star","review":"I always enjoy Lucy Walker's descriptions of outback Australia.

You get a first hand glance into the personalities of the two men."},{"Title":"My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin","review":"This book is half dangerous and half helpful. The easy and very cheap ($3) availability of brand new hardcover copies of this book on remainder shelves indicate these failings have been recognized by the reading and historical communities.The helpful parts are the raw texts of written communications between Roosevelt and Stalin, which are not, to my knowledge, available anywhere else. If this is a complete record as claimed, it's crucial information for historians as the evidence of the semi-public communication between FDR and Stalin.Unfortunately, except for the published memoirs (suspect in themselves) of the direct participants, we cannot know the substance of behind-closed-doors verbal communications between FDR or Harry Hopkins and Stalin or Molotov, which were considerable, that may substantially alter the meanings of written communications reported in this book. As experienced professional manipulators, both FDR and Stalin well understood the utility, and hazards, of a written record.The dangerous and misleading parts are the remainder of the book written by \\"editor\\" Susan Butler and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. (court historian of JFK's \\"Camelot\\"), who, as committed progressives, give a decidedly one-sided and pro-FDR slant to their commentaries. You'll find no critical historical analysis here.Worse, Butler is a very poor technical historian, with proof on nearly every page. For example, on page 34 Butler states the Germans captured 400,000 Soviet prisoners in the first week of their June 1941 Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Later on the same page she states the Soviets lost 300,000 prisoners in the first month of fighting. Apparently, according to her, the Germans gave back 100,000 prisoners!Lest the reader believe this is merely a proofreading error, many, many other pages contain errors of technical history that a Yale-educated historian should not make. As one of many examples, on page 140 Butler describes the Bell P-39 Airacobra as a \\"maneuverable fighter\\" plane.This is technically inept in the extreme, as the USAAF, RAF, and RAAF rejected the prewar P-39 as being wholly inappropriate for combat in Europe and the Far East, to be replaced with superior fighters as soon as possible. The Soviets, however, loved the Airacobra, and wished to acquire as many as possible through Lend-Lease. Army Air Force chief General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold did not want American aircraft factories to continue to manufacture an obsolete fighter merely for Soviet consumption, and recommended a newer type replace the P-39 in shipments to the Soviets.If a \\"historian\\" can't get simple facts and numbers such as these correct, the reader can be excused for being cautious about accepting the remainder of their commentary at face value.In sum, I recommend this book to serious readers of history with significant knowledge of what was going on at the time. To avoid being misled by historical inaccuracy or ideological slant, other readers are strongly cautioned to verify statements made by Butler or Schlesinger with multiple outside sources before accepting them as fact."},{"Title":"My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin","review":"This is a really good resource book to have. A friend gave it to me as a gift, and jsut as I thought I already knew everything about WWII, this book surprises me with new facts straight from Stalin and Roosevelt themselves! The book guides you through each president's thought process and how they dance through political fires with wit and strategy. Roosevelt is much more fascinating now that I see how he thinks.

Highly recommended if you want to read about 2 impt leaders and WWII."},{"Title":"My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin","review":"This review is in response to the other review here that suggests the Yalta myth. For background information, one misleading myth invented to smear FDR is that he sold-out Eastern Europe in the Yalta agreement, but that's simply not true. READ WHAT THE YALTA AGREEMENT ACTUALLY SAYS. Also read the wording of the Atlantic Charter from the beginning of the war. Churchill later said that if the Yalta agreement was such a bad deal for the West, then why did Stalin break it? The Yalta agreement called for \\"free and unfettered elections\\" in Eastern Europe and \\"the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live - the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government\\" to the people of Eastern Europe. I urge everyone to actually read the Yalta agreement.This is what the Yalta agreement actually says:-------------------II. DECLARATION OF LIBERATED EUROPEThe following declaration has been approved:The Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States of America have consulted with each other in the common interests of the people of their countries and those of liberated Europe. They jointly declare their mutual agreement to concert during the temporary period of instability in liberated Europe the policies of their three Governments in assisting the peoples liberated from the domination of Nazi Germany and the peoples of the former Axis satellite states of Europe to solve by democratic means their pressing political and economic problems.The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic life must be achieved by processes which will enable the liberated peoples to destroy the last vestiges of nazism and fascism and to create democratic institutions of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter - the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live - the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government to those peoples who have been forcibly deprived to them by the aggressor nations.To foster the conditions in which the liberated people may exercise these rights, the three governments will jointly assist the people in any European liberated state or former Axis state in Europe where, in their judgment conditions require,(a) to establish conditions of internal peace;(b) to carry out emergency relief measures for the relief of distressed peoples;(c) to form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of Governments responsive to the will of the people; and(d) to facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections.The three Governments will consult the other United Nations and provisional authorities or other Governments in Europe when matters of direct interest to them are under consideration.When, in the opinion of the three Governments, conditions in any European liberated state or former Axis satellite in Europe make such action necessary, they will immediately consult together on the measure necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration.By this declaration we reaffirm our faith in the principles of the Atlantic Charter, our pledge in the Declaration by the United Nations and our determination to build in cooperation with other peace-loving nations world order, under law, dedicated to peace, security, freedom and general well-being of all mankind.In issuing this declaration, the three powers express the hope that the Provisional Government of the French Republic may be associated with them in the procedure suggested.VII. POLANDThe following declaration on Poland was agreed by the conference:\\"A new situation has been created in Poland as a result of her complete liberation by the Red Army. This calls for the establishment of a Polish Provisional Government which can be more broadly based than was possible before the recent liberation of the western part of Poland. The Provisional Government which is now functioning in Poland should therefore be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad. This new Government should then be called the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity.\\"M. Molotov, Mr. Harriman and Sir A. Clark Kerr are authorized as a commission to consult in the first instance in Moscow with members of the present Provisional Government and with other Polish democratic leaders from within Poland and from abroad, with a view to the reorganization of the present Government along the above lines. This Polish Provisional Government of National Unity shall be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot. In these elections all democratic and anti-N azi parties shall have the right to take part and to put forward candidates.\\"When a Polish Provisional of Government National Unity has been properly formed in conformity with the above, the Government of the U.S.S.R., which now maintains diplomatic relations with the present Provisional Government of Poland, and the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States of America will establish diplomatic relations with the new Polish Provisional Government National Unity, and will exchange Ambassadors by whose reports the respective Governments will be kept informed about the situation in Poland.\\"The three heads of Government consider that the eastern frontier of Poland should follow the Curzon Line with digressions from it in some regions of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland. They recognize that Poland must receive substantial accessions in territory in the north and west. They feel that the opinion of the new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity should be sought in due course of the extent of these accessions and that the final delimitation of the western front.\\"-----------------Ronald Reagan wrote in his autobiography \\"An American Life\\" (page 305) that, as president, he sincerely wrote to the Soviet leadership and insisted that they honor their commitment to freedom in Eastern Europe as expressed in the Yalta agreement. He wrote that he \\"proposed that the Polish people only be given the right to self-determination that had been promised to them by Joseph Stalin himself at the Yalta Conference. At Yalta, I reminded them, Stalin had promised Poland and all the countries of Eastern Europe the right of self-determination, but the Soviets had never granted it to any of them.\\"According to \\"The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism\\" by Paul Kengor (pages 211-212), on the fortieth anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, Reagan declared, \\"Let me state emphatically that we reject any interpretation of the Yalta agreement that suggests American consent for the division of Europe into Spheres of influence. On the contrary, we see that agreement as a pledge by the three great powers to restore full independence and to allow free and democratic elections in all countries liberated from the Nazis after World War II and there is no reason to absolve the Soviet Union or ourselves from this commitment.\\" Yalta did not sell-out Eastern Europe. Indeed, Yalta required the opposite.I urge everyone to simply read what the Yalta agreement actually says. You can read it on the Internet. The agreement, you will see, is very favorable to the West and the people of Eastern Europe.What the letters in this book show is that FDR maneuvered to keep the Allies together long enough to destroy Adolf Hitler but that the tensions of the Cold War were forged in World War II. The Soviet Union lost 17 million people in World War II while America lost 400,000. FDR needed to keep the Soviets from quitting the war until America was ready to liberate Europe. FDR was a poker player in real life and was excellent at the game of diplomacy, including bluffing and shmoozing with meaningless shmooze. Then at the end, FDR shrewdly got Stalin to sign the Yalta agreement, which was very favorable to the West and the people of Eastern Europe.In fact, Stalin's advisor urged him not to sign it. After FDR died, Stalin broke the promises agreed in writing at Yalta, and FDR's successors - Truman and Eisenhower - did nothing about it. Truman gave Soviet foreign minister Molitov \\"a tongue lashing,\\" demanding that they honor the promises. With Soviet armies in Eastern Europe, there was probably little that Truman and Eisenhower could do short of another world war, which the American public did not support. Instead, Truman and Eisenhower used the policy of containment.It's amazing that this myth continues to bamboozle people who are too lazy to check the facts."},{"Title":"My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin","review":"The review you posted by Publishers Weekly literally made me want to gag. This book is not a \\"history junkie's delight\\"; it is the essence of Poland's 50 year nightmare from 1939 to 1989.As a retried U.S. military officer and Polish-American baby-boomer whose father fought at places like Iwo Jima during WWII, I have great interest in the betrayal of Poland during WWII. Anyone who knows about the Katyn Forest Massacre (done by Dear Mr. Stalin), the Warsaw Rising of 44 (when Dear Mr. Stalin refused to allow the Allies to come to the aid of the people of Warsaw) and the mass deportations and genocide against the Polish people, will be highly interested in this book.A great percentage of the letters are about the \\"Polish Problem.\\" And I am afraid the Polish Problem still exists today whereby people glorify the contributions of the Soviet Union led by a mass-murderer whilst at the same time being almost totally ignorant of the contributions of Poland to the defeat of Nazi Germany. The effectiveness and impact of Poles of the 1st Polish Armored Division, the two Polish Fighter Squadrons during the Battle of Britain, and the Poish heroics and sacrifices at places like Monte Cassino are either unknown or minimized. To this, add the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Polish Americans, sons and grandsons of Poland, like my father and more famous (maybe not so famous) Polish Americans like Col Gabreski and Lt Col Urban.At Amazon.com, you stock books like \\"A Question of Honor\\" which should be read by all those who want to truly know what wartime misery is all about. Shame on anyone who tries to varnish or glorify the abject misery that Stalin (not Hitler) brought to his own people but especially to the Polish nation."},{"Title":"My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin","review":"Very nice compilation of Roosevelt writings to Stalin, had he lived a while longer we might've had a better world!"},{"Title":"The French Key Mystery","review":"Is the popular fiction of today -- mass-market paperbacks sold in airports and drug stores, the best sellers -- any better than the old pulp fiction issued by small publishers? How does this novel of the 1930s compare with modern novels?One thing to consider is that most modern novels are more realistic. Although there areexceptions,the writers of techno thrillers and police procedurals seem motivated to do the research to provide more details and to get the details accurate, so Michael Connelly and Patricia Cornwell are amazingly authentic and thorough on forensics, and Tom Clancy is notorious for obtaining classified information about the capabilities of the US military.In contrast, many of the whodunits from the past employed absurd plot devices.S. S. Van Dine(a pen name) wrote mystery novels that were once hugely popular (and made into movies), but today they seem so absurd, so awful, that it's difficult to imagine that anyone who could read would waste their time over one.Somewhat in the middle is veteran pulp writer Frank Gruber (1904-1969). He knew what a french key is (one having been used on him when he was a penniless writer during the Great Depression), and there's a humorous account of a common swindle of those days, although the mystery's MacGuffin (plot device) is typically weak.But authenticity is not the only admirable quality of a novel. Readers also enjoy colorful characters and witty dialogue, and fiction took an unfortunate step backward with Mickey Spillane, who furthered the trend of humorless-tough-guys protagonists. Now the style (following the footsteps of the superheros in comic books) isdetectives with problemsand flawed heroes.Gruber (who eventually found success in Hollywood by writing for \`50s TV) was not a great writer, but he did devise an enjoyable hero in Johnny Fletcher, the down-and-out, slick-talking, goodhearted, streetwise, happy-go-lucky sleuth who outwits both the villains and the cops. He's not a tough guy -- more of a softboiled detective -- and one can imagine this novel being passed among bright kids during the depression, each identifying with wisecracking Johnny, just as young guys once (it's now difficult to imagine) admired and mimicked Bob Hope. Yes, this novel's slang is now outdated, and much of the plot borders on hokum, but that doesn't detract from a great character like Johnny Fletcher.This is not a Great Work of Literature, but it should be read by at least one more generation before being forgotten forever. I think I like the idea of Frank Gruber -- a guy who, whatever his talent, simply wanted to be a writer-- more than what he wrote. Fans of pulp fiction will profit by reading his autobiographicalThe Pulp Jungle.It, too, falls short of great writing, but I love the concept of guys in cheap hotel rooms (with a flashing neon sign just outside each window, the door jammed with a french key) pounding away on an Underwood portable, trying to get into the pulps.When posting this, I noticed that this 1939 novel is still being reprinted every ten years. Perhaps Gruber's work will live on."},{"Title":"Inside Scientology; How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman.","review":"Perhaps, reader, you are one of those who have been bombarded with a TV and billboard campaign promoting the book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, by L. Ron Hubbard. Dianetics contains information that will bring freedom and self-fulfilment, say the ads. What the ads don't tell you is that Dianetics, a \\"fringe\\" therapy that first appeared in book form in 1950, is really a \\"hook\\" to pull people into the Church of Scientology, a powerful hydra-headed international organization that extracts money and services from its members through its control of their minds and pocketbooks. Scientology (the collective term for the teachings, techniques and network of church corporations created by the late L. Ron Hubbard) sells \\"mental processing\\" that bears little resemblance to the book Dianetics. However, Scientology, for reasons my own book makes clear, uses Dianetics to lure \\"raw meat\\" (non-Scientologists) into its thought-control machine.The words \\"Dianetics\\" and \\"Scientology\\" are built on Greek and Latin roots and sound \\"scientific\\" and innocuous. Dianetics and Scientology are not sciences, and they are anything but innocuous. Deceptive use of the name \\"Dianetics\\" is typical of Scientology's operations. The organization has much to hide. Scientology and its other \\"fronts\\" such as Dianetics speak of freedom. But what kind of \\"freedom\\"? I am one of those who spoke out about Scientology. Agents devised a way to enter my home and photograph my papers. A piano concert I booked to play at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York City was canceled at the last moment by a man identifying himself as \\"Robert Kaufman.\\" My publisher was destroyed in Great Britain by a massive campaign of theft, forgery and poison pen letters.Scientology tried to steal my freedom of thought and speech, both when I was a member and after. That has only made me want to speak out all the more. In doing so, I have your freedom in mind also. You are about to enjoy a true science fiction adventure in \\"another world here on earth.\\" Entertainment, yes. But I also wish to share with you -- perhaps with an intensity you haven't known for a while -- the preciousness, the blessedness, of our right to think and speak as we choose.Your freedom. My freedom. Our freedom."},{"Title":"Inside Scientology; How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman.","review":"This book is a very difficult book to read and review.The first characteristic is that this is the recollection, report of someone who got into Scientology, managed to climb to nearly the top of \\"qualification,\\" though certification would be a better term. He paid for every single step of it, a real fortune, in 1967-1969. As such it is of course essential since it actually tells us one particular experience of this trip down under into one of the most secretive cults that exists on this planet. But as such too it is difficult not to see that there is always a personal dimension, even emotional, especially since scientology negates emotions that are considered as dangerous and negative. When he got out of it he rediscovered the beauty of emotions. We must not consider this testimony as the truth but as a truthful testimony, which is not exactly the same.But this testimony is very disturbing because it definitely clarifies a couple of things anyone who has lived long enough can know. The first form of this cult was Dianetics, a book published in 1950. I have covered that book by itself and will not repeat what I already said. But this here book clearly explains how Scientology came later and at the end of the 1960s had pushed Dianetics down and replaced it with a new ideology which was a lot more cultish. But after 1968 the Church of Scientology was under attack in many countries, including Australia, England, the United States to only consider English speaking countries. And at the same time quite a few lawsuits were started all over the world against these organisations. They went on with their activities, but this time they advertised it in the 1980s, starting before the death of L. Ron Hubbard in 1986, under the color of the New Era Dianetics, a new edition of the original book. I cannot compare the two editions because I do not have the original one.If we only consider Dianetics we could and should discuss some concepts and some approaches but it is always draped in some very self-assertive scientific language that sounds positive, slightly bombastic, but never totalitarian. What the book contains is debatable but not forcibly hostile or antagonizing. It certainly does not contain any real mesmeric, not to mention hypnotic, language. Some people can be easily captured by the authoritative language that may compensate some want, lack, or satisfy some need, but if we keep the normal critical distance that we are supposed to keep when reading any philosophical or ideological book we are definitely safe.But that has little to do with the advanced form under the name of Scientology and the practices that go along with it inside the church of scientology. I am just going to state a few of these practices drawn from this here book.First there is the use a totally esoteric language with an abundance of neologisms, acronyms, mono-syllabic abbreviations, etc. Many words are also shifted in discursive categories from verb to noun and vice versa quite freely and the syntax is also at times original with transitive verbs turned into intransitive verbs for only one example. Some call this language scientologese. It definitely sounds like any hyper specialized language like police talk or air talk and a few others like medical talk. This requires an effort and this creates a closed mental world in which the people are cutting themselves away from the real world.Second the time scale is completely berserk. The use of trillions, zillions of years, the origin of human things pushed so far away that we are practically at the Big Bang, that it all started in the cosmos and man was nothing but an abstract spirit that through all these zillions of years managed to get embodied into flesh and bone by some vast cosmic evolution. We must understand there are billions of such spirits still freely floating all around looking for some carriers. These spirits are thetans and the freely floating ones that stick onto our legitimate thetans and bodies bacome parasite body thetans causing all kinds of problems. In other words science fiction has been transformed into a real history of the universe and the human species.Third the world is cut into two groups of people: the clears who are already initiated into the system, and the others who are wogs. These wogs become raw meat when they are attracted into the church of scientology and there pre-clears when they start their initiation. This initiation costs a tremendous amount of money. Then among these initiated people, you have those who stay inside and can pay their way up and their affiliation, and those who work for the church in order to pay their way up and through to the top certification. They are working like hell for a pittance and that solution takes a great and long time to come to some kind of result.Fourth In this initiated population you have the privileged very few who managed a franchise of the church in the form of an educational scientology center under their own responsibility and at their own risks, and paying a percentage of their gross income to the church of scientology. You also have the proletariat of this population, the super exploited workers in the various centers and in the old days the lumpen proletariat working on the flagship of L. Ron Hubbard who were working for nothing at all because it was for them a punishment, and eventually they may become the Sea orgs, those who were sent to the various centers to check up the good work there.Fifth the initiation work is a total subordination of each individual to an exacting system that forces them to work long hours, everyday without stopping, do very repetitive tasks, and under constant surveillance and pressure that make them completely dependent. They have to get punished, get summoned and pressurized, get vilified and downtrodden all the time to just go on advancing. What's more the guidance personnel is there to remind everyone that they have to find all answers to all questions exclusively within a corpus of official documents, some highly secret, and all that by themselves without getting any help from others. This is practically impossible to maintain all the time but the result is suspicion, conformity, paranoia, absolute self-centeredness within a hermetically closed group and society. Add to that the use of e-meters and a standardized hypnotic language in all exchanges and checkups of each individual student and you have the factory of mind manipulation, some say brainwashing depicted in this book.Sixth and last every student, member, affiliate, believer, faithful or whatever indoctrinated person has to constantly swear their allegiance to L. Ron Hubbard and Mary Sue Hubbard, which must have become more difficult now since both are dead. They can only read and think within the official library of books, circulars, bulletins, newsletters, tapes or whatever signed by the boss. They must report those who do not believe that fully and they better report themselves if they happen to disbelieve one little point before someone reports them.That's the picture we get from that book. Scientology then is depicted here as a purely totalitarian frankly fascistic system. Is it a true picture? Is it a truthful record of a particular experience? Is it purely fantastic ranting and raving? Is it the figment of the insane imagination of some warped and distorted mind? I cannot say and I do not want to say. Read, and read more and get your own information and build up your own opinion. Mine is very deeply moved by that testimony and I tend to believe that man is truthful because he is a musician and musicians don't lie even when they have a very sonic way of listening to the world.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Blood summer","review":"In a nutshell this book is about a brother and sister (both teenagers) who run away together to a motel and spend a few days banging each other.

More depth, more action, more violence, and better characterization than I'd expected out of an action book written in the 1960s. \\"Shout at the Devil\\" is set in east Africa in and near the Rufiji delta just around the start of World War I. The bold, selfish, hot-tempered American O'Flynn organizes the massacre of a large elephant herd in order to collect the ivory tusks. Problem is, the herd belongs to the Germans and so the raid precipitates a deadly conflict between the two sides.The events of the second half of the novel are actually based loosely on the story of the German light cruiser K&ouml;nigsberg, eventually sunk by the British in 1915. It is evident particulary during this part of the book that Smith researched details of how the K&ouml;nigsberg survived in the delta for as long as it did.A great action novel to read while on vacation. The pages turn quickly and the story is informative and well-written. Also, nothing in the book is so outlandishly fictional as to not be believable."},{"Title":"Shout at the Devil","review":"If your tired of all the unrealistic 'and they lived happily ever after' crap, this is it.

And he sets it up so well!If this is the first Wilbur Smith book you're gonna read, your not wasting your time.I give this book 3 stars just because I'm comparing it to other Smith books I've read.

The violence aside, I think he intended it as an amusing piece of fluff in the adventure genre, and that is certainly is.He has presented a colourful, overblown group of characters with little complexity, playing out an unlikely sequence of events in an exotic setting, well described. And it works. That can't be an accident.There's little depth here--in fact it stops just short of farce--but if you're looking for an entertaining read, I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Shout at the Devil","review":"I never thought about Africa being a fun place to visit until I traveled there on a merchant ship in 2008.

I highly recommend all his books especially the ones on the Courtney family!"},{"Title":"Shout at the Devil","review":"Not one of my favorite Wilbur Smith novels but a middle of the line novel by him. Too fanciful a plot lacking any of the historical fiction that I enjoy in most of his Africa series books."},{"Title":"Shout at the Devil","review":"This is one of Wilbur Smith's best. I laughed 3/4 of the way through it. It was then I realized that the story was very subtely based as much on WWII, and what the Germans did to families at that time, as it was on WWI. The story became very serious and the comedy was no longer applicable in the last quarter of the story. But that doesn't mean I lost interest in that part of the book. The ending was perfect. Smith is an expert. If you want to read fairy tales where everyone lives happily ever after, this book is not for you. It's reality. If there is any doubt about that, read some of the stories that were written by the survivors of WWII."},{"Title":"Shout at the Devil","review":"I've only read a couple of Wilbur A Smith's book, but have enjoyed them. I realize he will use violence and heartbreak to help the story to fit within the historical period and regional area he's writing about. However this book went way over the top. I could only imagine he must have been in a lousy mood when he wrote the ending.The book starts off quite well introducing us to the characters. Although one of the main characters, O'Flynn, has your typical \\"Smith\\" qualities, he is also rather a cad. Brave for one instace cowardly in another. Always looking out only himself no matter who it hurts whether it's his daughter, his partner Sebastian, or his faithful companion Mohammed. The adventure in the book is exciting and does keep you on the edge of your seat. Part II is about rage and revenge, with each character tetering on madness. The pace continues to build to an explosive climax.******SPOILER ALERT**************Sounds I liked the book, right? Well I did until the end. There is no satisfaction here. Yes I know Smith tends to kill off a hero or two, however usually the book ends with a somewhat happy, or at least normal, ending. Not here. Quite simply: EVERYBODY DIES. The good, the bad, and even the ugly. The villian doesn't even die horribly. He just vanishes. You sit reading the last couple of pages feeling depressed and empty. I bought this book in London to read on a flight back to Los Angeles. I just left it on the plane. Take my advice. Smith has so many better books than this. If you're looking for something along this line, try his book \\"Cry Wolf\\". It's just as exciting and also has a clever and satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Shout at the Devil","review":"Unarguably, this book is yet an other one of Mr.Smith's Captivating Best ! If you lack the flair for adventure,this book is definitely not for you.This is in retaliation to 'someone' who openly derogated Mr. Smith and his works.Although,some of his works may reflect ruthless gore and lots of violence, the fact is that one being able to imajine and be involved deeply with the scenes and characters as described by him only proves how vivid and clear his descriptions are.When it comes to 'describing',Wilbur Smith is invincible.It requires deeper imajination and reading in between the lines than just racing through plain text to enjoy Mr.Smith's works.'Thou shalt not blameth,if thou not understandeth.

It is a \\"must read\\" for Evangelical Women everywhere."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"The three women in this book are possibly the strongest characters I have ever read about. The story is told in lovely prose, reading this book is like sharing a weekend with your best women friends. I wish this exquisitely told tale was one without an end."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Charms for the Easy Life, written by Kaye Gibbons, was in my opinion, very heart-warming and inspiring. The novel was set in the mid 1930's to 1940's in Raleigh, North Carolina. Margaret, the narrator of this novel, shares with the reader her story of the women she lived with: her gorgeous mother, Sophia, and her grandmother Charlie Kate-Birch, an unlicensed physician/healer. Although there were two unsuccessful marriages within the two generations before Margaret, in the end, all found love and happiness. Charlie Kate made a name for herself for being one of the kindest, hard-working physicians in North Carolina and was included in an edition of Busy North Carolina Women. Sophia became involved with an intelligent, handsome, charming lawyer, Mr. Baines, a graduate of Yale. The three generations of women were engaged in helping those who were ill. Hence the reason why Margaret became a doctor. The Birches were women who promoted strength, loyalty, love, and compassion, not only to their patients, but also to each other.Kaye Gibbons has done a grade A job. She provided the reader with great plot elements, showing each character's strength to carry on a good life. Charlie Kate's will to continue her legacy of reaching out to the community, regardless of her aging, was an inspirational aspect of the novel. As was the journey to finding Sophia's future love. Gibbons presented to us a lovely story, not just another unbelievable fiction.This story of how women made it through life during the time of World War II is not only inspirational, but also engaging."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have wearied, in recent years, of reading novels by authors whose characters are interesting only by virtue of their being from the South, and whose plots depend on rural Southern details and the characters' Southern eccentricities. I feel this is a cheap ploy, so I wasn't particularly interested in picking up Gibbons' book, Charms for the Easy Life. But I'm glad I did! OK, the novel benefits from its &quot;Southerness&quot;, but I got the sense that such a skilled writer as Gibbons could make proper Bostonians glow in realism. This book is not only a delightful read, but it also touches on the not-so-easy relationships between mothers and daughters, and the equally difficult relationships between women and men. Gibbons also exhibits a detailed (but not obvious) research of the Depression Era, and, on top of it, she makes a sturdy comment about the value of non-traditional medicine. My only complaint is about the book's resolution, which came too quickly and tidily for me. Although I read it in one afternoon, the characters have stuck to my ribs and, the more I think about the book, the more its layers are revealed to me."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're \\"forced\\" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do. I don't understand how anyone can possibly NOT adore chocolate. That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I loved this book. It was the first book i have read by Kaye Gibbons and it certainly will not be my last.The story centers on a turn of the century midwife and follows her life to the end.The granddaughter is telling the story.

It is great!"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"The narrator is top high school student Margaret Birch, who lives with her mother Sophia and grandmother Charlie Kate in a small town in North Carolina in 1940. Charlie Kate is the well-read town medic with no formal training but a whole lot of experience who upstages the doctors from time to time. Margaret can't be persuaded to choose a college, because she loves assisting her grandmother on house calls too much to leave home. Charlie Kate is Margaret's main adviser and confidante. Sophia is a good mother, but she lacks Charlie Kate's wisdom when it comes to unconventional Margaret, who shows no interest in boys, clothes, or cosmetics. Both Sophia and Charlie Kate made bad choices in husbands, both of whom strayed and are now out of the picture. Margaret constantly laments that she wasn't sired by the doctor who Charlie Kate chose as a suitable mate for Sophia but whom both parties rejected. My favorite section of the book is where Margaret is volunteering at a hospital and takes on the task of reading and writing letters for wounded soldiers. Appalled at what they dictate, as well as a screwy Dear John letter that one receives, she and her grandmother fabricate their own letters to send home for these men, with mixed results. These three strong, smart women make this book an uplifting delight from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Gibbons' book is amount three strong women who possess the determination to succeed and do so with their hearts intact.

They all help out the Grandmother who is a midwife/herbalist/medicinal-do-it-all give medical services to the poor and bereft.

This book is absolutely wonderful! It moved me by the strength of Charlie Kate and weaving of the tale of war, romance and a coming of age for Margaret. I have read this book 3 times within the last 4 years and the ending always moves me to tears. This is a fabulous book."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This is my favorite book. I have recommended it to so many people and even given it as a gift to a few.It's wonderful to read a book about 3 strong women.

I could not put this book down and simply fell in love with the characters. They were so real and so alive."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone. It is a testament to women and reading. The characters are great and the story is original. I couldn't put it down!The story is told through Margaret's eyes as a teenager living in the South during World War II. Her grandmother is known all around for being a midwife and healer. Both Margaret and her mom Sophia go along with Charlie Kate on house calls and help take care of the sick. I loved the relationship between these three smart, strong women. They stick together, they watch out for each other, and they take care of everyone. This book has some really sad moments, but overall you feel good reading it.A couple of great quotes from the book:\\"My grief had been plain and unpoetic, and the hole in my heart would've grown wide enough and deep enough to consume me had my mother and grandmother not kept me with them, and still.\\"\\"In our house, the point of reading and learning was neither to impress outsiders nor to get a job or a husband, nothing like that. It had nothing to do with anybody but the three of us. When a good book was in the house, the place fairly vibrated. We trained ourselves to be exceptionally fast readers so a book could be traded around before the nagging and tugging became intolerable......We shared a curiosity about the world that couldn't be satisfied in any other way.\\""},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book is about three generations of strong southern women. My favorite character by far was the grandmother and matriarch, Charlie Kate. She is a self taught healer, and treats her patients with a combination of common sense and tradition. Charlie Kate is feisty and isn't afraid to speak her mind or take on the powers that be. I also dearly loved the relationship she has with her granddaughter (and of course it made me think of my own grandmothers often)."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Not being a woman, or a midwife, or a semi-witch, or a southerner, I'm sure I missed something about this book. It wasn't necessarily bad - I can appreciate the craftsmanship of the text - it just really didn't speak to me on a personal level. Still, not a bad read for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I can't read this book because the Kindle edition costs 3 times more than the printed paperback edition. Whats up with that? It's sad because I have loved every one of Kaye Gibbon's books."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"As I read this book I kept waiting for some catastrophic event to occur, but it never does. The author gives you great characters that live an unconventional life for that time period, yet nothing happens to them. They go about their lives doing good deeds and you the reader are just peering into there goody goody routines. The characters are very well developed and funny even at times a bit corny for me. The best part of this book was that it was short."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"A light wonderful read about 3 women full of sass"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I had to read this book to do a review on for a college class. It was okay, but not one that had me staying up late at night to get to the end. I thought the story shouldn't have ended the way it did. It just seemed like it wasn't finished."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have read several Kaye Gibbon's novels and found this to be a wonderfully passionate and emotional novel. Charlie Kate represents a forward thinking woman who was not afraid to care for sick and desolate people of that era. I found much substance in the novel. I am in the medical profession and felt that Kaye Gibbons did her homework regarding herbal remedies and medical treatments that seemed appropiate. Take time to read this novel it is worth it!"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book is good, but only if you can tolerate the rambling narrative style it is written in. The characters are solidly developed, and the anecdotal episodes are well-done. It can be predictable at times, and I'm not sure if a male audience will like as much as a female audience, but both genders could find this book entertaining. Only the femaile audience may find it enlightening, however. As a college literature professor, I read this book in hope of perhaps using it in a course, but I decided against it. That doesn't mean it's bad; it just means it's a nice piece of light, easy reading which women will enjoy ... and men probably won't."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This story is more than a little farfetched -- quirky unlicensed but sought-after physician grandmother enlightened enough (in the U.S. South, in the 1940s and 1950s) to give abortions and do CPR on colored folk -- silly mom -- plain young girl who has no exposure to males in any form or at any age, who suddenly falls in love with a rich privileged handsome guy with curable war wounds. It instantly blended into a dozen or so such chick-lit feel-good southern stories I've read over the past decade or so, and like them left not a trace on my brain or imagination."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book is a kind and gentle read. There are no startling insights or life-altering observations, but it is worth reading because it does speak of values and ethical behavior. The grandmother is a strong woman whose opinions are revered and who doesn't tolerate fools. She is unfailingly consistent in her outlook and mission, which is to help other people - with or without their consent. Her daughter is lonely and well-meaning, and the granddaughter is growing into herself and her beliefs with help from her grandmother. This book has charm."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbon's Charms for the Easy Life will be a shock for most of us, accustomed as we are to the doomed, dysfunctional women of Southern literature. The book deals with the lives of three generations of hyperfunctional Southerners: Charlie Kate, grandmother and miracle working midwife, her vamp daughter Sophia and her intellectual grand daughter Margaret. Gibbons used WPA interviews as background to the story, and the closer she adheres to the WPA stuff, the more interesting it is. All in all, it is an engaging read with lots of interesting detail on Southern superstitions and folk cures. After a while though, my B.S. counter started to tick. Here are people who came up from nothing, yet manage to have the literary taste of Boston Brahmins. They sail quite comfortably through the great depression with all the comforts -- including indoor plumbing. Despite being an uneducated midwife, Charlie Kate is firmly in control of all the doctors and hospitals in her area, she has a better success rate than the Mayo Clinic, and Margaret, the clever misfit, never seems to have a lonely moment."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book has more substance to it than some of the readers have recognized. If midwives and stories about medicine in the early to mid 1900's interest you, try this story. Or, if exploring mother-daughter relationships that are positive and make you feel good, try this story. If you love learning how people who love each other interact and take care of each other, read this. If you have ever longed for someone that could have the insight to tell you what is best for you and have a riotous sense of humor, read this. If you enjoy a read that takes a difficult time (WWII) and weaves it through the lives of some incredible women, try this story. You can make it very complex, if you must, or simply take the story as it is, and as it was meant to be. You will find yourself thinking back to these characters often, and wishing for that charming life that made living with each other easy. When you have that, you just may have what it takes for an &quot;easy&quot; life. This book can help in the meantime."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have seen negative reviews of this book, but I loved it. My teenage daughter's margin notes made it even more special.While the story may be unrealistic, it is fiction, and why do we read fiction? I read it for escape, and this book &quot;escapes you&quot; to a place where women are strong, where your grandma can tell you everything you need to know, where there are some bad, lost, and abandoning men, but not all men are bad, where life is full of hope and magic is possible.It is literate, with references to many authors we should all read. There is some social commentary, some sadness, some things everyone should know (papaya tablets for digestion, aloe for burns, etc.)Charms for the Easy Life (&quot;depending on your definition of easy&quot; should have been a subtitle) was wonderful. I will be reading more of Kaye Gibbons books in the future.A lovely novel."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbons has one of those rare gifts that not all writers possess: the ability to take the lives of fictional people who are seemingly nothing in a high profile society and make them sparkle with with more interest and more reality-based magic than any heavily financed publicity machine could ever do.You come to believe these three beautiful, strong women and the reasons for why they stand together--not because--but in spite of the unworthy men they've encountered. Grandma Charlie Kate, a smart, literature loving, though uneducated woman, is gifted in natural healings and believes that when a person dies and purges (foam at the mouth), it is all their hopes, dreams, and things left unsaid. She is odd by others' standards, outspoken, and that's what makes people respect her!Daughter Sophia is the more openly dreamy side of Charlie Kate, hopelessly romantic in spite of a disappointing marriage to a man in yellow shoes, and she loves high fashion. She faints easily at the sight of infections when she helps her mother on housecalls, and is mad for a man named Mr. Baines who takes his sweet time going to the altar.Sophia's daughter Margaret tells the entire story of the family's somewhat Hemingway-like suicidal history and recounts their lives mainly around WWII. Margaret is more like Charlie Kate, but she still has enough of her mother in her to fall in love with a wounded soldier who comes from a good home, having broken the circle of bad men on the first crack.Everyone makes such a big deal about the Vietnam soldiers suffering more than any others, and I know that they did their share, but if you read this book and the life breathed into it, you will see that no war and what it does are any good. Beautifully written, easy to accept as nonfiction, and full of bittersweet richness, this is easily a book that should reap rewards for its quiet grace, humility, and strength of character. I love this book dearly, and urge you to read it because of the human interest. You will never forget it long after you are finished."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Contrary to some of the reviews I have read for this book, I found it believable and enjoyable. Just because you come from a rural background does not mean you cannot develop an appreciation for fine literature or are unable to rise above your origins to make a better life for yourself -- college education notwithstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Charlie Kate was an inspiration and reminded me of similar older people who I grew up with here in the much-disparaged rural state of South Dakota. Most of the people living in the 1930s had no other resources besides themselves. They had to rely on their own ingenuity and that of their neighbors, to pull them through. I think that was very well-illustrated in Gibbons' narrative. The main reason I enjoy Gibbons' books is because in spite of all the trauma her characters go through, they rely on humor to deal with it. That is one of the most valuable lessons that can be learned whether you live in urban America or not."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I cannot get enough of Kaye Gibbons! I thought this book was a sweet story and although I read it some time ago, the relationship of the grandmother and granddaughter has remained a lasting memory. I recommend the book as an enjoyable read. If you are looking for something intellectual and deep this is not the book for you. It is a story, entertaining, and reminiscent."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I read the reviews of this book because I wanted to see what other Amazon-ians thought of one my all-time favorites. I now want to jump up and down on my monitor after the Kirkus review. Boo. Hiss. The review criticizes the book mostly for it's Southern storytelling influence and values, and as someone who read it while temporarily living in the deep South, I have to say that those elements made it all the more special. As a &quot;Transplanted Yankee&quot; I not only learned about the South from this book but it make me appreciate the sense of family that is so abundant there. This book moves through generations of women gifted with honorable traits and as a reader I related to a bit of each of them. That, to me, is the mark of an excellent story._Charms for the Easy Life_ is one of the best books you will ever read. I promise. When Oprah selected Gibbons books as her book club selections, I was ticked, but disappointed that this wasn't one of them. This book will lighten your day and paste a grin on your face that will last for days. I highly recommend it...especially for the wintery dark days coming up. This will light a candle in your soul that will warm you for years on end."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbons' \\"Charms for the Easy Life\\" tracks three generations of tough-minded women from the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War Two. Charlie Kate is the larger-than-life character, an \\"Ubermensch.\\" Charlie delivers babies, heals with herbs, reads two books a week, and directs the lives of her daughter, Sophia, and Margaret (Charlie's granddaughter). Since the impressionable Margaret is the narrator, it stands to reason hero worship takes precedence over a more reliable picture of the family's history of the first half of the twentieth century. She recites events before her birth with a fondness that is reserved for those we do not truly know; some warts of the family tree are exposed, such as the history of several suicides that provide some morbid humor. One male family member whose sexual orientation is questioned by everyone except his mother, \\"shot himself after having spent two miserable years grieving over the death of Rudolph Valentino.\\" Women's clothes are found in one of his drawers. The son's mother says, \\"Oh, Charlie Kate. He had a girlfriend. Look at all her things here. I always knew what people said about him wasn't so.\\" Margaret recalls, \\"my grandmother stuffed the dreamland girlfriend's things into a paper sack and marveled that a man would cram his feet into shoes so high and narrow.\\"The meat of the novel centers on Charlie and her indomitable spirit (she surely would be labeled a feminist today). One conflict both Charlie and Sophia have endured, that Margaret is determined to avoid, is the deserting husband. As far as dating advice, Charlie would often say, \\"Kiss all you want. Kissing's fine, nothing more than uptown shopping on downtown business. But if you suffer him to put that ugly thing in you before you're married, do not come to me to ask how to undo what you have so stupidly done.\\" Somehow the three of them live under one roof in Raleigh, North Carolina, and quite well financially, since Charlie's mobile medical business (no license) is booming. Margaret recalls several stories of how grandmother saved this person from a lynching; sewed body parts together, treated malaria, and comforted the dying. After awhile one half-expects to read Charlie donning a cape and running around in tights with a big \\"S\\" on her chest (Charlie would have to wait at least until 1938 when Superman was created).Besides the over-the-top portrait of Charlie, the novel still seems to plow forward as Gibbons fleshes out characters with dialogue that is sharp and has no effects of sounding contrived in order to say something witty. \\"Charms for Easy Life\\" may not offer a rounded character description of Sophia, Margaret, or a realistic one of Charlie, but the novel still manages to enliven a picture of life down South from the turn of the century to World War Two. Life may have not been easy for these renaissance women, but Gibbons sure has afforded us the pleasure to partake in their charms.Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Three generations of women are the focal point of this novel, and though their familial bonds are tight, there are unique characteristics of each that make the reader care for each. Charlie Kate, a headstrong &quot;medicine woman&quot;, says it like it is and won't take no for an answer. But she is not just forthright with her opinions, but also with her feelings for her family. Her daughter Sophia tends to &quot;need&quot; to be someone's companion, whether it be a man, her mother, or her own daughter. Margaret, my favorite character, was raised by the women and gets to experience things in her life that truly define her. I loved how close the three were, and that their traits complemented one another.A book that you hope goes on and on. I read it in two evenings."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"It's a little gem of a book ~~ one I've had in my bookcases for a long time. This past weekend with everyone in my family struggling with the stomach flu ~~ I picked it up to read it as I needed something light and easy to read. It is a lovely insight in a family of three women of three generations. It's mostly about Charlie, the midwife and all-around nurse. Her daughter, Sophia and granddaughter, Margaret were secondary characters but their stories are just as charming.Charlie grew up poor. She married the river ferryman. After their daughter, Sophia was born, they moved inland. Charlie kept her midwife practice going and soon, her husband abandoned her to work on the Ohio River. It was just Charlie and Sophia, till Sophia married a man who made a mockery of their wedding by wearing yellow shoes. While Sophia's daughter Margaret was still young, Sophia became a widow. Then Charlie moved in with them and this is the basis of their story. They lived through life with stories of people and ailments, love and friendship through the years.It really is a charming little book. If you love stories on mother/daughter relationships, this book is for you. If you like stories about people living in rural areas where community is very important, this one is for you. It's my first Gibbons book in a long time and reading it is just as sweet as stealing an afternoon to read it!4-16-07"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This is the fascinating story of three generations, with a midwife/herbalist grandmother, her single mother daughter, and her bookworm granddaughter. The grandmother, Charlie Kate, is a fascinating, well developed character whom the reader cannot help but admire (she reminded me strongly of the aunts from Alice Hoffman's 'Practical Magic'). Somewhere between a medicine woman and a psychic, she was nevertheless predictable, in that she hung around until her daughter and granddaughter's lifes were fixed and then she died. Terribly predictable, but sparkling with its descriptions of WWII Raleigh and the life of an herbalist/midwife. The book leaves you wishing for a grandmother like Charlie Kate and a suitor like Tom Hawkings III.

The tale is interwoven with humor, compassion, and Gibbons' brilliant style. The power of this novel transcend the mere power of the written word - it changes and enriches the reader."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbons has a wonderful way of describing ordinary things and making them extraordinary. This book made me laugh and smile and cry."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I don't know if I would have appreciated this book quite as much if I hadn't listened to the audio version read by the author. This is not your 43rd American president's southern accent. Nothing clipped, cocky, or clumsy about it. Kaye Gibbons speaks earnestly in extended syllables and dulcet tones, her voice imbued with serenity, compassion, and intelligence. Think drawl, not twang. Similar to, but thicker and warmer than even the loveliest of my North Carolinian friends' accents, it transported me southward in place and backwards in time.The audio edition my library carried was abridged, and so immediately upon finishing that, I read the unabridged print version, more because I couldn't bear to leave Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate's company than any feeling that I'd missed something, though it was rewarding to delve even more deeply into their richly-drawn, highly idiosyncratic world. While I quite enjoyed Ellen Foster, as well as all of Gibbons' books (in fact, I prefer Diving Women to Ellen Foster), it didn't impress me nor draw me in nearly so thoroughly as Charms.Since the description Amazon provides of this book is not very detailed, and since I can't do a better job, I'll quote the one from the Harper Collins website:\\"A family without men, the Birches live gloriously offbeat lives in the lush, green backwoods of North Carolina. Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II. Charms for the Easy Life is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer ... even if it means finding it in unconventional ways.\\"If I ever get around to making such a list, I'd say Charms for the Easy Life would be among my top 20 favorite books. It's such a shame that Amazon offers none of Kaye Gibbons' books in audio."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"\\"I have read two books a week for thirty years. I am satisfied that I know everything.\\"So says Charlie Kate Birch, and she's not shy about sharing her knowledge, whether you want to hear it or not. Charlie Kate is an early-1900s North Carolina midwife, herbalist, and self-styled doctor (with no official credentials). She's feisty, outspoken, and somewhat manipulative, but also very civic-minded and generous. You can't help liking her, even if she is a little too full of herself. Her daughter Sophia and granddaughter Margaret live in her orbit and are mostly grateful for the direction she gives their lives as a threesome.Kay Gibbons' writing is highly polished and carefully restrained--a quality I'm coming to appreciate more and more for its rarity. She also has a sly gift for humor that sneaks up on you. One of the characters will make a seemingly dry observation, but if you circle back and read it again, you catch the subtlety and burst out laughing. For example, when her mother Sophia asks God for help in a hurry, Margaret notes: \\"He no doubt knocked Himself out getting to her, as she was such a trophy among his creations.\\"This is a quaint, charming, and at times hilarious story. I really liked the portrayal of these three highly intelligent, book-loving Southern women. They learn from their mistakes and don't take any guff from men.***If you want your own easy-life charm, you'll need to find the hind foot of a white graveyard rabbit caught at midnight, under the full moon, by a cross-eyed Negro woman who has been married seven times.***"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This was first book of Ms. Gibbons I'd ever read. I didn't know who she was until now. Started the book on a flight from Kansas City to Los Angeles. Within 3 or 4 readings, I had it finished and wanted more. Very well written and in an easy, conversational dialogue. I like her writing style and I enjoyed the book very much. HIGHLY recommend."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have read and enjoyed Kaye Gibbons' other works (\\"Ellen Foster\\", \\"A Cure for Dreams\\", and \\"Sights Unseen\\") and I think, with the possible exception of \\"Ellen Foster\\" that she has outdone even herself. The characters- grandmother Clarissa \\"Charlie Kate\\" Birch, a self-taught alternative healer, mother Sophia, the most romantic of the family, and main character and daughter Margaret, practical, intelligent, yet romantic- are unique, they stand out from the average woman of the 1930s-1940s of the South. Yet at the same time, they have the same basic desire, to be loved and respected, as anyone else.Gibbons' portrayal of Charlie Kate as eccentric yet admired by the community for her healing work showed that one does not necessarily need to follow the mainstream in order to be successful and happy. Reading \\"Charms for the Easy Life\\" in fact made me kind of wish I had the education and skills to be an alternative healer."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I enjoyed Kaye Gibbons' Charms for the Easy Life immensely. I thought it was a well-crafted, character-focused novel that explored the deep familial relationships of three Southern women.The book details the lives of Charlie Kate, a smart, stubborn, self-taught healer; her daughter, Sophia, a beautiful woman searching for companionship; and her granddaughter, Margaret, a shy girl growing up in the WWII era. The book follows each woman as she finds love, manages family relationships, and blazes an unconventional path towards her own happiness. Through it all, the women demonstrate an insatiable and admirable thirst for knowledge.The story is told from granddaughter Margaret's point of view. The writing is evocative and engaging. In addition, the character of the grandmother is one for the ages. Uncompromising, set in her ways, and sure of her talents, she is not a woman you will forget easily.The novel is largely about how family cares for one another, about how Charlie Kate, Sophia, and Margaret are each one another's \\"charms,\\" making life easier, happier, and more livable. You will thoroughly enjoy keeping their company for a while."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This is a very good story of women relationships, set in the old timey rural South. Charlie Kate was a tough character, but I guess that is what it takes to survive, especially if you are a woman taking care of yourself and your family."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Like others, I had never heard of this author, until I discovered this novel in a bargain bin. What interested me as I skimmed the book was the location of the novel in the South. Ms. Gibbons writes like McCullers, Welty and O'Connor, not in their unrelenting manner of the Southern grotesque (although there are some gruesome tales of people suffering from all kinds of afflictions), but in their portrayal of vivid, memorable characters. The core of this novel is a three-generation family of intelligent, strong women, and the most remarkable character is the grandmother, a de facto doctor, without a license. She is the healer of the town, but more importantly, she heals her family and gives them the strength to perservere. She gives her daughter and her granddaughter the resolve to leave their cloistered home and venture into life self-assured. Ms. Gibbons' writing is simple, profound and compassionate. My only criticism of this work is that at times I felt that it was a bit simplistic and contrived, but I recommend it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This may be the first school reading assignment that I have ever actually fully enjoyed, except for maybe a few exceptions. I really liked reading this book because it talked about a young girl's life growing up in a family of women, which is something I believe many teenaged girls can at least partially relate to. I really liked how not one bit of it was boring. The author kept it interesting by meshing the main character's grandmother's doctoral experiences with the entire family's daily life. I especially enjoyed how towards the end the author created a bit of a romance between the main character and a young man. Overall, this book is something I could read again in a few years without getting bored with it:)."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"...but I really liked it anyway. In Charms for an Easy Life, talented Kaye Gibbons sticks to what she does best: write about several generations of Southern women. Written as a fictional memoir, it chronicles the lives of a trio of strong willed women within one family, led by Charlie Kate, a turn-of-the-century unlicensed midwife in North Carolina. None of the women in this book have much use for any of the men, remaining together (if conflicted) in their cynical self-sufficiency...until...Read it and find out. A good read."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I'm a Kaye Gibbons fan, and in my opinion this is the best of her books. The relationships were real and complex and reading this book was just a joy. I've given it to several friends to read and will read it again myself."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book to read telling me how wonderful it was. I didn't share in her enthusiasm after I had finished it. I don't think that there was some hidden greatness to it that I somehow missed, I think that this is the type of book that you have to have a very specific taste to enjoy. While the relationships were interesting, I felt that they lacked certain emotions or realities, which alienated me as a reader. As a whole I found it to be an easy read, but flat. I felt that it ended just as Ms. Gibbons was beginning to enjoy herself with Charlie (main character) and it left me feeling indifferent. Unless you enjoy sweet, simple but unoriginal stories, I don't recomend this book."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills. Although the book was long, it was shallow and I expected a deeper plot."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I was vastly disappointed with this novel. I had read and admired &quot;Ellen Foster&quot; and was optimistic when &quot;Charms&quot; was selected by my book club. Unfortunately, the plot was facile, superficial, and unbelievable -- a fairytale with pretensions to reality. The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely &quot;human&quot; qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own. In short, I found this novel insultingly smug and sanctimonious, the kind of novel that gives Southern literature a bad name."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"What a desappointment! As soon as I finished reading Ellen Foster, I was hungry for another book by Gibson. I am sorry to say Charms of the Easy Life did not give any insight of teh characters, they are treated very sketchy, I could not have any feelings for any of them (I adored and admired little old Ellen). This book is boring, boring, boring."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book started off well and you really got a feel for this wonderful and special older woman who was a healer and the central character.

It is on the high school reading list in my town and I thought I'd enjoy it because the town English coordinator who makes up the required and recommended reading lists is a nice man, but I was upset by the characters (except Charlie-Kate), plot, and even the details of the story. I'm not oohing and ahhing over it. You don't need to read it if you don't have to.

In this book, Rink first knew caroline when she was of tender age of fifteen. they fell in love but because of some circumstances they were kept apart.Without any explanation from Rink for his running away Caroline found it hard to wait for him forever and took the chance of having respect and money that she always craved for by marrying a rich but older man. Well till now it isn't so bad, is it? But as it happened that older man was Rink's father and Caroline knew it. Now how is that for feeling antipathy for a woman who married the father of the man she loved? And i don't really blame Rink for being angry with her again and again for what she had done.Caroline wasn't a saint and i don't think any person in her shoes can afford to be anyway. Who knows what i would do if i happened to be in her place? So i wouldn't judge her and would advice other readers to not judge her too.Both the times Rink came in contact with Caroline she was forbidden for him. That part of this romance was best. Their summer romance so many years back was very sweet. Rink's conscience and desire were in fight with each other. i like this in a romance and i like the build of sexual tension in Sandra brown's novel.She really is the best!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"WOW, WHAT A PREDICAMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND THE WOMAN YOU ONCE AND STILL LOVED MARRIED TO THE MAN YOU HATE TO CALL YOUR FATHER?

I bought this book mostly just to see how on earth she could make the step-mother/step-son scenerio work and I was amazed. It started off alittle slow, but it picked up and boy...I didn't want it to end. And if the story about Caroline and Rink wasn't enough, there was a secondary romance between his sweet little sister Laura Jane and Steve going on. This book stirred my emotions with the cruel Roscoe (I was furious!!),Caroline's years growing up with the town drunk, Rink's first wife and her daughter that he missed...there was just so much. I couldn't put it down once I got about half-way and stayed up until 2:30am this morning to see how it ended. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I found Bittersweet Rain to be entertaining. I could not put this book down. I fell in love with Caroline and Rink. If you have time for a short romance this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Okay, so I read this book because I read three others by Brown. I was motivated to do so by the fact that each of the previous books had at least one great sex scene in it. This book has one pretty good sex scene, but is negated and made all the more unlikely by everything that happens later in the story. My biggest problem with the book though is Brown's characterization of women. There are two main female characters: one is a virgin (and complete idiot) who marries the father of the man she loves for no apparently good reason other than to live in his big house; and, the other is a mentally retarded(but in a &quot;endearing&quot; way, i.e., as long as she's being told what to do, she's happy), makes me wonder if its not Brown's intention to propagate the myth that women are all a deficient sub-species when it comes to getting along in life.Brown's main female character in this book wants love under the ideal (i.e., the right) conditions, but needs a &quot;good&quot; man to calm her down, relax her into the groove, and open her eyes to the subliminal realities that can arise from &quot;great&quot; sex even when life is less than perfect. Hogwash! Only the mentally retarded woman seems to understand what joys may be had on the wings of pure desire, and only the mentally retarded one is ready to get down anywhere, anytime with her lover, which, of course, she does not get to do because she couldn't possibly know what she's doing. &quot;What if she has an orgasm?&quot; -- is the question uppermost on the minds of the family. Her big brother decides to let her try sex (by getting married first), but vows to kill the new husband (a crippled man) if sex hurts his little sis. And all the while I was reading this, I was wondering - how'll he find out? Will there be regular debriefings or as long as she's wandering around blissfully oblivious, is everything supposedly fine?Anyway, the main female character, Caroline, is boring, easily manipulated, dumb (as opposed to being legitimately brain damaged), and totally unbelievable. Nobody...I repeat...nobody could be as unaccountably indecisive as this woman. Half the time she's heaving and sweating over the man (his name is Rink?), the rest of the time she's running away from him because she's worried about anything and everything except working things out with him. She's so insubstantial, she's sickening. The male lead sounds delicious sometimes, then he'll say something so stupid you want to throw the book out the window. I'm supposed to be reading these books for fun; nibbling on them between re-readings of Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton. Mind candy, however, has to at least be palatable, or whats the point? If you like your romance with a little reality, drop Brown like a hot rivet. Start by NOT reading this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I must admit, when I first read the back cover of &quot;Bittersweet Rain&quot; I was not expecting to enjoy this book too much. I just could not imagine a love story where the heroine is first married to the father of the hero. Being a Sandra Brown fan, and I buy all of Sandra Brown's releases, I went ahead and bought it. I must say I was not disappointed. The plot turned out to be very good, and kept me interested. The book was also a double treat of romance, with not only Rink and Caroline, the main couple, but with Steve and Laura Jane (Rink's sister). I fell in love with this couple just as much as Rink and Caroline! I would most definitely recommend &quot;Bittersweet Rain&quot;. It was a quick and very sweet read!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"the joy of falling in love for the first time is something you will remember for all of your life. of course the first time you feel your heart break, you'll always remember that too. this is probably the best book ive read dealing with both of those issues. sandra brown has the ability to bring the same sort of excitement to the reader that the characters are going thru as well as the let down. in bittersweet, we have two different love stories going on. the first dating back to childhood between caroline, the daughter of the town drunk, and rink, the son of the towns most wealthy family. the second, between laura jane, rinks sister, and steve, the hired hand. sparks fly between rink and caroline, mostly because of rinks dad, carolines HUSBAND! laura jane and steve are absolutely wonderful. i didnt want this book to end. ive read reviews where people say things like &quot;they felt like friends that i had to say goodbye to when the book was over&quot; but until this book, ive never really understood what that was like. this one is a keeper ::smile"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've read almost all of Sandra Brown's novels, and this one didn't disappoint me at all.

It kept me reading until I found out what kept them together, then the startling truth that kept them together."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"SANDRA BROWN'S BITTERSWEET RAIN takes a more convoluted twist to the plot when the couple in the book, Caroline and Rink are wedged apart by Rink's father, Roscoe with his scathing treachery.However, readers may find it hard to digest the plot of a stepmother in unrequited love with her son.The stunning revelation of Roscoe's plan to ruin his son upon his deathbed remains a shadow over Caroline's undying love for Rink. Despite their strong attraction, Rink cannot cast off the fact that Caroline belonged to Roscoe once.Fortunately, SANDRA BROWN handles the twisted plot with unexpected maturity in her perspective. Caroline and Rink are fuelled by desires but at the same time they tried to fend off the attraction for the relationship is bound to explode in a conservative town still in awe of Roscoe. To fight off the shadow, Rink has to confront himself their bond is too strong such that Roscoe has never once taken his beloved away.Right till the last moment when Caroline fainted at award ceremony dedicated to Roscoe because of pregnancy, readers are gripped by the powerful emotions spun by Ms. Brown. It is savagely tender and their love no less bittersweet. She transforms an unconventional tale into one of simplicity and poignancy with her rousing narrative.For this, BITTERSWEET RAIN is one romance that will wring heartfelt tears for Caroline and Rink, and incessant accolades for this beautiful writer constantly producing textured materials."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to sream with frustration at the characters pig-headedness, yet I could understand their logic. The bickering between them is sweet yet very sexual and sassy. This isn't one of Sandra Brown's finest but it is very intriguing."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've read more recent books by Sandra Brown and really liked them, so I thought I'd give this one a shot. Should have known better. First off, reading the scenes where the heroine, Caroline, is 15, made me feel like a pedophile. And we're supposed to think that some 22-year old guy who takes advantage of an obviously naive 15-year old is a good guy? Just because he oh-so-nobly decides to wait to have sex with her until he tells his dad about her, that makes it OK?Next, how you can you have any sympathy or respect for a romantic heroine who flat out admits that she married a nasty, horrible man for wealth and status? She had a job, she was supporting herself fine. It's not like she was living on the streets and that was her only way out. Chalk up two in the ick factor.Finally, while it was much better handled than the rest of the story, the subplot involving a developmentally disabled girl and a much older Vietnam vet bothered me, probably because Brown was never consistent or detailed in explaining what the developmental disability was. And the descriptions of her actions were inconsistent as to her capabilities. The net result is, it feels a little creepy. And even though she does try to make it sweet, the first time the vet kisses her, he's feeling her up. Which again, makes it feel like she's taken advantage of.All in all, while I still really like Sandra Brown, I'm sticking to her books that were written in the last decade.I would also caution anyone against buying this on a Kindle, as the spelling and punctuation is awful, so that you have to go back and reread whole paragraphs just to figure out what it's supposed to say."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This is the first of Sandra brown's books I've ever read but will not be the last! Not only an author but an artist! She made the characters come to life for me and I could visualize in my mind's eye what they all looked like and even the looks they gave each other! It made me long to be at The Retreat, I can't wait to get another of her books. I hope it's just as good because I'm not sure it can be better!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"If you don't mind relationships where the surviving spouse takes up with a family member or friend of the dead spouse, then you might like this book. But if you're like me, you won't. However, even without my convictions, this book was still pretty sorry. First off, it's slow. Second, the leading lady, who by the way was the main reason I disliked this book so much. (However, judging by the other reviews, I'm in the minority)It might not have been so bad if we weren't made to believe that Rink, the son of the man Caroline married, was the real love of her life, yet she married the father anyway for money, status, and a stupid house. What kind of woman does that? Not one that I could like. The Retreat? PLEASE!!! Give me a break. She must not have loved Rink too much. What made me the maddest about her was her response to the reading of the will. She tells Rink \\"her true love\\" to contest the will in which his father left him nothing, but left his mothers house (The Retreat) to her, his stupid wife. I just could not believe it. I would have said, contest it huh, why don't you just give it back to me you tramp. She was just selfish, stupid, of weak moral character, and she was always putting her nose where it didn't belong. SB tried to redeem her in the end, but it was too late as far as I was concerned. Anyway, bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"What would you do if the person you hated most in the world took everything from you, including your mother and the love of your life? And still he was not satisfied.On his deathbed, Roscoe Lancaster requests that his long absent son come home so that he can see him one last time. His wife complies and the prodigal son is summoned. Of course not on is Rink her stepson, he is also her first (and only) love. Of course Roscoe's motivations for a reunion are not all out of compassion for the son he lost; it is just one more chance to one up him by flaunting his relationship with wife Caroline in Rink's face. Roscoe was the main antagonist who drove the two apart when they were engaging in an elicit relationship (Caroline was 15; Rink was 22 - kinda icky).Rink cannot help himself and his still intense feelings for Caroline. A stolen kiss here; a grope there. But underlying in his thoughts is that his father made love to her first. Can Rink ever get over his pride and declare his love for Caroline?\\"Bittersweet Rain\\" is a melodramatic love story set against the machinations of a truly evil and desperate man, who loves no one, least of all himself. His contempt for the less than perfect daughter (who loves him unconditionally) makes you want to punch him. There is a lot of chemistry between the two leads; but clunky, dated love scenes (his \\"maleness\\"; her \\"feminine core\\"). One of the most endearing qualities of the book is the emerging relationship between Rink's sister Laura Jane, and the disabled ranch hand, Steve.Though a little dated (it was originally written in 1984; re-released in 2000), it was an enjoyable and romantic romp."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Only Sandra Brown will put together the most unexpected couple, step mom &amp; step son. But the story was so beautifully woven that I don't mind at all the weirdness of the situation. Although Caroline was married to Rink's father, she had been Rink's lover even before she got acquainted with Roscoe. Only years after Rink left her to marry somebody else, did she chose the father. For those who are familiar with SB's other books, the relationship between Caroline and Rink resembles Schyler &amp; Cash in &quot;Slow Heat in Heaven&quot;; the secondary characters, Mary Jane and Steve are Janellen &amp; Bowie in &quot;Where There's Smoke&quot; only for Mary Jane and Steve, SB went deeper with their love story. Quite a treat for the readers. Two romances in one book - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I am a long term fan of Sandrea Brown, but this book was a waste of money to buy and a waste of time to read.The male character either has a case of arrested development or child molest tendencies, and even if he had beeen a character in a forensic novel rather than a romance , he would not have been interesting. The female character was equally pathetic for putting up with his obnoxious behavior. I like a good escape novel now and then but this was too unbelievable to be the least bit enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"The story line for this book is good, if you are looking for a Romance by Sandra Brown. The reason for the low rating is the number of the typos in the Kindle edition. It definitely interferes with enjoyment of the book. There should be better quality control.

That is a 'feel good' romance."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"By the time I began reading Sandra Brown novels, she was writing mystery thrillers and I just couldn't buy the books fast enough. Then I was introduced to the miracle of Kindle for PC and I began looking to see which of Sandra's books were in this format. This romantic love story is as well written as any of her mystery books and a welcomed change from that genre, although she tells her readers in a note at the front of the e-book that she wrote this story before she began writing mysteries. The characters are well developed and delightfully diverse. The story line is gripping and has a nice surprise ending. I especially liked her treatment of two social issues in the book. I don't want to spoil it by telling you what they are, but she handled the situations with accuracy and sensitivity. As is the case in all of the Sandra Brown novels that I've read so far, the sex scenes are written with both passion and grace. If you read this book and like it, you should also read \\"Rainwater\\" an excellent literary novel set in the Great Depression era in middle America. I would love to see more of that genre from her."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I loved this little book and couldn't put it down.

However, there were so many typos and gramatical errors that they were a distraction. I found myself counting them up instead of paying attention to the story.

In 50 years of reading, never have I seen so many errors in one short book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book was not one of the usual type that Sandra Brown is known for but it was really good. It kept my attention throughout and I could not skip read to find out the outcome. Excellent."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book starts out with promise, and kept me wondering what really happened to the lovers that kept them apart. Other than the supsense of finding out what really happened between Caroline and Rink, there was nothing good about this novel. The secondary characters seem pointless, as if Brown only included them in her novel to fill space and add more pages to this book. With character names like Rink, Roscoe, and Granger, Brown tries too hard to make this into a romance. There is no distinguished climax to this story, other than Caroline becoming pregnant. I was always taught in English class that stories should have climaxes, and shame on the publishers for not noticing that there is none. It was a big let down to receive this book, which kept me in supsense for a while, and read as nothing came of it. The characters aren't very likeable and Caroline is not the heroine one might expect her to be."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I can't even finish this book-it is that terrible!

This is the first that over half of us did not like. I felt it started out with the &quot;I cannot stop reading&quot; feeling. I wish Caroline's husband, Roscoe had been introduced before his illness. I think he would of added so much more to the story. Roscoe and Rink had a father/son relationship that the author missed. Why the daughter and caretaker? I feel no point was made. We were all put on a high cliff and left without a parachute. Disappointed club member."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This was the first novel I've read by Sandra Brown and I'm glad to say that I was not disappointed. I usually steer clear of contemporary romances (unless it's a book from Judith McNaught), but I'm now real glad that I gave Brown a try; the story was very romantic. I didn't think she could pull it off, with Caroline being married to Rink's father. Their relationship was very sweet though, and the author conveys the tension, love and longing between the couple so well that it was as if nothing was lost between them despite the long separation. The only problem I've had with the book was that I found the names of the characters (Rink!) a bit strange which is a minor complaint which will not deter my appreciation for this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book was interesting, and it kept my attention with all that lovey-dovey stuff, but I think Sandra's way to obssessed with just one topic, and it's not romance."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I wont lie I almost didn't read this book ... The plot of it sounded, to put it nicely, gross. But so far I have liked all Sandra Browns books, and not to my suprise it was great, I read it in one day. The book is about 2 young people who were torn apart by lies and brought back together by death. Caroline was the town drunks child and she grew up with the title. So when she was offered a chance to try to change her title she marries Roscoe (a very wealthy man),and the father of Rink, whom she had a slight past with. When Rink comes home for his fathers death, they find out the passion that he and Caroline had shared was stronger now then 12 years ago when Rink left her behind. And before Roscoe dies he lets known all the secrets of his dirty scams that he was involved in and set up, and the couple has to figure out where to go from there, now that they know the truth.

Am I the only one this has happened to?"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I could accept the premise of star-crossed lovers seperated, only to be brought back together by unhappy circumstance. Even if the circumstance was the marriage of the heroine to the hero's father. Okay, so the father was evil was orchestrated everything. He was cruel and used the heroine, verbally abusing her as well as being physically rough with her.So how is the son different from the father? When he gets angry with her (which is most of the time), he grabs her, mauls her, tells her she's trash, while she fights to get away from him. How is it we're supposed to believe she loves him? Their summer romance was when she was 15, and this is some 12 years later. He certainly doesn't rekindle any romantic feelings by being kind.The sex scenes are embarassing with their euphemisms and overall lameness.The book wasn't a horrible premise. It was just horribly done. A hero should be likeable and it should be obvious why the heroine wants to be with him."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I love her suspense and wasn't sure about the romance type.

You can get so absorbed in it and not want to put it down! The characters are written so real! I highly recomend it! :)"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This was my first Sandra Brown Book. Maybe the many good things I had heard and read about the author had raised my expectations too much or maybe this is just not one of her best works, but I was fairly disappointed with this book.Sure Mrs. Brown adheres to the 411 of romance writing and the basic story is not without originality. But the characters and their actions are as real as the ones in a cheap soap opera, complete with all the tears, screams and clich&eacute; stances (his cornering her, hand against the wall, her walking away turning her back, his standing rigidly, head forward, tight fists by the sides). The heroine was given more maturity with 15 than with 27 and the lead couple was more likable in those flashbacks (these were however well interwoven with the main story). Also, the couple's reasons to stay apart until the end of the book, her concern about her reputation in the town and his pride are really weak. This and some of the character's other flaws kept me from ever relating to either protagonist.Additionally, some of the plot twists were unconvincing (Caroline's sex life with Roscoe); others were easily reconizable crutches to give the couple more time together and later vanished into obscurity. Some promising threads were never tied up. The sexual tension was overbearing and the prolific sex scenes dragged on too long, all for the price of some deeper character exploration.So if you just start out with romances or with Sandra Brown for that matter you can probably make a better choice than this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I bought this book today and I've already finished it. I have read one other title from her and I am now addicted to her work. Her writing flows and has an energy that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. I will now buy anything I can find of hers.

One of them being a 15 year old having a relationship with a 22 year old man. Putting that aside, I still had issues with the story.Rink (I love that name)returns 12 years after his romance with Caroline ended. Caroline is now married to Rinks very rich father and is dying. Rink is bitter about the marriage, but was the one who had ended the relationship with Caroline 12 years before.While the attraction is still there, there's lots of resentment on Rinks part and he's pretty vocal about it. Other than the physical attraction, there just didn't seem to be more to it, in spite of what was written. Also, the story with the father (Roscoe) just seemed to be so not believable.The aspect of the story that I did enjoy was a blossoming romance between Rinks sister, a mildly mentally handicapped woman, with a sweet demeaner and Steve a somewhat cynical man who is recovering from the horrors of Vietnam. It's a sweet story and tells that there is someone out there for everyone. That romance was both believable and sweet."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've only just finished this book yesterday and I've already forgotten much of it. It's just plain unremarkable. There is a villian, the heroine's evil older husband. There are two romances in the story; one of the heroine, and one of the hero's younger, developmentally-disabled sister. The love scenes are trite and although they do not go into graphic detail, there's something vulgar about the language. This novel was written in 1984, and perhaps it read differently then, but I found the dialogue and descriptions during love scenes a bit smarmy. It's not terrible, but there's not much to enjoy either."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"There is no question that this is definately one of my favorite Sandra Brown books.

Not that that is a good thing or a bad thing either way. Rink was gone for twelve long years after breaking Caroline's heart.

She is homeschooled, and listened to it on her own every day (over & over) with no nagging from me. Because of the use of songs, I feel that a child who enjoys singing will gain more from this program than a child who doesn't. (most children's language programs I've found use a lot of singing) The reviewer who disapproved of the use of witches etc. in the book may not understand that the text is very *German*... I found after living in Germany that Germans have their own ideas about what is appropriate for children. (I see no point in learning a language which has been disjointed from its culture.) My daughter was 8/9 yrs of age when she used this program (cassette version) and nothing was offensive or inappropriate. All in all, a wonderful start to your child's study of German! 5 stars for being fun, easy to use, and educational. I only wish there were a level 2!"},{"Title":"German for Children (Passport Books)","review":"I purchased this book and cassette program for my 3 young boys who have an interest in learning German.

Fantasy readers and non-fantasy readers will enjoy."},{"Title":"Flight of Vengeance (Witch World: The Turning, Bk. 2)","review":"These stories are well rounded and interesting. They bring new ideas and flavor to the Witch World saga. Each book set here, whether by Ms. Norton personally, or a collaboration with another, &quot;fleshes out&quot; the place and the times.

This book is written by two great writers, Ron Fortier and Gordon Linzner and with Illustrated by Rob Davis. This two-fisted pulp novel has two great pulp fiction characters from different series clashing for the first time with a fight between Moon Man and Doctor Satan. Plus this book has two different short stories written by Ron Fortier, One is Lady Arcane, Mistress of Magic and the other short story is called Angel in his sights. So if you're a fan of two-fisted pulp a novel, then this is the book is for you."},{"Title":"THE HOUNDS OF HELL - Fortier & Linzner","review":"When I was a kid growing up in the 1970s, I could hardly wait for the next DOC SAVAGE novel to hit the store shelves. It was the amazing covers, I think, that originally sparked my interest, but it was the pulpy overblown epic adventures inside that kept my appetite whetted through book after book.Now those days are back.The mere notion of a new mystery novel featuring return of WEIRD TALES' diabolical Doctor Satan is reason enough to celebrate, but when you toss in the enigmatic Moon Man, surely one of the pulps most wondrously bizarre crime fighters, well, it just doesn't get any better than this!THE HOUNDS OF HELL is a genuine page-turner, a combination epoch crime story of an evil genius terrorizing a great metropolis, blended with all the quick-paced action of a classic Republic serial. The original pulps were filled to the brim with looming evil geniuses and bigger-than-life, incorruptible heroes, and this reader was very satisfied that the veteran authors of HOUNDS, Ron Fortier and Gordon Linzer, serve up the very same delicious concoction.Artist Tom Floyd's fantastic, and appropriately purgatorial, wraparound cover, purely seethes with vintage atmosphere, adding considerably to the authentic feel of this package, as does its mood-inducing b&w; interior illustrations by Rob Davis.Reading this book was the best time I've had in quite a while, and I wish to immediately clamor for a sequel!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE HOUNDS OF HELL - Fortier & Linzner","review":"This novel not only delivers solid, two-fisted pulp action, complete with a diabolical mastermind, it also signifies a major crossover encounter between The Moon Man and Doctor Satan. There were very few crossovers in American pulp fiction (the Red Falcon cameos in G-8 novels and stories come to mind), but a crossover on this scale, with two characters from different series taking center stage and battling to the bitter end, hasn't been seen until now. If you're a fan of the hero pulps - or of the super-villain pulps - and crossovers, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"THE HOUNDS OF HELL - Fortier & Linzner","review":"Not only was this book my first introduction to Doctor Satan, it was also the book that first showed me that there were new stories being told with the classic pulp heroes. I read it years ago and adored it -- I've since re-read it twice more. It features the Moon Man and Doctor Satan going toe-to-toe (with Ascott Keane around, as well). The pacing is spot-on and never boring. The action scenes crackle in a great pulp style and the illustrations capture the characters very well. If you like pulp, you'll like this book -- it's that simple. There's a lot of new pulp being published and most of it slips through the cracks due to the fractured nature of the pulp community -- this one is truly worthy of being considered a modern pulp classic."},{"Title":"THE HOUNDS OF HELL - Fortier & Linzner","review":"What a fun, exciting book! Fortier and Linzner resurrect two great pulp characters from the past-- the semi-good, semi-bad Moon Man, who fights crime outside the parameters of the law, and the thoroughly eeeevil Dr. Satan (what, you thought \\"Dr. Satan\\" was a good guy?!). Throw in a few detectives and innocent victims caught in the middle, and you have a recipe for pure, pulse-pounding pulp adventure. Recommended."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Thousand Cranes is about a young man named Kikuji, whose mother and father have died. His father's presence still weighs heavily on events however, in the form of two of his former lovers, Chikako Kurimoto and Mrs. Ota. The first things we learn about Chikako is that she is having a tea ceremony and has a birthmark on her breast, which Kawabata seems to use to mark her as the outcast in events. And as we will see, it seems Chikako was merely a plaything for Kikuji's father, while Mrs. Ota was a truer love. Chikako is now bitter about this, and meddles hurtfully in Kikuji's life. When Kikuji follows in his father's footsteps and has an affair with Mrs. Ota, Chikako tries to disturb this in many ways, primarily by trying to set Kikuji up in marriage.Kawabata uses the tea ceremony to add meaning to the novel. Much is discussed about tea bowls that have been passed down and used in formal and informal ways. Indeed, just as tea bowls have been passed down through generations, so have lovers, as Kikuji takes first Mrs Ota as a lover, and then later falls in love with her daughter, Fumiko, after Mrs Ota commits suicide in shame over the affair. Kawabata writes beautifully of the timelessness of things in contrast to the transience of human life and love. It is a brilliant formulation, simple in its application but deep in its meaning.I enjoyed Thousand Cranes more than Kawabata's masterpiece Snow Country because it had more energy. There is certainly subtlety here, and as with the tea ceremony, plenty of metaphor. But I was thoroughly engaged by every page Thousand Cranes. There is more drama and more pointed dialogue here than in Snow Country. Thus I think this book would play better with modern readers. This is a good entry point for anyone interested in Japanese literature generally and Kawabata in particular."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"I usually read both the negative and positive reviews and try to reconcile the different viewpoints in writing my own review of an item. In this case, the few negative reviews did not bring an illuminating viewpoint, but rather a lack of understanding of a culture so different from one's own, thus rejecting it as overly sentimental and sappy.However, if you are able to emulate a totally different mindset, belonging to a different time and place and bound by the constraints of a very old and strong culture, then you'll find incredible depth and amazing beauty in this book. I personally found it so enchanting that I read it in one sitting from cover to cover. Where lies the strength? In Kawabata's uncanny understanding of human weakness, selfishness and possessiveness, which so intricately ties to love. The book is short, its language is simple. No supernatural, no shocking revelations and no extraordinary events. Yet, Kawabata portrays a vivid picture of the atmosphere, of each character and of the connection between the characters in the story, dead or living, such that in less than 200 pages you feel Japan's summer heat and the smell of tea as if you've been present amongst these people.Furthermore, to what already constitutes a masterpiece, the writer adds a modern flavor, which is surprisingly refreshing for a work with such classic beauty."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Kikuji attends a tea ceremony held by his late fathers mistress,Chikako, who is making moves to introduce him to a potential bride.To his initial horror, Mrs Ota is also at the ceremony;the woman who replaced Chikako in his fathers affections and was with him until he died.He falls into a doomed relationship with Mrs Ota and her daughter Fumiko.Chikako loathes the liason and manipulates in the background and spreads her poison....And all in a short 100 page novella.Kawabata employs his aesthetic lyrical prose around the Japanese tea ceremony to look at a dying culture and doomed love.A strange and strangely haunting tale where literature becomes an art form in itself, something uniquely Japanese and that I've never found anywhere save in Japanese works.A great record of a vanishing culture that was forced to reinvent itself after the defeat of 1945.A subject very much recorded by the finest Japanese writers;Mishima, Tanizaki etc."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"There is an everflowing current of the past as present, or perhaps vice-versa, throughout the story, as though no time has passed or will pass, or could if it would, would if it could, as time is omnipresent though it doesn't really exist unless you look and depends on all from where one looks. Kawabata is looking in all directions: &quot;He gazed at it for a time.

Two of Kikuji Mitani's father's mistresses insert themselves into Kikuji's life. He falls for one of them, and later her daughter. A tea ceremony is central to the story, but it's meaning is a little lost on this Westerner. It's a short novel, but one I'm afraid I just didn't \`get.'I also own Kawabata's Snow Country, which I still plan on reading at some point, but unfortunately I didn't find Thousand Cranes to be all that exciting.Thousand Cranes by Yasunari Kawabata, was first translated into English in 1958. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, and he died in 1972."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"This is the second book I've read by Kawabata and it was awesome. I first read Snow Country which is excellent as well. I find it better when reading this syle of prose to read slowly and little bits then let it sink in before moving on.

But that book was great too."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The book seems intriguing enough; it is said to be written with brush strokes, like a Japanese painting. In fact, I found it pompous, vapid, and self-enamored. True, it has charm in that it is not long-winded, and some of Kawabata's symbolism is well-crafted. What the book has in skill and craft it lacks in insight and interest.Admittedly, Thousand Cranes is a book that every reader will react to somehow, which is makes it a better accomplishment than some other novels. Some readers will no doubt react with awe; I personally reacted with revulsion."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The sentimental and sexual education of a young man, who gets entangled in a spider web concocted by one of his father's mistresses.The story is shrouded in an emotionally restrained and melancholic (remembrances of the passed away) atmosphere, which is always brutally broken by the interventions of the devilish intriguer.The novel is full of symbols, but should more appeal to the Japanese than to foreign readers. The tea ceremony is an important part of it, e.g. the author relates the deep impressions made by tea sets on the participants (because they have hundreds of years of age and their ancestors drank already out of them).Some reactions of the main characters seemed to me exaggerated and they cried nearly on every occasion.Only for the aficionados of the Japanese novel."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Words fail me in the effort to express the superhuman act of will which was required to continue reading this book after the opening scene, wherein a young boy, Kikuji, spies his father's mistress clipping hairs from the birthmark which covers most of her breast. Try shaking that image from your head. At any rate, Kikuji, now a grown man, becomes involved with both another mistress of his now deceased father's and her daughter. Meanwhile, the birthmarked mistress somehow feels free to meddle in his life and tries to set him up with another young woman. All of this is set against the backdrop of the ritual of the ancient Japanese tea ceremony. Eventually, as it must, tragedy strikes as one woman after another commits suicide.Yeah, so?If the word dysfunctional did not exist, it would have to have been invented to describe Kikuji's romantic life. As if wading through your old man's detritus was not bad enough, topping it off by pursuing a mother and daughter would have to be described as begging for trouble. Add to this the fact that none of the characters are terribly likable and that Kikuji is almost completely passive and you've got a book that is hard to fathom or to like. Ultimately, I felt like there were too few suicides--I wanted them all put out of my misery and that birthmark trimming schtick purged from my memory.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Many consider _Snow Country_ to be Yasunari Kawabata's masterpiece, and while I am inclined to agree with this judgment, it would be a mistake to overlook _Thousand Cranes_, an amazing study of relationships by the modern Japanese novelist.Kawabata's writing is often compared to the haiku form of poetry due to its concise effectiveness. Each word in _Thousand Cranes_ seems to have been chosen with extreme care, and the result is an engaging tale about the consequences of a love affair.In a sense, _Thousand Cranes_ is about the presence of the dead among the living. One must keep in mind that Kawabata was a master observer when it came to relationships between men and women, and to the relationship that men and women have with death, that ultimate certainty in the life of every living being. _Thousand Cranes_ is a subtle, detailed, and profound exploration of these relationships.The writing style in this novel is the style that made Kawabata famous, and for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968. The characters are believable in their flaws and obsessions. Some of the images, such as that of Chikako's birthmark, will stay with you for a long time. The use of the Japanese tea ceremony as the background for the plot represents an interesting literary device and adds depth to the action, which takes on the character of an ancient ritual._Thousand Cranes_ is a highly recommendable novel. If you have read Kawabata before, you won't be disappointed. If you have not, perhaps _Snow Country_ would be the ideal place to start (after all, _Thousand Cranes_ is considered to be the second part of the thematic trilogy that began with _Snow Country_, although the characters are not the same), but in any case, _Thousand Cranes_ is a fine example of the genius, subtlety and depth that established Kawabata as one of the most significant authors of world literature.Thanks for taking the time to read!Later..."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"This well-known Kawabata masterpiece is about a young man who has an affair with two women, both past lovers of his deceased father, a few years after his passing. Because of the women's conflicting personalities the affair(s) have very different impacts on them; one retreats into a guilt-riddled depression, and the other turns into a cold and vindictive schemer. From this bee's nest the story then shifts to the protagonist realizing of his affections to the daughter of the depressed mistress, and in typical Kawabata fashion it is a pseudo-romance explored with great subtlety and poise.This book is every bit as good as Snow Mountain (it isn't mandatory to compare all his work with each other, but it does give you a bit of perspective). Whereas the former is more about loneliness and a connection with nature, this one focuses more on family, truth, and regret. The tea ceremony is an important metaphor here, and fittingly backdrops two young and confused people who begin to care deeply about the other, but due to past circumstances can only express themselves through circuitous trivialities. The actual plot is a little more than noticeable than in Snow Country as well, and the story is of course written in an overall manner of keen sensitivity and perhaps despair. Excellent reading for anyone interested in Japanese literature or otherwise. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"To fully appreciate this novel, you must understand something about the Japanese culture, specifically courtship and the tea ceremony. Kikuji is a sexually active young bachelor and he is unable to overcome the shadow of his father's past with two women, neither of which is his mother. Chikako is a woman with an odd birthmark on her breast and when Kikuji was eight or nine he was with his father when he observed Chikako snipping the hairs on the birthmark. That one sight had a powerful affect on him, even now he thinks about it on a regular basis. Chikako was also one of the women that his dead father was in love with and she plays the role of the conniving shrew throughout the novel.Mrs. Ota was another one of his father's lovers and now Kikuji has taken his father's place as her lover. This is further complicated by the fact that Mrs. Ota has a daughter (Fumiko) that is a prime candidate for marriage. Kikuji is an uncertain man; he is very interested in Fumiko but cannot bring himself to consider the possibility of an intimate relationship. When Mrs. Ota commits suicide, Kikuji and Fumiko are able to get together, despite the vile rumors that Chikako spreads about Fumiko. Unfortunately. Kikuji is unable to correctly pursue the girl; his past binds him too tightly for his present to take a proper course.The role of the Japanese tea ceremony and flower arranging is an integral part of the story and there are many references to specific forms of utensils used in the ceremony. This is the aspect of the novel that will confuse people that lack an understanding of how important the tea ceremony is in Japanese society. Yet, this book is a masterpiece of literature as it does what the best examples do, it opens your eyes to other aspects of life that you otherwise most likely would not have encountered."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Kawabata's novel gives amazing insight into the Japanese traditions of family ancestors, as well as insight for anyone who has felt tied to their parents. Kikuji's struggle to find himself and his independence from the memory of his father signify the struggles of youth at the death of a parent in modern times. Brilliantly executed, it is quite possibly one of the best novels to ever come from Japan."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Kawabata, in this book, produces a characteristic sense that, yes, indeed, this is true: that the author not so much invents or writes as records facts.Repressed passions and pain, conflicted desires, apathy, pessimism and hopelessness are all part of Kawabata's landscape, as well, and here, he has found a setting for these emotions in tea. Know nothing about tea? It's allright, you know something about life, and that's what we're talking about."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Being a huge fan of Japanese literature, and Kawabata in particular, I knew I would enjoy this story even before cracking the cover open. It is rather subliminal. Kawabata takes the reader on a journey, but he allows the reader to fill in the story. More is said with what isn't written than with what is on the paper. True to 20th century Japanese literature, the writing is crisp, straightforward, and without fluff.I found the characters all very interesting. Honestly the least interesting was Kikuji, but as a main character he works. The more interesting characters are Ms. Ota, Fumiko (her daughter), and the despicable Chikako.One does not need to fully understand the tea ceremony to enjoy the subtlety of this novel. In fact, the publisher has a forward which briefly describes the ceremony. For those unfamiliar, just do a web search for 'tea cottage' or 'Japanese tea ceremony'. It is a slow process which the attendees follow carefully prescribed etiquette. The pieces used for preparation and service are admired for their age and beauty. Everything to the setting, the wall scroll(s), flowers, even the open 'door' of the cottage are deliberate. It is similar to viewing cherry blossoms in the respect that it encourages Japanese people to slow down and enjoy nature while forgetting the bustle of everyday life.Throughout the novel the themes of fate and decay reappear. Pay particular attention to the tea vessels, their colors signify deeper meanings. And they translator has included a few footnotes to help describe the origin of particular pieces.This is a stunning, haunting novel from one of the greatest Japanese authors of all time."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The attention to detail, delight in beauty and observation of seasonal change which are, to me, important aspects of Japanese life are all here. This is a beautifully written account of the relationships between the young protagonist and two of his dead father's mistresses, the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of one and the daughter of another. The tea ceremony features prominently, symbolizing these relationships. A work of beauty and charm."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The \\" literary\\" merits of the work are well discussed elsewhere. What may not be appreciate is how compelling and \\"readable\\" this novel is. New to Kawabata, I read through it in a single setting , enthralled by the subtle artistry of the writer that combines with the moving story of forbidden love to produce a quietly devastating impact."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The style is very Japanese which means it's a bit sparse, a bit distant, a bit cerebral. Thousand Cranes is a story told through tea ceremony--in fact, an incredible portion of the book is dedicated to discussing the types of earthenware used in tea ceremony. If you don't know anything about Japanese tea ceremony, you could get a bit confused about why so much emphasis is placed on it in the story.When I finished, I felt let down. The imagery was beautiful, the emotions were real, but there was just something missing. The dialogue felt more like a play than like a novel (a problem with the translation, perhaps?), and the characters are (I'm sure purposefully) erratic and hard to pin down. While this could have been intriguing, the book was a little too short to make the effect anything but unfulfilling."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Although I have always been a voracious reader, the first time I read this book it almost put me to sleep. I was 23 years old and I got to the end of it, flipped it closed and wondered: \\"Hmmm, a bunch of people drinking tea. I wonder what that was all about?\\"Many years later, after being married for two decades to a lovely and intelligent Japanese woman, after a thousand hours of instruction from her in the finer points of Japan's subtle, but wildly erotic history and culture, after uncountable forays into the night world of Japanese entertainment, after tutored watching of hundreds of Japanese movies and dramas, I returned to this book again. One chapter in, I found my heart racing: \\"WOW! this is FILTHY!\\"The book is definitely not about people drinking tea.And filthy it is, but in a lovely subtle and artistic manner. I can now easily imagine the middle aged men of the Nobel prize committee falling all over themselves to award Kawabata the Nobel prize after reading this. (The Snow Country is excellent as well). However, if you are a multitasking 23-year old with MP3 headphones in your ears and five internet chatter sessions crawling around on the screen in front of you, don't bother with this book - you won't get it. Wait until you are older and have experienced hopes and disappointments, loves and frustrations. Wait until you have had some wonderful, messy relationships that you aren't proud of, that ended badly, but were somehow sweet as well. Then come back to this book on a quiet morning and have a great read!"},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The metaphor used in \\"Thousand Cranes\\" is tea, but not simple dried leaves in boiled water. Along with tea, in the tradition of the Japanese tea ceremony, is the complete picture created by the individual pieces of the art, bowls and whisks and jugs for carrying water. The various utensils, each with their own pedigree, are only able to find their true use in the hands of a Master of tea.In this story, the metaphor is skillfully brought to play in Kikuji, who has inherited his father's women and guilty past in the same way that he has inherited his tea cottage and collection or rare cups and utensils. Chikako, a discarded mistress of Kikuji's father, is the poisonous Master of tea, manipulating others with the same subtle skill she maneuvers the ceremony. In equal measure, Fumiko, daughter of Kikuji's father's favorite mistress, also struggles under the burden of inherited guilt, even while seeking to escape, giving her mother's tea items to Kikuji as gifts yet not able to free her mind with the same ease.True to Kawabata's style, the unsaid rings much more loudly than the dialog, and surface tone of calm belies a raging whirlpool sucking the characters deeper and deeper. I found \\"Thousand Cranes\\" a captivating read, and was unable to put it down until I had finished the story. A small book, it does not lack for power."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Mishima Yukio, that troubled, brilliant, versatile author of numerous great novels, said that if a Japanese writer was going to receive the Nobel Prize, it should be Kawabata Yasunari. The latter did win the prize in 1968, four years before his death. Both Kawabata and Mishima should be numbered among the great writers of the 20th century, both committed suicide, and both were Japanese. That's where the similarity ends. Any novel of Kawabata's opens the deep treasure of Japanese understatement, the minimalist style of sumi-e, haiku, and Noh theatre. Every sentence says less than expected, but as some people like to say nowadays, \\"less is more.\\" So true. THOUSAND CRANES is brief and to many Western readers could appear overly simple and without strong flavor. To assume this would be to miss the main attraction of the novel, which, admittedly, might not be for everyone. In delicate brush strokes, the author deftly paints the picture of a complex relationship which would have attracted Henry James, had he not been so stoutly Victorian in his choice of plots. A young man has an affair with Mrs. Ota, his father's former mistress, rejects the meddling of a second woman, also a former mistress of his father's, and is attracted, full of guilt and hesitation, to Mrs. Ota's daughter. Like much Japanese writing, the novel is full of natural symbols as well as the signs of the seasons. Tiny details assume great importance, take on important symbolism----two tea bowls used by deceased lovers, an ugly birthmark on a woman's breast----details which would be drowned in the mass of verbiage present in most Western writing. Tea ceremony and the delicate beauty of old ceramics suffuse the pages. The novel is about sex, love, guilt, revenge, and the need for children to outgrow their parents' transgressions. The stunning part is that these words are almost never mentioned ! There is a belief in Japan that if a sick person can make a thousand paper cranes (origami style), they will recover. The title thus refers to a healing process, though the thousand cranes appear only on a kerchief carried by a girl whom the protagonist does not marry. This novel is a tour de force by one of Japan's and the world's best modern writers. If you want to try something completely different, I strongly recommend THOUSAND CRANES."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Yasunari Kawabata was truly an artist with great taste. He was a great painter in disguise of a writer. Reading his work is like wandering alone in Japanese art gallery in a chilly day, looking at painting after painting while pondering over your own thoughts, savoring the beauty of color and at the same time being transported by the delicacy or even the tiniest details of his literary brushstrokes. Every word or gesture in this story has meanings in itself even if it was inexpicitly expressed. The suppressed passion, guilt, revenge and jealousy intertwined beautifully among the backdrop of tea ceremony, thousand cranes kerchief, iris vase in the alcove, the lipstick stain on the rim of the teacup, the double star, the fireflies etc. This is certainly not the book for everyone. For those who are looking for a book that full of plots, or a book that inundated with overdone passion or actions, this is definitely not for you. But for those who want to explore complex and artistic Japanese minds, Zen philosophy which is the backbone of the famous cliche &quot;less is more&quot;, the beautiful combination of domestic life and nature, this book is a gem. Kawabata is by all account worthy of Nobel prize for literature. This is the book I cherish and feel wonderful every time I read and re-read it.Strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Sex, lies, suicide, and tea. This slim novel by Nobel Prize winner Kawabata Yasuni deals with Kikuji Mitani and his encounters with a wide variety of women: the poisonous Chikako, the haunted Mrs. Ota, and Fumiko, caught between her shame and her desire. The books moves at a leisurely pace, touching upon numerous subject: propriety, shame, and revenge. Kawabata shows his mastery here, crafting each character carefully, with precise nuance. I would recommend this book if only for the character of Chikako: both monstrous and tragic, she is one of the most interesting characters you will encounter in literature. Some Western readers will be off put by it's slow pace and decentralized plot, but the details and characterization will win you over in the end. One word of warning: although extensive knowledge of the tea ceremony is not need, and a brief introduction will fill you in on basically everything you need to know, readers may miss some of Kawabata's lush symbolism when it comes to the tea ceremony and the tea utensils. But even without that layer, it remains a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Although told in a simple style, this book explores the very complex responses to human interaction. The setting of the initial scene is a tea ceremony with the following primary characters: Kikuji, a bachelor whose parents are dead; Chikako, a bitter ex-mistress of his father and the go-between for a proposed marriage; Mrs. Ota another mistress of his father and her daughter.Kawabata is superb in showing us the complex feelings that Kikuji and Mrs. Ota's daughter have towards his father and the two mistresses. While the responses are primarily shown through the action, the tea ceremony and the utensils surrounding it play a significant symbolic role.This book is well worth putting on a must read list."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Although an appreciation for traditional Japanese culture and a knowledge of the ancient ritual of the tea ceremony are helpful. this book is enjoyable regardless of either. The protagonist, Kikuji Mitani, is caught in an intergenerational and gender war between two of his deceased father's mistresses. The jealous Chikako dutifully tries to arrange a marriage for the young Mr. Mitani after his natural mother's death. However, her rival, Mrs. Ota intervenes, bringing great shame to herself and her daughter, Fumiko, in whom all of her mother's transgressions are concentrated. This is a story about the power of tradition and social mores, and respecting our place in the great continuum of life. The novel is short (147 pages) and concise. The content is complex but beautifully illustrated by Kawabata. This is an excellent piece of literature in all aspects."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"The crane is a symbol of long life in Japan, ironically enough for this story. The title of the book comes from the cranes decorating a kimono worn by a significant guest at the tea party about which this story revolves. My favorite of Kawabata's novels, there is in Thousand Cranes a deep primordial eroticism. That is normal in Kawabata's work, but this story evokes perhaps the best example, even better than Snow Country. One of the satisfying pleasures of reading Kawabata is that he puts you in touch with Japan's sexual tension in the way a good Bordeaux might have connected you with enjoying red wines. You realize immediately you're onto something complex, and it is going to take a while to understand its depth.If you can imagine love and desire in the quality of an intense dream, that is how this story begins to unfold. But like a cherry blossom, that kind of love is fleeting. Reality barges in to destroy its budding beauty. Withering jealous resentment worms its way into love it cannot abide, insinuating itself to take its revenge for perceived offenses, perhaps inherited. Alexander Pope wrote a poem about love between Peter Abelard and his student Eloisa that on one level reminds me of the depth and quality of feeling Kawabata manages to craft in Thousand Cranes. It is the kind of love some cannot live with. Here is an excerpt from one stanza in Eloisa's voice that I think captures that understated texture of desperation in Kikuji's and Fumiko's relationship in this novel:Far other dreams my erring soul employ,Far other raptures, of unholy joy:When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.Oh curs'd, dear horrors of all-conscious night!How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!Provoking Daemons all restraint remove,And stir within me every source of love.I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.I wake--no more I hear, no more I view,The phantom flies me, as unkind as you.I call aloud; it hears not what I say;I stretch my empty arms; it glides away.To dream once more I close my willing eyes;Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!The end of Thousand Cranes is haunting. I don't believe there is anything in Japanese culture more profoundly different from the Western view of things than how one lives with love or fails to do so, or for that matter how a good author writes about it. Restraint is the word that comes to mind. That, it seems, is what this story is about."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"This masterpiece moved me to the very depths of my soul. The powerful writing beguiled me into its world. The book itself is the essence of Zen, the words the utterances of zen--in which the story and its characters pale in importance. No one has ever written more beautifully."},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Snow Country and Thousand Cranes exemplify Kawabata's mastery of the subtle and not-so-subtle nuances of human psychology. Yet what amazes is his almost Haiku-like precision and pithy brevity. For me, each sentence exploded off the page. When I returned to the first paragraphs of Thousand Cranes I was amazed to see that these few spare sentences somehow contained, or rather encoded like DNA, the whole essence of the novel"},{"Title":"Thousand Cranes","review":"Thousand Cranes is a beautifully and simply written tale of human tragedy. Kawabata takes us, with subtle nuance and few words, into the strongly passionate and complex world of human relations.With the world of Cha dou (the way of tea) as the back drop, what follows is an intricate web of deceit and revival of old repressed emotions, which are intricately woven with a Zen like quality between the characters as the story progresses.A young man, Kikuji, gets an invitation to a tea ceremony by Chikako, the long ago spurned mistress of his dead father. He doesn't know that it is a manipulation on her part to set him up for an arranged marriage meeting with a student of hers. Also showing up at this ceremony is the woman, Mrs.Ota, who took Chikako's place as Kikuji's father's long time mistress. Chikako has been jealous of Mrs. Ota and conspires against her and her daughter while she insinuates herself into Kikuji's life.Mrs. Ota, still in deep grief over the loss of Kikuji's father, connects with Kikuji at the ceremony. The fine line of reality gets blurred when both of them start feeling a deep nostalgia about the father, and they sleep together, filling Kikuji with an awe of the sublimeness of woman that he has never felt before and offering Mrs. Ota a temporary reprieve from her pain.Ota's daughter, Fumiko, takes on the guilt of her mother's past with Kikuji's father and the new development of what has happened between her mother and Kikuji, and begs Kikuji to stay away from her mother and to forgiver her.Chikako is a bitter woman who stayed in Kikuji's household even after the affair with the father was over, and is: conniving, cruel, and cares not about who she hurts. She has become a Tea Ceremony master and it is in this context that she does her manipulating and ruining of lives.Centered in all of this is Kikuji, as was his father before him. While he doesn't really want to deal with the recriminations of his father's past, he is forced to do so. He feels loathe to marry even though he finds the girl introduced to him very fine. With Mrs. Ota he feels both something warm and freeing, and yet, he also feels the need to hurt her at the same time, wondering if she is seeing his father in him. Chikako keeps forcing herself into his space and he doesn't do much to deter her from doing so even though he despises her. And she takes advantage of that by trying to manipulate his life against him.Outside of that, he develops a very sweet relationship with Fumiko, who is really suffering about her mother's past and recent actions, and he tries in some way to ease her pain. The line gets blurred here as well as he has a hard time distinguishing between her and her mother, seeing her mother in her until the end when he sees her as separate.All of this culminates in a final tragedy that seems a waste.Although an actual traditional Tea Ceremony is not ever explicitly done in this book, the tradition and refinement of it is passed on through the accoutrements, which are hundreds of years old, and which have passed from Mrs. Ota to Kikuji's father and from Kikuji's father to him. The use of these tea bowls and utensils through out the story keeps a thread of connectivity and deep emotion going between the characters and suggests a continuum of tradition, and, breakage from it as some of the bowls get destroyed.Kawabata's writing is a pure expression of the Japanese mind and culture, which I feel westerners will not understand immediately unless they have had some exposure to the eastern way of thinking. I myself spent years living in Japan, studying the language, trying to grasp the Japanese mind, which is illusive at best, even now. However, if you are willing to read this book outside the confines of the western mind, with another part of you, then this book is an exquisite work of poetry and art that is well worth the experience."},{"Title":"Strands","review":"STRANDS is an outstanding and gruesome horror novel. I read it many years ago and recently picked it up to see if it was as good as I remembered and it was. It tells the story of a man who is hung by a group of vigilantes. The murderers are not 100% sure of the man's guilt but seem to need to punish someone for the rape and murder of a young girl in the town. Once the deed is done, the men cut up the hanging rope and distribute pieces (or strands) of it as a reminder of the deed, so everyone will remember their part in the act. Decades later, as the son of the hanged man comes to town to try and understand what happened, the members of the hanging party are killed by the vengeful spirit of the dead man AND even the spirit of the murdered girl. This is a fantastic novel of revenge beyond the grave and has real fear in it. Not for the faint hearted but highly recommended for fans of horror. From what I've read, it is Kisner's finest acheivement."},{"Title":"\\"King Henry VI\\": Pt. 3 (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"If you are a student of drama and/ or Shakespeare Arden is the best edition for graduate work (Norton for undergraduate work and Oxford is making a good show for either)."},{"Title":"\\"King Henry VI\\": Pt. 3 (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"This was one of Shakespeare's earliest plays. (possibly his third) Yet, there is nothing to indicate he was only starting out. Right away he grabs our attention with the funeral of King Henry V. Henry V's brothers Bedford and Gloucester help us to see the virtues and strengths of the deceased king. The Bishop of Winchester is well drawn as a comical villain who plots and plans, but never succeeds in doing any real damage. (Not until the next play anyway.) Talbot is memorable as the selfless hero of the play. York is memorable as the hero who defeats Joan of Arc. King Henry VI himself is interesting. First we see him as a helpless infant. By the third act, we see that he has both strengths and weaknesses. He makes the mistake of dividing the command between the rivals Somerset and York. But also, we see that he does not tolerate treason or neglect of duty. There are also many memorable scenes. The garden scene that foreshadows the War of the Roses is well drawn. The scene where York comforts his dying uncle is tragic beauty. Bedford's death in 3.2 has almost a divine tone. The death of Talbot and his son is very lamentable. York's sudden rise to power is captivating. Perhaps Shakespeare's greatest achievement in this play is that he simultaneously shows us England's war with France and the dissension with England itself."},{"Title":"\\"King Henry VI\\": Pt. 3 (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"This is not quite as good as 1 or 2, but it is still excellent! Shakespeare grabs us with the dispute between Henry VI and York. While it seems to end peacefully it does not, and the war goes on! York's death in 1.4 is another landmark in Shakespeare's writing. The scene (2.5) where Henry finds true terror is horror, sorrow, and yet beauty and yet another moving part of the play. (The son that hath killed his father and the father that hath killed his son.) The war pauses in disaster for Henry and some comic relief is offered. But the horror starts all over again when Edward IV and Warwick have a falling out. The war starts over again, and the King of France gets involved! The scene where King Henry VI is reinstated is a scene of beauty and hope. While all of this is happening, Shakespeare carefully prepares the monstrously satanic character of Richard III. From here, the play just gets more and more bloody. A final moment of horror is offered when the eventual Richard III proudly compares himself to the one who betrayed Christ. In part 4 &quot;Richard III,&quot; the real terror begins!"},{"Title":"\\"King Henry VI\\": Pt. 3 (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"The three books that cover the life Henry VI are each masterpieces in their own right.

It is probably a good idea to read this book if you want to write parallel code, or if you just want to know why large scale supercomputers are not in wide use today.Previous uniprocessor architecture knowledge is required for the more interesting chapters.

If you know nothing about horses or all the hard work and dedication required in caring for them, whether race horses or not, then you get a glimpse at how hard the job is.

She had everything including a successful, good looking fianc&eacute; who after arriving home on Christmas eve dropped a bombshell telling Leigh that he'd met an old flame from his college days, and had fallen in love all over again - only not with Leigh. Obviously, she needed to regroup and take a look at her life up to that point. Hopping in her car, she left for parts unknown arriving in a small town in the Virginia horse country, taking a minimum wage job, and a tiny cozy apartment. There she would meet crusty Bibs McBride, stable owner and ultimately the one-eyed horse Silver Dreams. Buying Silver Dreams, caring for him and finally riding again she discovered his remarkable speed and with the help of a cantankerous trainer, Whit Riley, entered the high stakes racing world. With a one-eyed horse, and the two wounded souls of Leigh and Whit they would all embark on a journey of healing to ultimately find fulfillment of dreams they once thought were lost.*** This was a very well-written and fast paced story. Facts revolving around horses, their care, the racing aspect was extremely well-done and well-researched. From one horse lover to another this will definitely prove to be a great read. The relationship between Bib and Leigh was thoughtful and very heart-warming as Bib was able, with her down home logic, to show Leigh what was truly missing in her former fast track life. Once Leigh was able to let go of her control issues, and sense of abandonment, and look at what it was she now had, she would be able to embrace the happiness that was right there in front of her. The romance aspect between Leigh and Whit was mild, but sweet with the main thrust of the book focused more on the Cinderella horse - Silver Dreams. What few problems Leigh and Whit encountered towards their romantic involvement were secondary to the action of Silver Dreams training, care and races. For those looking for a wonderful horse story - this is the winning ticket, but definitely put your money on the Place ticket for the romantic angle in this book. For a horse lover such as myself - I totally enjoyed this read and have no trouble in recommending it to others."},{"Title":"Silver Dreams","review":"When, on Christmas Eve, protagonist Leigh Meredith's fiance suddenly breaks their engagement to pursue another woman, Leigh is forced to evaluate her place in life. She realizes that she was never really in love, and furthermore, the rest of her life isn't making her happy either. She has a successful career at a prestigious Manhattan advertising agency, but somehow it feels empty and unrewarding. Needing some time for herself, she relocates to a small country town in Virginia. Here she meets Bibs, the owner of a local stable, and this soon leads to Leigh's purchase of an injured, run-down horse named Silver Dreams. As the horse recovers, however, Leigh realizes that the 5-year-old Thoroughbred, though unraced, possesses an impressive amount of speed, and she becomes increasingly interested in the possibility of turning him into a champion racehorse.This primary, equestrian plotline opens the way for the secondary story in the book - one with a more romantic tone. Leigh's quest for a trainer for Silver Dreams leads her to Whit Riley, formerly a great horseman but now a reclusive, downtrodden man with a drinking problem, haunted by his own unfortunate past. At first he is reluctant to get involved, but Leigh's persistence convinces Whit to give Silver Dreams a chance. The project turns out to be just what he needs in order to restore purpose and direction to his life. And, not surprisingly, a personal relationship begins to blossom between owner and trainer as the succeeding months pass.First-time author Sondra Rice Newman has created a fast-paced equestrian story that will provide an uplifting diversion for horse-loving readers. The story is a bit predictable and idealistic - everything seems to run just a little too smoothly for the main characters as far as the racing world goes, especially given the horse's rocky past and Leigh's inexperience as a horsewoman, and the relationship between Whit and Leigh felt contrived at times - but the plotline is exciting and still kept me reading. If I had one major disappointment here it would be that the horse himself did not have much of a personality in the story. The book focuses more on the lives of all the humans around him. And the fact that, with the exception of Bibs, everyone always refers to the horse by his full registered name, Silver Dreams, makes him seem that much less real. The full name begins to feel repetitive and unwieldy, and a nickname (Bibs calls him 'Sil') would have sounded more natural.What impressed me about the book was that, from a horsewoman's point of view, the details are realistic. Newman is herself a horsewoman and it shows, which is relieving. It's always a disappointment to start a horse story only to find that the details are all wrong, but this doesn't happen here. I was particularly impressed to find that the author has her facts straight regarding both horse color genetics and Thoroughbred pedigrees. Moreover, readers NOT already versed in the nature of the horse world need not worry. The protagonist herself has only a small amount of past equine experience, so Bibs and Whit have plenty of opportunity to explain equestrian terms and procedures the reader may not be familiar with. On the whole, this is a nice light-hearted story, appropriate for horsewomen and non-horsewomen alike."},{"Title":"Silver Dreams","review":"The bond of love between a horse and its owner is very special.

Then, as stories like this so often do, Leigh's life is thrown into a tailspin when her companion of three years returns from a trip to his hometown to announce they are through and he is marrying his high school sweetheart.Leigh is immediately angry, with confusion and emptiness soon following as well. Selling off or giving away most of her \\"possessions,\\" packing her red Miata with bits and pieces, Leigh sets off to find a new life away from the one she found so recently upended. Finding herself in Virginia, loving the quiet atmosphere, and slow lifestyle, Leigh takes a job at a small newspaper office and begins anew her life in a way that belies her past as a high-paced woman of the world.Leigh soon meets \\"Bibs,\\" a crusty, commonsense woman of the town who boards horses and gives lessons in riding and showmanship. And through Bibs, Leigh also meets \\"Silver Dream,\\" a horse whom Bib's is seeking to sell and whom Leigh finds herself the owner of, despite his somewhat daunting injury which has caused him to lose an eye. As Leigh finds herself in the company of Bibs more and more, she grows to love and appreciate this no-nonsense woman and the life she leads. As Leigh becomes more comfortable around the horses, she finds herself a natural horsewoman and to her delight, finds Silver Dreams is a racer at heart as well!Into Leigh's life comes Whit, a man with a past which threatened to beat him down, until he met Leigh and Silver Dreams who give him a new lease on life, and love. Throughout this book, the reader sees many parallels from Leigh's former life and her now, markedly simpler life as well. From the fragile goblets with crystal cupids and fine tablecloth she used only twice a year, to the juice glasses and garage sale finds she now implements in her life, we see that Leigh has changed, from a woman who put great value in material things to a woman who now puts great value in the people and of course, Silver Dreams within her life.The adventures Leigh, Bibs and Whit are alive within this book and their work with Silver Dreams. It is their own dreams of racing which make this a book that is attractive for both horse lovers and others as well. I must admit, if I had been asked before reading this book through that I'd ever recommend a book about horses, I most likely would have answered in the negative. But after reading this book, I can honestly say that this is a book that will appeal to all ages, and many personalities as well. For it is not just a story about a woman and her horse, it is about life and what Leigh discovers about herself through interacting with Silver Dreams. And there is no better recommendation for any book but to say it teaches a valuable life lesson, and \\"Silver Dreams\\" does just that.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Silver Dreams","review":"Very sweet story which is utterly predicatable. An owner with an out of state jock's licence allowed to ride her 2nd race ever in a Grade II race? Yeah, right. And then it wins? Uh huh.But if you like cute stories with happy endings, then you'll like it. Calling the horse by its full name is irritating (which is why horses like For The Moment are called Fred and not by their show name), and all the \\"huntin' fishin' shootin'\\" illustrations of accent even moreso (we know the character is in the south; enough already), but it is a nice lighthearted read."},{"Title":"Rules for Young Friends","review":"PRODUCT CAME QUICK & JUST AS DESCRIBED.VERY SATISFIED WITH OUR ORDER.THANK YOU"},{"Title":"Men Who Met God","review":"The premise of this book is simple, but the message is powerful and pointed. A.W. Tozer examines some of the life-changing experiences in the lives of the Old Testament Patriarchs and Prophets--specifically, the moment when these great men of faith met God face-to-face. Reading this book has spoiled me on every other similar work. The book awakened a newfound passion in my heart for the great saints of the Old Testament and none I have found since has matched the power and soul-piercing insight of Men Who Met God.Chapter Titles:1.

When Christians are harboring hard feelings against each other, they need to be reconciled.&quot; (from chapter 4)&quot;Christian believers are called to be burning bushes. They are not necessarily called to be great, or to be promoters and organizers. But they are called to be people in whom the beautifying fire of God dwells, people who have met God in the purifying crisis of encounter!&quot; (from chapter 7)&quot;Throughout church history, the great Christians were those who were willing to go down in humility before God.

I assume this is the same book cited here. If so, it is regaled as a minor classic in adolescent porn. Lolita? \\"Brick\\" is a very pretty 12 year old redhead who seduces everything in her path. Her hunger for sex is boundless. For example, little Brick not only wants to screw a pilot, but it has to be at 30,000 feet - or no deal! Brick's path is play-called by a narrator dirty old man, \\"Who want's an old bag fourteen?\\" Brick is the toast of the town as the rich and powerful [...] line up for the chance to nail her. But Brick knows sex better than anybody. Brick is just twelve, but she also knows money. Softcore porn to be sure. Yet this bizzare novel is nearly impossible to put down as the reader wonders what pervision little Brick will think of next. I think it's teasingly wonderful!"},{"Title":"Call me Brick.","review":"I agree with my sexy sister Spencer that Call Me Brick is a great read. Me and Spencer do things like that together all the time. \\"Brick\\" is a fiery redheaded 12 year old girl who knows more about perversion than the Greeks and Romans combined. Me and my sexy sister Spencer sure did learn a lot. I once read that Call Me Brick was actually written by a team of writers in response to a state supreme court ruling about pornography in the written word. Apparently, they were challenging the ruling and basically daring someone to step in and file charges. In that respect, Call Me Brick is a significant exercise in civil rights. Also, could a person be prosecuted for checking this novel out at the local library? Such action would require that librarians provide police with the identities of people who check out certain books, thus ameriolating our rights even further. Finally, me and Spencer are as perverted as anyone else and loved this novel! So there!"},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"Wow. Very well done story.It always bugs me a bit when someone is ready to die of love 24 hrs after meeting. In this story the chemistry is almost immediate but the relationship is very believable. The storyline is unique and engaging and just a great romance.Definitely one of Meagan's best, on a scale with Penelope Williamson, who holds #1 in my heart right now for great romance-writing for grown-ups."},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"Action packed, mysterious heroine, sullen and brooding but confident gunslinging special agent hero, and a 'whole pasel of outlaws and villains' make this 1875 western a real winner!Christalbel Van Alen has escaped a mental institute and is being pursued by a relative who wants her dead! She, the only witness to a murder, disguises herself as a widow and is traveling to find the smallest ghost town in the west to create a new life for herself. However, her dreams are disturbed when her stagecoach is captured by outlaws and the prisoners are taken captive for ransom.There Christal comes face to face with a real life gunfighter, an enemy whom also becomes her saviour. MacCauley Cain.But Christal runs again when she feels threatened of her past being discovered and true to life, her past finds her. If you enjoy outlaws, gunslingers, bounty hunters, saloon girls and cowbows (the genre) and mysterious heroines or heroes, then you'll love Fair is the Rose. Fair is the Rose keeps you turning page after page and on the edge of your seat.Personal note: I admit I own tons of Meagan McKinney's novels purchased from 'dime stores' and have never read any, until I read 'Fair is the Rose' and I began searching through my hundreds of romance novels to find ALL of McKinney's writings. She quickly became one of my favorites. But one thing I noticed in 'Fair is the Rose', the heroine never bathed! Talk about scent of a woman!"},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"This book had it all and will receive a place of honor on my bookshelves next to Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught.\\"It was a bad hanging.\\" What an absolutely wonderful opening sentence. If that doesn't gain your interest, then I don't know what will.The best part was that the book kept on delivering page after page and never faultered.I hated to see it end.This was my second McKinney read, and needless to say, I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"I enjoy Ms. McKinney's books but although this one started out with a bang I felt it ended on a fizzle. I felt oddly let down at the end, I can't quite put my finger on it, perhaps because, having read \\"Lions and Lace,\\" ***spoiler*** I wanted more \\"reunion time\\" between the sisters. Also, I felt the story descended into melodrama at times. But overall it was a diverting read worthy of a hot summer night, and a hunk of a cowboy worthy of a few good swoons!"},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"I usually don't read western romance, I love mostly historiacal romances (especially regency). This is the second book of Ms. McKinney that I have read and I think she is a great writer..one who fully develops her characters and picks an interesting plot.This being said, this was a GREAT BOOK. Don't even hesitate to buy it.Christal is running from the law when she gets held hostage at gunpoint. The leader of the gang, Macaulay Cain, is a hard man but she gets glimses of his softer side. She becomes a puzzle to him, an obsession that he cannot shake off. He wants to know why she never talks about her past, never talks about her family. She IS holding in a deep dark secret. She is running from the law because her supposedly killed her parents and ran away from a mental instituiton. The person who is really reponsible for this crime is her uncle, but no one believes her. Therefore, she doesn't want to tell Cain the truth .The story grabs you even more in the second half, where Cain ends up being a cop who is under cover as an outlaw. After his team catch the bad guys, she runs away. But his obsession of her leads him to follow her all the way to the brottols. He thinks she's prostituting but she really is a dancer. I can't say any more because I don't want to kill the book for the rest of the readers but it is a great books with a lot of funny and interesting plot twists. I can still play out some of the scenes , like a movie. For instance, when the group of outlaws expected him to rape her, he didn't . He took her behind tree and they acted it out. He respected her and took it upon himself to protect her. Also when she was running to him to show how much she loved him, she was throwing her wealthy jewelry to strangers. It was funny how Mckinney depicted this scene. (this scene u probably won't get till you read the book because it is kinda out of context because i don't want to kill the story)/ ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"I am a huge fan of McKinney's historical romances but this was my first Western romance by her. I was not disappointed and I don't think you will be either.Set in 1875, this second in the Van Alan sisters duology tells the story of Christal Van Alan, who was raised as a prominent Knickerbocker of Manhattan until the day she was accused of a terrible crime she didn't commit. Three years on the run, she finally flees to Wyoming, disguised as the widow Mrs. Smith. Almost to her destination, her stagecoach is taken hostage by a band of outlaws, including Macaulay Cain who even death wouldn't claim when he defeated the hangman's noose. Both have secrets; both have a past they'd rather forget. Christal, though hard on the outside, has a soft innocence underneath she will protect at all costs. And Macaulay, whose cold eyes set him apart, is a better man than even she could know.The story will grab you and just when you think you have the players figured out, all will change. It's an intriguing tale with great twists and turns and more than one villain. McKinney's writing is superb as always: great characters, wonderful description of the historic setting, places and people--and great storytelling. I recommend it.LIONS AND LACE is the first in the duology."},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"STORY BRIEF:Christal's parents were wealthy. Her uncle killed them, accused her, and had her placed in an asylum. She escaped and has been on the run working as a waitress and selling dances. Her uncle wants her dead. Christal is riding in a stage coach. An outlaw gang takes her and other passengers as hostages to collect ransom money. Cain is a member of the gang. The story is about the relationship between Christal and Cain.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was ok, but I couldn't get excited about anything. Most of the feelings are stress and worry, first about being held hostage and later the stress of trying to survive with no money and being in hiding from the uncle. Christal won't tell Cain anything about her past because she fears he won't believe her innocence and that someone will return her to her uncle. Cain is frustrated because she won't trust him or let him help her. These are the feelings through most of the book. It doesn't feel like there is any relationship because she is constantly hiding her secrets (and feelings). There were some sex scenes which were ok I suppose, but nothing special.I suppose the biggest problem is the heroine's character. She doesn't do anything smart or interesting. She's a weak victim. She's desperate and scrambling to survive. Even in the end, something happens and she's desperate and scrambling to make things good.Then we have heroine stupidity. A threat is outside the cabin. Cain goes outside with his guns and tells her to stay inside. She does not. She goes outside to help him. She has no weapon. How is she going to help? She just stands there and watches. And, as a result something bad happens to her.The overall plot was probably ok. Different bad buys enter the picture. Hero needs to save heroine a few times. The uncle wants Christal dead but his motives were not clear. If he wanted to inherit her parents' money, he needed to kill both Christal and her sister. Yet he made no attempts to kill the sister. There appears to be no evidence against him so Christal shouldn't be a threat. That should have been developed differently. And the ending could have been better regarding time with the sister.The best part was Cain. I liked his intense focus on one woman. He couldn't get her out of his mind. He was handsome, rugged, macho, sullen, and brooding. Very competent. Had a good heart and good morals.DATA:Story length: 250 pages. Swearing language: moderate with religious swear words. Sexual language: none to mild. Number of sex scenes: 6. Total number of sex scene pages: 7. Setting: mostly Wyoming 1875 to 1876. Copyright: 1993. Genre: historical western romance."},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"Great book, loved it right from the beginning til the end. Unlike some of Meagan McKinney's other books, the hero is not a cynic villain but an honest, adorable man who loved the heroine almost right from the beginning and tries to save her from her past. As the story goes, he grows frustrated with her and the fact that she doesn't trust him enough to tell him the truth.The heroine, Christabel Van Allen is the sister of Alana from Lions and Lace, another great story."},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"The concept of this book is interesting, a high bred woman wrongly accused of murder is on the run and ends up kidnapped by a band of criminals, led by one of my favorite heroes ever, Macaulay Cain. He is phenomenal. My favorite part of the book is during Cristabel's captivity when Cain is her abductor. The relationship they formed was actually quite lovely considering the crazy circumstances. Once back in the 'real world' things get even more tumultuous and I absolutely LOVED how Cain was obsessed with Cristabel and would do ANYTHING to find her and get to the truth of who she was and what she was running from. He is just an all around good man, but he's no push over. I wish Cristabel would have trusted Cain sooner than she did and I wish the villain was punished a bit more for all his wrongs, but overall the book is a 5 star read for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic western romance."},{"Title":"Fair Is the Rose","review":"From the synopsis, the book may sound sappy, but it isn't. The hijacking and the events that took place left you breathless, and when they find each other again -quite interesting.

The author's descriptions of the locations she visited over the past fifty years as a journalist are insightful and, in my mind, fairly accurate. She is more than a travel writer. Morris is an artist, taking what she sees in the places and people of foreign places and turning them into vivid expressions on the page for the reader to both visualize and experience. Morris also does a great job at not only explaining the places she writes about as she sees them, but also at explaining the history behind where she is and the significance of it all. This book not only is a journey across the vast world we live in but is a great way to study the history of the post-modern twentieth century world. The only confusing part, however, is the sex change she underwent in Morocco in the 1970s. I wish I would have known that going into the book because the photo of the author on the back flap undeniably shows a woman, but for the first half of the book the author was constantly referred to as a man. The whole thing had me confused, but became more understandable after Morris' trip to Casablanca where he/she came out of a surgeon's basement literally a new . . . uh, person. (an interesting chapter in the book). Despite the interesting surgery, though, this is a well-written book worth reading."},{"Title":"The World: Travels 1950-2000","review":"I stalled on coming to the end of this, but consoled myself that I can start over again tomorrow.Jan/James Morris is the next-best thing to having been everywhere myself.

I love that the poems aren't afraid to speak in their own voice or to talk about things that matter. I admire Wendy Carlisle's use of form, which is so masterful it seems effortless.

Two authors are West Coast, two East Coasters. All are informed by America's tradition in Letters. And, thankfully, each writes as if she were the first woman on earth.Wendy Taylor Carlisle is an East Texan publishing her inaugural edition via Jacaranda Press, a lively California Press based in San Jose. Carlisle has been published widely in American literary journals and this, her first book, makes us say, \\" Where has she been? It is always amazing to me the number of poets practicing their arts alone and without notice, poets who could rank with the famous of our country. Her sophistication and restraint is stunning, an elegance which comes from years of...what? practice? Where? This does not read like the work of a first-book poet struggling to say its name. Here is a person who trusts silence, the indirect message, and the light around the fire rather than the drama of fire itself. It's as if she found the truth inside herself so deep she didn't have to brag about it. Wendy is a writer who operates in the world of faith. You do not have to see it to believe it. She presents what she knows, the truth of her experience and that of others. She can be \\"right on\\" with no punches pulled. Here's a poem called \\"The War\\":She had the war inside so when he came with his napalm his foreign women it only seemed natural the fight would continuetheir marriage the tunnel they twisted in their breath hissing like missiles across the perimeter they fit together like hinge and pin blew apart easily as a mined knee left the usual phantom limbCarlisle is at her best, however, in a languid state of mind, with a detachment which frees the line to be itself. \\"The Mathematics of Hunger\\": All she knows adds up to the insight of hand and lip, tallying gnaw and gulp to swallow...ending with the lines \\" In the geometry of palm and tongue,/ hunger is the first calculation.\\" Wendy Taylor Carlisle writes of tentative connections to the past -- notes on childhood, the first fragile gift of sensuality, yet it is never \\"confessional\\" poetry. She has found the secret. How to jettison the thought beyond biography. She writes as if she had all the time in the world, an audience capable of meeting her on her own terms, a lack of force which is the sign of true strength.Four women from small poetry presses make a mark on our literary world. Jacaranda Press, a collaborative press, is about fifteen years in the making and hosts seven brand new titles. It is run by Jean Emerson, a poet. One has only to look back to the beginning of the 20th century when 10% of the people owned 90% of the land to see how much the terrain is now changed. This is a new millennium. This is a new breed of publishers creating their own parties instead of staring in the window of others. And we are glad.Grace Cavalieri is the author of eleven books of poetry and numerous produced plays. Her most recent book is Sit Down, Says Love (Argonne Hotel Press.) Her new play \\"Pinecrest Rest Haven\\" is being readied for production, NYC.

My daughter has read it, and I have given a few to friends as gifts. What fun. I enjoy the fact that I am relatively intelligent. But, I love being girlie. I love perfume, make-up, lingerie, all of it. Bombshells are not stick thin waifs who don't eat. Real bombshells are real women with appetites and curves. Bombshells refered to in the book are Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, to name a few. Women who look like women, not women who look like little boys.Perfume and make up are wonderful things. This book mentions classic fragrances. Chanel Number 5 will be around long after I am gone. It also mentions the classic fragrance of Tabu. Which I adore. It's sets me back all of eight dollars, and I get so many compliments on it that I have to laugh.After reading this book probably 60 times in the last few years it just keeps reminding me that there is nothing wrong with being a bombshell. Bombshell is a state of mind. And while I think women's lib is a good thing, I have to admit, I LOVE having males open doors for me. I love having a man offer me his arm when I am walking in heels on ice. I love having a man offer me his hand when I step out of the car. I have reached the conclusion that a lot of men like women who look like women. I think secretly, men like women to wear dresses and look pretty.Mostly, tho, a bombshell is sincere and caring in her heart. A bombshell cares about others. Most importantly, at the end of the book there is mention of how a bombshell leans in to listen to the person she is speaking too. That may be called a \\"bomshell-ism\\", but, in reality it is just good manners. I couldn't imagine a bomshell talking to someone while looking over their head to see what else is going on in the room. I'm thankful I was a self-made bombshell before the book. Reading the book keeps me on my toes. And I am thankful that my daughters are also bombshells.

This book showed me how...from telling me how to have a brunet tantrum to applying eyeliner to vacationing in the Caribbean to dressing up in cold weather!With the delightful illustrations, pink decor, and quotes of bombshells from a bygone era, it is a wonderful book, worth every penny you'll pay for it!And, for the record, don't pay the $19 for it at Border's. Drive home, log onto Amazon, and pay the greatly reduced price for this gem that has been hiding on shelves for too long!!!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"As befits a description of the bombshell lifestyle, this book is charming, capricious, and unabashedly feminine.I saw that one reviewer, who went on and on like the sort of person for whom a book review is an excuse for a political diatribe, claims that no one dresses like that. Au contraire. This book has changed my life. My calves are muscular and I feel tall and powerful from wearing heels everywhere. I feel glamorous all the time, not just once or twice a year when I'm dressed up for a Christmas party or something. It doesn't take much to be glamorous here in Seattle, home of folks who wear fleece and mukluks everywhere. I don't think of the bombshell mentality as being retrograde, though I do appreciate vintage style and fashion. I think of it, rather, as being much more European-- less about the &quot;me first&quot; American ethic of comfort and functionalism above everything else, and more about enhancing one's confidence and femininity, and for lack of a better word, &quot;diva-hood&quot;. To dress for others as much as oneself is not so much vain as it is considerate. We all like to look at lovely things. Either you have the level of confidence to break out of the ordinary or you don't. This book won't make you fabulous-- it just helps you channel it."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I purchased this book expecting a fun read....and yes, it is quite fun. However.....please.....ladies, do NOT purchase this book as some kind of 'style guide'. This is not about style and how stylish women dress. The last thing we need is for American women to look even trashier (no bra under your sweater to the office and fishnets during the day, indeed!). On a positive note, the book design and illustrations are just divine. Congratulations to the creative team. References to the old Hollywood starlets are both hilarious and inspirational......but I fail to understand the relevance of quotes by Patricia Arquette and Drew Barrymore! These ladies are hardly bombshell material. The fashion and beauty information is a little misguided (unless you're a drag queen) and the disparaging remark about redheads is just plain weird.THIS ONE IS STRICTLY FOR LAUGHS."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book covers everything while referring to our sisters from the 20's - present (although, mostly the women of the fifties). Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, and Elizabeth Taylor are just a few women who are referenced through-out this amazing little guide. I have owned mine for over a year and still reference back to it. There are no biographies in this book, instead different bombshells are brought into the fold with each new section. From hair color, to makeup, to clothing and home decor, everything you could imagine is mentioned in this book. I discovered a love for Etta James, Frank Sinatra, and classical music because of the music list in this book. At 21, these artists were known by me but never listened to. Now, I can't get enough of what my past sisters were listening to. I have become a master at the \\"Garbo eye\\" and have tossed my foundation goodbye. I also tossed out my Erno Laszlo skin care system in favor of Ponds and my skin has never been better for a fraction of the price. I will admit that not everything that is recommended is in my budget (I can't afford to walk around in Burberry trenches while wearing the latest pair of Ferragamos) but I now save to buy these pieces when I see them heavily discounted. I now perch instead of sit and know how to make an entrance. Sip your Dom (or a glass of Chardonnay) while reading this book and discover your inner bombshell like I did."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book is amazing, don't listen when these people tell you that you should not take this book seriously. It is very practical and unpractical at the same time. This book is an easy read and easy to take notes from. This book and another book Better than Beauty a guide to charm by Helen Valentine and Alice Thompson is all the beauty books you will ever need. Everything in this book made complete sense to me, and the women who it didn't make sense to are too practical and do not have enough imagination. I am a young woman who loves this book, and even though some of these things it says is a little outrageous, you sometimes have to go for it to make live exciting. The bombshells in this book lives excitingly, and has adrenaline in a day to day life. I recommend this book to everyone because I can look back at all the female figures in my life and see some of what they do in what the bombshell does in this book. This book is so lovely. Don't stop to think why not buy this."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I Believe I have an old soul and I was born in the wrong era. I love the styles of the 30's, 40's and 50's when women were sexy, confident, dressed impeccable with a sophisticated flare.I'm not much of book reader. I'm more of a newspaper, magazine kind a gal keeping up with current events. However, the minute I saw this book at a 57th street store window and it's cute cover and title, I said I must read that book. When I open the pages and began to read it, I couldn't put it down until I read it all the same day. I must say, it was totally inspiring and made me think of the women of that era. I love this book, it's fun to read, the illustrations are adorable and I keep it to read it as often as I can.Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I bought my first copy of this book almost 7 or 8 years ago -- I think. (Yes, my first copy. -- It became worn out & was falling apart from so much use.) The first thing that drew me to the book was the title. I perused it in the bookstore & HAD to get it. She had described A LOT of my favorite perfumes -- a lot of my favorite makeup colors, a lot of my favorite books, a hotel I had heard of & wanted to stay in -- even the room I wanted to stay in and a lot of my favorite movies and actresses. Well, when I saw so much of myself in the book, it was kismet. I still love this book because it's ageless and timeless. You don't have to be a youngster to be a Bombshell -- in fact the book would insinuate that we can certainly get better with age. The book doesn't spend time giving dime a dozen advice on what you SHOULD eat, wear, how to tie a scarf, what to do for your body type, face shape etc. It merely tells you what Bombshells of the day have been known to do & draw your own conclusion from there. It's also a crazy mix of dimestore & extravagant lists -- like a Bombshell may favor Revlon lipstick but may have an Hermes bag. It also emphasizes being well rounded. A Bombshell is not just about what's on the outside. It's about the brains, and what comes from the inside. This book is as much about bringing your inner fantasy out as well as being informational and humorous. I hope this book stays around long enough for me to get a third or fourth copy if I ever need it!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I LOVED this book! It is a great read for any person that appreciates old Hollywood and all of it's glamour. I don't think this book was meant to be taken as a serious \\"fashion guide\\" for frumpy housewives looking for \\"Advice\\" on how to BE a bombshell."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I love this book. Not as a how-to guide, which I think many people seemed to hope it was, or an expression of modern womanhood, which it isn't. It is a case study of that rare form of woman, the bombshell, whose hayday was earlier in the century but who will never go away. And, as that, is it a lovely, informative, witty, and touching book. I'm sorry that it seems many people didn't get that.I bought this book when I was at a self-esteem low point in my life, when I felt anything but pretty and the myriad magazines and beauty guides did nothing to help. This book did, by showing in the very first chapter how being this kind of glamorous has far more to do with attitude. No matter what people think you look like, it is your own confidence and attitude that will determine how you are thought of. This is an incredibly powerful and important thing to hear for many people, especially young girls who think they'll never live up, and this book is a masterclass in that. Buy it for the shy, bombshell-loving girl you know, I think they need it."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"What a surprise - this little gem proved to be more delightful with each page. The illustrations are terrific and the book's message has something for the bombshell in each of us. Not only was I entertained by it's wit and wisdom, but I enjoyed the tidbits about Marilyn Monroe, et al. ALL women are bombshells, we just needed a reminder. Thanks Stover and friends for showing us the way. Va-va-voom!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I must say that it was the best book I have read in some time. It was very fun to read and to relate. I felt that she was talking about me. Now I am encouraged to me more of a Bombshell."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This is an excellent little read! It seems to me that it was inspired by Marilyn Monroe and the author is speculating on what she'd be like if she were alive today. There are many interesting Marilyn tidbits here and some on her imitators like Jane Mansfield, et. al. Best thing is, there's no mention of the ultra-phony(and trampy)Pam Anderson.I love the illustrations! Very nice. Would make a wonderful gift for women to give among friends."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I keep reading this and keep highlighting different parts. It is delightful. Makes me feel great to be a woman. Any woman can be a bombshell. It is about attitude, not age, race, size, etc. (I just wish there were an updated edition.) Every time I read it, I feel energized. What a gem!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I have had this haunting feeling lately that most women today are lacking something, or trying too hard. We don't seem to express our vulnerability or our sensuality- we just show a lot of skin-- low-cut tops, lowrise jeans. What is real sex appeal?For that matter, what is real va-va voom? Finally, an adorable, tongue-in-cheek book about the classic goddesses who overcame bad childhoods and multiple marriages. They believed in dreams, they made us believe in dreams. The authors say you don't even need to be busty, or blonde, it's state of mind, a consciousness. This book is glamourous, sweet, empowering and made me laugh, too. (I ran out to Saks Fifth Avenue and bought Jicky perfume, very old school sexy.) There's even a quiz and a cute website which I found on the web when I looked up the book title. I only wish there had been a little more on exercise, but I guess the book was too honest for that....bombshell weights do go up and down but a bombshell is a bombshell because she believes I herself more than her scale. (I am buying this book for my depressed friends, it's better than Prozac.)"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"For some reason, the people who buy this book expect to see a step-by-step guide on how to become Marilyn, Elizabeth, and Sofia. However, there is no such thing as step-by-step guide on becoming a bombshell. The bombshell tendency is often born into a girl (or boy) but is carefully cultivated into the full-blown bombshell that we know and adore. While I admit some of the things are dated, why can't we incorporate a little bit of the forties and fifties into our lives? Champagne baths are a tad much for those of us with budgets, but why not have a grocery store-cheap bottle in the fridge for those toasting those special occasions like a dove landing on the windowsill? This book was an eye-opener for me, showing me that I can be my own type of Marilyn or Elizabeth in the modern world, it just requires a little bit of glam and a whole lot of confidence. While you and I never may be listed with the Bombshells of legend, we know we are Bombshells, and so does everyone else with the swish of our hair, the champagne in our refrigerator and our genuine effervescene for the movie of life in which we are the star.Don't purchase this book if you want a step-by-step guide or tips on how to become Marilyn Monroe. This book is not that. It's more of a catalogue of famous Bombshell tendencies (which bras, makeup, shoes, music, etc.) that you either find just like yours, somewhat like yours, or nothing at all like yours, and you could use these tendencies to cultivate your bombshell status. But no step-by-step. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"In a time when fashionistas prescribe either cookie-cutter, sexless Anne Taylor fashion or outfits that scream \\"$50 an hour, me love you long time!\\", the return of the bombshell is long overdue! Sexy but never trampy, playful but never moronic, intelligent but not at the cost of sensuality, the bombshell is an archetype that European feminists never crucified - although it suffered more stateside. I hope this book heralds a new interest in the joyful balancing act of the bombshell. This IS a how-to book, despite what some reviewers have said. It is, however, more of a description of a paradigm than a cookie-cutter prescription - with some concrete advice on shoes, scent, clothing, attitude, lifestyle, etc. Sometimes tongue-in-cheek, high-spirited, sensual, unapologetically feminine, delighted - with a little spritz of irony- this book is a fun, fun, fun read. I loved it - treated myself to a bottle of Coco by Chanel to celebrate, and the next day I wore a just-knee length b& w polka-dotted skirt with a fitted black top and new red open-toed 1940s heels that I hadn't previously been brave enough to wear to the office. Celebrating a kinship with the Bombshell makes me feel fabulous! You might even say... liberated! Liberated to be playful, sexy, whimsical, feminine, capricious, sentimental, *and* intellectual. The Bombshell is the well-balanced, thinking woman's Cosmo Girl. The only things I wasn't too keen on were the critiques of certain artists and authors as not-for-bombshells. As far as I'm concerned, the bombshell can read as much as she wants, and whatever she wants - and the same goes for art appreciation. A Bombshell with a Ph.D. might find it a bit naff to have sex appeal linked to reading material - but then again, maybe wrapping a copy of Being and Time in a Men Are From Mars dust jacket would appeal to her whimsical sense of irony. Never mind me, though - just go get the book and see what you think!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"It's about time some practical advice was given with an air of humor, light-heartedness and sexiness. An adorable how-to manual that doesn't take itself too seriously. But watch out-if you follow this advice expect heads to turn. The information packed into this little pearl is dead on. The authors have obviously watched all the classic films and have distilled the best tips into a concise guide no aspiring bombshell should be without. I recommend this to everyone. (It will make men smile, too.) It's positive, fun and beautifully illustrated."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Isn't it always the case that what some readers hate about a book is what you love about it? I love the focus solely on vintage movie stars, perfume, music etc. I love the way it reads like a movie magazine of the era, full of fluff and fun and nothing too sad or intrusive. I love the way the author seems to be making a study of bombshells in their native habitat, the movie screen and the Hollywood of yesteryear. I love that although it's so over the top you may sense a hint of things being \\"tongue in cheek,\\" she passes no judgments about the bombshell way of life.I love the fact that it is not a how-to book which I find have a tendency to sound rather \\"Do this or you aren't beautiful/strong/hip/chic/accomplished etc.\\" You can take what you will from this book. Read it to see a light and fun side to bombshells whose lives are usually mentioned in junction with tragedy now. Read it to see some suggestions as to what music a bombshell listens to and what mood it sets, what movies she loves and what books she reads (and why). Maybe you'll want to add some bombshell touches to your life or maybe you won't, either way it's a fun read.Personally I pick it up to cast a rose glow over my life, to add some effervescence and to recapture a sense of fun. To me, that's what makes this book sparkle, it is a slice of a cotton candy world. It's a rose-tinted bygone Hollywood that you can stroll through and pick up a few trinkets to adorn your reality, or not."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This is a great book. It's not a good book if you're looking for a guide to dress like Lindsey Lohan or how to put together a work appropriate wardrobe. It's a fun and funny book about the concept of the bombshell. The concept that started with Marilyn, Sophia and Kim, and continues today in some of the sexier and smarter women out there. Being an old movie buff certainly helps in the appreciation of this guide. If you can't stand black and white movies, and think that Marilyn was fat and over-rated, do not bother."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I have always admired the women who coined the name &quot;bombshell.&quot; Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Rita Hayworth, and the likes, all hold a special something, a way of life all their own. This book delves in and explains it.From what to cook to what to wear to how to throw a tantrum (according to your hair color), this book not only informs, but entertains wildly. Whether you want to take it seriously and remodel your life, or just use it as an amusing afternoon read, this book is a must for every woman.Not only does it encourage sex appeal and glamour, it touches on the fact that it also takes brains to be a bombshell. This is something few people recognize, and thus women are forced to feel that if they are beautiful and sexy and enthralling, they can't be witty and intelligent too. And that's oh-so-wrong!I love &quot;The Bombshell Manuel of Style&quot; and read it over and over. It's neat to see how there's a little bombshell in all of us. This is worth its price and more!!!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Written and illustrated by people who should know, here is some fun advice with 100% hot style. Based on great movie stars and what can only be personal observance of real-life Bombshells, this little book is too much fun to put down. The illustrations are bright, sexy and whimsical, and the advice will make you feel better about getting dressed, doing your nails and forgetting how to cook. Reminiscent of Helen Gurley Brown's Sex and the Single Girl, (only funnier,) it covers everything from Marilyn Monroe's diet, to what to wear at home, (hint: it's not sweatpants!) You'll want to grab a copy to see how you measure up, and how to make it all better. It's a silly book, hard-core feminists will be offended. But it is sooo delicious, you'll find yourself sippping a cocktail to Frank Sinatra before you've finished the last page. Sister Holly Golightlys rejoice!! Hurry, get some bubble bath and get this book!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"\\"The Bombshell Manual of Style\\" by Laren Stover was a major disappointment. It's one of those schlocky \\"empowerment through high heels\\" things that have unaccountably become popular lately -- and not even a particularly good example of its ilk -- made even worse by combining it with schlocky nostalgia, a la the movie \\"Swingers\\". I kept waiting for the book to turn into a bitter parody of itself, i.e., \\"The Bimbo Manual of Style, 1957 Edition\\" (which at least would have been entertaining), but it never did -- or not intentionally. If only Ms. Stover had been content to let the book remain a frothy romp through vintage-style glamour, instead of also trying to make it a how-to book. It aimed for glitzy, missed, and ended up embarrassing, like reading old issues of \\"Cosmo\\".\\"Bombshell\\" encourages its readers to derive self-worth from that which is dumbest, silliest, and most trivial about femininity. It pretends otherwise, telling us that bombshells are intelligent, authentic, compassionate, etc. -- then suggests prancing into a job interview braless in a tight sweater. I can't see intelligent, authentic, compassionate women like Marie Curie or Rosa Parks or Mother Theresa doing that; so while a bombshell might be *permitted* to be intelligent, authentic, and compassionate, those qualities are clearly secondary -- what she's *required* to be is a busty floozy. I'm well aware that women have hearts and bodies as well as minds -- that we can be smart, strong, and functional while also enjoying love, sex, men, and traditionally feminine pursuits -- and three cheers for all that.I also want to make clear that I usually enjoy frivolous fun and/or \\"girlie\\" books. I loved \\"Kiss my Tiara\\", \\"Sex Tips for Girls\\", and \\"The Sweet Potato Queens' Guide to Life\\". I enjoyed \\"The Grrl Genius Guide to Life\\", \\"Mama Gena's School of Womanly Arts\\", \\"Miss Piggy's Guide to Life\\", and most of \\"The Bad Girl's Guide to Life\\" (all these books, by the way, do what this book tries to do, with far more amusing and helpful results). But there are limits.First of all, \\"Bombshell\\" assumes that 1950s-style femininity is good clean fun; innocent of social/cultural baggage, and bravely persevering despite a conspiracy of spoilsports to forbid it. I like dressing up and flirting as much as anyone; I'll admit that cleavage flaunting and the occasional tantrum have their place; and I work out faithfully, get pedicures, and wear perfume.What I find baffling and irritating is the notion that this is somehow rebellious -- as though there were Orwellian puritans prowling the streets, slapping lipsticks out of women's hands. I've never encountered anybody like that; but every single day of my life, I encounter movies, TV shows, magazines, advertisements -- and yes, books -- telling me in blatant and subtle ways that I should wear makeup, dye my hair, get \\"cosmetic\\" surgery, etc. Whether or not I comply is optional (so far), but one can't have it both ways. An image mandated by all of corporate capitalism, all of the mainstream media, and all of popular culture, cannot possibly be considered rebellious -- or even original. Fishnet hose may be fun, but they're not \\"fighting the power\\".Secondly, \\"Bombshell\\" is off-puttingly dated. Almost nothing in it postdates 1960. For example, one chapter is devoted entirely to perfumes popular between 1920-50 (\\"Jicky\\"? OK, Collette wore it, but where do they even sell it nowadays? In one shop in Paris?), including an elaborate, gushing description of one that no longer exists (\\"My Sin\\"). Everything introduced after 1980, no matter how popular it is/was, gets lumped together in a one-sentence dismissal, apparently because the fragrances of that era are too old to be trendy -- but, unlike the equally untrendy perfumes the author praises, are not yet old enough to be nostalgic.Thirdly, \\"Bombshell\\" conveniently overlooks the fact that being a bombshell went out of style for a reason -- it didn't work. Women have had the past few thousand years (surely a fair trial period for testing a theory) in which to act like shallow airheads, and it hasn't done us or anyone else any good. We still don't have world peace, comparable pay, or even a decent parking space.Stilettos and simpering only worked for beauties and movie stars -- and usually, not even for them. Marilyn Monroe, whom \\"Bombshell\\" constantly cites, had a miserably unhappy life, abused drugs and alcohol, and died, probably of suicide, while she was still in her thirties. So did Dorothy Dandridge, another of the book's \\"role models\\". Elizabeth Taylor has been divorced -- what, eight times? -- and in and out of rehab repeatedly. I don't wish to be unkind to any of the ladies in this book, but their combined track record suggests that its methods produce less than successful results.There's also a strangely artificial feel to \\"Bombshell\\". It has the same relationship to actual women as Ralph Lauren ads have to actual cowboys. Real-life women don't dress or act that way. With the exception of a few starlets and showgirls, nobody did, not even in those days. This book isn't about women in the 1950s -- it's about *movie characters* in the 1950s.Retro can be charming and fascinating in its own way, and there are several good books about various elements of retro style. \\"Bombshell\\" wasn't one of them. Those who don't enjoy this sort of thing should skip it. Those who *do* enjoy this sort of thing should *also* skip it, because they'd be better off watching Marilyn Monroe videos, listening to Frank Sinatra CDs, or reading hard-boiled detective stories (since those always seem to have at least one bombshell \\"dame\\" in them). Ms. Stover should have put together a coffee table book about vintage clothes, music, and movies; and gotten it out of her system. The illustrations in this book are delightful -- but otherwise, this \\"bombshell\\" is a dud."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Please, people, obviously Ms. Stover never intended this book to be some sort of self help endeavor. She is actually a very intelligent woman if you've ever bothered to read anything else she's written. Anyway, this book is about deconstructing and examining what it is to be a bombshell, the whole idea behind the image. And none of the women discussed in the book would anyone consider to be \\"slutty\\" or \\"bimbo-esque\\" as has been suggested in other reviews. Also I think another over-arching point of this book is that women don't have to dress and act like a New England prep or intellectual snob to be an intelligent, powerful, vivacious woman. If you like old movies and are fascinated by the bombshell persona then this is absolutely a book for you. Very easy to read a la cart with lots of interesting anecdotes about all those bombshell women."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book was very...amusing, sometimes comical.

I did enjoy the book, but I think it is due to the fact that I hold a certain nostalgia for the 1950s and the lifestyle described in the book. It is well written, easy to read, and made me laugh out loud several times. My favorite section was bombshell makeup and what a bombshell has in her bathroom, they actually list Ponds cold cream as a beauty must have! The only person I know that uses cold cream is my grandma!

Just watch old movies and copy how the now-dead actresses behaved and dressed. Listen to all the early 20th century songs. There!

I don't understand how any somewhat intelligent writer would waste time writing such a useless book."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"...book that ended up being a major let down. It seems that Stover is trapped in the 50's, and is trying to give advice to modern day women on being a \\"bombshell\\".For example: 1. She claims that bombshells do not own a calculator, or a cell phone. COME ON! How ridiculous is that notion. If my car breaks down in the middle on the interstate, how am I supposed to fix it? Let me guess, put my right leg in the middle of the street, and flag down a car? I don't think so.Also, I don't know about anyone else, but I like to keep my checkbook balanced and my bills paid on time. You better believe I'm going to pull out a calculator.2. Bombshells do not wear panyhose. Oh yeah, accordig to whom? I refuse to wear a suit without panyhose, or clothes that are tight and 2 sizes smaller. I will project an image, if I follow her guidelines, but it will not be a \\"BOMBSHELL\\".3. Bombshells take their shoes off when it rains. Maybe Stover should walk the dirty streets of NYC before making that statement. Besides, I was not born on a barn, why would I walk bare-foot in public?4. And where does Stover get off telling me what I should and should not read. Because Marilyn Monroe liked \\"Birth of Venus\\", so am I?And most of the women she referenced are either dead, or \\"over the hill\\".This book obviously is geared for the wrong decade, I would have loved it if I lived in the 60's.However, I did find the illustrations charming.

They refer to the same few actresses over and over. Apparently the bombshell standard was set by women on screen and the setting for a so-called bombshell's life is a movie set. Then, the only contemporary actresses they feature are Marisa Tomei, Patricia Arquette and Kim Basinger, and I wouldn't place them all in the bombshell category. Sheesh. It took *how* many people to write this little bunch of fluff?"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I had to return this book because it was so terrible.

Luckily, some of us have a clue.Your book [is terrible.]"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"If this had been marketed as a kind of amusing anthropological study rather than a manual of style, I would have rated it a five. As it is, it's a well-thought-out, well-organized study of the 30's to 50's Bombshell, and those who imitate them, but style manuals usually include more how-to. From the title and description I expected more things like how to do your hair like Rita or your makeup like Marilyn, or at least how to keep your seams straight. The author's observations are witty and fun to read, and you may be able to add or reconfirm some of the details if you're going for that look and attitude, but Bombshell How-To it is not.Die-hard fans of old Hollywood Glamour movies or individual bombshells will be more entertained than I, but I'm more into the mysterious Femme-Fatale Vamp than the bubbly Bombshell to begin with, so I'm admittedly a little biased in that regard. (I loved the presentation and the writing, so would love to read &quot;The Vamp Manual of Style&quot; if they ever tried that subject!)"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"In this sad day of feminism I am totally refreshed by this book that says it is OK to be woman and to embrace womanly charms! I loved this book. I'm tired of apologizing for dressing like a woman where the regional uniform is uni-sex T-shirts &amp; Jeans! Sure, much of the book is tongue &amp; cheek, but a true bombshell knows the difference. So with that, I spritz my Chanel No.5 and perch upon my chair, a pointy mule dangling from my polished big toe!

Or dare :)"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I have to take offense at so many of the reviews that are suggesting this is a \\"how to\\". Contrary to that opinion, this is a \\"tell all\\" more than a \\"how to\\". If you are not born a Bombshell, no amount of makeup tips or appetizer recipes will turn you into one. I was a Bombshell at age 2, performing Santa Baby on my grandmother's stage in the bar. This book was taken right out of my head. Any of you out there that think it is \\"outdated\\" to be a certain type of woman are just jealous. You are the women who won't be friendly to me because you think I will seduce your man. (Even though I have never stolen a boyfriend in my life).No, I don't do everything the authors have stated-I too enjoy a French manicure every once in a while and I don't hate camping-but the key to the Bombshell is her spirit. The spirit of a time gone past, the glamour girl who didn't die out with the age. I own every Sinatra recording ever made and know that if I had only been able to befriend Marilyn, she may have found a kindred spirit. Those of us who despair do so because of how misunderstood and mistreated we really are. How many true friends do you think Marilyn had? (Too many people around her probably shared some of the reviewers opinions about \\"bimbos\\" and \\"floozy's\\")Shame on all of you who stand up for women's rights to be whatever they want but put down women who want to be womanly! It is impossible for me to make friends with women who aren't as attractive or more attractive than me because none of them will even speak to me. Most give me the cold shoulder but I have completely shrugged it off because I am who I am and my pink strappy stilletos will NOT be retired because you think they are too sexy, too flashy or threatening. Men love me, they have always loved me and I love them. No, I'm not a tramp, yes I have a husband but I don't dress up for men-I do it for me! It's who I am!My husband, when we were dating, loved the little outfits; the tight pants, the low tops-yet married, he once gave me hell because we went to a wedding of a friend and I wore a hot number (and got hit on by some of his friends). I put my stilletoed heel down that night to let him know when you marry a Marilyn don't expect her to turn into a Debbie Reynolds! He hasn't done it since and has decided, wisely, to be proud to have the hottest wife in the room.So, if you're one of the women who normally wouldn't speak to me, give it a try next time. We don't steal boyfriends, and generally don't have many girlfriends which can get lonely-but we know LOTS of single men, ladies, whom we couldn't possibly date. Get smarter-befriend a Bombshell-she can do wonders for your date book.Favorite Bombshell quote: \\"A man being rich is like a girl being pretty.

Very funny and way true. I have observed my bombshell friends for years and can attest to the veracity of these observations. Let me assure the reader from Wyoming that the very first bombshell I ever new was a red-headed radical feminist with a stunning figure who wore short skirts, mules and makeup and could blow a legislator out of the water with one wink. She was H.O.T.! I am, too. Some of us radical feminists like to play the game -- by the way, we win. Read the book and find out why."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Who is a bombshell? Basically, this book is about 1950s and 1960s movie actresses. Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Rita Hayworth, etc. Drew Barrymore is also mentioned as a \\"modern\\" bombshell which is absurd.I do like retro 50s style, but just basing an advice book on movies that are dated isn't very helpful. For example, the book recommends wearing a scarf around your head while driving which would look silly in this day and age. Marilyn Monroe has a staged photo-op where she is lifting weights in jeans, so the book recommends lifting weights in jeans. Also Bombshells don't own cell phones or calculators. Silly advice like that.Like Saturday Night Live, here is the section of the review called \\"REALLY?\\"Advice to wear high heels hiking? Really? Because high heels and mud go so well together?Advice to wear make-up to bed? Really? Because a damaged complexion is so attractive? Really?Advice to wear no bra and a tight sweater to work? Really? Because getting ahead means showing off your assets? Really?I do like certain things about the book though. There are lists of old perfumes, lipsticks, vacation spots (all very retro), so it's not a complete waste of time... plus I do like reading about the old Bombshell habits from half a century ago... but the book should never be taken as a \\"how to\\" guide."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's silly at times, and yet makes good points. I've stopped carrying my purse over my shoulder and now carry it on my forearm, but I don't answer the door wrapped in a sheet and a spritz of Chanel No.5. There are some great points about not \\"sitting\\" but \\"perching\\", and a bombshell is never boring because she is always genuinely interested in those around her. It's a fun read, and my friends have enjoyed browsing through it. I read it about once a year just to give myself an attitude boost and remind myself how much I love being a woman."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I can't rave enough about this book - it's funny, endearing, positive, uplifting, and eyeopening. The only drawback is that it's only a 'how to' manual for those who are already realitvely bombshellesque (sorry, all you outdoorsy or girl-next-door types). It's well thought out, and wonderfully illustrated. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Just the book I've been waiting for! This is the most adorable book I've ever seen. The illustrations are awesome! It proves that you don't have to be blonde and 6 feet tall to be glamorous. Women will be amazed to discover that they're more Bombshell than they realize - I certainly was...and I'm loving it!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"A light, fluffy read that takes up way less than one afternoon this book is not to be taken as a &quot;how to.&quot; Either you are a bombshell or you are not. Plain Jane mousy women who read this will come away with nothing. The lists of music, makeup techniques, clothes and perfume will only serve as a research guide to them. True bombshells already know this information. For them, this &quot;guide&quot; serves only as a document of self-affirmation. Other reveiwers have complained that some of the information in this book is dated, doesn't incorporate viable information for our times, and lacks references to modern day bombshells. It is my opinion that they do not &quot;get&quot; it. If there was nothing else to learn from this book it is that the bombshell loves herself, her own personal style and is proud to be an individual. She looks to the great ladies, fashions &amp; ways of the past because the present has become a cookie cutter sexless kakhi wearing culture. Bombshells are not afraid to step outside the lines and do something different. If the perfume you wear is not on the list provided or your musical tastes vary from what is contained in its pages but it makes you feel pretty and feminine and good about yourself than so be it. A true bombshell has enough confidence in herself that she doesn't heed every word of a silly little confection of a book as gospel- instead she slips on her highest heals and marches to the beat of her own drummer."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Ah, this is a treat. It's as airy as a meringue, yet with a satisfying crunch and sweetness. Stover constructs and deconstructs the image of the bombshell in this charming and witty book (it's all about the performance of femininity and it's cheaper than critical theory, too!). Stover's skill as an ethnographer of the bombshell takes on a persona that is larger than life (as in her later book, _Bohemian Manifesto_) and makes it a source of frothy delight. This is not actually a manual, per se, but more of an observance of the bombshell at work, at play and in the boudouir.And play is important--Stover stresses the fun in acting like a bombshell, while not losing sight of the fact that it is an act, a performance--there's a reason so many bombshell examples come directly from movies (and anything that loves Jayne Mansfield as much as I do, well, that's all right with me.)As in Stover's other work, the illustrations are bright, joyful and just as delicious as the text; the whole book is beautifully designed.My only suggestion would be a film list of the \\"bombshell\\" films; we have a list of favorites *of* the bombshell, but I'd love a fuller resource to see more of this glamour onscreen! I'd also like to less of a heterocentric viewpoint since so many bombshell characteristics have shown up in femmes and as such have become symbols of both femininty and suberversion (maybe _The Bombshell Manual of Style_'s next edition will include Tallulah Bankhead? I hope! Or could we hope for a book on the Bombshell Bohemians?) as have drag queens.I think this could add to a richer understanding of bombshell as a beauty and as a tool to explode forms of conciousness. However, these issues may be for another book (and Ms. Stover, I hope you write it and if you do, _The Femme's Guide to the Universe_ is a great resource...)Still, this is glorious fun and if you have a taste for the girly in girly girl, I think this will be delightful. Brava!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Charming from cover to cover, this book has become a fixture on my bookshelf. Light-hearted, witty and elegant, the advice on scent, fashion and poise is old-fashioned but hardly dated, as well as desperately needed in these times when trashy is chic. This is the secret that we've been waiting for--how to be feminine, witty, seductive. In short, a how-to on being a Bright Young Thing. This is sex appeal that isn't cheap, intelligence that isn't blas&eacute;, femininity that is anything but apologetic.

The Bombshell Manual of Style will show you how."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I love this book, and so does everyone else I know!

I propose a toast to bombshells everywhere!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I agree. To become a bombshell, you have to be attractive and voluptuous - both qualities obtainable to ANY woman. Surface fat can be overlooked by simple sweeping arm movements to distract the eye or camouflaged by fabulous draped clothing. Hair can be removed easily when found in inappropriate places. The rest comes from INSIDE - a capturing of the inner joi-de-vivre that projects for miles. &quot;Bombshell Manual&quot; embodies the elusive, embrases the complexity and reinforces the importance of maintaining the bombshell personae.I don't agree that &quot;Bombshell Manual&quot; dwells in the past and is not in touch with the present-day woman. Rita Hayworth, Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe showed us how to break the rules or follow them when necessary - a truely modern concept. I say bravo to Bombshell for illustraing that so wonderfully."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I love this book! What is so great about this book? Well, everything. The book is much like a bombshell, it gives and then gives some more. I definitely was NOT a bombshell, and yet by following the advice Laren Stover gives in this delightful book, I suddenly transformed into a creature that sometimes I don't even recognize!!!I almost would like to keep this book a well-known secret, but it's so great I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This was an interesting take on what being a bombshell consists of. Each chapter details a unique characteristic of 'bombshellism'. From what a bombshell wears, reads, or listens to; to what she loves (animals), her tantrums, and even how her astrological sign affects her. What this book lacks in length, it makes up for with great sketches and name-dropping. Although most of the scenarios listed are taken from early movies with impossibly gorgeous screen sirens like Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, some things still hold true and frankly, most women have a lil' bombshell in them."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Another one of my sister's books on looking and feeling good about yourself, this book was a great read. A reminder of what feminity was in the middle of the twentieth century, the bombshell celebrated her feminity and sexuality with grace and style. She could shock her public by wearing close-fit attire that silouhetted her shape and go bare underneath. She admired her physique, whether she was skinny or fat. And she attracted men with good personality. Ms. Stover does a good job doing her research on celebrity bombshells and what their daily regimen was that made stand out. This should be the woman's bible on what it takes to achieve the look and feel good about yourself."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I was more than a bit disappointed with this book. The general idea of living like a cross between Marily Monroe and Catherine Hepburn is more than appealing, but the tips and advice dished out by the book are circa 1957. Very unhelpful for a 27 year old in 2006! Might I suggest \\"Swell\\" by Cynthia Rowley - it's made for the modern girl on a realistic budget. The Bombshell Manual is just a bit of a flop."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Wow, I had suspected I was a closet bombshell for a long time and found the affirmation of the fact in this book! This is both a \\"how to\\" and a heck of an entertaining read! Some of the history of the bombshell was fascinating and I loved the Sophia Loren quote \\"all that you see I owe to spagetti\\". Yes, girls can be smart, sexy, cute, silly (in a good way) and wrapped up in a complex and enchanting Chanel scented, pink package. Now ,I DO have taxidermy in my house but they are named and usually trimmed with flowers or silly hats. Oh well, even a bombshell can have her lapses."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book was a god send.

The idea of this book or any \\"manual\\" is to take threads of ideas from the book and incorporate them into your lifestyle- whether it's changing your Tommy Girl perfume to Mitsouko, wearing a silk kimono instead that worn terry cloth or just leaving your cell phone at home to use someone else (at least once; just for the experience). The idea is too have fun and feel sexy!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I read the Bombshell Manual cover to cover. It's really an adorable book. My favorite part was the section on 15 Road-Tested Outfits. I'd love to see all these curvy blondes walking around New York in anachronistic looks. That was the best part--the blur between sincerity and irony, elegantly-written prose and easy-to-read lists. I was touched when I imagined the ink in the bombshell's diary smuged with tears.

I really liked this book, and will adapt some of the suggestions into my life,like trying to set a mood,and pleasing my man more(lucky him!)by wearing silky clothes.Or nothing.I really liked the music suggestions included, and most especially, the bombshell zodiac chapter(I'm a Libra).I did NOT care for the 'cookie cutter' makeup method mentioned.I think it is waaay too much, and men nowadays love a more natural look.It won't rub off on the sheets!!Also, I think a woman that knows how to cook is sexy.How can you stay thin eating out all of the time? Ps.I started a club on Ya-who for 'modern bombshells'.(Hint-hint)"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Laren Stover takes her bombshell cues from the classics -- Sophia Loren, Brigitte Bardot, Jayne Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, and other women who exuded sexiness over the years. So expect plenty of classic bombshell references in &quot;The Bombshell Manual to Style,&quot; an informative though rather thin description of how to let your inner sex kitten purr.After a list of quotes from bombshells through the decades (does Drew Barrymore come off as bombshellish?), Stover starts giving intricate descriptions of how to live day to day as a bombshell. A bombshell's tantrums (brunettes get to destroy stemware), wardrobe (for weight-lifting, a triangle bikini and jeans), jewelry and &quot;underpinnings,&quot; perfumes, handbags (and their contents), shoes (mostly mules and slingbacks), makeup, a Bombshell's sanctum sanctorum (a piano is a must) and a soundtrack to her day (Tchaikovsky for bubble baths).And, perhaps most importantly, attitude. &quot;If you can learn to use your mind as well as you use a powder puff, you will become more truly beautiful,&quot; Sophia Loren once said. So Stover also focuses on the attitude and feelings -- love of animals, optimism, laughter, and a bit of sentimentalism.Don't take &quot;Manual&quot; as a complete guidebook to life unless you're a Paris Hilton heiress, since few women's lives can completely conform to what is described in here. Rather, take a tip here (perfume) or a tip there (shoes), if you're unsure of how to be feminine and sexy without seeming vampish. Certainly it has a lot of good pointers and recommendations.Probably &quot;Manual&quot;'s big flaw is in being too restrictive. What if a Bombshell likes J.D. Salinger or Sylvia Plath -- is she disqualified? And the assumption runs through it that a Bombshell can afford the designer price tags and furnishings that are absolute musts for a bombshell. As Ms. Loren said, being a bombshell shouldn't be restricted by whether you wear Dior or not -- how about a Budget Bombshell book?Laren Stover presents a fun and alluring vision of the classic bombshell beauty in &quot;Bombshell Manual of Style.&quot; Sure, you can't do it all, but you can at least put on some Manolos and spriz some Chanel on."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book is a delight.

Of course I do disagree with the authors occasionally -- this bombshell does enjoy French manicures, for example -- but it was the refreshing spirt of the book that really tickled me. Yea!

Please buy this book to make you smile, to embrace you inner bombshell, and to have fun.... if you are not looking for these things, then please find yourself something boring and practical. But if your heart is light, or needs to be lightened, then this is an exquisite choice.

And I reluctantly admit that I am 65% Bombshell, but this book is totally unrealistic (hiking in heels?!). It hardly applies to modern life. There are only a few techniques I'd care to apply to my life (like keeping perfume and nailpolish in the refrigerator). This book could have been really funny, but it fell short. What I was hoping would be cute movie star advice ended up being a sort of extended profile of my favorite movie stars. And not even a very good profile.

Yes the \\"drums\\" of this book i.e. the illustrations, cover, etc are great. However the lyrics i.e. the WORDS and the concept IS outdated. What worked then DOES NOT WORK NOW. No matter how \\"classic\\" a Bombshell is, she still has to keep up with the times. A Marilyn Monroe type today will never succeed in this world. Too innocent, too gullible, and Bombshell-like. Of course the Bombshell is on the verge of extinction - because the world is changing and become less accommodating to them! What I have left to say are:#1 - I am glad this book exists. It is definiately a \\"coming of age\\" book. If you can enjoy just the \\"drums\\" then you will enjoy it. Just don't take the lyrics too seriously, or seriously at all as a matter of fact.#2 - I am dissapointed at it's failed attempt.#3 - I resent the current examples of Marissa Tomie, Drew Barrymore, and Kim Basinger - and all the others are dead except for Liz Taylor who no longer is a Bombshell. She has gained weight and lost public appetite.#4 - The inconsistancy of the book is what made me give the below average rating. \\"A Bombshell does not run around changing her hair color\\" - and yet claims Drew Barrymore a Bombshell, the one who has gone from blond to brown to RED and to blond again. This is hypocritical and also outdated. Back in the 50's, haircolor was much more permanent, before the invention of \\"hair color removers\\" and heavy conditioners. Today, hair color is more versetile.Despite my sayings, don't take this book seriously at all if you want a cute table top decoration.

I've been through several copies over the years after friends and guests have \\"borrowed\\" mine...I don't blame them! After a difficult day I can always count on this pretty little book to boost my mood and restore my confidence- perfect with a glass of champagne! Uplifing, inspirational and beautifully illustrated. Please, please, write a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"It could have been a lot better. If you buy a book like &quot;The Bombshell Manual&quot;, you're expecting some light and fluffy reading. Well, good because that's what you're getting. There were some parts that I found interesting, but more parts that I found too long and tedious like the bombshell horoscopes. Yuck. And who says that redheads don't make good bombshells?"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I must say that there is a little bombshell in all of us. And this book helps you to discover it. You don't have to follow each advice from this book, but read it as a fun and inspiration! And guess what somewhere inside you this little hidden bombshell is going to raise! I love this book and read it over and over. I bought too many copies of this wonderful illustrated book and presented as a gift to the special friends, and they all love it!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book is FABULOUS!!! If you are a bombshell or want to be one, this is definitely the book for you! This book covers every aspect of the bombshell life: psychology, fashion, beauty, lifestyle, pursuits, ideals, and bombshell miscellanea. There are also adorable illustrations throughout. Plus the book is a nice size...perfect to toss in your handbag so you will always have your &quot;Bombshell Manual of Style&quot; as a reference! Some of the other reviewers said this book was outdated and offensive to women of the 21st century, but I think they are being a little bit overly sensitive. This book is charming, witty, elegant, and FUN...just like the bombshell herself!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I too enjoyed this book and am thoroughly delighted by its celebration of a no-holds-barred femininity. What is wrong with highlighting your charms and creating a prettier picture for everyone around you to enjoy? I did think, though, that the author could have used more examples from the present and perhaps some photographs to better illustrate how to be a bombshell today. Ninety-seven percent of her examples were from the 1950s, and one can't lift fashion models for today straight from movies approximately 50 years old. Case in point: Stover's chapter on \\"15 Road-tested Outfits.\\" South Seas Cruise? Fancy Horseback Riding?? Sure, those bombshells from the '50s continue to be inspirational, but it would have been more helpful to give guidance on how to incorporate bombshell style into the contemporary woman's everyday wardrobe. Perhaps a sequel needs to be written ..."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I couldn't put the book down. It was a needed &quot;blast from the past&quot; about the return to femininity!! Excellent and very sexy."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Ok, I was a bomb shell to begin with but its nice that other people understand that too! This book is so funny and enlighting that I could not put it down and had it read in the first night! This book allows us to bring out the hidden bombshell!This is a must read.... again and again!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I grew up watching old Marilyn Monroe movies and have always been fascinated with \\"Bombshell\\" style. Therefore, I was delighted to discover the \\"Bombshell Manual of Style\\" by Lauren Stover and Robin Toledo. According to this book, \\"Bombshells\\" love men, stilletos, the color pink, are kind to animals, know the seductive capabilities of perfume, and always have a signature lipstick color. On the negative side, however, \\"Bombshells\\" are manipulative, selfish, and throw temper tantrums.This is a very fun little book and gives women great ideas about how to celebrate their femininity. While I do not consider myself to be a \\"Bombshell\\" per se, I related to many of the ideas and suggestions in this book.What I loved most about this book is that it leaves no stone uncovered about proper bombshell ettiquette. The reader walks away knowing how a bombshell thinks, should dress, the type of lingerie she prefers, and even what color lipstick to wear for any occasion.This book is a quick read but ever so fun! If you know a \\"bombshell\\" or someone who wants to explore her (or his) inner bombshell, this book will make a great present!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Well, I'll have to admit that I'm not really a &quot;bombshell&quot; and in the fullest sense of the word, I don't think I'd want to be. It seems to me that even the most deep-down, genuine bombshell (in other words, someone whose true persona fits the general &quot;type&quot; as opposed to someone who's studied the description and is &quot;acting&quot; accordingly)would have a tough time being taken seriously in real life, even if she was an easy person to like or love...and sometimes, no doubt, be maddened by! On the other hand, maybe she's the type of person who inspires other people to take care of her.Still, it was a fun book to read, with its breezy, tongue-in-cheek style. I think it must have been a fun book to write, too. And even for us non-bombshells, it gives a nice reminder to kick back sometimes and just enjoy life and our femininity."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I had such a good time reading this book that I read it twice. It is marvelous! And I learned one very important thing...Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Some critics argue that the bombshell formula is strict and outdated. To the contrary, the author paints a picture composed of past bombshells (i.e., Jane Russell, Rita Hayworth, Elizabeth Taylor, etc..) that transcend into this era. I wouldn't argue that the author is trying to tout particular bombshell commodities that all bombshells must own. Rather, the author points out the symbolisms of bombshellism. For example, the author states polka dots, pink, and open-toe shoes are bombshell must haves. All of which are feminine. Ergo, bombshells dress feminine. Moreover, bombshell bathrooms contain Acquanet Hairspray, Ponds Coldcream, and Prell Shampoo. This can be interpreted to mean that bombshells don't waste money on high priced beauty products. They are traditional and confident. From books to movies to music to animals a bombshell picture is painted that shows a woman who is classic, feminine, compassionate, and spontaneous. Read this book to become enlightened and to increase your personal bombshellism."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I was expecting a parody, and this book can be read that way... except by the humorless, of course, who will take it far too seriously.Instead, while much of the book was written tongue-in-cheek, it's also juicy reading, laugh-out-loud funny, and surprisingly inspiring.It helped me connect with when I was a little girl and idolized Bridget Bardot in old movies on TV. It reminded me of Jayne Mansfield's giggly va-VOOM sense of style. And, this made me go to my closet and look at all the sensible white blouses and Terribly Professional tailored clothing, and sigh deeply.I went out and bought pink. Pink blouses, pink undies, pink shoes. Not what-a-cute-baby pink, but Bombshell Goddess PINK.Life hasn't been the same since. And I'm delighted!If you're looking for a carefully analyzed, dress-for-success, statistically footnoted guide to fashion, this isn't it. Likewise, if you read it with red pen in hand, noting where the pace is too slow and where the logic falters, you probably won't like this book. It's unapologetically frivolous and fun.BUT... If you want a good, light poolside read with plenty of smiles, this is a great choice. You may also reconnect with childhood fantasies, in the very best ways.This book is still on my nightstand for when the day has worn me down a bit. After reading just a few pages of it, I slip off to dreamland with visions of pink bubblebaths, fluffy maribou high-heeled slippers, and boxes of soft-centered chocolates."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I ADORED this book. In our current time where MTV dominates the american public's perceptions of how a girl should dress, act...etc, I found this book extremely refreshing and it gave me hope for our sad, sad times! People think that to be sexy one must dress like B. Spears or Lopez...this not only makes girls insecure about their bodies but also encourages them to be trashy! This book is a breath of fresh air, reminding us of the great beauties of the past who mixed &quot;sexy&quot; with class! This book encourages one to be confident and love being truly feminine and...themselves!!!! Trust me, it guides you there and it has been proved that the true gentleman will appreciate a modern day Audrey Hepburn!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I just bought this book for my girlfriend for her birthday (she asked for it). After she read it I picked it up and started perusing it and think it is hilarious. I feel sorry for all the women out there desparately seaking guides to tell them exactly what to do - step by step. The Bombshell Manual is for a woman with a mind of her own. It deconstructs the acrhetype while giving confidence to all women. It's not a recipe book like some readers hope it will be, but rather a treasure chest of inspiration."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I enjoyed this book, I also enjoy black and white movies. It seems as if society has made women so hard and tough that their afraid to be bomshells. I think this book is going to be a classic for all women to read. This book lets you know how women should be treat themselves. After all we are all special aren't we? I think if you are a true bombshell in the making, you can get some valuable hints, and then again if you are one of those women who think less about looks (yours) and more about society views, then maybe you should try reading something else. However junior bombshells read on."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable, and it gave me a lot of ideas on how to make me feel more glamorous in my everyday life (who would have thought that taking the strap off of your purse would make a difference?) Don't take it too seriously, though. Try to get a &quot;sense&quot; of the bombshell from this book; don't freak out about particular details. For instance, my major centered on English literature, and I wasn't too keen on taking her advice on my library! Pick and choose what will make YOU feel like a bombshell!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Are you incapable of walking in flats? Do you cry over nature shows? Do you actually wear satin babydoll pajamas without a male companion nearby? Then you just might be a bombshell.This delightful, funny, beautifully illustrated little book tells you just how to be an old-school bombshell (a la Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth and Elizabeth Taylor). Learn how to do your makeup, what perfume to use, what music to listen to (Sinatra, darling!), what to wear for any occasion and just what sort of bag you should be carrying. There's even a cute little quiz in the back to test your bombshell quotient.Warning: This book is unashamedly old-fashioned. If you have problems with using your sex appeal to get what you want, don't go here. Ditto if you don't like animals, if you hate skirts and if you hated the movie &quot;Swingers.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I've been searching for a book like this for years! Thank you Miss Stover, Miss Forrest, Miss Burdette and Miss Gollin. Beautifully designed, this extraordinary glamour guide doesn't miss a Bombshell beat. Whether it's body language, road-tested outfits or how a Bombshell amuses a man, this fabulous manual deconstructs the original Hollywood Bombshells and shares with us hundreds of practical tips. Why settle for just &quot;fashionable&quot; when you can be a Bombshell! I think this is a must read for all women."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I really couldn't wait to delve into &quot;The Bomshell Manual of Style&quot;. I expected a frothy confection of &quot;bombshellism&quot; with perhaps some tips to incorporate into my life. Sadly, I found the beautifully designed cover, illustrations and quips on the back of the dustjacket to be the best part. Yes the author shares ideas on how a bombshell behaves, eats etc. But all the examples are dated, and the author fails to translate them to today's society. If I were to wear some of the outfits the author suggests, like a large, bold print polka dotted dress with super high heels shopping I am sure I would get stares but they would not be flattering ones. The author Laren Stover uses Elizabeth Taylor, Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe frequently as examples through out the text. Certainly these women are renowed for their beauty and style. But what played then doesn't work now, even for a bombshell. Had the author also used more comtemporary &quot;stars&quot; with style and glamour such as Jodie Foster or Sharon Stone and reported on how these ladies imbue star quality and that bombshell quality to their lives, the book would be much more relevant. Suggesting that a bombshell goes on a diet as her doctor won't give her anymore pills is an insult to all modern bombshells who know the best way to lose weight is a good support group and everything in moderation. The movies a bombshell watches, books a bombshell reads, and especially the clothes a bombshell wears according to the author are in many cases limited and old fashioned. Many of the perfumes the author suggests a bombshell use are way too heavy for today's modern times. This book is so beautifully designed and so well conceived it's a great disappointment that it fails at its attempt. Should the author care to make it relevant to today and show the reader how to incorporate sassiness and style and charm into today's world it would be an excellent, fun read. But this little book will not help anyone fufill their bombshell aspirations!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"While I think this is a cute and witty book, I don't like how a previous reviewer mentioned &quot;intelligent but not at the cost of sensuality&quot;. Intelligence has a great deal to do with sensuality. It also weeds out men a truly intelligent bombshell would not want to associate with. If my intelligence intimidates a man, that's his problem. Intelligence doesn't take anything away from sensuality. I really didn't dig the &quot;bombshells don't read Emerson, Thoreau, or T.S. Eliot&quot; and the &quot;bombshells don't like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&quot;. Screw that. Three cheers for bombshells being domestically challenged! That's what I am! The illustrations were very cute as well."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"After going blonde recently, some co-workers dubbed me &quot;the Blonde Bombshell&quot;, so I decided to find out what that means exactly. Well, this book showed me the stuff it takes to be a real bombshell! I began renting the old movies it makes reference to and tuning up my inner bombshell, as well as dressing the part. My boss is beginning to wonder why I no longer wear pantyhose,( but if you read the book, you'll know!) I highly recommend it for all women who have a bit of a bombshell inside."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Hello, I am the author of another book out this summer (&quot;Jackie Style,&quot; bio of JKO), and I have to say, I LOVED this book -- a great summer, beach read -- I have been giving it to all my friends as gifts. Toledo's illustrations are gorgeous and aptly show &quot;Bombshell Style.&quot;I think people who are taking this book too seriously should lighten up -- take from the book what you like, raise a glass of Veuve Clicquot to the authors, and don't be afraid to show your own style to the world!A terrific book!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book is devoid of advice for women who have real jobs or real lives. If you are an out of work Actress who married well and divorced smartly, this is the book for you. Otherwise, move on.The fact that almost all of the actresses used as examples in this book are dead and lived miserable lives, seems to slip past the author. The examples of wardrobe choices and Bombshell Behaviors given are all out of movies or photo ops, so translation into real life becomes quite difficult.I think this must have been written as a joke. If you are really looking for advice, please look elsewhere. If you truly do not need to eat food, can wear stilletto heels in a snowstorm or hiking in the woods, and practice leaning naked from your window to lure the papparazzi into giving you free publicity, then you probably don't need this book. If you have a job, a husband, children, a hobby, or a life in general outside of being photographed, this book has nothing to offer you."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Laren Stover's Bombshell Manuel of Style is just plain fun reading. She writes about the easiest source to find bombshells - movies. Being a combination bombshell/bohemian and a movie buff I found this entertaining reading and a little inspiring. One recurring theme throughout the book is being confident and not afraid to be yourself. The book is made even better by the artwork of Rueben Toledo. Being a visual learner; it was Rueben Toledo's work that attracted me to the book and made me want to purchase it. I have purchased this book as gifts for others and two for me. One is for my night stand and one as a sort of workbook. I underline and make notes when I try a perfume or something another bombshell has tried. The experience makes good conversation when hanging out with girlfriends. It's a good read when you are having one of those days when you don't feel your best or bloated. It will give you a quick pick me up by reminding you just how fabulous you are. I mean this in a like/love yourself way not a conceited \\"I'm better than anyone\\" way. It wasn't meant to be a serious book, just fun. It seems to be her journal of discovery. She admits to not being a bombshell but becoming fascinated by them (Ms Stover was more bohemian). Warning, if you are confident, have contradicting interests, love being a girly girl, sometimes borderline on wearing extravagant jewelry (or straight out gaudy), are book smart, light up a room when you walk in, must look your best at anytime...you may find you are a bombshell. If not, you may come to understand them better. At the very least you will have fun watching great movies. Enjoy reading the book."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Really a sassy little book, that brought a smile to my face.

Must have reading for all females who love the fun of being girly!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I have decided to give this book to a great transvestite that I know. The book seems like a manual for a woman who does not know much and needs some schooling. The only problem is to be a Bombshell one shouldn't read a book, they should just be, but thats another story. This is light reading and meant for fun/rec purposes. Do not take this book seriously. It is adorable. One problem though (I DO LOVE DREW BARRYMORE), but Drew doesn't belong in this book. Granted she is great and beautious and all...but she is far too contemporary to be noted in the book. Get the book for fun facts, but don't see it as a guide to ultimate sex appeal."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Bought this book at an airport news stand and by the time I reached JFK from LAX I had finished the entire thing. It's funny and reminded me much of myself in many ways, (except that my fridge isn't a vanity on ice - I find that being able to whip up a gourmet meal, (or at least order one,) is a tre chic trait. I know lots of people don't get the connection between Patricia Arquette/ Drew Barrymore to some of the great ladies of the silver screen, but their bubbly personalities and often kittenish personalities certainly made sense to me. Certainly not meant to be a \\"style guide,\\" however someone living in mid-America that is looking to spice up their life will find this just as helpful as a Sex and the City DVD."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Okay, by now its known I have a pretty vast collection of beauty books, and how could I resist one that made you into Marilyn Monroe? This book is fun, it encourages you to be spontaneous, extravagant, and (gasp!) sexy. Its perfectly acceptable to be sexy, not just at home or out with friends, but in the office, shopping for groceries or taking the dog for a walk. Every woman has it within her, that coy little minx just waiting to show herself and be petted.A bombshell, and Jayne Mansfield put it, is a woman in cresendo. I love that. I love the idea that it is wonderful to accept yourself and revel in your own beauty. Be extravagant (champagne in the bathtub) be spontaneous (passionately kiss your lover in public) and at the same time always a lady.Good book, good read."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Holy cow! This book is entertainment. The author is not suggesting that we take every word as gospel. It is a lighthearted look at women who are a bit glam. Apparently, lots of dry, humorless feministas and women who live in sweats and big sneakers were not happy with what they found between the covers of this little gem. Too bad. This is a cute little book for those of us who still don't pump gas, wear high heels everyplace, and like being perfumed and pretty. Some of us can be playful and glam while still being smart and capable. What a shame that there are women out there who think we must be one or the other. For me, it was a thrill to find a book in which I see myself. We are bombarded with these ideas of what women should be, (more like men) and quite truthfully not all of us fit the mold. What a shame that some see bombshell types as throwbacks; we are not. [...]Before those who berate bombshells shun us, perhaps they should think of how they would feel if the feather-toe slipper were on the other foot: If they went back in time a few decades, they would be treated as odd because of their beliefs, appearances, and behaviors. There is room for all of us in the 21st century, get with the program. This is a cute book. That said, it is time to put on my Ella Fitzgerald cd and take a bubblebath. :)"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"this book is delightful and inspiring. it's definitely a light read, and shouldnt be viewed as a \\"guide\\" or \\"how to\\" book. it's more an homage to women who are strong and independent enough to embrace their femininity, sometimes to the point of hillarity. i have been giving it as a gift to fabulous women i know for four years, and it's always adored. i recommend reading it in a bubble bath..."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I am not a feminine woman, so I originally bought this book to laugh at the ludicrous things I was expecting to read. But it was entertaining, and enlightening. There are quotes from different bombshells, and sections on nearly every part of a bombshell's life. The best part about this book however is that while they tell you what a bombshell is, they apply no pressure for you to change your life all around to become one. They are simply trying to let you know why Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Kim Novak, Rita Hayworth, Heddy Lamarr, etc... did what they did they way they did it. A great read. Even for men."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book is great for light reading. This book gives some good advice such as having body confidence, always looking your best, and being as intelligent as you can be but I really wouldn't follow this manual very closely, for instance, would you wear high heels all the time or throw a tantrum? Overall, it's a fun read but not to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This book is fantastic! To those who think it's outdated, name for me a 'modern bombshell'? Jodie Foster? Please! Bombshellism is about being unabashadly feminine, sometimes innapropriate yet always a woman....

This one is a must read for either someone looking for an amusing read or want tips on how to be that rare type of woman who is equal parts lady & tramp! The people who are giving it low ratings are taking it way too literally. This book is not to be followed step by step, it's just for inspiration & reference. You don't have to follow every little thing just what you're comfortable with. It's light hearted & humorous reading & Laren did a great job on this. It's a very imformative book, it covers everything from beauty & style to art & culture. I also love it's compact size, so I just throw it in my tote when I'm on a getaway or sipping champaigne in my bubble bath. It's about the joys of being a woman & liberated. Sexy, smart, charming & beautiful...in your stilletos!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I adored The Bombshell Manual of Style! I loved how it made so many references to 50s bombshells like Marilyn Monroe. The tips in this book are not supposed to be applied to your own life. This book is simply a cute entertaining read. (Something other reviwers didn't quite grasp.) Don't buy this book if you are serious about becomming a bombshell (unless you want to emulate a retro bombshell). While some of the ideas can really be used...others are just a little too drastic to really live out. This is such a great book! I read it over &amp; over again...Definatly not a waste of money!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"This is a bubbly read that makes a great gift for glamour girls. (I was so flattered to get it, inscribed, \\"To my favorite bombshell...\\") Clearly the authors know their subject, and the purse chapter alone will give bombshells goose pimples of recognition. (\\"The bombshell likes a good fit. She choses a handbag the way she choses a slip - it's not just about looks. It should feel snug, well-proportioned, natural, a part of her. Messenger bags, backpacks and briefcases are out of the question - too utilitarian. And never anything in the shape of an animal, vegetable or mineral.\\")It would be nice if there were some tips on bombshell maintenance, though; As John Cusack said about a lost English rose in SERENDIPITY, \\"Ten years ago she looked like Baby Spice. Now she might look like...Old Spice.\\" So bombshells, take note! Moisturize from the inside out with water water water, then use something good -- or anything, really -- on your skin, like MAC Oil Control Lotion. Stay out of the sun! And since eyelash curlers crunch them up, give your lashes a fighting chance with a bedtime dab of petroleum jelly once a week. And if you must reduce, I'd be a bit suspicious of Marilyn Monroe's Diet Plan on page 136, which has buttered toast being served at every meal. (Try grapefruit or broccoli instead.)While this book may not turn a girl into a bombshell overnight, it could help a boyfriend better understand what we like. (Namely, Joy perfume, Frankie Sinatra and trips to the petting zoo.) And it's full of neat trivia, such as the fact that Kim Novak posted a sign outside her childhood home that read, \\"BRING SICK AND STRAY PETS HERE\\", and that she once had a lame housefly for a pet that escaped her mother's swatter. Stories like that make one proud to be a bombshell."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Okay, I'm jealous. I'll never be a bombshell, but at least I now smell like one. After glancing at the perfume chapter in the bookstore, I realized what fragrance was haunting me from my childhood. I immediately went out to buy it. At that point, the book was worth the money. This was a really fun read. For those women, unlike me, who aspire to be a bombshell, this book can be used as a manual."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I came upon this book at a friends house and read it over, not a big fan. The cover looks intriguing, but the book book is another story. Instead of giving practical advice ladies in this economy can use how to \\"bombshellize\\" your life for 2009, this is just a manual that gives unuseful and unrealistic advice, IE its ok to throw tamtrums because ladies did it in 1950's movies ( READ: movies), its ok, you won't get arrested or looked down upon. Wish this advice would be geared more towards ladies of this day and age, not ladies 60 years ago. There is advice to wear provacative clothing to work, and also encouragement to not work at all, and spend you days shopping at very expensive boutiques, not in this economy!"},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"I loved this book.

I think that I have read it four or five times. If you love Marilyn, Jayne, Rita, etc. you will love this book. Even though slightly unrealistic, it is a great book to read when lounging about your pool or bathtub (the bombshell's favorite place to be).

I recommend it for anyone who is interested in reading about bombshells, and confirm their prejudices:) It is a very quick read, and by reading it, one can delight in daydreams and fantasies about being The Bomb. It can also be used for educational purposes - it covers many areas of the life of a bombshell. It is important to note that this book focuses on the old school, not the new chic look.If you are looking for advice on how to actually becoming a bombshell, however, this is not the book to buy. Reading it is more like browsing through an entertaining magazine than actually reading a book, and there is not so much content. This is not a book that can be used practically; it can \\"only\\" be used as a nice distraction. I liked the chapter about different perfumes best. There are also a few hints about style as for clothing, but overall, this is a book for amusement and not for serious fashion (or other) advice."},{"Title":"The Bombshell Manual of Style","review":"Oh I think this book was amazing! I totally related to all of it. Being a bombshell are one of the things we can enjoy in life. I learned a lot of how to brush up on a few things, but I feel good when I read this book.

The best thing about Bombshell is the illustrations by Rueben Toledo. He's fantastic and the Toledo girls are cuter than cute. As for the book, read it but don't take it seriously. If you try to live like this you'll end up broke or dead. Actually, as I read I couldn't help but check off in my mind how the bombshell's the book holds as ideals ended up: Marilyn-- dead in rented room, Dorothy Dandridge--- dead on the bathroom floor, Rita Hayworth--- a lifetime of misery, Ava Gardner--- a really horrible, selfish woman, Jayne Mansfield-- dead on the road and at a low point in her career where Hollywood was laughing at her, not with her, Jean Harlow-- a victim of a nightmare marriage that may have led to her death at 26--- I didn't want to relate to any of this at all!Fashion wise, if you dress like a bombshell, expect to be called into HR or fired.

There are the Divas, the Sex Kittens, the Bombshells and I haven't figured out the name of the fourth...but they do a lot of the number/fact type stuff. This book is a study on the Bombshell personality. I was attracted by the cute pictures and the whimsical lettering. I read the entire book on a five hour plane trip and found myself laughing, giggling, tearing up from trying not to be so obviously tickled (pink, of course)by the many anecdotes and comparisons that are scattered throughout the book. My husband, who was sitting next to me, kept spying over my shoulder, and as I would share little insights, he too would laugh and then comment how true this was and how he knew he had married a bombshell.I have been handing these out to friends and even marriage counselors that I know. Toledo has put together some of the best sketches of lifestyle glimpses, while Stover does such a good work at bringing out generalities that are very much a part of this persona. It is very encouraging to compare other women who have excelled at who they are and note that some of us in mainstream America can also enjoy our \\"fun, cool sensual, sexuality, complete with feathers and sequins.\\" Then at the end of the day, we can curl up in our puffy polka-dot chairs and toss our shoes off our feet and across the room as we pick up the Wall Street Journal and catch up on the Headlines for the week.

It tells you about the race's background, the standards and the colors. The selection and care of a kitten are dealth with in detail, and so are diet, training, bathing and grooming. The section on health is quite extensive - all major and minor diseases and their treatment are discussed. A chapter is devoted to breeding and raising kittens and the last section deals with showing your Persian. It was interesting to learn that the Persian of today is the result of long-ago crossings of two similar breeds of long-haired cats - the Angora and the original Persian. The Angora as a breed is extinct - Longhair or Persian is the correct name. Some of the photographs are functional, demonstrating how to e.g. comb and brush your cat, handfeeding with doll's bottles or showing scratching posts, harnesses, carrying cases and administering medications. Although this is an old edition of Ramsdale's book, it is very thorough and still useful to the cat owner or prospective cat owner. The cats and kittens in the photographs are cuddly and gorgeous."},{"Title":"Fen Country","review":"&quot;Fen Country&quot; (1979) is a posthumous collection of short mysteries, with only one story repeated from Crispin's earlier collection, &quot;Beware of the Trains&quot; (1953). If you are new to this author, I suggest you start with one of his full-length mysteries to get the full flavor of his sometimes cranky, always brilliant amateur detective, Gervase Fen.The best of the &quot;Fen Country&quot; stories feature Professor Fen with Chief Inspector Humbleby of New Scotland Yard as his Watson. Some of the mysteries feature different, anonymous detectives and these stories tend to be clever puzzles with only the barest accouterments of character development or setting.There is one semi-autobiographical, wish-fulfillment story, &quot;We Know You're Busy Writing, but We Thought You Wouldn't Mind if We Just Dropped in for a Minute.&quot;&quot;I am forty-seven, unmarried, living alone, a minor crime-fiction writer earning, on average, rather less than 1,000 [pounds] a year.&quot;The crime writer lives alone in Devon, and has begged his friends and creditors not to interrupt him during working hours. Naturally they do, including a man and woman on the lam from their respective spouses. There is no great mystery as to the fate of the lovers, only a great deal of authorly glee.&quot;Fen Country&quot; is a good read for Crispin fans, but &quot;Beware of the Trains,&quot; whose stories he personally collected is better. Neither short story collection transcends the genre of 'brilliant, eccentric detective' fiction like his novels do. If you are an avid reader of Allingham, Sayers, or Innes from the Golden Age of British mystery writing, try Crispin's &quot;Buried for Pleasure,&quot; &quot;The Long Divorce,&quot; or &quot;Love Lies Bleeding.&quot; You might even be tempted to put Professor Fen at the top of your great detectives list, ahead of the likes of Lord Peter, Sir John Appleby, and Mr. Campion."},{"Title":"Fen Country","review":"The previously uncollected short crime stories of the late Edmund Crispin (pen name of Robert Bruce Montgomery) have been gathered here, including one that was unpublished during his lifetime (\\"Cash on Delivery\\").The majority of these 26 stories are very short items (averaging between 4 and 5 pages), which were first published during the early 1950s in the London EVENING STANDARD. Most are wit-testing Puzzle stories that hinge on a relatively obscure fact, and in most cases the detective is Gervase Fen, an amateur, who is a professor of English language and literature in the University of Oxford. In some other stories, Detective-Inspector Humbleby of New Scotland Yard is the main detective--assisted occasionally by Fen. And a few stories focus on other people entirely.One of the longer Fen-Humbleby stories in this collection--\\"The Mischief Done\\"--is seriously flawed. The main \\"fact\\" about diamonds that the story hangs on is bogus. It's as if Humbleby told Fen, \\"I know everything about pigs. Pigs have invisible wings and can fly. Look it up in any books about pigs or flying and you'll find it's true.\\" If a skeptical reader were to call Humbleby's (and Crispin's) bluff about diamonds, she or he would find that the remarkable statement about them is completely false. (A parallel flawed story is Conan Doyle's \\"The Speckled Band,\\" which depends completely on the ability of snakes to respond to sounds--despite the fact that ALL SNAKES ARE TOTALLY DEAF.)Another Fen-Humbleby story--\\"The Undraped Torso\\"--is built around some dubious ideas about the appearances of scar tissue.On the plus side, \\"Merry-Go-Round,\\" \\"Death behind Bars\\" (aka \\"Too Clever for Scotland Yard\\" in EQMM), and \\"Who Killed Baker?\\" (co-authored with Geoffrey Bush) are wonderful stories.By the way, a somewhat longer version of \\"Shot in the Dark\\" (a clever break-the-alibi story) was published in Crispin's earlier collection BEWARE OF THE TRAINS (1953) with the title \\"Otherwhere.\\" It was much admired by Jacques Barzun, an academic mystery buff, who included it in one of his anthologies, THE DELIGHTS OF DETECTION (1961).For the most part FEN COUNTRY is well printed.

I was in one of these cars at the time, in the rail yards at Coblenz! My problem is its lack of organization, that it jumps from location to location without any chronological sequence. There certainly was much confusion in the ranks and we did wander aimlessly due to lack of leadership. However, I know of no incident when anyone turned and ran. Also,he refers on Pg. 140 to the \\"442nd Regiment\\" of the 106th Division in error. The Regiments of the 106th were the 422nd, 423rd and 424th."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"Another great book on the single most significant battle, involving American forces, of WW2 in Europe. As the title says, it focuses on the first 11 days of probably the most confusing and involved battle of the whole war. That our troops, most of them ill prepared at that time, did as well as they did under horrendous conditions is a great testament to America's citizen soldier. That their leadership did as poorly as it did in a lot of cases, and as magnificantly as it did in other cases, really sheds some light on the US Army at the time. This book spells it all out in great detail, how it was for the individual soldier trying to stay alive, as well as the decision making from Gen. Marshall on down.Certainly the most difficult battle American soldiers fought in WW2, Normandy was terrible but for the most part it was only a day or so, and with far fewer casualties, the author really make you feel for the 18-19-20 year olds who were suffering as much from the weather and hunger as from a desperate enemy who knew this was really his last shot. The book is somewhat similar to \\" Company Commander\\" and the more recently published \\"The Longest Winter\\", both equally good reading. This book is important to those wanting to gain more insight in to the day to day life of American soldiers in the Battle of The Bulge. It also touches a little on the German side of the battle, particularly on the importance of the American uniformed German soldiers who spread confusion, terror, and death.The only downside to this book is the same one I have found in the many other books I have read on the battle. The reader is still left with confusion about the overall conduct of the battle. Apparently the battle was so large, so involved, that no single book can put it together so that the reader feels he knows what happened pretty much every step of the way. This one will not do that for you either.It will tell you though, how it was, in great detail, for a few of the many thousands of soldiers who took part. And in all fairness it didn't claim to be the definitive work on the battle.But I will still recommend it very highly to anyone interested in the Bulge, or in the war in general, particularly in Europe. Great book, you will love it, I know I did. You will want to do a lot more reading in the subject, though."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"This gritty account of the Battle of the Bulge doesn't pretend to tell a comprehensive story. You feel the cold, the fear, the anxiety of the attackers and rescuers alike, the cold, the deprivations of the prisoners, the confusion, the endless jockeying for power between the American and British high command and, again, the cold. But it's the personal stories of the young grunts that make the book a page turner. Even if you already know the details of this campaign, you won't want to put the book down until you finish.The author cuts through a slice of war that is personal and compelling, and he offers several insights that may be new to many readers. My only criticism: the military maps are atrocious for the untrained public. A few good, clear maps to orient all the activity going on would have been a great help."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"A friend of mine, Woody Timler, fought in the Battle of the Bulge and I wanted to learn more about it so I listened to the unabridged CD, 11 Days in December. I am afraid I picked the wrong source. The story was a series of jumbled up recollections that made little sense and carried little feeling of how it really was during that very traumatic time. Another review described the accompanying maps with the book as \\"atrocious for the untrained public.\\" With the CD version were no maps at all so one was left on his own to imagine how the conflicting stragidies worked themselves out. The celebrity references to Ernest Hemingway and Marlene Dietrich were unnecessary as they contributed little. The real stars were the soldiers.What made this muddled story even more so was the monotonous reading by Patrick Cullen. There was no excitement, tension or edge to his voice in the telling of this most horrific battle; further, his German and French pronunciations were ghastly.If you want to find a cohesive, interesting, and understandable telling of the Battle of the Bulge you won't find it in this book.Leif SalvesenPlano, TX"},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"If you pick up Stanley Weintraub's \\"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944\\" expecting a book less on the combat history of the Ardennes Counteroffensive (Battle of the Bulge) you will surely be disappointed. However, if you want a well-told tale of the humanity of this particular period of the Second World War your expectations will be thoroughly met. Weintraub himself states in his preface that this book is not an authoritative history of event, but rather a reflection of the human reactions and feelings associated with the holiday season in the Ardennes 1944. Now, don't read into this review that Weintraub has failed historically; he has not. His story is well told from a historical standpoint just not new in that regard. Instead Weintraub has added to the human factor of this greatest of all American battles. This is Weintraub's gift as a historical writer, to capture the human side of conflict, especially as related to places and dates around them (e.g., Christmas; the central temporal theme of at least three of his books). Whereas Alex Kershaw's \\"The Longest Winter\\" (another book covering elements of the Battle of the Bulge) uses liberal doses of celebrity reference without adding to the story (in fact in many ways hurting the central theme), Weintraub peppers his book with allusions to several famed writers and personalities (who weren't carry arms) with the intended effect - namely to put a human and oft more recognizable, face on these events. Goes to show those aspiring writers that such ploys will work or not depending upon context and intended effect!\\"11 Days in December\\" is 189 pp. of fun, easy to read, and while not impossible to put down, hard not to pick back up again. 3 out of 5 stars for pure history, 4.5 for historically-centered humanity!"},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"With \\"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944\\" Stanley Weintraub did not set out to examine all the complicated ins and outs of the Battle of the Bulge. Rather, building upon the remarkable story of the Christmas truce of the first World War (which he vividly rendered in \\"Silent Night\\"), Weintraub set out to paint a grim picture of what this peaceful holiday is like for those who are currently serving in battle.\\"11 Days in December\\" is not a full recounting of the Battle of the Bulge, and for those who may not be entirely familiar with its history, the organization of this book will not help them. Weintraub jumps from event to event, not necessarily in chronological order either. What he does achieve is a very vivid depiction of the human side of war. His narrative is filled with personal accounts from the very famous (General Patton, David Niven, future president Eisenhower, Ernest Hemingway) to the ordinary soldiers who were far from home on Christmas Day. Their tales are searing and sad, tempered by the facts of war - Allied soldiers accidentally killed by friendly fire, the torture of POWs, and the brutal realities of constantly losing and regaining ground.Weintraub has truly captured the human element in this book, emphasizing the dire straits that these soldiers were in and the price of war. However, the telling is extremely uneven making it hard for readers to focus on what happened when and to whom. One wishes Weintraub would have perhaps focused on solely the human side, or fleshed out his tale more chronologically to make it easier to follow. Still, as an introduction or revisiting of the Battle of the Bulge, Weintraub does a commendable job."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"The book is short.

I knew the story of The Battle of the Bulge, though this was my first book on it.For the most part, what I liked was that it was a quick read.

And, I read a lot, although this is only my second book on the Bulge. I'm interested in the Bulge because my uncle Wes, 101st AB, got the snot beat out of his outfit at the Bulge and he never talked about it. This book suffers from being disorganized and overly anecdotal, and by accentuating the trivial. I could not get any clear idea of the big picture of this battle, nor could I find anything informative at the micro level (how individual events discussed in this book impinge upon other events in the narrative), simply because the stories were unrelated in chronology and in geography. Even better maps - those that identified and located places mentioned in the narrative - could not have helped very much in putting the battle together and making it understandable. Trivia: Why treat Hemingway in this book at all? I applaud the movement toward \\"narrative history,\\" which guys like Shelby Foote (who worships the wrong man, Nathan Bedford Forrest) and Stephen Ambrose (OK, he had a little plagerism problem, but his books still make good reads) did well. This is because this style of writing relies on dogface soldiers and little people who were there, and paints interesting, understandable pictures about historic occurrances so that the reader cares about what's going on. Weintraub seems to have tried to write a \\"narrative history\\" with this book about the Bulge but simply fails on account of all that I write above."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"But for the want of petrol (gasolene), World War II might have had an entirely different ending. The Allies would have still won, but it would have been a much longer, much more bloodier conflict if Hitler's last and greatest gamble had worked--as it almost did.If the Germans had had the gasolene they needed for this battle, they might well have reached Antwerp, destroyed the Allies' most important harbor and split the Allied forces into.Yes, Bastogne would have been a problem--and the Germans' lack of gasolene takes nothing away from the heroic stand made there or Patton's remarkable reversal of course--but if the Germans had had the gas they needed, they could have and would have rushed past Bastogne to the sea.Weintraub's writing isn't always easys to follow, but it's usually, almost always, worth the effort. He masters the strategy of the battle and succeeds in the most important element of a historical account such as this: he gives the battle a human face, from the common (or uncommon in this case) soldier to the generals such as the confident Patton, the steady, perhaps too steady, Eisenhower and the haughty, arrogant Montgomery.The son of a veteran who was surrounded at St. Vith appreciates this book and Weintraub's work. It enabled me to appreciate what my Daddy went through even more."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"The first thing you have to ask yourself as you consider this book is 'What information is it I want to get about the Battle of the Bulge.'If it's a detailed military historical treatment of the battle with it's strategic and tactical significance of the battle, this isn't the book.As the author says in the Preface, this is a book on 'how it seemed then - a look at ten days on a frozen World War II battlefront through the lens of Christmas.' And at that purpose it excels. Here are small annecdotes. Here is what one soldier after another remembers. Here are times when the German and American troops stopped fighting and sat down for Christmas.It is a supurbly written book, and gives you a better feeling of what it must have been like to have actually been there. I'm glad I wasn't (I was three years old then).This is not to say that it isn't historically accurate. It is. But the emphasis is on the individual soldiers, not the big picture. I only noticed one error, and it's probably a typo. On page 140 he talks about the 442th Regiment being part of the 106th Division. The 442 was the famous 'Go For Broke' Regiment composed of Japanese-American troops. They fought in Italy, not at the Bulge. Like I said, probably a typo - the regiment Col Descheneaux commanded was the 422. How's that for nit-picking?"},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"The author consulted a number of different sources to put this together and at times it gets a bit choppy. Intertwining the battle sequence while trying to relate it back to Christmas gets a bit awkward at times, but it is still an enjoyable book.Having visited Bastogne in December, the book communicated for me a solid sense of place.

The human interaction also shows in the level of the individual soldiers who surrender, hold on, and fight in poor weather in bad conditions. There were many mistakes in the battle, but the quality of the American soldier held true and the Germans did not get their breakthrough.This is a great book on the human perspective of the battle.

The 201 pages provides coverage of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. It is a popular history that could be a TV movie to educate viewers. There are few references to the war in other theaters. The Battle of the Bulge had the most intense fighting in the West since Normandy during WW II. The Nazi army achieved a complete surprise through secrecy and not using radio (p.23). Some warnings were received by the Allies but considered disinformation and ignores (p.25). Hitler hoped a successful offensive would bring peace on his Western front. All plans contain assumptions and dependencies.The chapters tell about the events among the Allies. Things were going on that were never reported, such as the deserters and \\"misappropriations\\" (p.23). The attack began with surprise attacks on December 16 in the Ardennes forest. The Nazi army was successful and advanced. There were rumors of murdered prisoners by the SS units, and in turn \\"no SS troops will be taken prisoner\\" (p.34). Inexperienced troops and replacements were routed or defeated (p.36). German troops dressed to impersonate Americans caused confusion (p.75). Ernest Hemingway, armed with a Thompson submachine gun, accompanied front-line troops (p.82). Bad weather prevented air support (p.85). General McAuliffe and the surrounded troops refused to surrender (Chapter 8). The weather cleared on December 24 and the Air Force could attack the enemy and drop supplies to the besieged forces (Chapter 9). American forces raised the siege and Nazi troops moved east. Allied forces continued to move east (Chapter 12). The 'Afterword' provides a summary.There are other books which are longer and have more details.

It is well-written and gives a fairly thorough account of the battle and its surroundings, but I couldn't help feeling a sense of detachment on the part of the author from the people who fought in that battle. There are the usual \\"up close and personal\\" vignettes about individuals, but they seemed almost an afterthought to the main focus of the book, the battle. Even that could have been explored in more detail, but this is a relatively short book, and within the space confines, the author did a decent job of explaining what happened, although some of his prose raised more questions than were answered.

The prodigious author, Stanley Weintraub, has collected the records of the recollections of many people, ranging from President Roosevelt down to the soldier in the field. The central theme of all these disparate individual records is the eleven day period in 1944 from December 16th through December 26th.The book begins with a bet between General Eisenhower and British Field Marshall Montgomery that the war would be over by Christmas 1944. Adolf Hitler gave orders for an offensive in the west that would cause Eisenhower to lose his bet, extend the war well beyond Christmas and enter history as the \\"Bulge\\". For some portion of the front of the book, I felt that the author was so \\"pro\\" Montgomery, that I went on the internet to see if Stanley Weintraub was actually British. He is not.This book, \\"11 Days In December\\", is not just a collection of numbered Army units moving here and there in Belgium, although, the author does tell you, that such-and-such a unit moved to a town; as an example, that the 101st Airborne was moved, by trucks, to Bastogne. In fact, Weintraub has some three to four pages in the index dealing with numbered American, British and German units. If you would like a book that describes where the different divisions, regiments, headquarters, etc., were located, I would recommend \\"The Battle Of The Bulge\\" by John Toland (1966).Of greater importance is the fact that the author brings together many recollections of different kinds of people. For example, there are the reminisces of movie stars David Niven and Marlene Dietrich, which are capped by the reported experiences of the famous writer, Ernest Hemingway. Of course, the author includes the famous response of General Anthony McAuliffe when he was asked by the Germans to surrender Bastogne. \\"Nuts!\\" On a more serious note, Stanley Weintraub records, pages 100-101, that President F.D. Roosevelt asked Secretary of War Stimson and General Leslie Groves if the A-bomb would be ready to use on the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The bomb was not read and Weintraub writes, \\"Despite later racist allegations, the atomic bomb was not being withheld for use against Japan\\".The book ends with the relief of Bastogne, on 26 December 1944, when General Patton's Fourth Armored Division reached that Belgian town. By the way, in the Church's calendar, December 26th has long been St. Stephen's Day; see, for example, \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" by John M. Neale and Tim Ladwig, 2005."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"Although the German attack on the Western front in December, 1944 ultimately shortened the war, at the time it was a sensational event that generated a great deal of fear that another blitzkrieg was taking place. As became clear later, the Germans burned through their last reserves in an attack that had no chance of succeeding, for they had no stocks of gasoline for their motorized vehicles. Their only hope of success was to capture large stores of Allied fuel a short distance from the launching point of their attack.A great deal of ink has been used in analyzing the battles, in this book there is a concentration on the human side, success, brutality, incompetence and some instances of kindness and compassion during the Christmas season. Weintraub holds nothing back in his comments about the Allied leadership, the intense rivalries between the commanders, both military and civilian. There are comments from the ordinary soldier, freezing off precious body parts in the numbing cold while desperately trying to avoid having them shot off.Two primary points of human interest are the incidents where the German soldiers went out of their way to be kind to Allied POWs and the arrogance of Patton, praying to God for his help in getting clear weather and lecturing him over his failures. That rendition captures the essence of Patton, his effective arrogance and how he would have hated peace so much.This book is a story of the battle from the perspective of the foot soldier and the befuddlement of the Allied leadership. Part of the reason for the level of sensation and fear was that for so long no one really knew what was going on. Weintraub also is blunt in his criticism of the military leaders and how they so often put their pride before victory."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"This book isn't really an addition to the scholarship on the Battle of the Bulge. Instead, author Weintraub has decided to focus on the holiday aspect of the battle. This is a clever ploy on his part, in that this book, and 3 others he's done on Christmases during wars, will probably sell well during the holiday seasons for years to come, and I suspect they were pretty easy to write. This book is 180 pages of text, a thin section of notes, a bibliography and an index. There isn't much here.The author does do a pretty good job setting the stage for his story. He takes a decidedly American tone in discussing the arguments between the Brits (especially Monty) and the Americans, though he's pretty hard on Courtney Hodges and Omar Bradley, too. The account of the fighting is pretty cursory, given the space he's allowed himself, and his discussion of the Christmas aspect of things is really limited to 2 chapters, each about 20 pages in length. There are some good anecdotes here (Marlene Dietrich sleeping with George Patton, for Pete's sake!) and everything is well-written and reasonably well-organized, but really truly there's nothing new regarding the battle. The Germans attack, they capture St. Vith, surround and capture 2 regiments of the 106th Division, surround but don't capture Bastogne, and then are stopped short of the Meuse, and Bastogne's relieved. That's about it. A little about Peiper, a brief mention of Kurt Vonnegut, and you're done.While I enjoyed this book, I'm not sure what the point was, other than to tie in the Christmas theme. The author's previous Christmas-themed book, which dealt with the Christmas Truce in 1914, involved an actual event, when the armies stopped fighting sort of spontaneously, and the generals hesitated before deciding what to do...that was more insightful, because there was something that actuallly happened. Here, American troops celebrated Christmas during the Battle of the Bulge. Nothing really that extraordinary about it."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"Mainly general broad knowlege of the Bulge. The most detailed accounts and the bulk of the book deal with allies commanders - Eisenhower, Montgomery, Bradley, Patton and the other major Allied commanders and their personal squabbles during the battle. On the German side most of the storyline deals with Hitler, Model, Rundstedt and their other major players and their strategic and personal problems. Most of the action describes strategic manueverings, so if you're wanting some good tactical storylines and peronal accounts from the front lines, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"The following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of \\"11 Days in December - Christmas at the Bulge, 1944\\" by Stanley Weintraub. Patrick Cullen reads the book.On December 16, 1944 the Germans, or more specifically Hitler, decided to attack the allies in a desperate bid to end the war or at least obtain a more favorable negotiated peace.As the author clearly details a combination of diverse circumstance almost reversed the allies hard won advances towards Germany. Christmas holiday leaves granted many troops and senior officers; the wishful belief held by many that the war was just about over, mass desertions by British and American forces and the atrocious weather and terrain all combined to give Hitler an advantage that was masterfully exploited.The author's intent is to tell the story through the words of many diverse participants on both sides. The extensive use of direct quotes gives this story a startling degree of realism.I found some aspects of this narrative particularly riveting. The description of the intense rivaliary between the British - Montgomery - and the American high command was disheartened. The fate of the allies POW's is detailed in heart wrenching details. The wretched life of the enlisted solders that had to burn their Christmas mail and gifts as they retreated from the German onslaught breaks your heart.My knowledge of European geography is limited. I had to stop the disk and refer to maps of the battle area in order to fully visualize what was transpiring. This is one of the unfortunate limitations of listening to a book were knowledge of place and location are essential to fully understand the story.This audio book consist 5 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 5 and one-half hours. Blackstone Audio published the audio book.The disks are secured in the standard fan fold multi CD holder. The holder slides into the external packaging box.Blackstone audio indexes the tracks on each disk in 3-minute segments. I found this very helpful finding my place on a disk or finding a particular segment to play again.For individuals, like myself, who do not have a more that superficial knowledge of the events that transpired and the players involved this was a very useful and informative audio book."},{"Title":"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","review":"The first thing you have to ask yourself as you consider this book is 'What information is it I want to get about the Battle of the Bulge.'If it's a detailed military historical treatment of the battle with it's strategic and tactical significance of the battle, this isn't the book.As the author says in the Preface, this is a book on 'how it seemed then - a look at ten days on a frozen World War II battlefront through the lens of Christmas.' And at that purpose it excels. Here are small annecdotes. Here is what one soldier after another remembers. Here are times when the German and American troops stopped fighting and sat down for Christmas.It is a supurbly written book, and gives you a better feeling of what it must have been like to have actually been there. I'm glad I wasn't (I was three years old then).This is not to say that it isn't historically accurate. It is. But the emphasis is on the individual soldiers, not the big picture. I only noticed one error, and it's probably a typo. On page 140 he talks about the 442th Regiment being part of the 106th Division. The 442 was the famous 'Go For Broke' Regiment composed of Japanese-American troops. They fought in Italy, not at the Bulge. Like I said, probably a typo - the regiment Col Descheneaux commanded was the 422. How's that for nit-picking?"},{"Title":"The Thousand-Headed Man","review":"After his Calbia escapade Doc learns in London, with the media highly intrigued as to why he is there.

Cris Burks has a way of making the characters so real you immediately become emotionally bonded to them. I found myself at times saying aloud, \\"oh no he didn't,\\" whenever the main character, Katie went into detail of how her husbands wronged her. Although I didn't agree with the fact that it took four husbands and an Internet relationship to make her realize that she was overweight and needed to make herself her first priority, I am a sucker for the happily ever after.Cris Burks has an amazing way of story telling and was always right on time with her one-liners and ole wives tales. -DD"},{"Title":"SilkyDreamGirl","review":"Why doesn't anyone care about Katie? Cris Burks has done an outstanding job of depicting the Katies of the world--women whose friends, husbands and other family members take for granted in the extreme. Katie's that reliable pair of shoes or ragged sweater that one loves enough to keep around but not enough to take care of or to mend. My favorite Katie-hater is Donna, Katie's 'best friend.' She constantly insults and hurts Katie under the guise of being frank for Katie's own good. I think that Donna and Mamma Jeffries, Katie's mother, really do love Katie, but they abuse her, simply because Katie's no good at playing the game of survival of the fittest. At least not in the beginning.I love it that Katie's boys, even her oldest son, are crazy about her. They know that she's a jewel, and treat her accordingly. The scene between Katie, her sister-in-law and the boys had me laughing so hard that I almost choked!I really do like everything about SilkyDreamGirl, and I can't wait for Cris Burks next offering."},{"Title":"SilkyDreamGirl","review":"Katie Coomers is 37.

Although it doesn't sound like it at first this is one of the funniest (not smiling funny but laugh out loud funny) books you will read all year.I can't believe this is Chris Burks's first book. It's just that good."},{"Title":"SilkyDreamGirl","review":"What makes Katie Coomers unique? She survives all the tragedies in her life. This book is well-written.

At the family's Labor Day picnic, husband number four surprises her and the guests by announcing that he is leaving her, moving to California, and he expects for her to care for his sons until he can get himself together. A few days later, she shows up at her job as a call center supervisor and is fired for under performance. Katie has gained a lot of weight over the years and has to listen to her mother berate her about her weight and choices she has made in life and in men.Katie deals with her plight by cooking mouth-watering meals and baking fabulous, calorie-rich desserts, which she feeds to her sons and her wounded soul. People rave about her desserts and her friend Donna tries to get her to go into the catering business but Katie wants no part of going into business with Donna. In fact, Katie is happy just having her own personal pity party. Besides cooking, her other form of escape is the Internet chat rooms. She meets new friends who do not judge her and have a great influence on her. One special cyber friend is MastrThief who helps her believe in love again, then increases her loss of hope when her illusions about him are shattered. Katie, though, is persistent in not giving up on finding Mr. Right on-line. She meets and dates several gentlemen from the chat rooms. Some are nice and others leave something to be desired.This debut novel by Cris Burks is well written, witty, interesting and intriguing. The book is easy to read and the flashes back and forth in time are easy to follow. The characters are well developed and have a realness to them whereas a reader could easily relate to them. It seems as if the author had to have lived this experience in order to write this novel so vividly. This book is highly recommended.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"SilkyDreamGirl","review":"This book is captivating from the get go. The name is very well chosen - it is the name the protagonist Katie uses for herself in cyberspace. The author has a fantastic way with descriptions and is drop dead hilarious. Her characters come alive and the plot is excellent. The reader empathises with Katie, who is filled with despair after her husband leaves her. She finds comfort in eating and balloons out even more. Then she seeks and finds some measure of comfort in the chat rooms of cyberspace. At the end of the story things are definitely looking up for Katie and since I'm a sucker for a good ending this was great.I do believe there are many people like Clarence walking around. Those who pay a lot of money with the promise of making so much more.

Thus, SilkyDreamGirl begins.Katie's wit and sarcasm kept the book moving, and at times made me laugh out loud.

All the while, her online experiences begin impacting her \\"real time\\" life.

There's plenty of overeating going on, surfing chat rooms in a quest to find a satisfactory relationship, and drama-filled encounters with unforgettable characters who challenge Katie to define who she is and who she wants to be. This wonderful debut novel is well-written, endearing, has twists and turns, and is thick with hearty chuckles. Furthermore, novelist Cris Burks is adept at writing descriptions and creating laugh-out-loud metaphors which should provide readers with an enjoyable experience as opposed to having them plow through a story filled with overused clich&eacute;s and adverbs. One aspect that could have made this great novel even greater is increased dialogue between the characters so that we can get to know them through showing versus telling. In summary, SilkyDreamGirl is a reader's delight, and a welcome new voice to the world of African-American fiction."},{"Title":"SilkyDreamGirl","review":"This book is definitely a page turner.

I like the fact that Emma has a half-breed child from a long ago rape and she keeps her child and lets him know how much he's loved.I like the fact that Emma doesn't whine about things that need to be done - she just does them.I like the fact that Rider is an outcast in both his Shoshoni world and in the white world. It gives him a certain edge, I think.However, there's a lot to not like about this one, too. I would have preferred that Emma not have been raped. Her son could have been written in differently - ie she's raising her sister' son, she thought she loved the man who fathered the boy, etc. Being the child of a rape has got to be hard on a child.Yet, the son says nothing or does nothing about why his skin tone was so much more different than his parents.I disliked the fact that while she was sleeping with Rider, she tried to get the Lt. from the army outpost to propose to her.I disliked the cavalier way Rider went about securing Emma as his bed partner on the wagon trail.I also disliked that absolute flatness of every other character on the wagon trail.

The other members of the wagon train don't want to let her go because she has a big black mark against her - she has a half-breed child as a result of rape from a Cheyenne Indian.Rider is a half-breed with a Shoshoni mother and white father. He is a gunslinger wanted for murder by both the whites and his Shoshoni tribe. On the run from bounty hunters, he rides through town as Emma and the wagon train are getting read to head out. When the wagon train leader dies unexpectedly, Rider decides to lead them himself to hide from the bounty hunters and pursue Emma, who he wants as soon as he sees her. Rider makes the wagon train take Emma with them but he does this with the intention of sleeping with her rather than helping her out.Out on the trail, the misfits who make up the wagon train are nothing but trouble. Most of the families were rejected from other trains because they are running from the law or not prepared for the hardships on the trip. Emma Trent is constantly surprising Rider with her courage and determination. When he sees her half-breed child, he sees this as confirmation that she will easily fall in bed with him since she obviously had lain with another Indian. Rider has a few surprises in store when Emma rejects him as she is terrified of men after being raped.The more time Rider spends with Emma, the more he becomes a decent person. The hard, cold gunslinger finds himself caring about Emma and her son Josh. Emma and Rider start to care more for each other as they battle each other, the other people in the wagon train and watch out for Indians. Emma starts to think Rider might be a decent man and they give into the passion between them to share some hot nights along the trail. But when the train reaches Oregon will he ride on or will he stay with her?This book is a very good adventure historical romance that takes the reader along with travelers on the Oregon trail. Emma is a heroine to root for, she survives hard times and rape but still remains a caring and giving person. She wants to go to Oregon to have a better life for her son with less prejudice against his Indian blood. Rider starts out as the type of bad boy that you can see his potential to be a better person but life has hardened him into a selfish, cynical man. It takes the love and caring of the couragous Emma to make him into a better man. I enjoyed the passion Rider and Emma had for each other, it was nice seeing two lonely souls find someone to love."},{"Title":"Warrior's Heart (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was believable. It is the story of a young woman named Emma and her son (whom she conceived through a violent rape by a Indian warrior). It is about time an author writes history as it really was. Yes, there were many many children from rape all through history. What is so beautiful is she loves her son and bares no resentment. She is moving to Oregon in hopes that the settlement will accept her child of mixed blood. The author shows many examples of how cruel racist whites were to half breeds, another issue I am glad she brought to the table.Emma falls in love with Rider, a Shoshone, who is her wagon master. He is rough and raw and the author writes him vividly as a true man. He has flaws, a huge sexual appetite, and somewhat selfish. He is a believable character which makes the story seemed real.I admire Emma and how she did not hate all Indians for just what one did. I also like the fact that there is finally a romance about a woman who is not a virgin full of silly ideas."},{"Title":"Warrior's Heart (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"It was one of those &quot;hard to put down&quot; books.

This author used to be one of my favorites, but this book wouldn't have a chance at being published by an unknown. I have about 50 pages left, but I'm tempted to stop reading. I've gotton to the point where I roll my eyes everytime the same phrase or thought keeps getting repeated. Most of the time, I don't even like Rider and Emma (the hero and heroine of this story), and that makes it VERY hard to get into the story. Apparently, this author has gotten so popular, that her editors no longer even look at her stuff, which is a pity. They could have shaved about 50 pages of repeated junk. Emma tells Rider that she loves him three times within the span of a few pages, and then thinks to herself &quot;She loved this man, she knew it now, though she didn't speak the words, knowing he feared commitment.&quot; ?????? It was as if she wrote a few pages at a time, then went back weeks or months later and finished the chapter, not bothering to go back and see what was written.

She put up a fight at first but her feelings for Rider just got stronger. I pratically did no work at my job, I just couldnt put the book down. I give this book 5 stars.

That should be interesting!! Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Warrior's Heart (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"The plot is definitely there, but I was not enthralled by the writing style. Too many things were repeated. Phrases, thoughts, cliches, and subplots. I got the feeling that this story was written quickly with very little reworking for clarity.

It just requires that you look past all the redundancies."},{"Title":"Warrior's Heart (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"I have to agree with some of the others, this book was far from Georgina Gentry's better works. Although I liked the heroine, Emma, I could not feel the same way for the hero, Rider. I found him obnoxious and down-right disgusting at times. I never felt like I was reading a real love story. Had this not been by one of my favorite authors, I would have not finished it. The secondary characters were also obnoxious and rude and I could not find anything to like about them. I have read almost all of Ms. Gentry's books and this one is at the bottom of the list. It definitely is NOT a keeper!"},{"Title":"Warrior's Heart (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"I at first liked this book as it went into how Emma and Rider first met but after a few more chapters this book really fell flat where her other books flew. I really did not like how Rider treated Emma as I got further into the book. He's supposed to be falling in love with her but to me it seemed as though all he ever really wanted was sex, I mean thats the only reason why she was allowed on the wagon train to begin with because he was \\"allowed\\" by the others on the train to take his pleasure with her. I mean he tries to rape her twice in the book. He is rude, obnoxious and doesn't even take Emma's feelings in to consideration. I also think that Josh's character isn't written deeply enough he could have brought a lot more to the story but Gentry only touches on him breifly using him as a bridge to get Rider and Emma together. He is such an intresting character but is made to be so shallow and unimportant. I hope like many others that their is a book written about him when he is older which will bring more depth and emotion to his character and also show his feelings on what it is like to be a product of rape and maybe him finding out about his Cheynnne roots. All in all I give this story only two stars because it's plot was not well thought out but its characters were somewhat intresting and the love scenes once consentuial were well written. I only hope if a sequel for Josh is written that it will have more depth and its characters will be better behaved and have more morals."},{"Title":"Warrior's Heart (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"This book is blah.

Read all her others and they are top class but this one is the pits!!!Her hero was in my eyes no hero. He was selfish, full of himself, arrogant and a brute into the bargain. He lead the wagon train because he wanted to bed the heroine . He had no complusion in blackmailing the heroine to sleep with him even after he knew she had been raped!!!. He was no better than her rapist. He 'hated' the way others on the wagon train because looked down on her but he was worse. He looked on her as his property, as part of his payment for leading the trail.He was prepared to treat her like a whore because she had a child and obviously been with someone else.He showed no honour in dealing with heroine. I would not even call him a 'man' let alone a warrior with honour.The characters were wooden, sex scenes boring. Hard to believe this book was written by the wonderful Ms. Gentry as all her other books are filled with compassion, love and both men and women with codes of honour and courage amd wonderful sex scenes.Leave this one alone and read her other native american books and you fall in love with each and every hero.I would give this some minus stars if I could"},{"Title":"Worlds of Pain: Life in the Working Class Family","review":"Lilian Rubin writes with an empathy that could only come from being the product of a working-class family herself. Unfortunately, the baggage which Rubin's brings along on her study tends to butt in inappropriately. In the chapter on the subject's childhood, for example, Rubin concludes that all of the subjects must have been unhappy during their early years because she could recall her &quot;own impoverished background.&quot; It did not matter to Rubin that her subjects &quot;implored, even commanded [her], to believe they had happy home lives as children.&quot;It should also be noted that this study was conducted in 1972. While there is a fairly significant new introduction which Rubin wrote in 1992, the text of the book is unchanged. Certainly much has changed in the past twenty years. Both in terms of the jobs of the working-class, the sex lives of working-class couples, the reasons they marry, and even the definition of working-class itself.In short, an interesting read by a talented writer. But rigorous sociology it is not."},{"Title":"Worlds of Pain: Life in the Working Class Family","review":"This book would probably be a lot of use to a writer or screenwriter who was researching the working-class family in the early 70s.

If one reads between the lines, what we get here is an author who has alterior motives. I'd like to know what her positions are on Socialism, Marxism, and Communism. She tries to be cryptic but the careful reader will discover what Rubin's really up to.Finally, this book is dated. It has lost most of its validity, and unless one wants this book soley to understand the time it was done, it has very little place in current working-class family evaluation."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary ...

I rarely if ever have reviewed any of them because they are so picked over that I don't feel that I have anything to add. However, it was with a good deal of anticipation that I stepped away from the renowned to the obscure by reading \\"King Henry VIII\\". I say that because it was the subject that interested me and I admit that it made quite a difference reading a play about someone I knew something about. This, in turn, gave me pause to consider many things about \\"King Henry VIII\\" that I would never have even known to consider about his other histories. It's not that I read many of his other histories but those that I had read left me completely at the mercy of the Bard for any sort of perspective or overview.What I found most interesting about \\"King Henry VIII\\" is the limited scope that the play covered. Let's face it: even today Ol' King Henry VIII is a treasure chest of plots and subplots. Yet Shakespeare treated his subject with a great deal of respect and, essentially, rewrote history before it was even written. The four or five main characters (with the exception of Cardinal Wolsley) all come across in good light. Perhaps Ann \\"Bullen\\" is a bit empty-headed but certainly Henry, Anne of Aragon and the lesser known (outside of the Church) Thomas Cranmer are all noble through and through. There is little of the bawdy, glutonous Henry that history has given us. You would guess that Shakespeare would have done great things with such a subject but he didn't and the question that I asked myself was; WHY?I have not studied anything about this play. I prefer to always see what the play says directly to me before being told by others as to what it means. Thus I may be stating the obvious but I came away with the conclusion that \\"King Henry VIII\\" was written for Shakespeare's Quenn Elizabeth. It was pretty obvious when reading Cranmenr's final speech and it put everything into perspective. All that went before were noble and all that came after were not even mentioned. The \\"noble\\" divorce of Henry and Ann of Aragon was necessary so that Henry have the proper opportunity to sire Elizabeth. I'm not sure enough of my timetables to know if Elizabeth I was still alive when this play came out but even if she weren't it would still be the Bard's tribute to her.I had come to expect that most of the \\"good stuff\\" of Shakespeare (with the exception of \\"King Henry V\\") was to be found in his tragedies primarily and comedies next with the histories coming up a poor third. However, I kept my pencil busy underling passages in \\"King Henry VIII\\". It is a good play, it's not \\"MacBeth\\", but it's a good play. I'd have considered rating it 5 stars but then we'd have to rate some of the rest as 7's 8's and 9's. Most people who'd take the time to read Shakespeare probably already have a pretty good working knowledge of at least the popular history of the King with six wives. Read it for yourself and I think that you, too, will find that history is better understood when you are already familiar with the subject."},{"Title":"King Henry VIII Pb (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"... the reviews for King Henry VIII by William Shakespeare (and all their other books as far as I can tell) as if different editions have the same content - obviously in the case of classics that is far from true.... 3 editions of Henry VIII at this time: (1) Hardback edited by Gordon McMullar published in November 2000 (2) Paperback edited by Jay L. Halio published in September 2000 (3) Paperback edited by R. A. Foakes published in February 1998Their editorial reviews describe ALL 3 of these editions as &quot;This is the first fully annotated modern-spelling edition of King Henry VIII to appear for over a decade and includes up-to-date scholarship on all aspects of the play, including dating authorship, printing, sources and stage history.&quot; I don't think so! The reader reviews don't distinguish the editions but they are the same reviews posted for the different books. I wish I could contribute the answer but I am still trying to figure it out -- in the meantime, purchase cautiously or you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"King Henry VIII Pb (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare managed to describe the later life of King Henry the eight, with much intelligence and gracefulness. This play, written centuries before, has captured my attention unlike any present-day play or novel. King Henry VIII was based on the life of the notoriously known King Henry the eight of England. To my dismay, only two of King Henry's wives were mentioned. This play showed how King Henry's life was never truly complete: he couldn't trust anyone, he was unfaithful to the Lord, his wives and his country, and he was never blessed with a son, to be heir to his throne. For myself, the climax of the play was viewing how the king dealt with the change of wives and the birth of his daughter, Elizabeth. The play King Henry VIII by William Shakespeare is a wonderful recommendation for anyone who wishes to understand the tidings of King Henry the eight from a fictitious, historical, personal point of view, rather than from historical facts."},{"Title":"King Henry VIII Pb (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"This was an appropriate conclusion to Shakespeare's career. Not only are the characters such as Henry VIII, Cranmer, and Wolsey convincing, but the poetry and images are beautiful. In addition, through the fall of several characters such as Wolsey, we can see reflections of Shakespeare himself as he wrote his 37th and final play. It is also poetically appropriate that one of the greatest writers England ever knew ended his career by writing a play about one of the greatest kings that England ever knew! I DO NOT believe that Shakespeare only wrote parts of this play as many people do. With the beautiful images, poetry, and captivating characters, I am very confident in the belief that this play was written entirely by the one and only William Shakespeare."},{"Title":"King Henry VIII Pb (Arden Shakespeare)","review":"The edition is unedited, with no introduction, and without notes of any kind.

Originally its title was 'Jerusalem Arabic' which means that what you are really getting is the Palestinian dialect, which is very close to Syrian and not quite as close to Lebanese. Learners who come to it from an Egyptian background will also find much that is familiar in the grammar and vocabulary.The lessons build on each other in a very logical way so that even an absolute beginner with no previous Arabic exposure should be able to work through them. The vocabulary is not the most interesting, but it is useful for everyday life and interactions with native speakers in their own environment- however, it doesn't go much beyond that. Also, the drilling is very 1960s- rote exercises, for instance a set of sentences with a feminine subject which have to be converted to plural, or plural subjects to be converted to singular. And because of the book's age, some of the expressions it introduces might be a little dated by now. The only solution for this, of course, is the help of a native speaker.Still, since there are many fewer pedagogical materials for Levantine Arabic (and very few of them recent) than other forms of vernacular Arabic (Egyptian or even Gulf) this is a course that a beginning learner can plow ahead with. One irksome feature: the book does not make use of the Arabic alphabet at all.

Only a few other mothers have exposed their terrifying journey in this manner. In my capacity as Founding Director of Postpartum Support International, I have spoken and corresponded with thousands of pregnant and postpartum mothers from all walks of life. Each one's story is unique. And yet, there is a common thread that Sheila's story captures. She articulates the depth of emotional sorrow and agony while in denial about her illness and then expresses her joy and relief when she finds answers in her quest for help. The Postpartum Social Support Movement is still in its infancy. Those who contribute to the development of knowledge and increase awareness about postpartum depression are true pioneers.

ClarkDenise's Pieces Author Site & Book Reviews...P>Not so very long ago, the depression or \`let-down' feeling many women experienced following the birth of a child was called \`the baby blues' - and was often said with a shrug and a grin. But after the term was renamed \`Postpartum Depression' and the Susan Smith case gained national attention for the condition, society has begun to realize that this mental state not only exists, but it also has far-reaching consequences that can result in tragedy.Ms. MacDonald has written a true first-person account of her struggle with the condition and how she overcame intense and out-of-control feelings of resentment, mental and physical exhaustion, fear... and hatred. Next came feelings of guilt and shame... followed by thoughts of suicide. Her faith gave her the strength to fight the demon trying to take over her life, and her courage in sharing her story is capable of helping others through the dark torment of PPD. Her narrative comes straight from the heart and is a no holds barred confession of how she went from a happy and contented mother to a state of enraged darkness. This short book packs a wallop, and its impact is emotional. With her story, Ms. MacDonald shares with the reader a horrifying state of mind, an experience that many of us, thank goodness, will never have to partake. But for those who may find themselves at the crossroads, this book offers hope and compassionate understanding. At end of this personal narrative, the author includes a list of valuable resources for those seeking help or information on this all-to-real condition, making this personal experience an essential asset to any mother-to-be's reading shelf... just in case."},{"Title":"Out of the Darkness: Postpartum Depression Is Not Something We Can Fight Alone","review":"This book took me on a journey through the mind of one woman sharing her cycle in postpartum depression.

Its major problem was no cohesion between the workbook and the cd, which made trying to follow the lessons confusing for parents putting it together for their children. Each segment on the cd was not labeled other than the standard 1,2,3... so that even seen from iTunes, it was very difficult to navigate from one section to the next. As the cd was so much intended to be used with the workbook, it was then also very ineffective in listening to the cd just on its own and appreciating the sounds. This was also made harder by the \\"put on\\" voices, which made replaying over and over again very irritating to bear. Plainly, it was just not fun and if I had subjected my child to it, I am sure it would have gone over her head leaving only a smelly whiff of dullness to remember it by.

These teachings are as relevant today as they were times past, and as Larry Kahaner so ably shows, can be applied to our modern business dealings to great results. If you are seeking a way to enrich your business life and your spiritual life at the same time, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Values, Prosperity, and the Talmud: Business Lessons from the Ancient Rabbis","review":"As a business editor, I've pretty much seen it all when it comes to advice for company managers and leaders. But this book offers something truly different: new ways to apply values that have been in practice, honed and refined, for 1,500 years. And while you'll obviously get the most from this book if you're a practicing Jew, there's a huge bonus here for gentiles like me. The stories and lessons are far more specific than anything we can discern from the vague background hum of Judeo-Christian values in business today. If you want solid spiritual guidance that you can take to work every day, this book is for you. Besides the rabbis, you'll learn a little bit from everybody, from Mark Twain to Deutsche Bank to diamond dealers. So, go for it. You'll like it."},{"Title":"Values, Prosperity, and the Talmud: Business Lessons from the Ancient Rabbis","review":"Kahaner's book helped me realize the kind of employer I aspired to be. Many of the contemporary situations Kahaner writes about show the intelligence of the ancient Rabbis.

But this book isn't just about being an ethical business person, it is about living an ethical life."},{"Title":"Values, Prosperity, and the Talmud: Business Lessons from the Ancient Rabbis","review":"Kahaner has written a number of excellent business books and has always come up with a fresh theme or outlook to add to what is often a very predictable genre. By winnowing the Talmud for business advice he has found plenty of original material with a number of surprises that will be useful to businessmen at any level of experience. In a world full of troubling news about the leaders of America's companies this book couldn't have come at a more opportune time.

Larry Kahaner does an excellent job of extracting and putting into modern-day context ten basic lessons in the Talmud that are as timeless as they are timely. Clear, succinct, and easy to read, this book makes a compelling case for the wisdom of living your business life and your personal life as one, guided by the time-proven principles of respect, fairness, and charity. After reading this book, I found it easier to make day-to-day decisions by asking myself, what would the Talmud tell me to do?

He was an agent of the Queen, cleaning up a mess that disturbed the Royal Family and therefore society. Outlining a profound and intense panorama of what it was like to live in London in the 8oies of last century, Moore shows us reasons why The Ripper was never apprehended. And so he details his vision of the 80ies as the beginning or at least a forecast of our century. If you read only this book this year, it will not be wasted. If you think comics are for kids and dyslectics - think again!"},{"Title":"From Hell: Being a Melodrama in Sixteen Parts, Vol. 1","review":"Alan Moore, simply put, is a master story teller.

To get the whole story, there are nine more volumes to go. All told, you'll spend $50 to get the whole story. It's worth every penny. From Hell does more than just tell the story of Jack the Ripper. It tears apart Victorian London and everything it represents. This is a heavily, heavily researched novel, downright spooky, utterly terrifying at times, and while it's paced very slowly, the impact is like being cut up by old Jack himself. Alan Moore's words are in perfect harmony with Eddie Campbell's illustrations. Illustrations? Oh, didn't I mention that this is a comic book? &quot;Comic book,&quot; you ask, shocked. Well, get over it. This is a story that redifines the medium, a graphic novel in every sense of the word. Once you read one chapter, you won't be able to stop until you've read them all.

It's a marvelous \\"trot\\" to help study the Dhammapada without getting caught in the misleading thicket that arises in every translation.

My copy of the book didn't come with the CD-ROM so I can't comment on that aspect of the publication, however the book alone is worth the investment. While the best brush script should be done by hand, this book is the next best thing. Within 100 pages Solo has a nice variety of typefaces, the best of which have that wonderful kitsch feeling.This book is perfect if you are looking for a groovy sixties or fat fifties script font. However some parts of the collection have a few faces that aren't so great, for example everyone must have a copy or version of \\"Baloon Extra Bold\\". But there are a few jems every few pages, so you won't be let down if you are trying to get that fifties classified ad look - or need a script font that looks like it feel off of a Doors album cover.Professional designers should take careful note of the copyright notice, as you are only allowed to use only six words in any project.

The other really good intro that I would recommend would be Fred Alan Wolf's &quot;Taking The Quantum Leap.&quot; Some of the ideas of this fascinating subject I found to be clearer in Gilmore's book....others I thought were said with less verbosity in Wolf's book. As Gilmore's book is told in the style of Lewis Carrol's allegory, it is a touch more pleasant to read.....but not much. I would recommend reading them both for a complete intro to the wonderful world of theoretical physics. Afterwards, I would recommend &quot;In Search Of Schroedinger's Cat&quot; by John Gribbin and &quot;Parallel Universes&quot; (also by Fred Alan Wolf)."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"The Alice in Wonderland metaphor fits the subject perfectly and Gilmore does a fantastic job of catching the tone and feel of the original.

Being a physicist, I am well aware of how difficult it is to explain even the simplest concepts of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, I find the book to be extremely boring if you happen already to know something of QM, and extremely confusing if you are trying to learn something about it. I'd highly recommend George Gamow's Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland, instead, which I read for the first time in my junior year in college 17 years ago, and several times more since then, always with great joy."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"I had attempted to read several writings geared toward introduction to quantum theories and practices,without any real understanding of what was being said. Then I stumbled across this book, and with it's easy to follow format and great illustrations of ideas, I now have an understanding I can apply to the previously read works. This book has proven invaluable to my studies and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this field of study. It is informative and makes the information easier to retain with amusing visual memory aides."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"Alice in Quantumland is an entertaining novel that is sure to get the basics of quantum physics across to its readers. Gilmore teaches his readers the basics of complex concepts through lovable characters that are sure to hook his readers. While the concepts are hard to grasp without formal teaching Gilmore presents them in a way that makes it easier to understand. Characters such as the kind and lovable Quantum Mechanic or even the Classics Mechanic help to keep the readers entertained while teaching them new concepts.However, if you have never taken any type of physics course and have no background in chemistry, this book may come across as very confusing. The concepts can be very difficult to grasp. It is hard to understand how someone can be in six different places at once without having a physicist standing behind you explaining quantum physics while you read about Alice's adventures. As Gilmore explains in the Preface, \\"Neils Bohr, the father figure of quantum mechanics in its early days is said to have remarked that anyone who did not feel dizzy when thinking about quantum theory had not understood it.\\"Yet, once the concepts are understood there is an underlying bit of humor that makes the book amusing. There are characters such as the ugly duckling, the little mermaid, and even the emperor with new clothes. Bad puns and old storybook characters appear in this book making the adventures of Alice rather humorous.As a junior in high school with two older siblings majoring in physics I recommend reading this book (provided you have some physics knowledge or siblings that can explain quantum mechanics). If you are able to understand the concepts of quantum mechanics the book is hilarious and will call you back to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"I am a 15yr old student and didn't really know anything about Quantum Physics - other than that it was supposed to be really difficult, complex and beyond the average person's intelligence. This book taught me quite a lot and I found it interesting(which can't be said for a lot of physics books) and informative. The only problem was that when I got to the last page, there was still more that I didn't really understand - as if there should have been more pages, it inspired me to find out more about the subject as well. I think that this book definetly deserves all five stars."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"I was really excited by the idea behind this book- making learning about quantum physics interesting and entertaining. The problem was, the analogies were just too imprecise and seemed to muddle things up. I got incredibly bored with the book as things were never explained properly. The best part of the book is the little blurbs and notes at the end which actually explain what is going on. The actual content of the book just seems to confuse rather than explain."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"When my son was ten, I read this to him as bedtime reading. We had a LOT of laughs. It's a great way to get the feel of quantum mechanics and have fun at the same time."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"It is a cute book, and the beginning and the way it is like hte Alice in Wonderland theme makes the book easier to follow and understand. It is a neat idea, but still hard for the unadvanced physics student to completely understand. There are a lot of notes to help out, but it is a pain to keep flipping to the end of the chapters to read them. Overall a cute idea and a start to make physics more interesting for those who are not too much into that type of science."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"Very fun book almost complimentary to Mr. Tompkins. A lotof concepts are explained, Uncertainity with Heisenberg Bank, matter antimatter, electric current,I loved the description of electrontron spin described as umbrellas up or down,two slit experient, superposition principal with taking routes in the wilderness. It is very nice to put some imaginations into Quantum Concepts.

She's very interested in quantum physics, but I'm afraid this book will be daunting for her.The writing style is generally good -- smart but accessible and witty. My main complaint is that all of the complicated points are explained purely through words, in fact, through long blocks of text.Even most adult-oriented books on quantum physics that I've seen in the past come with plenty of diagrams to explain concepts like interference, uncertainty, etc. This book features some amusing (and well-drawn) illustrations of the characters, but the absence of explanatory diagrams is a major weakness.The concepts explained here are paradoxical and difficult. The narrative helps make them a little easier to understand, but the lack of visual aids keeps this book from being truly great.Suggestion to the author and publisher: Add some simple diagrams of quantum phenomena in the next edition!"},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"I don't really even want to take the time to bother saying why; it wasn't worth it! I wholly appreciate what Robert Gilmore is trying to do (make quantum physics more palatable for novice readers), but his analogies aren't clear and he puts too much effort into trying to be the Reverend Mister Dodgson. For a much less insipid book, try Fred Alan Wolf's &quot;Taking the Quantum Leap&quot;; or for a more comprehensive history of things, look into George Gamow's &quot;The Great Physicists from Galileo to Einstein&quot; (originally published under a different title, but I see it's here at amazon.com). Gamow's book is dated (early '60s), but surprisingly relevant and well-written.

However, those who are interested in quantum physics or just want to update their understanding of the area will probably enjoy this book. Gilmore attempts to weave a bit of the Alice adventure into the quest to keep the reader's attention while pointing out the developments of \\"Quantumland,\\" although Alice's allegorical involvement diminishes a bit toward the end of the book. Repetition of concepts will help younger readers to grasp key points while the inserted notes (and end notes) help to move the discussion along more technical lines. For sure, there is little of math or proofs in the book but the emphasis is upon introducing and explaining basic concepts, especially the interaction of particles. Some will find the book too simple, others a bit boring, but Gilmore does a credible job at presenting the developments and unknowns of Quantum Physics. The book is quite readable and recommended as an introduction for a younger audience."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"I'm shocked at the college teachers/professors saying this book is too difficult for beginners. Are you joking? They don't even know what it's like to be a beginner anymore. I, on the other hand, AM a beginner and found this book fun and informative.

While Physics was not necessarily my favorite subject in school, my interest increased significantly after reading books by Feynman and others that made the subject more approachable. However, I had trouble in grasping the fundamental concepts of Quantum Mechanics even after reading some excellent books, probably due to its inherent abstract nature.However, this book changed things. The overlay of the Alice in Wonderland on top of intricacies of quantum mechanics made it a lot better read and helped me create a mental picture that was otherwise hazy. I think the use of Alice in Wonderland itself is an excellent choice, given the wacky qualities of the story which fits perfectly with the equally wacky nature of Quantum Mechanics.The author has made the complex issues in Quantum Mechanics a lot more memorable by equating it to Alice's characters and what they do.This book is intended to explain the concepts of Quantum Mechanics to a lay reader - be he well-versed in Physics or not. To this effect, the book meets the needs completely. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Quantum Mechanics, Physics, or simply in how things work."},{"Title":"Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics","review":"I read this book as a junior in high school and loved it. It's a wonderful introduction to quantum physics for those whose interests are pique but just simply don't know much about the topic.

Three's Company deals with the second triumvirate of Rome, that of Augustus Caesar, Marcus Antonius, and Lepidus. It spans a time period from Caesar crossing the Rubicon to the denouement of the second triumvirate and is told from the point-of-view of Lepidus. This has both strength's and weaknesses...Lepidus has always been nominally interesting to me because he seems like such a non-entity in other materials and he is virtually unheard of today except by those with a keen interest in Roman history. While most people have at least heard of Marc Antony and Augustus (it is hard to get through high school without at least hearing those names) how many people today recognize the name of Lepidus? Even historians pay little attention to him. In this book you more or less learn why; Lepidus is somewhat of a dull boy with little imagination and a mediocre intelligence at best, and not a lot of people paid attention to him even when he was Triumvir.It can be difficult to tell an exciting, dashing story when your protagonist is such a plodding fellow and if the book has a weakness, this is it. Despite it being a difficult task, the author actually does a pretty good job though. I liked the book, and finished it in a long day. The book does something very well that was fascinating: it showed the strengths of the Roman republican system and of the people who made it work before the transition to empire. Even though Lepidus is not the brightest boy, his very lack of imagination and his cleaving to traditional republican ideals actually made him a pretty handy fellow to have around sometimes. Immune to bribery, patrician, not very imaginative, strictly schooled in the way things should be, he goes about and does his job as he has been reared to do, and, like many of the Republican era, did more than pay lip service to the notion that service to Rome came before service to self. In his pedestrian way, Lepidus tried very hard to be a good leader of soldiers, conscientously looked after them, ascended the cursus honorum as he should, and actually governed extremely well in both Rome and Africa giving those places the best governance and prosperity they would enjoy in his generation. He was plodding and a little dull, but in the end this tortoise beat the hares when it came to good governance, a fact forgotten by many. But then again good governance doesn't leave much for the historians to talk about. There was a reason that Rome worked as a republic for nearly four hundred years and the reason was men like Lepidus. Caesar is a far more fascinating person, had more raw talent and intelligence in a fingernail clipping than Lepidus had in his whole body, but as a civilian in that era I would have preferred to live under Lepidus' rule. It's that old Chinese curse, \\"may you live in interesting times\\". Lepidus wasn't a very interesting fellow really, but it made him the better ruler for all that. This book is fascinating in the way it manages to convey that point and it does a great job of covering the key events of the period, including many of the military engagements and political maneouverings. This is a worthwhile read helps bring more depth and understanding to a complex and turbulent period."},{"Title":"Three's Company","review":"Evelyn Waugh once asked Alfred Duggan why his novels all centered on obscure periods and places that most potential readers had never heard of. Duggan replied that the lack of historical source materials made the background research easier!This book certainly doesn't support Duggan's facetious reply. The evolution of the Roman Republic into a military dictatorship is one of the most overworked historical themes, from Shakespeare's time on. But Duggan found a new approach to this classic tragedy: view it through the eyes of a minor player almost forgotten by history.With our historical hindsight it is easy to say that Marcus Lepidus was an idiot who utterly failed to understand the decadent aristocracy he was raised in, the ruthless thugs he was dealing with, and the spineless population he pretended to represent. No other historical \\"leader\\" had TWO armies desert en masse to the other side.But this sheer incompetence makes Lepidus a fascinating character, and one well suited to Duggan's \\"thinking reader\\" style of writing, in which the conference room and the dinner party occur more often than the battle scene. We live inside Lepidus' head and follow the man's gradual descent from high-minded defender of constitutional government to rationalizer of mass murder to plain warlord.This isn't Duggan's best book (Lepidus' last \\"campaign\\" in Sicily drags on far too long) but it still stands far above the current ruck of blood-and-thunder historical novels."},{"Title":"Three's Company","review":"This book, which is set in Rome's second civil war, is, in my opinion, a fair read, it's rather plodding and half way through you start getting angry at the main character for being so blind to the situation around him,but it is readable."},{"Title":"Three's Company","review":"I have reread this book many times.

When I tune into The Apprentice or American Idol, I am faced the immense and lasting allure, but also the banality, of these shows: we want to see how other people behave, think, deal with success and embarrassment, how they make love and how they fail. What disappoints me about these shows is that, except in rare moments, we rarely actually get to see this. What we see, instead, are real people acting out plot lines as tired as old sitcoms and presenting themselves as flat, stereotypical characters--much less interesting than they real people (whom I presume) they are.Derek Sayer's Going Down for Air presents, in all its voyeuristic glory, the memories of a middle-aged, heterosexual English university professor. Sound boring? It's not. Sayer digs deep, and looks at his life and past squarely in the eye, and in doing so, he ends up asking the enthralling, sometimes disturbing question of how much we can ever know about ourselves, how we remember and forget. My favorite images in the book include a five-year old Sayer on his tricycle, unwittingly causing what might have been a fatal motorcycle accident, unabashedly homoerotic memories of being caned as a schoolboy, and a stark recollection of a hospital visit to Sayer's aging father--a hilarious and malicious character--that is ironic and deeply touching. This is reality TV better than as seen on television.The book is in two parts, with the memoir followed by a more conventional and scholarly essay exploring the processes and functions of memory. While not as thoroughly engrossing and addictive a read as the memoir, Sayer deftly incorporates the viewpoints of philosophers, sociologists, psychoanalysts, writers and artists from Durkheim and Lacan to Baudelaire and Edward Hopper into an argument about why we can't take our personal and collective memories for granted.The whole book is illustrated with Sayer's own pleasing and provocative photographs of places around the world and from his childhood, which would form a striking photo-essay in themselves but here go a long way in bringing both texts to life in a manner which is distinctly Sayer's own, highly personal, ironic and communicative."},{"Title":"Going Down for Air: A Memoir in Search of a Subject (Great Barrington Books)","review":"I thought reality TV would be a fad for a season or two -- boy, was I wrong.

Primrose is content in his life, with a faithful wife, and lovely, if somewhat distracted children. Hearing that his banker has gotten into trouble and fled the country, Primrose and his family begin a series of adventures which test the strength of Primrose's convictions.Among the issues which Goldsmith addresses in the novel are social ambition in a rigid class system, the drawbacks and benefits of a relatively liberal household, and the admittedly imperfect nature of the British legal system. Sprinkled throughout the novel are various discourses on the notion of liberty, the primacy of the monarchy, and a wealth of interesting references to British imperialism and colonial slavery.Regarding the class system, Primrose seems throughout the novel, to eschew the idea that social or economic mobility is possible, or even desirable. He posits, in a way that follows Aristotle and Edmund Burke, that people are fit for certain stations by their very nature; and that such social partitioning is right and should be maintained. Primrose also appears as a latter day Horace, championing the virtues of simple, rustic life. This pastoral life is directly associated in the novel with the laboring classes, who, not without faults themselves, manage to avoid the intrigues and excesses of the consistently vilified city folk.Goldsmith's writing style is fast-paced, with clear, direct language, wonderfully rendered characters, and a surprising number of plot twists for so short a work. Primrose and his eldest son George are the two finest characters in the novel. Both exhibit a picaresque tendency to wander and interact - Primrose with the intellectual/philosophical elements, and George with the material/experiential elements in the world. This is altogether a wonderful, spirited novel, and Stephen Coote's introduction to this Penguin edition is excellent in its explication of the novel's major themes and concerns."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"\\"Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse.\\" So ends chapter 13 in this delightful novel by Oliver Goldsmith, his only novel by the way.Oliver creates a pious character in the form of the vicar, Dr Primrose, that suffers from that most deadly of the 7 deadly sins, Pride. The problem is he doesn't know it. As a result he is brought down peg by peg, and made a thorough fool of in the process, in a way that is comical and warm to the reader. The vicar becomes a most beloved character by way of his suffering and in the end I'm sure will have earned from even the most hard hearted reader that most cherished gift a reader can bestow upon any flawed character, redemption.Oliver also creates villiany, more like evil incarnate, in the form of Mr. Thornhill. Thornhill is central to the most severe of the hardships suffered by the vicar and his family. A very meddlesome and self-centered character indeed!!Written in the 1750's, it has it all. Greed,envy,lust,unjust imprisonment, even prostitution. Yes, It's hard to believe a novel written in the 1750's could even touch on the subject, but nevertheless it is central to the plot.Combine all this with some of the finest wit in English literature and you've got a great way to spend a weekend.

Well worth everyone's time."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period. If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent. It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know. If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now.

In fine, a book to be read over &amp; over without a dimunition of pleasure at each reading."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"Told with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor and wit, The Vicar of Wakefield, published in 1766, features the delightfully innocent Dr. Primrose, a cleric who believes that kindness and virtue will always be rewarded. Surrounded by his wife and six children, Dr. Primrose lives a comfortable life, but he becomes the victim of theft when his broker runs off with all his investments, leaving him penniless, just as his son George is about to be married. When George's marriage is canceled due to his lack of prospects, the family moves to the country, where Dr. Primrose becomes vicar of a rural church.One disaster follows another, involving Dr. Primrose and his family. The poor but kind Mr. Burchell, who saved daughter Sophia from drowning and befriended the family, later shocks Dr. Primrose by slandering the daughters and ruining their chances to become companions to two women in London. The sale of the family's only horses to a trickster leaves them virtually penniless. His older daughter Olivia is abducted and \\"ruined.\\" The house catches fire, and their landlord demands his rent, knowing that the family has nothing. No matter how outrageous the calamities (and those mentioned above are only a sample), Dr. Primrose insists on seeing the bright side, even when there is no bright side. Virtue and goodness, he is convinced, will always be rewarded.Owing as much to eighteenth century satiric comedy as to the developing novel, the story of Dr. Primrose and his family satirizes the sentimentality of early novels, such as Pamela, while it makes use of sentimental devices to further its plot. Poking gentle fun at Dr. Primrose for his innocence, Goldsmith never mocks or belittles him. Coincidence, mistaken identities, the humiliation of all the villains, innumerable surprises, and the restoration of Dr. Primrose's fortunes lead to the \\"deserved\\" happiness of Dr. Primrose and his family in the conclusion. Virtue is indeed rewarded, and evil is indeed punished. A gentle novel filled with charm, The Vicar of Wakefield feels like a \\"lady's novel,\\" one which lacks the bawdy excess of Fielding and the unique humor of Sterne, while never taking itself too seriously. n Mary WhippleShe Stoops to Conquer and Other Comedies (Oxford World's Classics)Oliver Goldsmith; a biography.

It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security. The family consists of a mother and father and six children.

It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"Regarded by some as a sentimental novel, Oliver Goldsmith's \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766) describes the fortunes and misfortunes of the first-person narrator, Dr. Primrose, along with his wife and six children. The narrative is chiefly concerned with a description of Primrose's increasing adversity and the final restoration and elevation of his condition, in a story-line reminiscent of the Biblical book of Job. First the Primrose family loses their fortune, their home is engulfed by a fire, and eventually Primrose himself finds himself in prison, one daughter reportedly dead, another abducted, and a son jailed. But all is in the end restored as the narrative returns to the idyllic life of the Primrose home and its inhabitants as described at the end of the first chapter: \\"In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.\\" The circle is completed with the closing words of the final chapter: \\"As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.\\" Although Primrose is a vicar, his congregational and pastoral charge rarely comes into the picture, and it is more the events in this family circle that are the focus of his story.In the face of more than abundant adversity, Primrose remains the eternal optimist, a sweet and nave vicar who portrays himself unaffected by the worldliness and faults he sees in the lives of those around him. Nowhere is his naivete more evident than when he falls prey to the same deceptive character he has previously chastized his son for falling victim to. Yet Primrose remains blind to his own flawed character with its intellectual and spiritual pride. For example, when his half-dead son makes his entrance in the closing stages, Primrose affirms his own freedom from vanity, although the statement in which he makes this bold assertion suggests the opposite: \\"He now therefore entered, handsomely dressed in his regimentals; and without vanity (for I am above it), he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.\\"While one must at times roll one's eyes at his excessive parade of virtue, the reader cannot help feel a strong measure of sympathy for his overly sweet character and good intentions. When his house burns down, rather than mourn the loss of his worldly possessions, he rejoices in the safety of his children: \\"'Now,' cried I, holding up my children, 'now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my, treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.'\\" When misfortune results in his incarceration, he sees prison as an opportunity to convert the ungodly: \\"I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim.\\" Even his most malicious oppressors are reason for optimism: \\"... as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal.\\" And upon discovering that Jenkinson's account about the death of his daughter is false, he chooses to be overjoyed at her return rather than angered by the deception: \\"'How could you,' cried I, turning to Mr Jenkinson, 'how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain.' \\"While Primrose's strength of spiritual character, moral fortitude and steadfastness in the face of crisis is exaggerated to the point of humor and wild improbability, it is nonetheless admirable in what it suggests about the human spirit. He sleeps untroubled while in prison and having suffered the most grave misfortune and being deprived of all that is dear to him: \\"After my usual meditations, and having praised my heavenly corrector, I laid myself down and slept with the utmost tranquility till morning.\\" And rather than grieve over his misfortune after his house has been engulfed with flames, he sees it as a positive benefit, for it humbles his wife's pride and makes her more receptive to the return of his daughter from prostitution: \\"I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one, and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions.\\" And when too much laughter and merriness displeases Primrose in preparation for the solemn ceremony of marriage, he makes it the occasion for spiritual correction: \\"I told them of the grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this Mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own composing, in order to prepare them.\\" And even some of the other characters share this virtuous approach, for rather than commiserate with Wilmot upon the loss of his fortune to deception, the senior squire remarks: \\"your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished.\\"Like Job, Primrose suffers at the hand of increasing disasters, but unlike his Biblical counterpart, he doesn't go to the ash-heap to mourn or struggle with his condition or grief. He remains constant in hope and optimism, sees in the greatest disasters opportunities for spiritual correction and growth, and always retains the prospect of improving his fortunes, if not in this life then in the hereafter. Despite his overly optimistic character, this nave and simple man who wants to serve God and his family presents a somewhat charming figure. We are curious what will be the outcome of his life, and our sense of expectation is heightened by the twists and turns of the plot, which for an 18th century work is reasonably fast paced and quite accessible for modern readers. While improbable, Primrose's journey from fortune to misfortune and back again might prove morally instructive not just to its protagonist, but to us all. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"Goldsmith's only novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, is, as another reviewer pointed out, a modern (1766) version of the book of Job. In the book of Job, Satan attempts to make a fool of God and at the same time attack Job. Satan accomplishes this by arguing that the godliness of Job, who is God's beloved, is motivated by self-interest alone. God allows Satan to test Job in order that God and Job be vindicated.In Goldsmith's story, Dr. Primrose is a priest with a loving wife and 6 wonderful children. They have an elegant house, the respect of their neighbors and the means to help others less fortunate. We are barely introduced to Dr. Primrose and his family when they are beset by misfortune. Their wealth is stolen and they must give up their family home and move to a distant village. From this point on, a series of ever increasing calamities occur.Through it all we know that Dr. Primrose and family will persevere even if we can't anticipate all the twists and turns in the story. With that said, Dr. Primrose is not perfect. The introduction makes clear that he is possessed of intellectual pride. This measure of sin lends the story an air of authenticity that would be missing if Dr. Primrose was perfection personified. As a side note, the Penguin edition of this book does have a useful introduction which helps to frame the issues Goldsmith was trying to communicate as well as providing context for the times. The end notes are also of tremendous help.The ending may be unlikely but the message of faith and family love endures. Don't let the age of this classic novel prevent you from enjoying its wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield is one of those books you told yourself in college to read but never quite got around to it. It is Goldsmith's only novel and includes several of his poems. The book might be termed \\"The Book of Job as written by Jane Austen,\\" in that it tells of the toils and troubles that beset an English vicar and his family, while at the same time being concerned with the love affairs of young people. The family Wakefield consists of the vicar, his wife and six children, two older boys, two girls of marriageable age and two small boys. The family is forced by circumstances to leave their good, middle class life in Wakefield and move to a lesser, but still tolerable existence in the countryside. There they encounter a variety of characters, some good and some bad and some seemingly good, but bad and some seemingly bad, but good--it all gets sorted out in the end.Much of what happens in the book is improbable, but the idea is not to present a factual account as much as a story about morality. As time goes by we see the foibles of the vicar and his family, but at the same time we see their natural goodness as well. But their problems mount and the book descends into what seems like unrelieved misery. We keep waiting for the negatives to turn into positives--after all this is not Thomas Hardy--but they are slow in coming and then are crammed into an implausible ending. One advantage of the book is that it is relatively short (less than 200 pages), thus we are not forced to wade through 500 pages of drudgery to find an alls well that ends well ending.I rate it at four stars because it is an excellent example of classical English writing with a story line that gives some insights into the life and values of English people at a time when England was growing in influence and power in the world."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"\\"Now,\\" cried I, holding up my children, \\"now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish.

It is a wonderful quick read about a man (family) over coming adversities in life, yet continuing to hold on to and cherish what is important in life. Dr. Primrose never becomes jaded after all that is thrown at him. Just when you think he can take no more, more is piled onto him. In the end, of course, all is well. While I wouldn't call the book exciting itself, there are exciting elements...kidnappings, death, cheating, and more. I enjoyed it so much because Dr. Primrose is truly a stand up guy and one we can all learn lessons from."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"I have, in a way, two completely separate reviews for this novel, with two completely different rankings. As a serious novel it gets one star; as a comic novel it gets four. I have gone with the four-star ranking because I have very little doubt of which it is.If this book was in fact written as a serious panegyric upon the glories and virtues of the simple, holy life, and the blessings that come to those who persevere in the face of adversity, it is the most consummate tripe. The characters are caricatures, the emotions farcical, the plot lines banal. Primrose (the narrator) is a fool, and a particularly pretentious and self-righteous one. The women in the novel should make any self-respecting woman cringe. The tireless soliloquies on economics, politics and religion make you unwittingly begin to skim. I will take Wittgenstein's advice and just pass over the ending in silence. Think Danielle Steele in a more obscure vernacular, but worse. (Yes, that's right, worse.)Thankfully, it's not serious (or, at least, I am almost certain that it isn't). As a comic novel it comes off kind of like a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker movie about a Jane Austen novel. The beauty of it is, however, is that it's so deadpan, it's so subtle in its irony, that for the first eighty pages I really thought it was sincere - albeit terrible. I won't go into the plot details as most of you probably don't want someone to spoil the plot for you, and the rest can easily find it succinctly traced out by my fellow reviewers. I will say that it's a Book-of-Job-style parable, and one of the most complete and believable satires I've ever read.(I will add, just to give my review some perspective, that I love 18th century British literature, Fielding and Sterne in particular. In other words, my opinion has not been overtly colored by an ignorance of either the genre or the writing styles of the period. At least, I hope not.)"},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield (Kenkyusha English classics)","review":"A delightful tale of the calamities that beset an 18th century English vicar.

Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book.

Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast.

Naturally the answer depends on where you live. What is legitimate in one country is often not in another. This, as well as many other issues, makes legitimacy a very difficult thing to define and to grasp.This book gives you an understaning of legitimacy and from a lot of angles. Leading researchers in sociology, psychology, political science, and organizational behavior, all contributed to this book and the themes they cover are overlapping and mutually informative.One of the great things about this book is that the authors of the various sections are not philosophers, they are researchers. This means here that their opinions are backed up with corresponding studies, not just endless theorizing.The book starts with a summary of what will follow, then a section on the historical perspectives on legitimacy. The historical section offers a brief overview of what the author considers to be the best books on the topic over hundreds of years. Lots of excellent condensed information.The book continues with sections on &quot;Congnitive and perceptual processes in the appraisal of legitimacy&quot;, &quot;The tolerance of injustice: implications for self and society&quot;, &quot;Stereotyping, ideology, and the legitimation of inequality&quot;, and &quot;institional and organizational processes of legitimation.&quot;There is really far too much to talk about, so I'll mention a couple of my favorite findings from the book. First, tokenism (allowing a small number of a discriminated against minority to move up in society) actually helps to keep the group that is discriminated against down. Why is this so? There are many issues, one is that the token identifies himself with the higher status group and no longer with the lower status group. That means he or she is more unlikely to care about the plite of his or her &quot;former&quot; discriminated against group. Another reason is that the existence of tokens actually makes legitimate the higher status of the upper group in the minds of both the favored and the discriminated against groups. One of the great things about this book is that this is not just theory, it is born out in scientific tests.Another point I found outstanding was: what is legitimate to most people? The answer is usually something is legitimate if people feel that it is right. For example, if a process is believed to be fair (or right), people will believe it is legitimate. There are many interesting reasons for this which the book talks about.&quot;The Psychology of Legitimacy&quot; contains fascinating insight, studies, and excellent theory all in one place. More importantly, it is about a topic so important and far reaching that it applies to literally everyone everywhere."},{"Title":"Japanese by Spring","review":"The blurb on the cover of my copy of Japanese By Spring reads &quot;Just the sort of weapon we need in the war against academic pedantry,&quot; and I totally agree. Ishmael Reed creates the perfect caricature of a liberal arts college and its faculty, students, and administration. Jack London College is a typical liberal arts college with all common sense, interpersonal decorum, and cold weather removed. It's a liberal arts college on speed. The faculty portrayed in JBS behave as if they've had all their personal, emotional, and extracurricular dimensions surgically removed, and operate only as mouthpieces for the curriculum they teach and the intellectual/political ideas they espouse. Reed sets them up as raging, one-dimensional adversaries with whom Chappie does battle. It almost reminded me of any of the numerous popular teenage films where the protagonist is an inept pariah, picked on by all manner of his/her high school peers, and then, at the movie's midpoint, s/he obtains some device-a superpower, a fashion makeover, or in this case, a Japanese takeover-which allows him/her to exact revenge on his/her tormentors. As banal as such films often are, we enjoy them because we like seeing the good guy get his. In Japanese By Spring, we sympathize with Chappie (as ridiculous as he is) when he is harassed by his peers, and we enjoy the inevitable payoff, when he gets to fire them. Normally, I'd be disappointed with one-dimensional characters, but they are means to a greater end for Reed.And I loved the intrusive author bit. I haven't read anything else by Reed, so I don't know if he does this in other books of his. But the first time his name appeared in the text of the story itself, I did a double take-which is probably exactly what Reed wants the reader to do. As far as confounding readers' expectations and conventional narratological rules, this device is effective and entertaining. Most readers will probably spend the first several chapters of the novel thinking that Chappie Puttbutt is Reed's alter-ego, his voice within the story. But then, Reed himself appears, and before long, he's having a conversation with Chappie. Now what to think? Readers might find themselves wondering what the point is of having a fictional alter-ego in the story at all, if Reed can just walk right in. I'm not sure the answer is an easy one, but one guess is that Chappie represents all the aspects of Reed that he (Reed) would be embarrassed to acknowledge, sides that most people probably don't see. The laughable sycophant, waffling on all the issues; his pretentious, single-minded pursuit of tenure and a house in the Oakland Hills. I didn't mind Reed appearing occasionally throughout the novel, but I'm a little annoyed that he completely takes over by its end. Where is Chappie during the Ol&oacute;d&ugrave;mar&egrave; ceremony which ends the book? The book's ending is still valid, and a tranquil conclusion to a long and winding discussion about Rodney King, etc. But for its supposed protagonist to be completely effaced is unsettling.I get the feeling that telling a story (my quick, crude, and conventional definition of &quot;story&quot; being an unfolding narrative which develops characters and themes) is not Reed's first priority. In Japanese By Spring, plot development (and resolution), character depth, and continuity of all kinds (thematic, stylistic, you name it) take a backseat-a way-backseat-to the spontaneous, scattered, and often confusing exposition of Reed's views on just about everything. For the first 150 pages or so, he manages to couch his diatribes fairly successfully within the context of the story; that is, Puttbutt and his fellow characters provide voice(s) for Reed's strong and varied stances on various social and political subjects, as well as for those of Reed's opponents. At no point does Reed really pretend that his characters exist for any purpose other than as mouthpieces for his views and, more commonly, for those of his opponents. Entire conversations-if they can be called conversations-are contrived just so Reed can air his opinions. One example is an argument, late in the novel, between Chappie and his father. It's partially about the Gulf War, and as such, functions as one of the many platforms upon which Reed can discuss Middle-Eastern affairs and Operation Desert Storm, which was still fresh in America's mind when the novel was written. Trouble is, this encounter between Chappie and his father happens amidst a sort of clattering trainwreck in the narrative, where the actual fate of Jack London College is left unresolved. I have no problem with lack of resolution in story. But lack of resolution in plot, narrative, and the structure of a novel itself is troubling for me.Reed is known for improvising as he writes. This is quite evident when one considers the structure of Japanese By Spring. The structure here is, well, hardly present. Again, I have no problem with spontaneous or improvised prose. But here, it almost seems to thwart the story. It's so tangential it's clumsy. What seem like critical developments are mentioned offhand, in one sentence, or even half a sentence. &quot;Oh, and by the way, Chappie's mother was kidnapped by Arabs.&quot; &quot;Oh, and by the way, Chappie's mentor beheaded his wife and killed himself.&quot; Developments like these will come out of nowhere and then fade as quickly as they arrived. Meanwhile, the main plot is left hanging, and with a lot of slack.Reed's writing is rich with satire, and as I've already said, he spends the first half of the book creating hilarious caricatures of academic buffoons. He should have taken the material from the novel's first half, fleshed it out, and created a more thorough story about the events at Jack London College; a truly singular and even more powerful &quot;weapon against academic pedantry.&quot; Then, he could take the second half of the novel and use it as the basis for a series of non-fiction essays on Japan-U.S. relations, WWII theory, the Gulf War, the L.A. riots, race relations, Western-vs.-Eastern thinking, etc. I'd be equally enthusiastic to read both. But in Japanese By Spring, they've been conflated in a clumsy and often confusing manner."},{"Title":"Japanese by Spring","review":"In Japanese By Spring, Reed loses much of the force of his earlier works, such as Mumbo Jumbo and The Free-lance Pallbearers. A professor named Chappie Puttbutt fails to receive tenure at the racist Jack London College. The school is then taken over by the Japanese, who put Puttbutt's Japanese teacher in charge. Puttbutt becomes his adviser, and begins to seek revenge for not making tenure. The story becomes somewhat amusing, but the satire is nowhere near as strong as in Reed's earlier work. Reed also inserts himself into the novel as a minor character, but then moralizes for many pages atthe end of the book, leaving it without a good conclusion. Reed is an excellent writer, but stay away from Japansese By Spring unless you intend to compare it to his other work."},{"Title":"Japanese by Spring","review":"This book starts out as the story of professor \\"Chappie\\" Putbutt, a black man chasing the American dream, and frankly, kissing a lot of butt in that pursuit. After being denied tenure yet again at the fairly typical (albeit somewhat racist) Jack London College, Puttbutt takes up a self-instruction book that promises to teach him \\"Japanese by Spring\\". This sets off a series of highly improbably events that lead to Puttbutt reaching a position of such power that the rest of the faculty is now forced to kowtow to him. Renowned writer Ishmael Reed puts in what at first appears to be a brief cameo, and a rollicking good time is had by all.Puttbutt's story is both instructive and hysterically funny, but as Reed proceeds to insert himself more and more into the story, the book gets bogged down in preachiness. The characters get ignored in favor of Reed's analyses of issues, and the plot almost vanishes altogether. Still, an interesting look at race relations, the academic life, and the whole question of multiculturalism vs. ethnocentrism. While definitely a comic novel, Reed's serious insights into what's happening in college faculties these days makes this a must read for current and would-be academians."},{"Title":"Japanese by Spring","review":"I read several novels by Reed back in the 1990s and enjoyed them very much. I found a hardcover copy of this one in KL recently and thought it would be fun to read Reed again. Alas, this must have been one of his weaker novels. A few moments of near brilliance is offset by sheer banality. Very weird plot and weirder characters. Any sort of statement, or irony, the author is trying to make is lost amidst the abundance of weirdness. Needless to say, this would not be the best Reed book for the novice reader to tackle."},{"Title":"Japanese by Spring","review":"This book was much more than I had bargained for. I have a PC friend who had asked me to read it, and I thought it was going to be more PC affirmative-action driven drivel, and to some extent this was true. But it was hell-bent, crazy, hilarious, and it struck out in every direction at once, and was spot-on insightful concerning the Maoist Cultural Revolution in academia over the last twenty years. Reed is on the side of the Revolution, but he understands to some extent the mess it has made. He also appears to have studied Japanese and Yoruba, which is more than I can say for almost any other monoglot multicultural I have come across. He can order postage stamps and ask for directions in Japanese, as his main character could do, at least. This is way more of a second language than almost any &quot;multiculturalist&quot; (which generally just means anti-white male) actually possesses.The sheer brilliant mayhem of this novel, as Puttbutt is put through his paces, is spectacular. At some points I thought I was reading Shakespeare. The book is never mundane, and always does more than you could have ever thought of by yourself. Reed is obviously a genius.At other points, I lost track of the narrative. I couldn't figure out who was speaking. Sometimes, too, he would start a sentence talking about one figure, and then the next sentence would start with a &quot;he&quot; but it would be a different person he was talking about. In such a deeply important and major writer, this kind of obvious flaw should have been edited out.But the weird comic paranoia of this book is the first I've come across to really touch the comic paranoia of academia in which everybody is worried about the slightest shift of wind, and what it means. This book caught that. He also has some of the most inventive racist slang I've ever read. This book is like Celine in reverse. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and read it straight through. It had sat on my shelf for three years after the PC guy had given it to me. Then, I read it, and I can say that Reed is the best new writer I've come across in five years or more. Very playful, and beautiful book, especially when he gets off his high horse (he sometimes rants in his own voice but not for very long) and does the Puttbutt.I wish everybody caught up in the sick tensions and paranoia of academia would read this book. This is a very important novel, and will be on my syllabus for the next five years. Big fun here, and lots to talk about. What a brave and ingenious book! My real fundamental problem in the book is that he isn't critical enough about the Yoruba culture. This is the only culture that isn't ripped into the way he rips into white and Japanese culture. I myself don't know anything about Yoruba culture, but wonder if it is better than the American. Are women entitled to political representation? Is there freedom of speech? Where do they stand on the misery index regarding health, nutrition, sanitation, education for women, children, and the poor, decency towards minorities, etc? Reed, like most multiculturalists, seems to argue that all societies are the same in value but that the one he happens to come from is the best among equals. But this is only true if you completely get rid of any standards such as a misery index.Multiculturalism means no standards of any kind except personal whimor self-aggrandizement. This is the final problem underlying Reed's hilarious, inventive, and sorely needed book. We need standards that we can agree upon, but any kind of standard is immediately torn to shreds by raging political fanaticism. At least in Reed's book, this becomes funny."},{"Title":"Language Shock: Understanding the Culture of Conversation","review":"&quot;Language Shock&quot; helped me to understand my experience of living in a foreign land -- China, Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Cultural expectations so often get in the way, or at the very least, they complicate things.Agar spent a long time in Austria, so he has many useful personal experiences to draw upon. His book makes it clear that communicating to people of other cultures is a tremendous feat. So many things can go wrong!

Perhaps his excuse is that anthropological linguistics is a very personal study, one in which fieldwork cannot be done without factoring in the researcher's temperaments.

Poems here like \\"Unapproved Road,\\" mixing Taureg with IRA in its 1950s failed \\"border campaign,\\" wittily contrast in a way that Muldoon warms to more and more as his work confronts his own hyphenating midlife identity into an American as much as an Irish poet. \\"Guns & Butter,\\" \\"Whitethorns,\\" \\"A Brief Course on Decommissioning\\" address the post-1998 events in the North of Ireland intelligently and without pandering.

Kirlian photographs show the aura of things such as leaves, coins, and human body parts. This book consists of a collection of articles submitted by researchers in the field on Kirlian-related topics, so there are articles about building a portable Kirlian device, as well as articles showing what a healer's fingers look like when healing is happening! This is truly a wonderful book for anyone interested in learning about Kirlian photography -- both how it works and what it can be used for."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"This is a sort of humanistic psychology book that speaks of Western Christianity. Ira Progof has done just a fantastic job of captivating his audience. It is a translation of one of the classics of Christianity, but it is written in laymans terms and just absolutely brilliant. Ira Progof does the best job of translating this classic guide to spiritual experience that I am now looking for other books written by him. The translation speaks so well of inner depths and souls and things you may have always wondered but were never really sure of spiritually. I found myself staying up late at night, anxious to finish, but not anxious to end it! I may just read it again. There are passages that are so deep and so meaningful that I found myself reading them over and over. Some may find these passages I speak of vague, and they are. Yet they are worth understanding. This book takes effort and the pay-off is astounding."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"I would say that until a person has read The Psyche As Sacrament: A Comparative Study of C.G. Jung and Paul Tillich (Studies in Jungian Psychology), and has become familiar with both the leanings and orientations of both, then the Cloud of Unknowing would remain an esoteric and more or less inscrutable account of the inner life of a mystical relationship between man and God. This would remain true unless of course a person had already attained a particular view on the mystical and spiritual by experience, through which then his/her understanding will unfold as granted according to the need."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"I was disappointed in this book, it was weird and I got very little information out of it.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"As good as volume 3 of \\"Battle Royale\\" was, readers like me were turned off by the excessive sexual content in the end of the book. Thankfully, I can say after reading Volume 4, not only has the series made up for the fact, it's the best book so far into \\"Battle.\\" It's a helluva book, for lack of a better praise. It begins with Takako and Kazushi batteling to the death with an ending that will leave you breathless! Then the series takes its most disturbing turn when it sheds the spotlight on Kaori, a nerdish student who cracks under the Game's pressure. Her chapters are so creepy, it's highly recommended not to read this book at night, as the artwork in these panels are the stuff of nightmares! Yet as frightening as the story builds, the writing gets more and more ingenious, showing us how much more \\"Battle Royale\\" resembles a war story than a satirical take on reality-television: like \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" students act as though they were soldiers in battle, doing everything they can to stay alive, help their comrades...or kill anything threatening. Best of all, the characters are well-defined; you really care for them. As you keep turning the pages, you're left asking yourself not \\"Who's going to die next?\\" but instead, \\"Geez, how much more can these guys take?\\" I have never invested that much interest into a cast in any other graphic novel, or even a written novel. Well, there is only one person I feel irratated at: Shuuya, with his goody-two shoe act and his naive attitude about life. I swear, everytime he blabbers about how life is precious, I begin to secrtetly hope someone would pump lead into his body! Could happen, which leaves me to eagerly anticipate the next chapter! (Anyone here knows how many volumes there are?). I haven't read the original novel or saw the motion picture yet, but after reading the magna, I don't whanna! BTW, try reading the books while listening to the \\"Kill Bill\\" soundtrack. It's great music to listen to for \\"Battle Royale\\"! (Here's hoping Hirono wins!)"},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"As Sugimura desperately tries to locate her, Takako has her hands full trying to fight off the lunatic Kuzushi Niida, a boy whose aim is \\"blood and boo-tay!\\". Will he be in time? Shuuya and Kawada also have a problem when Noriko passes out from fever, and the two must decide whether they can get her to an abandoned infirmary. There's also another nut named Minami wandering the island, off her rocker and talking to her favorite pop idol. After an abortive attempt to hack into the Program computer systems, Mimura moves on to Plan B.The body count and brutality of Volume 4 is a little less than previous entries. I guess they had to get rid of all the bit players and establish the shock value before. Now, it seems like Battle Royale is settling down to telling the stories of the survivors. Over half the class is now dead. So as the characters dwindle, I assume the stories will get more and more personal...and painful. There is a real sense of danger, especially in what I would call the \\"live or die\\" panels. It seems like every character has a moment where they have a realization about their life, or their future, or some truth is revealed and that moment is drawn frozen in time, and on the next page they either die or they don't. So it creates a lot of suspense...or cheap manipulation of the reader. While the art is generally well done, when chracters are shown in childhood flashbacks, they seem to have oversized adult heads on child bodies, creating a hobbit image. But I really don't have any complaints about this series. The only thing that bugs me is that isn't this being televised as it's happening? So, shouldn't any \\"secret plans\\" the group have be doomed to failure? The kids seem to act surprised when they find out they're bugged but haven't they all seen the Program on TV the past couple of seasons?"},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"I am a devoted Battle Royale fan and sought out the manga after both reading the novel (which is now my favorite book of all time) and seeing the movie (which was plain awesome). I have all books so far as of July 20, 2004 and of all the books that have been released, Book 4 remains my favorite, barely above my second favorite, Book 6. After being thoroughly disgusted and turned off by the excessive and unnecessary pornography of Book 3, I began to lose faith in the manga series and ranked the manga as the worst of the three renditions of the BR story. However, with the sensitivity, beauty, and romance of Book 4 combined with the graceful (and graphic, obviously) violence, Battle Royale Volume 4 remains my favorite in the series and lifted the manga to the top of my BR list.The volume chronicles the climax of the battle between the lovely Takako Chigusa and the dastardly and perverted Kasushi Niida, the tearing apart and the reunion of Shuuya, Noriko, and Kawada, as well as some backstory with both Mimura and Kawada. Book 4, for me, defines and brings out the best in the relationships between the central characters, especially that belong to the kind and devoted Noriko, the bleeding heart Shuuya, and the \\"badass with the heart of gold\\" Kawada. If you're the romantic otaku who loves a little violence and drama along with a love story, Volume 4 will surely please you. If not, move on to Book 6 where the action is much more pulse-pounding and emotional. But then again, love can blossom even on a battle field, even if your love affair is with a graphic novel."},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"After volume 3, which was still a good read, and yet, far from as good as the rest of the series, Ihave to say, volume 4 really brought the life back. First off, the extreme sex of the Fallen Angel chapter in book 3 is gone, replaced by what makes the series work, pulse pounding excitment, and amazing characters. Also, I have to say, the art and style are amazing,detailed, and beautiful and gruesome at the same time. It's still at four stars, mainly because of my attitude towards the main character, Shuya (I think thats his name). He still feels to much like a bleeding Romeo hero, although he does get better in this volume, by realizing his flaws. And his \\"heroic\\" (stupid) actions are not treated as something great. But still, he bugs me, so that brings my rating down one star... more like half a star."},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"I've enjoyed the first three graphic novels of the series immensely, but I found Volume 4 to be a little less enjoyable than the previous volumes.I guess my main objection is that it didn't seem like that much happened in this book. Sure, a few more students died (I won't reveal any spoilers here about specifically who did what), but after I was done reading the book, I was left with the feeling that not much had happened. That's probably not uncommon for middle volumes in long series like this one; I'd expect that the pace will pick up in the next volume.The art is as good as ever, and there are some truly creepy close-ups of at least one character who's gone mad. There is a decent amount of violence, including a very nice surprise in one of the scenes, and the graphic sex that was present previously in the series is absent from this volume (so if that turned you off the series before, you won't have to worry about that with this one).Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed Volume 4, and will definitely pick up Volume 5, but I do hope that the rest of the books are stronger than this one. Obviously, if you're new to Battle Royale, I'd advise you to start with Volume 1, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"If you've read this series at all, volume four is the continuation of the same seriously messed-up, seriously gripping story. Forty-two kids, an entire class, are kidnapped and forced to hunt each other on an island for a \\"reality show.\\" This volume continues the story as one of our heroes takes ill -- but the book is good about giving each and every member of this huge cast a real backstory and real life... even if they often only get that depth in the seconds before their brutal deaths. If you want a really twisted story, grab it from volume one and prepare for one of the most chilling Manga series you'll ever read."},{"Title":"Battle Royale: v. 4","review":"Well, this volume was good compared to the last one.

Unfortunately, as a science book it must be written as such... and this book has sparked a few of my pet peeves... It refers to Earth as &quot;earth&quot;... Upper-case &quot;E&quot;!! It abuses the word &quot;the&quot; using it ad nauseum throughout the book... everything is a the in this book... It uses the degree symbol when providing temperature data in Kelvin degrees (a big no-no!), it hints at the long out-dated theory of Environmental Determinism (don't let Carl Sauer read this book!), and I attribute the fact the author tends to write with a hint of chauvenism due to the fact that this book was written in late 60s... Overall, the information in the book is interesting to the technical reader, but a bore to the rest of the world... and not well written for a science book. Shop elsewhere!"},{"Title":"Planets in Synastry: Astrologic Patterns of Relationships (The Planet Series)","review":"If this book is likely to be useful to you, you'll understand what I mean when I say that E.W. Neville is a highly Uranian individual. Though one can tell he's making an effort to rein in his hobbyhorses, this book is still heavily colored (too heavily, in my opinion) by his personal experiences and prejudices.This can be seen, for example, in his upgrading of Uranus to basically equal importance in relationships with Venus and Mars--a judgment I suspect few astrologers would concur with. It's also reflected in some odd, unexplained choices--for example, leaving out relationships between identical planets (Sun/Sun, Moon/Moon, etc.) and omitting aspects between Mercury and all the planets from Jupiter outward. Isn't communication a key part of relationships?But most basically, his idiosyncracy is shown by the elaborate scripts he lays out with virtually each aspect he delineates. &quot;Venus will do this, while Pluto will do that&quot;--leaving aside the very important concept of free will, there's insufficient recognition that any single aspect is just one of a few dozen astrological influences on a relationship.The book does cover the quincunx aspect, which is often left out by other books, though the readings of this aspect are almost always highly negative--often worse than the square, which makes little sense to me. Neville does thoroughly cover composite chart reading as well as synastric comparison.I don't want to discourage people too much from buying this book--there is much insight into astrological symbolism here, and for that it is useful. But one could wish it in a more open-ended and less dogmatic form."},{"Title":"Planets in Synastry: Astrologic Patterns of Relationships (The Planet Series)","review":"E.W. Neville (no clues as to whether the author is 'he' or 'she'!) has written an excellent and thoughtful book that covers not only direct chart comparison techniques, but also aspects in the composite chart.Written, one feels, with much experience in the field of both synastry and orthodox relationship counselling/analysis, the book is compassionate and offers telling insights into to the dynamics that drive human beings to try and form relationships in the first place.It is a delightful book and, even with almost 10 years experience as a consultant astrologer, I still rate as one of the best books about synastry on teh market - bar none.Quibbles? A few! The author fails, for some unknown reason, to include same-planet combinations, e.g. Mercury-Mercury, Sun-Sun, etc, etc.Important planet-angle aspects, too, appear to be excluded from the text. And the text is, very occasionally, disconcertingly blunt, along the lines of, &quot;with this tricky aspect in the composite chart, the relationship is unlikely to survive&quot;. Such blunt pronouncements about discreet placements goes against the experience of the professional astrologer, who very often does see couples whose relationship has survived, even thrived, one irritating synastric aspect notwithstanding! Perhaps later editions will tone down these often jarring statements, which tend to veer from the tone of humane understanding that the author displays elsewhere.As you can guess, I am a big fan of this book. It outshines other texts on the same subject, partly because of its highly literate style - sadly, something that is too often missing in most astrological literature. Both the intermediate astrologer, as well as more advanced ones, should find plenty of golden nuggets to mine in this unique book. And no, I neither know nor am related to the author!!John Little B.Sc Consultant Astrologer"},{"Title":"Planets in Synastry: Astrologic Patterns of Relationships (The Planet Series)","review":"Neville's work is a good text to add your astrology library. This book's one outstanding characteristic is that it periodically departs from traditional interpretations to give some thought provoking insights into the dynamics of relationship analysis. Neville is also one of the few astrologers to address the quincunx in synastry and composite chart analysis. However, his interpretations are almost always negative for this aspect, and I have not found this aspect to be as horrible as he frequently suggests.Neville's book has an interesting structure to it. It begins with a thought provoking discussion on relationship dynamics. When we get to the actual interpretations, he provides a brief synopsis (often humorous) for the conjunction, trine, sextile, square, opposition and quincunx aspects in both the synastry and composite charts (and presents them on the same page). At the end of the book he presents a case study.However, there are a few problems with his book. First, he periodically pontificates and his tone can be quite jarring. For example, for the aspect \\"Mars opposite Saturn\\" in the composite chart he says, \\"Only if one sees marriage or other intimate commitments as an indoor form of bullfighting would this be a useful aspect in a partnership. Even then, the mortality rate would be high and the life expectancy of the relationship short\\" (242). This sounds very heavy handed. In fact, in one of the longest running Hollywood marriages, the marriage between Sophia Loren and Carlo Ponti, there is a T square with Mars opposite Saturn and both squared to Pluto. It may sound ominous, but they made it work! Here is a great example of the power of free will.Additionally, His primary focus is on chart aspects between Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars and Uranus. Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto are treated as \\"secondary planets,\\" which suggests a negligible influence. This goes against my experience. Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn are very important in synastry and composite chart analysis. He also omits examining cross aspects between like planets, such as Sun to Sun, Moon to Moon, Venus to Venus, etc. He totally omits Ascendant and Midheaven aspects. He is also very fond of the planet Uranus and seems a bit too generous in proclaiming its great qualities.Neville examines the planets through the houses in both the composite and synastry charts, and frequently his examples are quite good. For example, for the synastry placement of \\"Mars in the eighth house,\\" he says, \\"This overlay is responsible for most 'double takes:' that neck wrenching response when another person reaches across a room or crosswalk and hits us right in our procreative urges\\" (117). His candidness is humorous. Although I don't always agree with him, he does offer stimulating analysis that's worth considering.If you need information on how to construct charts by hand, then this book will not be enough. This book focuses on relationship dynamics and aspects. However, there is quite a bit of free software available for beginners who do not know how to construct a chart. Astrologer Allen Edwall created software that generates synastry, composite and relationship charts that you can download for free. The program is called MatchMkr. Type his name in your favorite search engine to get to his website. Also you might want to browse zdnet and tucows download center to see what other software is available. Just type \\"astrology\\" in their download section search box.At times this book was exasperating. But overall, it is useful and provocative. It's nice to see fresh interpretations for aspects, and Neville does that with ease."},{"Title":"Planets in Synastry: Astrologic Patterns of Relationships (The Planet Series)","review":"While there is some merit in this book, especially inclusion of the composite chart, I am becoming more and more reluctant to pick it up when examining synastry charts. I approach this book with caution and brace myself for negative responses.Neville does try to give a best and worst case scenario, however both of these views tend to be too final and often smug in my opinion, without, for instance, showing any sensitivity to other factors that may have influence.Some of the interpretations are down right negative with little to back them up. For example, Moon falling in the 4th house is completely unworkable for a committed relationship, as is Venus in the 6th. He obviously favours Uranus and especially 11th house placements above all else, while excluding the incredible importance of Jupiter and Saturn. He shows a definite bias towards certain houses and planets.I now take most of what he says with a grain of salt. There is not enough consideration of subtle psychological forces at play in synastry, in my opinion, and I have come across many workable relationships that prove his insights wrong."},{"Title":"Planets in Synastry: Astrologic Patterns of Relationships (The Planet Series)","review":"I'm sorry to rate this book so low, because the author understands basic astrological mechanisms, but possibly not all that deeply. The author has a very stubborn, all-or-nothing approach to every planetary interaction which seems to show a lack of appreciation for how multivalent these symbols are. The author's tone and approach are so insensitive, unpleasant and arrogant that it really turned off this reader. With experience with clients and charts, the astrologer may find that relationships are more complicated than the author credits, and it is not the place of the astrologer to judge them, but rather to explain them."},{"Title":"Secret Place","review":"This book has greatly impacted my life.

And this is a daily struggle, not something you do once and you got it made. It is a life style that you develop. Is it easy? For some may be, for some it may be very difficult, but the degree of difficulty is totally irrelevant, for the reward is much higher than whatever this world has to offer."},{"Title":"Secret Place","review":"This book tough me how we need have a silent time to seek God and have an encounter with him."},{"Title":"Secret Place","review":"Eye opening!

I found the idea of the spiritual hunger the author identified throughout her travels to be thought provoking. I enjoyed the beliefs the author shared on our inner voice. Within that section I found parallels to the Appreciative Inquiry philosophy that I became acquainted with this past summer. The author's insights encourage people to be idealistic and strive to achieve their best possible selves while at the same time embracing the reality of where their own strengths lie. The book's time management thoughts are interesting to ponder. Other experts would benefit from considering the outlook on time that is expressed in this book. I agree with the Law of Physics described in the book.

The plays are presented in chronological order, and the introductions give newcomers to Shakespeare's work an understanding of what each play is all about, as well as the history behind it. \\"King Lear\\" is included both as it was originally written, as well as Shakespeare's revision of it years later.There is an in-depth glossary at the back of the book that will help the new reader of this work understand many of the words that were written in the plays at that point of time. Another wonderful addition is an index to the first line of sonnets, and the page that sonnet can be found on.This revised book will bring readers of Shakespeare's work closer to their original meaning thanks to the painstaking updating, while keeping the original titles in tact.

Notable are the extended articles for major religions ranging from African religions to Taoism. The text is richly illustrated.It makes, however, the mistake of defining religions by their official doctrine only. Though there are numerous photos of people worshipping, some of the articles take only the work of theologians seriously. Living institutions are often treated as mere relics of the past rather than as contemporary expressions of belief.I was also disappointed by the section on Mythology, which only treats dead religions and these not very well, preferring to discuss the way Myth is studied rather than providing specific details and cross-references. Where it covers these old traditions in depth, (and only the ones which are prominent in Western intellectual thought, alas!) it fails to flesh out the tales of the gods and goddesses or to provide a handy reference to different pantheons.It often fails on the side of &quot;neutrality&quot; by failing to present skeptical perspectives on religion. (There isn't even an article on Skepticism, which is, in this century, as important a movement as Iconoclasm was in the 8th and 9th centuries). Secular humanism also receives short shrift.The owner of this volume who bears these failures in mind will nonetheless find it useful. There's a fascinating section on New Religions, an extensive bibliography, and many fine, brief articles on the many facets of religion. It is worth having this among your general reference books."},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions","review":"I bought this encyclopedia several years ago, and have used it fairly frequently. I have invariably found it to lead me deeper and deeper into the book, as the entries are also interlinked very nicely.The entries are arranged in alphabetical order. Major entries are structured like chapters and are often devoted to a major faith. The book is very well illustrated, and has been printed on excellent paper. The cloth-spine binding itself is superb, and I have not had any problems with it over the last five years.The entries are not very lengthy, but do give sufficient details for someone who is starting to get interested in understanding about other faiths. The book doesn't have an index, but is well-cross-referenced. There is a table of contents listing the major faiths.A word about the background of the contributors: Ms.Wendy Doniger, the Consulting Editor, is a scholar who is highly influential and respected in US for her understanding of Hinduism. She is also embroiled in a controversy with Hindus in America over the way she and her school interpret Hinduism. Mr. Jeffrey Kripal is another such scholar - one of his books (Kali's Child) was withdrawn from circulation by the Indian publisher after objections arose in US and India. All the other contributors are from the West, except two from Columbia University, who appear to be of Indian origin.This naturally gives rise to a charge of bias or lack of understanding on of part of scholars. I also noticed this in some places while reading about Hinduism. However, this does not seem to be deliberate slant, but may be due to the background and cultural differences of the scholars. In fact, I found the treatment of non-Western religions in this encyclopedia to be more accurate and balanced than that in the World Book Encyclopedia, which often reads like a missionary text.All in all, an excellent buy. However, you should use it for general information only, and stop short of using it as an authentic interpretation of non-Western faiths (or Western faith, for that matter)."},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions","review":"I was looking for a book that contains a decent overview of many religions, possibly in dictionary form.

Unlike many that I found during my search, it does more than gloss over lesser-known religions, and it's more in-depth than the several thin but colorfully illustrated books that are widely available.

That second part is critical becouse with Hinduism, as with Catholicism, it is easy to get lost in the details and miss the forest for the trees. It is to the author's credit that he keeps his focus on the big picture.There is, however, simply too much information to absorb is one read-through. Readers will find themselves going back to this book and, if one's appetite is sufficiently whetted, may seek more in-depth resources to explore (which was probably the author's intention).

On overnight camping trips he would often read a passage from Sigurd Olson to get us to reflect on the beauty of nature around us. Olson's work has a charisma that can not be found by any other writer. Reflections of The North Country was the first of Olson's books that I have had the privledge to read. I read the hardcover version, and found it to be food for the soal. In the hectic modern world that we live in today it is wonderful to learn from the wisdom of the ages, and get back to nature. Reflections is a compilation of beautifully writtin essays written by the late Sigurd Olson as he neared the end of his life. He looks back on the bygone era, and lure of the old French Canadian Voyageur, and describes many of his own voyages by canoe. I would recommend this book and others by Olson to anyone who loves the outdoors."},{"Title":"Reflections from the North Country","review":"Here in the late twentieth century as the pace of life seems to quicken daily, Sigurd Olson's &quot;Reflections from the North Country&quot; offers a calm refuge and thoughtful perspective with which to deal with our hectic world. Olson was an outdoorsman and sage, and has provided in this book a series of essays drawn from his lifelong love affair with the great out of doors.The truly refreshing aspect of the book is its ability to drop a mantle of calm around the reader. In simple, evocative language supported by obvious deep thought Olson helps one reflect on the pace and values we keep today. Essay titles such as Timelessness, Great Silences, Search for Meaning, Harmony, Beauty, Freedom, Contemplation hint at the breadth of this book.If interested in retreating from and reflecting on our world today, this is an excellent companion with which to do so. Though written more than twenty years ago, it is timeless in its ability to reach deep into our souls."},{"Title":"Reflections from the North Country","review":"This book compiles some of Olson's best writings. In it, his last book, Olson further explores the concept of self-reflection and self-discovery through wilderness solace. His writing will be of interest to anyone who enjoys the outdoors (especially canoeing), but also readers who enjoy general contemporary philosophy."},{"Title":"Reflections from the North Country","review":"although the theme here is obvious. the thing i liked best about this book was how it brought attention to the many overlooked things in life. a must read for outdoor enthusiasts"},{"Title":"Reflections from the North Country","review":"This book consists of 28 essays, each a few pages long. The essays discuss general themes related to the outdoors, with reference to the North Country from Minnesota to Alaska. Olson is a marvelous writer, and the essays are captivating.The book is divided into three parts: \\"Primal Heritage,\\" \\"Search for Meaning,\\" and \\"The Imponderables.\\" The first group of essays ruminate on themes such as nomads, hunter-gatherers, silence in the woods, and the implications of these themes for modern life. The second group on meaning concerns one-word themes such as harmony, aliveness, beauty, and simplicity. These essays would provide an excellent basis for discussion in a book group or a classroom setting.The third group is the least successful, and moves to a poorly-developed religious climax. In earlier essays in the book, Olson revealed himself as a Christian who sees the beauty of God's creation in the great outdoors. In the third part he moves toward a more synthetic position, finding common ground among many religions. That's fine, but it leads him to two essays on an \\"emergent God,\\" which don't really work. He is a nature writer, not a theologian, and it shows.Though many of his themes are timeless, such as the need for people to discover their true nature away from their urban lives, Olson discusses many anachronistic practices. When he would arrive in camp, his chores might include cutting pine boughs for a mattress, chopping down a tree for firewood and tent poles, and other destructive practices. Those are no longer possible.Olson also reveals himself as a man living in a patriarchal time. He would disappear into the woods for weeks or months at a time, leaving his family behind. In this book, he mentions his son Sig several times but never mentions his wife, who presumably raised Sig and managed other household chores. Olson also sings the praises of his canoe-makers, and the joys of simple food in the backcountry such as rice, beans, and meats, but he does not raise any of that food himself. This reveals him as being connected to a wider economy and to people such as farmers who cannot disappear into the woods as he can.Would Olson have been able to live his life in the woods without his wife, farmers, canoe-makers, and others living their lives in a house? The thought never crosses his mind, but we should ponder it."},{"Title":"Reflections from the North Country","review":"Read this book before, during and after any trip into the BWCA, or Quetico (or for that matter any trip into the wilderness).

Taussig does not borrow from the research of legendary historical graybeards like Vernon Lee Fluharty, Richard E. Sharpless, Orlando Fals Borda or German Archiniegas. He does not use academic journals, newspapers or magazines to prove a point. Instead he presents a lyrical diary of his extensive fieldwork. In doing so, the author provides a raw and unnerving documentation of Colombia's long tradition of violence.Taussig's work is easy reading for students of Colombian - American affairs and Latin American specialists. However, this book will be a tough road for those unfamiliar with Colombia's culture of denial. For instance, Taussig condemns the government. His work is a glaring spotlight on the government's paramilitary utilization of \\"limpieza\\" or \\"social cleansing\\" of the bottom dwellers of Colombian society (desechables or throwaways). The author does not rely on Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International or even the U.S. State Department's repeated annual reports on the government's feeble human rights record. Taussig lives with the relatives and friends of victims and dumps eyewitness accounts on the reader instead.The author laments how a handful of wealthy families underhandedly bought and then destroyed an enormously fertile valley for thousands of families...in order to establish theCali sugar industry and institutionalize poverty for the same families as cane workers. He also reports how Colombia's Army & Police intelligence officials create \\"lists\\" of people that are handed to paramilitary leaders for execution. Union leaders, teachers, priests and other defenders of the poor often make the lists. Taussig does not defend the guerrillas...he knows they are not angels. This book is more about how the poor are caught in a violent sandwich with no hope in sight.This book discloses a simple fact of life in Colombia. That the ruthless paramilitary death squads are a part of the State strategy...particularly today. The leaders of the paramilitary death squads employ terror and this book is an honest chronicle of regular public assassinations in broad daylight. Yes, it is indeed tragic, that in Colombia the Army will stand aside and allow poor unarmed civilians to get cut to pieces because powerful members of society think this is how you protect democracy. Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Law in a Lawless Land: Diary of a Limpieza","review":"Michael Taussig offers a glimpse of the possibilities in his book Law in a Lawless Land: Diary of a Limpieza in Colombia--limpieza being the term the paramilitaries use to refer to \\"cleansing\\" a region of its undesirable elements. Taussig, an anthropologist at the other Columbia (the one on the Upper West Side of New York City) has been doing fieldwork since 1969 in a small city in the Cauca River Valley, a few miles from Cali. Some time around the year 2000, a tax-free, free-trade industrial zone was established just outside town. In February of the following year, a group of paramilitaries move in, hired--Taussig's informants tell him--by the \\"town's business elite.\\" In the 1990s, in other regions of Colombia, the style of the paramilitaries would have been to move into a town such as Taussig's, identify the supposed guerrilla sympathizers and massacre them all at once, thereby creating headlines and embarrassing human rights inquiries. But in the new millennium the paramilitaries operate in a more discreet fashion, and their enemies are no longer so much political as they are economic.In Taussig's town, they move into El Cupido, a love hotel downtown, with computer lists helpfully provided by military intelligence and go about the work of cleansing the town of its delincuentes--\\"undesirables,\\" a few at a time. Their victims include not so much leftists or even political activists but street people: kids who've had \\"problems with the law,\\" beggars, a madwoman, prostitutes not affiliated with El Cupido and a young man who, drunk in the middle of town one evening, makes the mistake of yelling at the paras: Que salgan hijeputas--\\"get out of here, you sons of whores!\\" He's killed for his outburst and his body lies on the street all night because people are afraid to move it. In neighboring towns other paramilitaries ban long hair or earrings on men, miniskirts on women, baseball hats worn backward and a gay beauty contest. Life under the paramilitaries doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.Taussig's book is based on a diary he kept during two weeks he spent in the town in May of 2001 during the fourth month of its paramilitary reign. His most interesting discovery is the support the paramilitaries have in town. One of his informants tells him that eight of ten of the townspeople are for them. There's a reason for this. Until the 1950s Taussig's part of the Cauca River Valley was dominated by small peasant farms. In their river-valley plots, the peasants (descendants of former African slaves) grew cacao trees, plantain trees, banana trees, coffee trees, orange trees, lemon trees, avocado trees, papaya trees, guava trees and many other trees besides. The peasants thereby created a mixed harvest that mimicked the tropical rain forest, required no store-bought fertilizers, no pesticides, little labor, little capital and, perhaps most important, created a continuous, year-round income.But, sometime in the 1950s, the sugar industry arrived. The peasant farms were plowed under and everyone went to work on the new plantations (for the ultimate benefit, as Taussig points out, of a few white-skinned families in Cali). At first there was plenty of need for labor, but then, as Taussig puts it, \\"chemicals and machines made the workers idle.\\" By the time the paramilitaries arrived, a shantytown of the unemployed had grown at one end of town, a slum that became so unruly that the police were afraid to enter. With no prospects for education or work, the kids formed gangs and turned to crime. Gradually, the town fell victim to a youth-gang-based crime wave that it would apparently do anything to solve. Taussig happens upon a gang funeral and witnesses the anarchic violence, the fights, the boombox hip-hop, the weird (for provincial Colombia) fashion, and the weird (for provincial Colombia) hair-dos. He notes one of the kids wearing an English-language T-shirt that says: Death Is Nature's Way of Saying Slow Down.In Taussig's town, he notes that the paramilitaries have also been recruited out of the ranks of the unemployed. Former soldiers unable to find other jobs dominate their ranks. The murder of the street kids--the children of other unemployed Colombians--is bad enough, but beneath this obvious terror, Taussig perceives a deeper kind of terror. What he sees is an economic \\"culture of terror\\" that afflicts everybody in the neoliberal world of his town. The principal arm of this culture of terror is unemployment. Neoliberalism is supposed to generate jobs and solve unemployment, but that's an act of faith, really, and not enough attention has been given to the possibility that it might just be the problem cruelly masquerading as the solution. Although each town in Colombia has its own logic, Taussig makes a convincing case that in this new Colombia, \\"like the plants that went under, like the forest that disappeared, human nature as much as nature is facing a brave new world for which there is no history or pre-history.\\""},{"Title":"Law in a Lawless Land: Diary of a Limpieza","review":"With this diary over two weeks Taussig not only explains but makes us desperately feel the violence of today's Colombia, the fear permeating people's life and consequently the breaking down of social networks, and the appearance and interplay of constant new \\"actors\\" on the war-scape. It is just such kind of war (maybe thought of as low-intensity), which is easily ignored by the medias and therefore by european citizens, too accustomed of feeling safe when there is a democracy in a faraway country, no matter, what is really moving around it.Taussig also invites us to think about the very sense of writing a diary, which of course also means the sense of being \\"there\\", an anthropologist going back to a country where he worked during decades. Old friends are met, and some of them can not be met anymore or have taken other roads. Two weeks, embedded in a historical depth that helps to understand certain aspects of the today's terror.I certainly recomend this book (as all the books of the author) not only to anthropologists and persons interested in Latin America, but anyone eager to understand the intimate relationship of local grinding poverty and violence, and global decision making."},{"Title":"A Lucky Number","review":"My mother found this book at a thrift store a few years ago and we both fell in love; after searching thrift shops and yard sales I finally ordered online and I'm glad I did. This book is charming and often hilarious, with great illustrations. My 13 year old brother actually likes it as much as my mother and I because it is just a good, wholesome, funny book."},{"Title":"Rex Cats (Barron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals)","review":"When we got our new Selkirk Rex kitten, I was anxious to find out more about the breed. I knew how much it had helped us, when our mostly-Maine Coon cat grew old, to know that the breed suffered from lower back problems. We made adjustments in his lifestyle, which must have worked; the Maine Coon lived to nearly 19.This was the only book I found that offered more than a couple of paragraphs about the Selkirk Rex (like the LaPerm, it's a relatively new breed); even so, most of the information here is about the Cornish Rex and the Devon Rex. That is, when it's about the Rex at all. Fully half the 100-page-or-so book is generic information about taking care of your cat, such as choosing a vet, feeding, and the declawing question. That's not necessarily bad, for those who haven't owned a cat before, and the book is cheap enough that I don't resent the &quot;extra&quot; information.On the other hand, the information specific to the Rex (and to the Selkirk in particular) is good enough to shoot the review up to 4 stars.First, it has incredibly pretty pictures of each of the Rex breeds, lots of them. If you want to compare your new (or proposed) kitty the best-of-the-breed, you'll have plenty of opportunity to do so. That might make it worth the money right there.The authors trace the history of each breed, but more importantly they give plenty of information about the cats' temperment (these are all extremely social cats, and now I know that our kitten's insatiable curiousity will outlast kittenhood) and unique needs. For example, I'm strongly advised to pat-dry Meriwether after a bath (which is recommended once a month), rather than rub his fur dry, because that'll develop mats. It doesn't answer everything (is it just Meri, or are Selkirks all not-jumpers?) but that would be too much to ask for.I've found some of this information on my Internet searches, but not all of it. If for no other reason than the collection of &quot;ooh, isn't she pretty!&quot; photos, I'm glad I got this book."},{"Title":"Rex Cats (Barron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals)","review":"The book is informative and simple enough to follow.

Fanny Stevenson 's drive for life took her from a comfortable Midwestern family life to Gold Rush San Francisco to Impressionist Paris to the South Pacific, with three colorful men, the most famous of whom was Robert Louis Stevenson. She was maligned for her fierce adventurousness in her own era; Alexandra LaPierre resurrects her story with admiration, and tells it well."},{"Title":"Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny","review":"This 500-page, fictionalized biography is an impressive, engrossing work. Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson was a physically-robust 'man's woman' in an era when women were used hard, but held back, typed, and discriminated against. A very early marriage to a charming, faithless, adventuring neighbor-turned-gold-prospecter resulted in several children whom she took around the world in her life's amazing travels and adventures. She gave and endured much w/husband No. 1, whom she divorced to marry writer Rob't. Louis Stevenson.That relationship was far more satisfying and productive. By becoming his vigilant caretaker and loving critic/editor/scribe, she prolonged his fragile life sixteen years and thereby left the world a rich legacy of superior literary works. Their union was largely a happy one, although not without tensions, screamers, and blow-ups, detailed in the book. Being a vigilant caretaker is a thankless job, as caretakers everywhere can attest. Mrs. S. didn't fare well in the eyes of many others, who were jealous and resentful of her influence over Stevenson, his change from adolescent to adult, and her temerity in limiting Stevenson's self-destructive (given his health) bon vivant tendencies. He, too, apparently grew to resent it as the years progressed and he enjoyed (towards the last and due to her), better health, greater energy, and congenial surroundings. But it was a true love match. They remained devoted to each other throughout their marriage and past his death. His loving poem, \\"To My Wife\\" (undated), is the cover page to the hardcover edition. Its tenderness and realism are truly moving.The Notes section describes the author's field trips all over the world and US, and the process of synthesizing new Letters, dialogue, and scenes from the materials found. The Epilogue's follow-up of all the key primary and secondary characters is greatly appreciated, as by the story's close, one feels close to and curious about them. The Bibliography is enormous and of great interest in itself. Stevenson was a lion in the Western European literary circle of his time, and their peregrinations to the South Seas and Polynesia put them in extended contact with famous people from several cultures, esp. the indigenous leaders of Hawaii and Samoa."},{"Title":"Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny","review":"it is ashame that this book left store shelves so quickly and has become so hard to find. it is one of those rare gems of biography, seemlessly weaving facts and writings and the many stories of a life into a work with a novel-like quality.the work gracefully unfolds the tale of a powerful, courageous woman. fanny stevenson was a woman ahead of her time and she was of her time. she traveled alone across our continent and to europe at a time when women traveled with companions at the very least. she m"},{"Title":"Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny","review":"Fanny Stevenson was a strong woman but deeply affected by the attitudes of her day. What a strength she had though. Love this book, any woman would appreicate her story, very well written."},{"Title":"Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny","review":"Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny rates as one of the better biographies I've read in the last five years. I believe this one will be one that I remember and refer back to often.Fanny's life contained much diversity, adventure, travel and love's ups and downs. She certainly was a unique individual and clearly had some charisma where men were concerned, although I am still baffled as to why that was considering the chauvinistic era in which she lived. IMO Fanny serves as a pre-feminist lady. She nursed and served Robert Louis Stevenson but couldn't be labeled as servile, if that makes any sense. She did not hesitate to give opinions and could bully others if they stood in the way of helping someone she loved. Strong-willed would be an understatement in describing Fanny.Since I am a fan of RLS, I enjoyed seeing his life through Fanny's eyes. It isn't the rose-coloured view presented by most of his biographers. His passion and loyalty towards Fanny and his friends impressed me.A couple highlights of the book:*Fanny's fashion sense: wear the current style, but add at least one item that expresses your individual personality.*There is enough travel, drama and adventure for a couple of lives*The devotion and loyalty between Fanny and RLS is touching*This is my first time seeing a Notes section layout such as this one has. I liked it a lot!The only drawbacks:*Even after reading this book I still don't feel like I know Fanny as much as know about her. I don't blame the author for this because most information about her is written by her enemies who felt she stole RLS from them. However, the author did a wonderful job of reconstructing her life from letters and such.*The other drawback is only a minor one and a personal peeve. I detest it when authors write lines such as 'She didn't know this would be the last time ...' or 'Little did she know that....' I hate being told something before it happens in a biography. I like to know what happens in the order it happens. Fortunately, this book indulges in only a minor amount of this tactic."},{"Title":"Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny","review":"Alexandra Lapierre followed the love story of Fanny and Robert Louis Stevenson from France to Scotland, to California, to Samoa and many other points along the way, and her fascinated pursuit uncovered a beautiful and rare relationship that should be more widely known to those who seek the life stories behind great literature."},{"Title":"Being Mentally Ill, A Sociological Theory","review":"I read the first edition of Scheff's Being Mentally Ill when I was a doctoral student in the late '70's. By then labeling theory had already begun to devolve into a set of sensitizing concepts, and prospects for a full-blown labeling theory of mental illness, or deviance more generally, had begun to fade.Nevertheless, Scheff demonstrated remarkable insight and skill in theory construction in making a case that contextual factors, especially the responses of others, whether they be individuals or specialized institutions, contributed substantially to who was characterized as mentally ill by others as well as by themselves.Scheff argued forcefully and with a good deal of wisdom that mental illness was a socially created phenomenon. The systems model that he used to outline this process, complete with feedback loops that demonstrated how the judgments of others could turn innocuous miscues into pathological symptoms that were acknowledged by observers as well as by the afflicted, was quite compelling and hardly the stuff of soft sociology.For a time, I was convinced that all mental illness was a socially created phenomenon that existed only in relational terms, rejecting alternative psychological and physical explanations. I have since disabused myself of that misconception, but I remain convinced by Scheff's work that some instances of mental illness are, in fact, products of ongoing social labeling processes.I've done program evaluation in schools, a juvenile court, alcohol and drug abuse clinics, mental health facilities, and geriatric assistance programs. Having read Scheff's work on social labeling processes, I could see them dong their damaging work in each kind of setting. Labeling was so thoroughly, professionally, unwittingly, and organizationally integrated into these domains that removing it, or even significantly diminishing its efficacy, would have destroyed the institution. Beyond that, by the time we get to program evaluation, the damage has been done. Victims' ways of thinking about themselves have been distorted such that they are consistent with their label. To borrow an idea from George Herbert Mead, their central nervous systems have been reorganized to their disadvantage.In a real sense, labeling is a universal phenomenon that occurs in all social interaction. Anselm Strauss' brilliant theoretical treatise Mirrors and Masks can rightly be read as an explanation of how social labeling in symbol rich environments provides the material that constitutes our identities.Scheff and others like him, such as Hawkins and Tiedman in The Creation of Deviance, have focused more narrowly than Strauss on the acquisition of pernicious labels that destroy lives. The reactionary spirit of Reaganesque rugged individualism that currently pervades our society has stunted the development and application of social perspectives due to original thinkers such as Scheff. Let's hope that these oppressive circumstances soon give way to reason in its sociological form."},{"Title":"How to paint signs and sho' cards,","review":"This is fun, has lots of drawings.

Thomas C. Oden gives a Biblical framework for what Wesley wrote in a manner that is far easier to deal with than Wesley's journals."},{"Title":"John Wesley's scriptural Christianity","review":"In the introduction of this work, Oden is careful to distinguish his efforts from those of Outler. Oden notes that he is primarily a systematic theologian and that Outler was primarily a historical theologian. Hence, Oden writes, &quot;My method is primarily systematic, Outler's historical.&quot; The bottom line for the reader is that you can either pick and read through Wesley's works trying to remember where he addressed certain subjects or you can pick up a copy of this book. Throughout this effort, Oden quotes from and abstracts-in contemporary prose-Wesley's writings subject by subject and then orders it all in a systematic fashion proving the overall consistency, width and depth of the material Wesley covered throughout his lifetime. In addition, Oden heavily references each subject and topic so that you can then read the context from the material he drew from. Of further interest, Oden offers suggested reading should a topic peak the readers interest to the point that they would like to learn more from other Christian thinkers. At the back of the book Oden provides both Scripture and subject indexes. Hands down this is an invaluable reference for topical Wesleyan studies and it is the closest you'll come to a systematic theology written by Wesley himself."},{"Title":"John Wesley's scriptural Christianity","review":"Thomas C. Oden has done a remarkable job in this book. John Wesley wrote sermons, tracts, hymns, notes on the Bible and other books such as the works, journals and letters. However, Wesley did not write a sytematic theology.Oden contends that Wesley wrote about all of the areas of theology and his sermons were written to cover all aspects of systematic theology. This was apparently the method used by those of his day to write theologically. Wesley wrote for his ministers and people in his church so that they would have his thinking on all aspects of theology.Oden has gathered Wesley's thought systematically, in a form that Wesley did not do and it is remarkable how excellent this job was done.This book should be up front and center for all ministers and lay people who want to know what Wesley thought and find the entrances or documentation in Wesley's works to follow up.Great job.J.

While the Betz Guide gives a solid outline of items to study, it doesn't provide the summarized material it outlines. I already know what is on the DAT and I can easily come up with a study outline myself. What I need is a study guide that provides me with the information to master the test. Bottom line, the Betz Guide is a terse and abbreviated study aid for an in depth and difficult test. In other words, it is a waste of money.

Missy Parker, her brother, Bobby, and their best friend, Junior Washington, are playing baseball when they are confronted by Hal Bainbridge and his wife, Estelle, who are just passing through the area. Hal and Estelle leave but the demon accompanying them stays behind. The demon is so enraged by Missy's defiance of Hal, that he vows to destroy every piece of Missy's life- and thus the war in Cat Lake begins.Junior is a Christian and as such, he shares his faith regularly. Little does he realize it, but his faith is about to be tested- and in the process, Missy will gain her faith. Step back into the Mississippi country in 1945 to a town where Christianity unites those of all colors and the battle between demons and angels has just begun....ABIDING DARKNESS: THE BLACK OR WHITE CHRONICLES BOOK ONE is a deeply moving story about the heart of Christianity. John Aubrey Anderson explains many of the basic tenets of the faith without being preachy or overbearing. His greatest strength, however, is the superb character development in which the reader sees realistic displays of Christianity in action. Missy's own journey with her faith is one many will relate to as she struggles to maintain her initial enthusiasm for Jesus. She becomes lax in her faith as time passes but renews her faith and experiences many of the same issues that Christians today deal with. The portrait of Missy is both stunning and awe-inspiring.ABIDING DARKNESS: THE BLACK OR WHITE CHRONICLES BOOK ONE has numerous scenes that will touch the reader's heart. Perhaps, however, the scene at Cat Lake Bridge with Bobby, Missy, and Junior is the most memorable. The drama that unfolds is both poignant and heart-wrenching. This reviewer still cries every time that scene comes to mind.Racial issues and their pertinence to Christianity are also very carefully and sensitively addressed by John Aubrey Anderson. Mississippi in 1945 was still a very segregated area but Christianity binds together those of different races. While Missy is white, her best friend, Junior, is African-American. ABIDING DARKNESS: THE BLACK OR WHITE CHRONICLES BOOK ONE demonstrates how Christianity is a matter of the heart and not a matter of skin color.John Aubrey Anderson has amazed this reviewer with this awesome and touching story of the Christian faith. While somewhat reminiscent of Frank Peretti's PIERCING THE DARKNESS and THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, ABIDING DARKNESS: THE BLACK OR WHITE CHRONICLES BOOK ONE is by no means a carbon copy. Instead, Mr. Anderson has utilized a similar technique to Frank Peretti but placed his own folksy brand upon this incredible tale. ABIDING DARKNESS: THE BLACK OR WHITE CHRONICLES BOOK ONE has earned a cherished place on this reviewer's keeper shelf!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"What a remarkable book! To see realistic characters who are so devoted to the Lord and so quick to pray about their problems was very gratifying. The glimpses into the spirit world were believable. The snake attack and the attack of the deranged man were especially gripping.

I had never heard of this author prior to reading this book; he has won me over."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I found this book on a sale table and bought it a few years ago. This week, I picked it up and began reading it; I was hardly able to put it down! It is a different kind of Christian fiction. Angels and Demons speak and surround the well-written characters. Set in Mississippi cotton country, the dialog is \\"spot on,\\" which is no surprise as the author is from that area.Some will not like the \\"preachiness,\\" but the author incorporated it into the storyline so well that I found it plausible.There are several scenes that had me holding my breath. One of the best written is when the three children are playing in Cat Shore Lake. I had to stop and dry my eyes before I could finish reading."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"When I received my copy of John Aubrey Anderson's debut novel, Abiding Darkness, in the mail I was really excited. Anyone who's an avid reader knows the history of excellent southern writers. It's a huge pair of shoes to have to walk in. I know I'm one of those southern writers still hoping to break into the market and have my own books on the self.Anderson does not disappoint with this haunting tale of angels and demons at work in the lives of some common folks of Mississippi. These are folks you know. They've been your neighbor. Maybe they still are. This is the tale of one headstrong child named Missy Parker along with family, friends and foes.It starts out innocently enough. Children at play. When suddenly some adults come on the scene and stir things up. Words and threats are exchanged. And then we're given a glimpse of the truth behind it all. Some unidentified individuals stand nearby watching. One announces to the other, 'It has begun'.And then things ramp up. As the truth of what that innocent little event really meant unfolds we realize something bad is happening in Cat Lake. Something evil. And it wants Missy Parker. The remainder of the story chronicles her life as she grows into a young adult. She lives, stumbles and learns. She lives, loves and looses.For me, one of the highlights of the story is Mose and Pip. A black couple, strong and wise, who are much like parents to Missy. They counsel and console. Teach and love. And at times reprimand.Abiding darkness is a story with heart and soul. You'll laugh and cry. Get scared out of your mind and anger will bubble. All at the guiding hand of this new and talented author John Aubrey Anderson. He has some profound things to teach us along the way. It's well worth your time to look into this novel, enjoy and learn all in the same sitting.A book like this is rare. Check out the sequel,Wedgewood Grey (The Black or White Chronicles #2), and the soon to be released third in the series,And If I Die (The Black or White Chronicles #3), also.REVIEWER'S NOTE: This review corrects typos and has additional info not available in a previous review I did under my old profile.

I have read some really good books but this book is FANTASTIC."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I have never read a novel with all the qualities that John Aubrey Anderson puts into \\"Abiding Darkness\\".It is a tale that starts in the Mississippi Delta of '45, with three adventurous children that soon end up in a maelstorm of a battle at Cat Lake. Missy Parker is the 7 year old princess that rules the roost and doesn't back down. Her older brother Bobby and their best friend Mose Jr. (Junior) try their best to keep her from too much trouble.The story begins by describing their idyllic world and the events that conspire to tear it apart. Thus begins a tale of heroism, hope, darkness and light. As Missy grows into her special destiny, forces beyond her understanding continue to influence her life, and the people around her.JAA does a simply amazing job in creating the world of AD. After reading it, I felt like I had grown up in the Deep South, instead of the desert of Idaho. He gives the characters a life and voice of their own, and they are compelling to follow through the events of the book.His storytelling is mastery. After the first 5 pages I was totally invested in the novel. By page 100 I was almost crying (in public) three times. I laughed out loud at other parts while reading it on a bus. He weaves in suspense and keeps your mind glued to the story, even when away from the book.He also manages to weave in spiritual themes that inspire, and truly sometimes chill you. The message in the book doesn't come across forced, but is a natural outgrowth of the heart of the characters. That is not an easy feat to accomplish.If you are looking for a wondrous story with powerful characters on the edge of danger, I can think of no other book that fits the bill. Mr. Anderson truly has earned my respect with the skill of his pen."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Abiding Darkness is one of the best debut novels I have read and John Aubrey Anderson should take a bow then please, quickly write some more!Life seems idyllic in the township surrounding Cat Lake. World War II is concluding, summer has arrived and three young children are doing what kids do~playing baseball until they drop. Missy Parker, a precocious seven year old, her older brother Bobby are spending the day with their best mate, Junior, the great-great-grandson of an African slave. They are unaware their world is about to be shattered by a pact made in the spiritual realm, their lives will hang in the balance and they will make promises which impact eternity.Thus beings an evocative tale set in the deep south of America which will remain with you long after you have read the final page. John Aubrey Anderson writes with a gifted pen, his words bring to the life this southern town and describes the lives of the white and black folk living and working at the Parker Cotton Gin with such clarity that I felt I was walking alongside Missy, kicking stones in the dirt. I could feel the sweat trickling down Mose Washington's face as he managed the Gin for Bobby Parker and my heart beat loudly as evil took on the face of French Bainbridge.I was hooked the moment I read the line on the first page, \\"The summer of '45 lied.\\" and Anderson does not disappoint in the remaining pages. He balances a wonderful story with glimpses of the spiritual powers at work, without making the characters pawns without purpose. He stays true to the realities of free will and the consequences resulting from the choices his characters make. The underlying message is clear without being overpowering. I certainly find myself pondering my response to this amazing book.Despite this being one of the first books I have read in 2007, I feel confidant saying Abiding Darkness will be on my top ten list for the year.............although there is the sequel, Wedgewood Grey, releasing this month!!"},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Abiding Darkness by John Aubrey Anderson is the first book in the Black or White trilogy. In 1945 Mississippi, 7-year-old Missy Parker is in charge, and everyone knows it. Especially her best friend Junior Washington, an 11-year-old black boy. You wouldn't expect a little girl to be a target for the forces of darkness, but there are lots of unexpected things happening at Cat Lake when Missy's around. Anderson does a terrific job of writing dialogue, especially capturing dialect without making it difficult to read. Conversations just flow across the page. He also has a way with a turn of phrase that brings charm and color to the story and makes Cat Lake feel just like home. It's filled with characters you would want to know and spend time with. I'm glad that this is just the first book, because I look forward to spending more time with them. Anderson's descriptions of the demons that haunt Missy and her family are chilling as are the scenes in which they attack. While many Christian books on the market are afraid to show God directly acting in characters' lives, this book shows the Lord taking a direct hand in their lives and letting them know it."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Imagine a Stephen King thriller if Stephen King were a man of faith!

I have read all three books in the series and loved that they follow this family through the years. I have given this book as gifts, and have recommended it to others many times."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Abiding Darkness, by John Aubrey Anderson, is a promising work of literary weight that's a wonderful period piece steeped in nostalgia and good old fashioned, Southern living. Told in a style reminiscent of Flannery O'Conner and other Southern writers, Abiding Darkness takes the 40's, 50's, and 60's and fleshes them out to real-life proportions, so much so you can smell the catfish roasting on the fire and hear the Temptations playing in the background. The characters are wonderful studies of simple, foundational living, and the narrative drawls in a uniquely Southern fashion, Anderson writing the character's dialogue as only a Southern writer could.The story follows the life of Missy Parker, a white girl who's been deemed \\"special\\" by dark and holy powers alike. Through her young life and through adulthood, Missy is unwittingly the center of a demonic and holy tug of war, as unseen, dark forces wage war against her; first in an effort to sway her soul, and forever after in an effort to hurt her and the ones she loves. Twice these forces claim the lives of those close to her, as two people she cares for sacrifice themselves for her.However, the dark forces that dog her every step are thwarted by the prayers of those close to her and Missy's own determined spiritual development. Also, beyond her ken and of those around her, an angelic host stands guard, making sure that God's special ones are not harmed by the Enemy's hand. The novel ends as a demonic and angelic forces clash once again, and the storyline leaves us expecting continued repercussions of the Cat Lake \`War of \`45'.The characters - Missy Parker, Mose Washington and Mose Jr., Bobby Lee Parker, David and Pat Patterson - are rich portraits painted by a writer clearly skilled at character development, and the narrative moves through time in a very \\"Forest Gump\\" sort of way - snapshots of crucial events are vignettes of strength and endurance, and there is the sense this would make a wonderful movie or even television miniseries. The story moves at its own pace; at life's pace, and Anderson does something many other writers have tried and failed - he creates a panoramic view of life, faith, and a friendship that exceeds both societal and racial boundaries.The only thing I had trouble with were the occasional \\"interruptions\\" of demonic forces as they plot Missy Parker's destruction, and the angelic hosts that guard them all. Though I understand the underlying motive and the story's central theme - how the forces of evil, the \\"abiding darkness\\", endures through time, and God's provision of protection against that darkness - these portions just didn't seem to mesh well with the rest of the story, for me, at least. In many ways, I felt the story would have been just as powerful - perhaps even better - if these moments were either meshed in with the story in a more subtle fashion, or left out all together. I believe the author's theme - that unseen, supernatural forces clash around us daily - would have still come through the story itself, even without these little asides.However, this in itself is not enough to detract from the overall quality of the novel, which has literary aspirations and for the most part doesn't fall short of them. Abiding Darkness is a promising, solid first entry into Anderson's trilogy, The Black & White Chronicles, and readers will eagerly welcome the second novel in the series, Wedgewood Grey, as a continuation of this rich tapestry of the Southern literary tradition. With this novel, Anderson has proven himself adept at setting the mood, establishing a convincing milieu, and creating a story that resonates with depth and meaning."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"It's been awhile since I've read such a powerful story it made me near-speechless. Abiding Darkness left me pondering how in the world I'd describe what made it such an awesome story...and coming up miserably short. Pinpointing one thing is impossible, so I'll list them all... or as many as I can without sounding long-winded. The only weakness in this book was occasional unnecessary head-hopping, but it wasn't enough to keep me from raving about it despite that one minor flaw.I'll start with what impacted me most. The spiritual honesty and depth in this book. The author takes many arguments used by non-believers and flushes them out through characters so real that you can see the wisdom of Christ in the uneducated men literally overshadowing the wisdom of the wise (by this world's standards). That alone makes this author a theological genius in my book. Plus he masterfully uses southern uneducated-sounding English and slang to bring out some good points.The sense of small-town community and the love between two cultures in the pre civil-rights era south is enough to make this book fantastic all by itself, but when he adds the spiritual mentoring it leaves readers...a bit breathless. Or choked up. I couldn't tell you how many times I was so caught up in the story my house could've been on fire and I wouldn't have noticed. My eyes blurred several times as I swallowed hard.Plus, there were many suspenseful moments. Many times I thought Missy would either be killed or raped and I held my breath as things played out. And so many people that she loved died, yet you could see how God used it all for His glory and how her losses started a chain of events that the enemy meant for evil, only to be turned upside down.

They built a boat and sailed on Cat Lake not knowing that demons were residing on the bottom of the water waiting for the right time to kill Missy. They inhabit the body of snakes and attack while Missy is alone on the boat.Junior, who came to Christ recently, saves her but before he dies from the venom, he asks his father Moses to help Missy find the Lord. She grows up a Christian and in collage dated Hull Dillworth, the leader of a Christian youth group. His outward purity hides his evil nature, making it easy for the demons to possess him.

David makes Missy promise to teach the Word to his unbeliever older brother Pat but his heart on the subject of God is closed mind. Pat wants her but resents the religion that he believes keeps them apart and only a miracle will change his mind.Readers who love the works of Frank Peretti will want to read ABIDING DARKNESS, Book One of The Black or White chronicles as the storyline is fast paced and exciting. The unseen supernatural angels and demons who work through humans add a mythical perspective to the plot.

The characters are drawn fairly well; at any rate, they're better than the pompous angels and demons who pop up every now and again to provide sonorous intonations on the action. The author has created a universe where everything is as it should be if party-line evangelicalism were true; everyone who disagrees with the Christians either caves in to its obvious superiority or becomes a demon puppet. For its few dubious strengths, the book in the end reads like a lengthy gospel tract clumsily stitched together with iffy action sequences. As Christian fiction, it's all right. As fiction, it's way below average."},{"Title":"Abiding Darkness (The Black or White Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"When I received my copy of John Aubrey Anderson's debut novel, Abiding Darkness, in the mail I was really excited. Anyone who's an avid reader knows the history of excellent southern writers. It's a huge set of shoes to have to walk in. I know I'm one of those southern writers still hoping to break into the market and have my own books on the self.Anderson does not disappoint with this haunting tale of angels and demons at work in the lives of some common folks of Mississippi. This are folks you know. They've been your neighbor. Maybe the still are. This is the tale of one headstrong child named Missy Parker along with family, friends and foes. It starts out innocently enough. Children at play. When suddenly some adults come on the scene and stir things up. Words and threats are exchanged. And then we're given a glimpse of the truth behind it all. Some unidentified individuals stand nearby watching. One announced, 'It has begun'.And then things ramp up. As the truth of what that innocent little event really meant unfolds we realize something bad is happening in Cat Lake. Something evil. And it wants Missy Parker. The remainder of the story chronicles her life as she grows into a young adult. She lives, stumbles and learns. She lives, loves and looses.For me, one of the highlights of the story is Mose and Pip. A black couple, strong and wise, who much like parents to Missy. They counsel and console. Teach and love.Abiding darkness is a story with my heart and soul. You'll laugh and cry. Get scared out of your mind and anger will bubble. All at the guiding had of this new author John Aubrey Anderson. He has some profound things to teach us along the way.

Unfortunately, the book appears to be badly in need of both editing and rewriting. The characters are wooden and ill-developed. To describe the dialog as stilted would be an insult to stilts everywhere. There are long periods between battle sequences and, said sequences really being the raison d'etre for the entire novel, it's very hard to care about the one dimensional characters whose misadventures and witless spoutings make up the bulk of the novel.There are books that you buy and put on your bookshelf to read and reread over the years. Then there are books that make you glad the library doesn't charge for it's services, because it would be a terrible waste to lay out good money for such atrocious reading. Sadly, this is one of the books in the latter category."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"&quot;Alternative history&quot; novels have developed nearly into a genre of their own, usually following military themes, and Robert Conroy steps into the realm of &quot;what if?&quot; with &quot;1901&quot;. Conroy takes what at first seems an outlandish premise---a German invasion of America at the dawn of the 20th century---and makes it believable. Historians, of which Conroy is one, know that Kaiser Wilhelm's government did indeed have contingency plans for such an invasion, and one can imagine that it could very well have happened after reading Conroy's plausible story.Readers of Harry Turtledove's &quot;Great War&quot; series will see many similarities in Conroy's work, including the use of many of the same historical characters, such as the ever-popular Theodore Roosevelt. Conroy also brings us Gen. Arthur MacArthur, father of Douglas and a formidable leader in his own right; James Longstreet, one of several old Confederate officers who come out of retirement to, ironically enough, save the Union; and even the inventor of the modern-day submarine.As good a read as &quot;1901&quot; is, Conroy isn't quite in Turtledove's league, which is nothing to be ashamed of. With the use of the series form, Turtledove is able to paint a richer picture of the period and develop his characters more deeply. Dealing as he is with events that span only a few months, Conroy must of necessity keep things moving at a fairly brisk pace, which gives the impression that his characterizations of real people like Roosevelt, Longstreet and Admiral Dewey, as well as his fictional characters like Major Mahan and a young German corporal, are somewhat shallow. We want to get to know these people better, but there's a war to be fought and Conroy has to get us back into the action. &quot;1901&quot; easily could've been mined for twice the material. Perhaps next time.The rapid pace of the book also requires the battle scenes to be lacking some depth. Whether it's an Apache scout ambushing two German soldiers or a massive sea battle between U.S. and German battleships, we get a whiff of the gunsmoke and a glimpse of the knife, but it's over quickly and we move on.Overall, though, it is a strong effort and I look forward to further work by this author. The realm of alternative history is rich with stories waiting to be told."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"To me, one of the great problems with alternative history is the lack of imagination. All too often, the novels of the genre begin with a divergence, usually involving the Civil War or World War II, and lead to a result that is not unfamiliar to a student of our history. In this respect, Robert Conroy's book is a refreshing change of pace with its intriguing premise: what if the German kaiser had decided to attack the United States in an effort to take over its recently acquired colonies? As ideas go, it is imaginative enough to be refreshing, yet plausible enough to work. Conroy follows this up with a believable plot that details the consequences of this decision on the world and on the cast of characters he assembles.Nevertheless, this is the limit of Conroy's achievement, as having avoided one pitfall he ends up stumbling into others. Though the plot is engaging the writing is not, as Conroy's insertion of details often gives passages the feel of a textbook. A similar problem exists with the characters; while his main hero and heroine are well fleshed out, the rest often come across as underdeveloped and stereotypical.The greatest problem with Conroy's novel, though, is its lack of respect for the historical background. Though this might seem counter-intuitive in a novel of alternative history, it is one of the keys to such a work -- its success in capturing a sense of the era that the book is set in. Yet Conroy seems uninterested in this. All too often he infuses his characters with more modern sensibilities (such as attitudes towards blacks and immigrant Germans) which no event could have created back then. Doing so robs them of their distinctive voice, and strong historical personalities such as Theodore Roosevelt seem to be little more than two-dimensional mouthpieces used to offer expositions on the plot. He also falls victim to name-dropping, introducing other famous figures no matter how implausible their participation in events might have been, apparently for no reason other than to give him an excuse to crowd his narrative with a \\"who's-who\\" of historical characters.As a consequence, the novel fails to live up to the promise of the plot. Readers drawn to the genre by the works of authors like Harry Turtledove will find Conroy's novel a pale imitation of their best efforts. Though entertaining in some respects, it lacks the vivid evocation of an alternate past that makes such books compelling reading. I only hope that other, better writers of the field will be inspired to make similar bold leaps of the imagination when defining \\"what might have been.\\""},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This is a very interesting alternative historical fiction story in the style of Harry Turtledove and others. From the 1870's until the start of WWI, the German General Staff had developed many campaign and battle plans. This one may be based on an actual plan as the author states, but never was executed because the German staff knew it was almost impossible to invade the USA and this is what gave Conroy the idea - What if they did !This is good escapist fiction and was a real page turner. Yes, some of the historical material may not be correct, but it does not affect the overall story line. Having studied military history, I enjoyed the way he developed the rapid advancements & changes the US Army were actually making at the conclusion of the Spanish American war and now accelerated due to the invasion by Germany.If you like Harry Turtledove's books, you will enjoy this one too from Robert Conroy."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"When I heard the idea of this book, I was very interested. It seemed like something that, while done even half-assedly, would still be very entertaining. I couldn't have been more wrong. The only reason that this book does not receive one star is because of the concept. There is a poorly developed love story and very poorly developed heroes and villains in this book. All in all I would have to recommend Meyer's A War Undone instead of this book."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This is an excellent book! It isn't the start of a series, like some authors are fond of writing, but a well-written, fast-paced and adventurous book that has a beginning, a middle, and an action-packed and satisfying end! Based on something that was actually planned by Imperial Germany, the air of genuine possibility sets this book apart from other alternate history books that are merely speculative. This was a story that really did come close to being reality and that makes the book all the more compelling. If you like history, this is a good book to read. If you like alternate history, as I do, this book should define the genre for you. I *HIGHLY* recommend this book and I recommend that when you're done with it you hang on to it and read it again and again!"},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This was a nicely thought out AH. At times, however, the characters seem a bit wooden - though this may be intentional on Conroy's part as an attempt to portray the times (someone said he was trying to match books of the time, along with just setting the action then).Unlike the many WWII-ish \\"Germany Invades the U.S.\\" stories, this one is actually believable, at least, from a technical plausibity standpoint. Germany isn't trying to conquer the place, just force some concessions. It's small navy can handle the U.S.'s even smaller one (split up in two oceans), and the fact that most of the U.S. Army is away in those newly held colonies makes the invasion's possibility much more believable. Heck, Germany really did have plans for such an invasion, should the need arise.Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"I read this because it was on someone's list of favorite Alternative History stories. However, people didn't talk like that then. Read some novels written around 1900 or some of TR's letters and the lack of historic flavor will be evident. Also the lack of patriotism is not credible. I doubt the state of New Jersey would fail to assist New York & Conn if they were indeed invaded. -- just one example."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This was the author'original foray into alternative history. While not a buff on this genre of fiction myself, a good, fun read is always worthwhile. 1901 is just that, an amusing premise and a fun read. Having read the author's recent 1862 novel I can discern obvious simularities. In both the US is taken by suprise by seemingly overwhelming enemies. The standard Pearl Harbor scenario applied to earlier periods. In both novels the US strikes back with unconventional tactics, weapons, and sheer determination and grit. Of course these prevail in the end and defeat the bad guys.While I liked the story, i did find the same problems with characters in this work as with 1862. Everyone acts too contemporary. Speech patterns are too modern, and behavior also seems out of context. In both novels there is a reluctant hero who is seduced by a sexually aggressive femme. Conroy seems to like sexually dominant women who were not the norm for their time. In 1901 we have the usual ethnics of various sorts thrown in for political correctness purposes. Thus we have token blacks and Indians all raising hell with the evil Germans.In the German ranks we have the usuall sensitive doubters who do not agree with the Nazi like attitudes of the Kaiser's army. That is another problem with this book. The Kaiser comes off too much like Hitler, and the German army of 1901 seems to act awfully much like the Wehrmacht of WW2! As another reviwer claimed, the Kaiser was an egoist, but not a monster. I like the clever use of historical characters in different alternative settings. This is the true shock value of this genre and Conroy does well with it here. Having not read many other books of this nature I am not able to make any critical comparisons. I do feel the Germans were vilified and made to look like Nazi's for the most part. Of course the author has to do this in order to create the suspense required for the story.The required romance was not too distracting, and overall there was less sex in this novel than in 1862. The plot moves quickly, and the numerous events related are all pretty rapidly covered. The action scenes are good, but a bit standard in their approach. Still, I found 1901 to be a fun, entertaining read. More than this can't really be expected in works of this nature. To expect greater sophistication takes away from the premise in the first place. This is a work of fiction and alternate history. Readers should not expect any more than this. I wonder where Mr. Conroy will strike next with his alternative history theme. This will be interesting to see."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"As a big fan of the alternate history novel, I sat down to read \\"1901\\" with eager anticipation for a new author in a new period.What a disapointment. And I mean a major disapointment. Those who compare it to Turtledoves \\"Guns of the South\\", have got to be kidding. \\"The Guns of the South\\" is one of the best (if not the best ) novel of this gendre, with deep historical research on period, charactors and the military tactics and technology of the era.The dialog in Turtledove's classic was not only believable and conformed to period usages but was good dialog in a dramatic sense as well.Robert Conroy's book, \\"1901\\", aims at these heights but falls far short. The charactors are not particularly interesting. The diaolg fails to be true to the period and even worse is not very believable. Overall, if \\"Guns of the South\\" is 5 stars then this book rates one star, not even in the same class.All those literary shortfalls could be forgiven, if we got lots of rip-roaring battle scenes and lots of dramatic tension. But other then one or two decent short episodes of action, the rest of the battles are few and in between the book slows to a crawl. It was a \\"page turner\\" alright - I kept flipping pages to see when the action would get going again.All the major moves are telegraphed and there are no serious surprises or even a plot twist or two. There is no sense of a building of tension or a even a real climax to the book. In the end, the enemey (the dirty \\"Krouts\\"), just seems to fold up and convieniently die, right on cue.It's nice to see the good guys win, but it would be nicer if they did it on their own (without almost miraculous intervention by the British or the bad guys brains suddenly turning to cheeze-dip).I gave this novel two stars rather then one because I felt the author has some promise - it was a really good idea and he has the basic pieces assembled for a great story - it just needed some heavy editing and re-writing."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Because he's upset that the United States won't give Germany the Philippine Islands, the Kaiser decides to invade Long Island. The plan is that German forces will land and stay in the US until we agree to give the Philippines to Germany or the Kaiser's face turns blue, whichever happens first. Why wouldn't the Germans just invade the Philippines to begin with? Might as well imagine the Confederacy trying to win the Civil War by occupying India until the British agree to help the CSA."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"901 is an alternative history novel that explores the possibility of the Kiaser's Germany invading the US for her overseas colonies. Namely Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, recently conquered islands from the Spanish-American War.Unlike many American wars, Germany would have invaded US territory in order to gain the peace treaty that ceded such Islands to the German Empire. European nations are used to fighting wars in this manner. They create a crippling blow to their nemesis, not to conquer, but to dictate a surrender treaty. Whereas the United States typically conquered what they attacked, IE Cuba during the war with Spain or the Southern states reunification after the Civil War. Though it was desired, a single battle that led to Richmond did not win the war of brothers.I find the clash of concepts over the art of war very intriguing. I also did enjoy the book very much. The story contains great historical potential as the Kiaser did very much desire an overseas empire and those pesky Americans with their Monroe Doctrine were quite the nuisance.Thus it was a call for war. As the Germans strike at an unsuspecting New York, the heart of the American economy, newly sworn president, Theodore Roosevelt, will have to endure and find a way to victory alongside with Confederate General Longstreet and recently promoted Brigadier General Patrick Mahan.The historical prospects of this book are incredibly plausible. I have no trouble believing in the Kiaser's villainy for global dominion; though at the same time Germany knows not to provoke England and her massive royal navy. Attacking an aging navy from the American Civil War is quite a way to test out one's new modern navy on the other hand. Which is something the Kiaser was also in desperate need to accomplish.Through most of the book, the well trained German soldiers are winning the war and in their final push to crush the rag-tag militias the US managed to muster, the real American Army finally returned from occupying the Philippines so that they may kick the Germans off the continent. Quite a riveting part of the novel if I do say so myself.The only problems I really had with the book were the fallacies of the post war Germany. Apparently the populous were so infuriated with all the lives that have been sacrificed for a losing war that they overthrew the monarch and replaced it with the parliament. Though I do not doubt civilian unrest, I do not believe that they would have had the dedication or leadership to rise up against the militant monarch. Yes, at the end of World War I, this was possible, but that was after four years of war that costs millions, not one year of an oversea war that cost thousands of lives. In addition to this, the new chancellor and de facto ruler of Germany makes outrageous claims of conquering East Europe and using the Jews as a scapegoat for losing the war with America. Obviously a parallel to Hitler's beliefs, but it was only Hitler who thought this way. Throughout the novel, the statesmen seemed like an advocate of democracy, not fascism. Besides, Hitler was not against the monarch, but very much for a Kiaser to rule Germany. By this point of the novel it just seemed as though the author wanted to foreshadow the Second World War by using his own brand of Nazis. Unfortunately, the ideologies of Hitler were typically so outrageous and complex, that the average statesman would not think of such things. After all, Hitler was a soldier first and then a somewhat elected official in the absence of the monarch, not the other way around as the book portrays it.Other than that, the book is a good read. Some of the love stories may be generic and too simplified to care for, but it didn't bother me too much. The book is not that large and stories about the brigadier general and the Dutch aristocrat, or the German-American soldier and the Irish Molly may have taken away from the novel if these romances were taken to a deeper depth. Overall I would give this novel three and half stars out of five."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"A simple, fast moving, uncomplicated approach to a very interesting premise.

He portrays an unprepared turn of the 20th century United States struggling to dislodge a crack German army that has invaded New York and Connecticut. Although not Nazis, these Germans are not very nice people and one wonders where a sequel would take their nation (the ending gives a strong hint).

The battles on land and at sea are very exciting and entertaining and in my opinion are the best parts of the book.There were, however, a couple things I did not like about the book. First of all, every character swears and curses like there's no tomorrow (although there might not be with Germany invading), which just doesn't seem to fit the time period. Granted most characters are military men, but the foul language is a bit over used. Secondly, I think a more plausible start to the war would have been at the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898(?) when the German Asiatic Squadron had the opportunity to attack and (unless Britain intervened)destroy America's forces in the Philippines. Instead, Conroy opted for Kaiser Wilhelm make the decision a few years later when America would be quite able to oppose a foreign invasion (although Conroy's timeline does afford Germany the time to assemble a large invasion force).In conclusion, if you like military history, I think you will enjoy this book, if not immensely, then at least a great deal."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Alternative history has become a relatively popular genre, often based on alternative outcomes in wars. This competently written and plotted book is based on the implausible premise that Germany invades the USA in an effort to confiscate the American gains of the Spanish-American War. Conroy seems to know his American history very well and does a pretty good job of constructing a story involving well known (politicians like Teddy Roosevelt) and not so well known (important figures in the contemporary American armed forces, now largely forgotten)figures in our recent past. Conroy develops a major theater of war in New York and Connecticut and develops a realistic warfare scenario. This war anticipates many features of WWI, just as the Russo-Japanese War did. As is often the case with these books, part of the pleasure is looking for what amounts to insider jokes in the form of displays of historical erudition. In this book, some famous figures like Douglas MacArthur, William Halsey, and Ernest King make cameo appearances as young men. Conroy does less well in his treatment of Imperial Germany, which was a semi-democracy and not quite the authoritarian state implied here. A enjoyable read. This book is comparable in construction to almost any of Harry Turtledove's similar books and arguably better written."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"I'm generally not into alternate history stories, but being interested in naval history, was intrigued enough to purchase the book. The fact that the Germans had considered landing troops in North America and had sent spies to the US to scout out possible landing sites (which was mentioned in Robert K. Massie's \\"Castles of Steel\\")made the story more plausible (also, the fact that during the Spanish-American War Admiral Dewey had had a run-in with the Germans- who hoped to snap up the Philippines from the defeated Spanish- made the premise more believable). I had previously read Massie's \\"Dreadnought\\" and felt that Mr. Conroy accurately depicted German leaders like Kaiser Wilhelm and Von Bulow. I also enjoyed reading the description of the naval battles.However, my biggest beef with the book was that the author takes no trouble to depict how the Germans could overcome the obstacles to carrying out such a task. He simply has the German invasion fleet magically appear off New York City. The Germans in reality would have several difficulties in such an operation. For one thing, their fleet was designed for operations in the North Sea, and as a result their ships lacked the range of those in other navies (for example, the battleship USS Oregon had a range of 5,500 miles at 10 knots; the latest German battleship Kaiser Frederich III only had a range of 3,420 miles at the same speed). This, combined with a lack of forward bases, meant a battle fleet would have a hard time reaching the US. Also, considering the ships of the day burned coal, refueling at sea would be very time consuming although they could do what the Russian Baltic Fleet did on it's way to Tsushima (during the Russo-Japanese War) and simply overload the ships with coal. Even still, the fleet would have been running on fumes (or coal dust by the time they reached New York. Nor does the author reveal how the German invasion fleet could have avoided detection. After leaving their bases, the Germans would sail through the North Sea and enter the North Atlantic either through the English Channel or by making the passage between Iceland and Scotland. Thus by the time they reached the Eastern seaboard of the US, they would have passed through several major shipping lanes. The idea that an invasion force of the size depicted in the book could travel all that distance with no one being the wiser stretches credulity. I could also mention the fact that even if the invasion force had successfully landed, they would face a logistics nightmare, with a supply line 5,000 to 6,000 miles long that the US Navy would have no problem cutting. Another thing I found hard to believe was that while Britain provided covert assistance, they refrained fom direct involvement because they were still wrapping up the Boer War. Baloney- the Royal Navy at the time could have swept the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet) from the seas with one arm tied behind its back and not even broken a sweat).All these factors are probably why the Germans never carried out their plan. Still the idea makes for an interesting story, which is why I was so disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Most people realize that an alternative history novel (just like a Science Fiction novel) requires some ability, on the part of the reader, to suspend one's disbelief. A good, well written, story assists the reader in doing this. For me this is the hallmark not only of a good story but also a good writer. In the case of Robert Conroy's 1901: A Novel, the premise behind the story certainly was engaging enough (a punitive German invasion of the United States in the aftermath of the Spanish American War) for me to pick this up from the $1 bin at my local used book seller. Not expecting great literature (it was in the $1 bin for crying out loud) I assumed that the subject matter would keep me reading... however, the execution by the author, Conroy, failed to deliver on the promise.In other alternative history books that Conroy has written, he is praised for his historical research. However based on the conclusions that he drew from his \\"research\\" for this title I am highly suspicious of this praise for his other works. In the first two chapters Conroy sets the tone for 1901 by claiming that Germany had the second largest fleet (the largest belonging to Great Britain) in 1901. Regardless how you measure Germany's fleet, it wasn't just far behind Great Britain's at this point in history, but also the French Fleet and (prior to its destruction by the US Navy in the Spanish American War) possibly the Spanish Navy as well. Furthermore although the Imperial German Navy was a force to be reckoned with during the First World War (technically, organizationally and manpower-wise) in 1901 Kaiser Wilhelm II (and Admiral Tirpitz) was just embarking on their project to build a first class navy to rival his Grandmother Victoria's Royal Navy.As I said in the opening of this review, alt-history requires some ability to suspend one's disbelief so if you can forgive Conroy's shoddy research on this point, his portrayal of Wilhelm as some kind of Hitler-esque villain and the Imperial German Army (and by extension the entire German nation) as mindless Nazis strains my disbelief faculties to the breaking point. In the post World War II world, it is easy to pick on the poor Germans. Hitler is the personification of evil and Conroy uses our own bias to create a cartoon like villain that will play upon our sympathies without having to work to hard to develop a real set of circumstances or characters to be the \\"bad guys\\" for the novel.This is especially problematic when the French make a much better villain during this time period. The French still have a jealousy/dislike of Britain (still true in 1939 and probably so today as well) that dates back to when Angles, Franks, Saxons and Celts fought over the British Isles. France had a powerful navy which rivaled Britain's for most of the 19th century (and was certainly the second largest in 1901) not to mention that the French had overseas colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas. However, there is some historical basis for German animosity towards the US in the wake of the Spanish American War (the German Navy and Dewey's Asiatic Fleet almost coming to blows after the Battle of Manila Bay as well as incidents in Samoa in the late 1880s).Given these first two strikes I have to give props to Conroy for his use of former American Civil War generals as commanders for the US Army in 1901. This was certainly the case with two of the Spanish American War's more successful commanders Joe Wheeler and Fitzhugh Lee (who were both Confederate Generals during the American Civil War). Also, I believe that Conroy's \\"rehabilitation\\" of General James Longstreet (General Lee's right hand man after Stonewall Jackson died) in 1901 pre-dates most of the Longstreet apologetic histories that have come out in the last several years.However, having these Generals use expletives like the sergeants who pushed me through my own basic training in the 1980s stretches credibility beyond the breaking point again. It is almost as if Conroy believes that all Southerners are rednecks, trailer trash or worse. I am certain that the modern \\"lost cause Confederate gentlemen\\" school of thought is just as flawed, but these generals were the aristocracy of the time and while they probably did swear they most certainly did not use modern expletives.So if you consider that a 0-2 foul ball, the final strike against Conroy's work comes in his portrayal of the British Admiralty as scared of the \\"mighty\\" Imperial German Navy. To the point where they let the entire German fleet (auxiliaries and all) sail into the North Atlantic bound for an invasion of the United States, unchecked, unmolested and almost unconcerned (yes, the British provide some covert assistance to the US) is simply a \\"wave of the hand\\" to make the story work.Couple this with uneven writing (which should have been fixed by the editor) and the melodramatic love story that seems like a tack on (to what purpose I am uncertain, because those scenes feel \\"Harlequin Romance Novel\\" to me) and this book is probably a 1 1/2 star book on my shelf. Conroy's authorship suffers when compared to Turtledove (the later is very good at writing character descriptions) and even though I liked (and related to) the main character, Patrick Mahan, Conroy's characterizations are quite one-dimensional and cardboard.So what is the bonus star for (note: I'd rate the book 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed)? Well, I think the premise of 1901 is interesting, if you strip away most of the \\"junk\\" noted above, there are some pretty decent short stories here -- which may have been how this book came about (a series of short stories or ideas by the author). With a little imagination and some better research this could have easily been a good read. As it is, the story wasn't much more than a cheap and partially entertaining way to spend a late evening plane flight."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This novel can best be described as a tall, cold glass of Harry Turtledove Light. All the elements are there, but a lack of historical research keeps this work from being truly great. That being said, the Alternate Reality genre will always welcome a great first effort novel like 1901. I have been a fan of this genre since I read a barbershop copy of the Man in the High Castle almost 30 years ago, and at times it was almost impossible to find any projects in this category. Mr. Conroy is certainly no Harry Turtledove, but he has put together a good read and managed to tap into a previously unexplored hiccup in American history, namely our turn-of-the-20th-century stumbling onto the world stage of politics and diplomacy. I would like to see more from Mr. Conroy, possible a second novel set in his \\"1901 universe\\". Ignore negative criticsm of this work, if you are a fan of the genre it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"As a first novel, 1901 is a good read. I thought the premise was unique and that's what prompted me to pick it up. The problem is that with alternate history it's all in the details and the possibility that one action could follow another. He starts off very well, but seems to get lost half-way though and loses that sense of possibility and just forces events to get to the end of the story. For example, if your army is pretty much surrounded and your supplies have been destroyed and your 3000 mile supply line is cut, that's when you sue for peace, not make a fullout assault. As for the details, his descriptions of New York would have been more accurate with a map -- The main character somehow crosses back and forth from Brooklyn to Manhattan and back, but it's not explained how he gets past the forces assembled on either side. The Lower East Side of Manhattan is over 2 miles from the Harbor so you couldn't observe from there. You have a great view from Downtown. I can't imagine a general taking off for a week to get married in the middle of assembling an army. Details and possibility got lost in 1901, but if he writes another novel I'll give him another try."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Conroy manages to take a single premise, what if the GermanReich of Wilhelm II went to war with the United States togain its newly acquired colonial territories, and weaves agreat book. While the plot is a fairly straightforwardtelling of the story of the war and its effect on a fewpeople, he interweaves so much of the American history ofthe early 20th Century into the book that, at each turn,you find yourself wondering who will turn up next.Conroy uses a number of points of view on both the Americanand the German side to tell the tale of the war. He alsotells it on high and low levels. We get to see the warfrom the seats of power in the White House and in theGerman Chancellery as well as from the ground. Conroy givesa story that ends entirely too soon. I found myself wantinga lot more detail and a lot more story. Simply, I wantedthe book to last longer than it did, so I could savor it allthe more. If you like alternate histories, along the linesof Harry Turtledove's &quot;The Guns of the South,&quot; you will likethis book."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"With all of the books out there that write alternate history from some obvious point of diversion, this one was a welcome change. Conroy takes the premise that Kaiser Wilhelm II, eager to expand his empire and demonstrate the power of his German Empire, tried to bully the United States into surrendering its gains from the Spanish-American War. The U.S., although unprepared for war against a first-rate European power, tells the Kaiser to choke on his schnitzel. Germany then sets into motion a war plan that they actually did draw up in real life, using their powerful navy to send an army across the Atlantic and attack New York.After a series of initial defeats at the hands of the powerful German army, the U.S. stabilizes the front, and likely gets a huge break when President McKinley dies, making Theodore Roosevelt the new President. Roosevelt appoints the aged James Longstreet as overall commander, and quietly orders the U.S. Regular Army (then busy fighting Aguinaldo in the Philippines in real life) back home. The U.S. Navy tricks the Germans into a battle on the high seas, where the U.S. ships were at an advantage. The German Army responds with an attack toward Boston, but are crushed by the arrival of the Regulars. The Americans get into the German rear at New York, cutting off the attackers and forcing a mass surrender.The book ends with the Kaiser going into exile 17 years early, and an ominous note for the future, as two members of the new German leadership discuss blaming the defeat on the Jews, agree that Germany should focus on expansion in Europe, instead of colonies, and toast the coming of a \\"Third Reich.\\" The U.S., flush with its second decisive defeat of a European power in three years, agrees on plans to build up its standing army. There's a sequel here if Conroy ever wanted to write it.There are some minor factual inaccuracies, but the plot as a whole is very plausible and believable. The Germans were this arrogant and overconfident, and always did underestimate the United States. The U.S. would have been unprepared for war, but would have stood a good chance to win if they held on long enough to consolidate their resources. And this is a plan that the Germans apparently considered carrying out at one time; all it would have taken was a word from their notably unstable Kaiser."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Unfortunately, although it starts on a good note, with intriguing international premises, the book gets pretty quickly under \\"nobody can beat US because we are US\\" spell.

As a gun buff, I recognized many of the arguements related to single shot vs repreaters.Many people compared this book to Turtledove. I thought this was more realistic than Turtledove (and to be quite blunt, I have tired of his prose and his predictable approach to things).Alternate history books can be either really cheesy or pretty good. 1901 falls into the latter category.Finally, I could not help but draw the similarities described in this book to the current War on Terror. We have a president, facing a peace-at-any-price crowd at home and a seemingly intractable foe bent on a murderous agenda. The copyright on this book is 1995!

And in 1901 the US military, both army and navy, did not appear the equal of anybody on the other side of the Atlantic. Certainly not in the eyes of those people who were actually on the other side.Other reviews have explained the actual storyline well, I'll simply add that the world of alternate history is made up of very many common stones and very few real gems. 1901 is a gem."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Alternative history has always intrigued history buffs and 1901 presents one of the most illogical premises imaginable; a German invasion of the U.S.A. in 1901.

The European ideas of war vs. the New World ideas of war at the turn of the last century are also interesting to view.Scenes of naval combat, the torn landscape of trench warfare and the horror, and the cost, of war is used to bring some reality to what might seem like a clean, super-fast string of events.

Also, even more predictable - the evil nasty europeans and the courageous \\"underdog\\" of the US overcoming the treacherous attack and \\"blowing the bad guys away\\". I mean - come on ! Not only do we have American cinema giving credit to U.S. forces for things they never did - like the U-571 movie where brave American marines dealt with cruel nasty nazis and recovered the enigma machine. The only thing was, it was BRITISH mariners and the Americans where nowhere in the region. At this rate, we in europe fully expect the movie of Alexander the Great's humble beginnings in downtown Statten Island, or the tale of the Bostonian Julius Casear's rise to glory.And so it is with alternate history. Without exception, American authors build up American opponents then knock them down by American grit, gung ho and chutzpah (whatever that means !) So many Americans have this ludicrous notion that they have always been a super power, and if I hear once more about how a bunch of plucky American farmers beat the Brits for independance, I'll scream. What about the French that contributed in a not-exactly-small way ? What about the fact it was essentially german mercenaries NOT the British Army who had other things on their palte at the time ?Regardless, I digress. I am giving the impression I didnt enjoy this. I did think it enjoyable, but oh, so predictable !Oh and one last thing - I agree about the fact the Germans of the time weren't the strutting SS that came later, but nor where they big cuddly teddy bears - ask the French who had been invaded by them 1871.

Conroy sketches his characters with obvious delight (his portraits of Teddy Roosevelt and ex-rebel James Longstreet are memorable). Since Conroy sometimes gives us background on a historical character, and sometimes does not, a knowledge of history wouldn't hurt in reading this novel. Still, the plot does tend to drag in the middle, though it perks up a bit towards the end with the major battle scene (in of all places. Connecticut).In the model of Turtledove's \\"The Guns of the South\\", though not as good. Still, it is well worth reading.Recommended."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the premise of this book quite a bit. Kaiser Wilhelm is a villian of history to begin with, and the early autocratic Germany was portrayed very well. The post Spanish-American war America also seemed to fit in well with the history classes I have taken. What I did wish for is more plot development. The obligatory love story could be shifted to the margins in order to more fully develop the German army and naval service. I would have loved to see more detail of the tactics of both sides, especially the different philosophies behind the new battleships. All in all, a good quick read, and I will look forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Conroy starts with an interesting premise, set in a fascinating period which has not received much attention. Unfortunately, within a few pages the errors of fact and atmosphere begin to mount up.On introducing the Bavarian private Ludwig Weber, the principal German character, we are told he belongs to the implausibly-named \\"kaiser's Imperial 4th Rifles\\" - it's not terribly difficult to track down an actual Bavarian regiment (Koenigreich-Bayern 4. Infanterie-Regiment, for example?!).More to the point, the dialog doesn't come across as authentic - a little more reading around late-19th c. American lit might have suggested to Conroy that the favorite oath of well-bred American gentlemen in the period was not an Anglo-Saxon term for manure.Naturally, the Germans must be cast as the bad guys, but I couldn't help thinking as I read it that one might just as well substitute Wells' Martians for Conroy's cardboard-cutout squarehead automatons in pickelhube helmets.In short, Conroy began with an interesting idea, but in the end his book is spoiled by a lack of research, both as regards the technical military details but more importantly the ambience of dialog, character and zeitgeist."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Conroy represents an interesting concept here but with a horrible storyline, cookie cutter characters, and horrible writing. It was entertaining but I wouldn't reccomend it if your looking for a great book."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This is a review of the Kindle edition. If you want a review of the content of the book there are plenty on here. I'll say I'm a big fan of alternative history, such as Harry Turtledove. In that genre I found this book to be an entertaining read. While the majority of reviewers give low reviews because of inaccuracies, or perceived inaccuracies. I was formally a history major in college, before leaving to join the military, although I don't consider myself to be a historical tyrant; although, there are some inaccuracies which I believe should have been corrected (such as mentioning that all of Germany's major ports are on the Baltic Sea, and then listing Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, and Bremerhaven; which are all on the North Sea. All in all though, none of the mistakes were significant enough to ruin the story for me. This is a historically based fiction, and one about an event which never actually happened, not a history book or fiction about an actual historical event. Nitpicking over inaccuracies in a book such as this would be similar to complaining that man and dinosaur never coexisted when talking about The Flintstones. Overall I found it to be an entertaining, if slightly slow at times, book. And as most historical fiction books do, sent me of a scavenger hunt, of sorts, to determine where fact separated from fiction (in this case exploring the lives of some of the historical figures used). To me this is the main purpose of historical fiction.As to the Kindle edition... The biggest issues I had with this book on Kindle is that it is not as well organized as others I've bought on Kindle. I don't know if it's the fault of the publisher, or if it didn't properly download onto my Kindle (I'm a fairly new Kindle user as still learning all of it's features and abilities). As the point of view character changes within a chapter there is no break in the text. This means while reading you can go from New York City to Berlin without realizing it or giving yourself a quick \\"break\\" to mentally transition between characters and places. I found this to be distracting, and would occasionally have to reread a paragraph once I realized that the change had taken place to mentally put myself in the new characters mindset, location, emotion, etc.Also the book is published as one big chapter, meaning that you can not use the directional control to skip from one chapter to another. Additionally positions are not noted at the bottom of the Kindle page. Combined this can make it difficult to find your way back to where you left off reading if you accidentally skip a few pages ahead or back while carrying the Kindle without pulling up the screensaver or if you purposely skip around the book to look up previous passages.Finally, the only image in the book is a map of the New York City and Connecticut area (which is where the \\"war\\" takes place). This image is incredibly small on the kindle and cannot be zoomed in on without becoming so fuzzy and pixelated that you cannot tell what you are looking at. As a note to this, if you go to the Amazon page for the hard cover edition and click on \\"look inside\\", by scrolling up from the first page of chapter one you can see the map, although that doesn't help if your computer is not readily available while reading.Overall, the biggest disappointment with this book was the format it was sent to my Kindle. If the above noted errors could be corrected it would have been a much more enjoyable read for me. The story itself was entertaining, and an interesting take on a subject that has not been covered by any other author that I am aware of."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"One of the reviewers called this the best of the series.

The writing is uninteresting, his characters are shallow (many of them are cliche) and he did not fully do his research on history. In the beginning of his book he calls the USS Texas ancient when at this time the ship was about six years old. There were other glaring errors but his writing is the biggest reason I wouls recommend all to avoid this book. It is a pity that there is not great author in the genre that really stands out.If you like Harry Turtledove and Eric Flint then you will love this book.

Robert Conroy makes his characters come alive, and his images are impressive (especially the burning of Manhattan, and the initial German landing that results in the massacre of American civilians). Germany's brutal treatment of the civilian population - a historical fact borne out by its actions in conquered territories during World Wars I & II - gives the story a passion that has you rooting for the Kaiser's defeat. Anyone who enjoys alternate historical fiction will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"&quot;1901&quot;, Robert Conroy's first (and, so far, only) novel, is a suprisingly well written, well thought-out work. It isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it is a very good and entertaining alternate history that deals with a very original divergence point. In 1901 Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, desiring a colonial empire to rival England and France, and angered by the USA's refusal to sell their newly acquired colonies from Spain, launches an invasion at New York. As the United States has almost little or no standing army in the country, and Germany has the largest and best army in the world, it becomes clear that the United States may very well lose this war.Conroy does pretty well with his divergence. It's plausible, which is the golden rule of alternate history. Conroy makes the reader believe that there could have been German troops wandering around Brooklyn and Manhattan, and portrays convincingly a U.S. government, led by Theodore Roosevelt, desperately trying to fight off these very aggressive, very professional invaders. Conroy is also particularly effective in evoking images underlining the brutallity of war. Men are mowed down, heads explode, bodies break, soldiers scream, and cities burn. Essentially, Conroy creates a microcosm of the First World War on American soil.Conroy also gives a pretty wide set of view-points. He criss-crosses from New York, to Washington D.C., to Berlin, and back again. His protagonist, Patrick Mahan, is thrust into an overwhelming situation, leading a rag-tag brigade of German- and African-American troops, while finding true love. Ludwig Weber wonders why he has come from Germany to this strange country in the service of a ruler he believes insane. TR gnashes his teeth, trots around enthusastically, while managing to hold the country together. Kasier Wilhelm gnashes teeth, asserts his greatness, and constantly demands reassurances from his council, none of whom really are loyal to their ruler.Conroy is also suprisingly good at maintaining suspense. We care about the characters by and large, and the fact that they could die keeps the reader on his/her toes. More importantly, Conroy builds his suspense by rewriting history. Initially when I began reading, I was convinced the U.S. would win. But as the book progressed, I wasn't so sure, particularly given the one-sided quality of the events. And regardless of who won, the ultimate consequences on the world would be amazing.Conroy does have some clunky passages, and some of his plot lines are cliched. Not all of his characters are a well defined as they could be. The kaiser in particular seems a little cartoony (in all fairness to Conroy, every biographical essay, text, etc. suggests that Willy had no depth). However it is a first novel, and these problems are easily overlooked. Conroy's novel is simply entertaining and enjoyable. It's a shame it is out of print five years after publication, as it would be an obvious book for DelRey or some other such publisher of alternate history to snap up. I also hope Conroy continues writing books, as he does have a great deal of skill and craft that just needs to be refined. The overall quality of &quot;1901&quot; is proof of that."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This is an \\"Alternate History\\" story based on factual plans of the German Army to invade the US that were never used. Believablity is added to the story by the fact that the US Atlantic Squadron conducted manuvers in the Caribbean and South Atlantic each summer while the rest of the navy showed the flag around the world.The story is told through several characters including Teddy Roosevelt. I found some of the characters to be lacking but others were well done, I especially like the German soldiers and the German politican Holstein. However, Conroy overuses the ploy of putting old conferate generals back into uniform to \\"whip them damn-yankee Germans\\".There is a great deal of military information but unfortunetly much of it is wrong. The Germans are in Feldgrau when in fact it was not adopted by the German army until 1910. The US soldiers are in blue despite the US Army having issued khaki field uniforms since 1898. Conroy also has the US soldiers armed with single shot \\"Trapdoor\\" rifles despite the magazine-fed Krag Rifle having been first issued in 1895. By 1901 the Krag equiped the US Regular Army and many National Guard regiments.Conroy's information on the US Navy is very good but he has the German navy about twice it actual size for 1901. In the book it is claimed to be second only to the British when it was smaller than the French and Russian fleets and equal to the US Navy. Per the 1905 Jane's Fighting Ships in mid-1901 the US Navy had 9 battleships, 2 armored crusiers, 6 large monitors, 6 protected crusiers (armored decks but no side armor) and a number of light crusiers and gunboats. The German's had 9 battleships, one armored crusier. 8 coast defence ships and 6 protected crusiers with many smaller ships. The four battleships of the Brandenberg class were slow, shortranged and with an inadequate secondary battery. The five Kaiser class battleships had a good secondary battery but only four 9.4 main guns (second rate size)The coast defence ships were very slow, shortranged, unstable and with a useless secondary battery of only six 3.5\\" guns. Going against the US Navy would have been risky business.The story lacks an dramatic incident to trigger the crisis, relying instead on the convoluted \\"logic\\" of the Kaiser to start the war. It is also difficult to believe that the Germans could assemble a large invasion fleet then sail through the North Sea and across the Atlantic in total secrecy. This is made less believeable when in the story the scope of British intelligence is more fully revealed.Nevertheless, it was a good read and did succeed in capturing some flavor of the period. I especially enjoyed the description of \\"Fightin\\" Bob Evans taking on a German crusier squadron with a lone US battleship. The ambush of a German battalion by Gen. Fred Funston was also very well done. It is not in the class of Morris's \\"Theodore Rex\\" or Massey's \\"Dreadnaught\\" but it is a worthwhile addition to the period."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"My thanks to Peter Hobson for pointing out that I wrongly said \\"Juggernaut\\" for \\"Dreadnought.\\" As he rightly suspects, all reviews can be at risk for errors, including his own. The author of \\"Dreadnought\\" is Robert (not Richard) K. Massie.I was looking forward to reading Conroy's book. I bought it after reading Massie's book, about the British and German naval buildups leading to the First World War, and Hannah Pakula's, \\"An Uncommon Woman,\\" about Empress Vicky, the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm. Some years ago, I had read \\"The Kaiser and His Court,\\" a memoir by one of the Kaiser's admirals. Although the Victorian era is not my chief interest, I spent two years giving guided tours in a Victorian mansion and learned more about the customs of that day.Conroy has obviously read \\"Dreadnought\\" as well, and including Count von Holstein as a sinister presence was an interesting touch. I enjoyed the battle scenes, and it was an interesting reversal to have Halsey die in the book's Battle of the Atlantic.Having said all that, I had to struggle to finish the book because it was so irritating. Whatever Conroy has read about social customs and manners of that day, he has forgotten. This wouldn't matter so much if he stuck to writing about battles, but he insists on including a romance between an officer and an heiress. People like Conroy are a reason why snobs are snobs. The man is tone-deaf about the behavior of anyone who doesn't hang out at pool halls. If he wrote a story about the British Royal Family, he would have the Queen addressing her husband as \\"Phil.\\"Conroy's heiress receives a male caller unchaperoned and even lets him move in as a house guest. Her visitor, a college-educated man, is surprised to find that the Schuyler family is as prominent as it is and that it goes back so far in American history. He refers to her servants as \\"hired hands,\\" answers her in the negative at one point by saying \\"Naw,\\" and uses words like \\"lingo.\\" When they decide to get married, they have trouble locating a Protestant chaplain, so they use a Catholic priest, who willingly complies.In terms of how middle and upper class people actually behaved 100 years ago, this is ridiculous beyond belief. Conroy might as well write a novel in which Woodrow Wilson leaves the White House every Saturday night, goes to a jazz club in a poor part of Washington, and plays the piano with a group of black musicians. When his first wife dies, he marries a woman who is noted advocate of open marriage and, since his Presbyterian minister is ill, has the ceremony performed by a rabbi who happens to be a good friend.I know this is meant as a novel of military history, but it is Conroy himself who insists on including a romance, and he gets it wildly wrong. His notions of how the other half lives evidently come from \\"The Inquirer\\" or Jerry Springer. Find the battle sections of the book and skip the rest. And if you would really like to dig into that period, read \\"Dreadnought\\" (or \\"Juggernaut,\\" should Massie ever write a book by that title!) and \\"An Uncommon Woman.\\""},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"I bought 1862 after reading a great newspaper review of it. When I went to post my own review at Amazon.com, I noted how many other reviewers had written \\"not as good as his other book, 1901\\". So, I figured I would see if 1901 was actually better.The good news is that 1901 is actually better than 1862 [I gave that two stars also].Unfortunately, it's not all that much better (not enough to raise this to three stars), and has the same problems as 1862. Of course, since 1901 was written first, I guess one might expect this.I won't go into plot details too much, as many other reviews here cover those things. Quick synopsis: Just as in 1862, there is a historical twist. In this case, Prussian-dominated Germany invades the USA in 1901. Just as in 1862, we see most of the action through the eyes of a young military-trained man, who gets involved with a young woman. Just as in 1862 the US is led by an old General who everyone thought was over the hill; just as in 1862, the enemy is over-confident and makes stupid mistakes.Along the way the the author gets to show how he thinks the US would prevail against overwhelming odds, the author attempts some very clumsy love scenes, you meet the one good enemy combatant (so you know all Germans aren't bastards, just most of them), and the reader must endure writing far below the standards of Stephen King's or Alistair MacLean's worst.Ands that last point is the biggest problem: Conroy is simply not a good writer. His writing style and character development are more worthy of an internet site or day-time television soap opera than a good book.His books start with a good solid premise, but the characters are cliches. His descriptions of them are insulting stereotypes: Apaches who hate white men and kill like invisible stalkers; blacks who move like panthers in the night; Germans who butcher with bayonets. I could cite many more examples.At times when reading the book, I would break out laughing, and my wife would ask what was so funny. I would then read the awful passage aloud. She would cringe and say \\"Oh, that's awful\\".By the way, that is a technique my college writing & composition professors taught me: If you want to know how something reads, read it aloud. If it sounds awful, it reads awful.Having read two of Conroy's books, I now think of the old saying \\"Fool me once shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\\" I don't plan to buy a third Conroy book.If the historical twist really interests you and thus you really want to buy this book for a quick summer read, be sure to buy a used copy."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Some books are fun to read and review even a couple of years after they are published. That is especially true if they are novels, do not sell well and suddenly become available for no more than a dollar or three from Edward Hamilton, Bookseller or some other discounter. Such a novel is \\"1901.\\" There is something in it for students of President Theodore Roosevelt, of Confederate General James (&quot;Old Pete\\") Longstreet of Gettysburg fame, for military tacticians and strategists and for folks who just like a rollicking good yarn.***There is just enough historical truth behind \\"1901\\" to make it possible to suspend disbelief and enjoy a tale rooted in German Kaiser Wilhelm II's lust for empire and his fictional belief that God intended the Americans to share with him a modest portion of the fruits of their 1898 war with Spain: Guam or the Philippines, perhaps, or maybe Puerto Rico. With the world's most awesome land forces at his disposal, the Kaiser invades Long Island and prepares his navy to shield it until the Americans come to their senses.***The challenge ruptures President McKinley's weak heart and he is promptly succeeded by his Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt of Rough Rider fame, San Juan hill, etc. Not for nothing is the first Roosevelt called \\"the Sage of Sagamore\\" (his New York residence). He is one of quite a few who believe that the American Civil War could have been shortened by two years had the Union but tenaciously followed \\"the Anaconda plan\\" of its then commander-in-chief of the army, General Winfield Scott.***Teddy deftly or daftly (your call) at this moment of great peril summons the now deaf octogenarian erstwhile Confederate General James Longfield back into service of his country. The plot then leaps forward with support from Longfield, Roosevelt and a supporting cast of cabinet members and a young fictional hero, Major Patrick Mahan, cousin of the great naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. The Major's earlier acquaintance with Kaiser Wilhelm and observation of German military behavior in Peking during the Boxer rebellion are pressed into service. By story's end Patrick is a general and bearer of the Congressional Medal of Honor. He is married and about to run for Congress.***Despite 25,000 casualties the Americans have inflicted 40,000 on the German invaders and prevailed in a massive naval engagement. The Kaiser goes off to exile in Denmark. Subplots of romance, cross cultural friendships and brutalities complicate a basically simple story line. This is not a book to be read slowly or searching for metaphysical significance. For the historian there are vignettes of German leaders which lend some plausibility to the plot."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"The premise of 1901, a theoretical Imperial German invasion of the United States, pitting the best of Prussia's seasoned armies against a rag-tag defensive force led by James Longstreet, would seem at a glance to be a fan of military history's dream come to life. As it turns out, Robert Conroy's 1901 is high on sex and gore, low on facts, and full of one-dimensional real-life actors who embody few - if any - of the myriad traits they possessed in real life. Let me just go ahead and list a few of the flaws of this book:1) Conroy's interpretation of many historical figures is both lax and depressing. As an example, the author's research into writing about Kaiser Wilhelm II seems to have only involved a trip to the U.S. Archives to look up anti-German propaganda from World War I. The real-life Kaiser was a complicated figure - a windbag, as Conroy points out, to be sure - but hardly a temper-tantrum-throwing, overgrown child as 1901's author would have his readers believe (for some real history of the Kaiser, check outDreadnought). Conroy's interpretation of Imperial Germany's government essentially amounts to a select circle of half a dozen thugs wringing their hands and cackling as they 'hatch their evil plans.' As history happened, the Kaiser actually took a back seat when real war occurred, with the German General Staff essentially running the country for four years from 1914-18.2) Conroy's belief that the American people would jubilantly accept James Longstreet's promotion to command is ridiculous. Historical acknowledgement of Longstreet as an excellent general has only taken place in the past three decades or so. He would have been a politically unacceptable figure to return to service at the turn of the 20th Century.3) 1901 is built around the idea that the German Navy could successfully ferry - largely in secret - a massive invasion force across the Atlantic Ocean some forty three years before a similar American/British invasion in Normandy barely succeeded. The logistics that Conroy casually chooses to ignore damn the entire book from the outset.4) Once landed, the Germans are content to sit in a tiny pocket in southwestern Connecticut and southeastern New York and essentially wait to be defeated. Conroy points out repeatedly in his book that the Germans had previously fought 'minor wars to fulfill limited goals,' ignoring the fact that, even in those 'minor wars' (I surmise he is talking about 1864's Second Schleswig War, 1866's Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71) the Prussian Army remained highly mobile, with the goal in both of the latter conflicts being the capture and occupation of the enemy nation's capital and utter defeat its armed forces - hardly a limited war. This was also essentially the German plan at the outset of World War I. Conroy chooses to ignore this historical strategic precedent and assert that, in a German invasion of the United States, that the commanders of the German Army would essentially be willing to sit on their hands and allow the Americans half a year regroup, train, rearm and finally seize the initiative and attack. The Germans only accepted trench warfare in World War I when their momentum ground to a halt - it wasn't a willing or planned design. That the invading Germans would simply occupy a relatively unimportant (with the exception of NYC) stretch of American coastline, settle in, and wait to be annihilated is one of Conroy's most startling blunders.5) The romantic relationships in 1901 are both predictable and unnecessary. Chapter after chapter is wasted (or largely wasted) with Conroy's unwilling/willing protagonist (who at one point tells now-president Theodore Roosevelt that 'I'm resigning after the war, I've had enough,' followed a few sentences later by, 'I want a command') wooing his wealthy New York lady friend. It's an affair that's introduced early in the book and manages to gobble up mass numbers of pages throughout the remainder of the novel. That our spit-and-polish hero both abhors war and is brilliant at executing it is quite a stretch; that he falls in love with a blonde, wealthy New York socialite who has a caring heart and is committed to charity work is beyond belief. These figures lack flaws - they are ideal personified.6) Similarly, Conroy's average Germans are equally dehumanized, rampantly raping, pillaging, and gleefully slaughtering prisoners. I suppose Conroy throws a bone to the German people in introducing the reader to Ludwig Weber, another relatively-spotless character who also happens to hate war, and is conscripted into the Kaiser's armies. Ludwig is, of course, surrounded by a collection of murder-loving rapists (read: ordinary German citizens), and at the conclusion of the book he chooses to immigrate to Wisconsin rather than return to Germany - huge surprise.7) Naval battles are far less about tactics than they are about average sailors getting blown up and maimed. Conroy seems to neither understand pre-Dreadnought naval warfare, nor to take much of an interest in what should be one of the central focuses of his book. Instead, the 'big naval battle' involves the brother of Patrick's love interest (how convenient) standing in the foretop of the U.S.S. Alabama, receiving minor wounds, getting knocked down, and waking up to find that the fighting is over, with the Americans miraculously proving the victors. It takes Conroy a full two pages to describe this action - obviously he wouldn't want to detract any pages from Patrick's stirring infatuation with his love interest.8) The Germans, despite a record as being excellent warriors, prove to be incompetent soldiers both on the land and at sea. As World War I was to prove, Germany's High Seas Fleet was, if anything, at least equal to the Army in terms of battle prowess, as the Germans gave as good as they got in several notable confrontations (The Battle of Coronel, the Battle of Jutland, etc). Conroy's German sailors are rank amateurs who appear to be worse seamen than contemporary Russians.I could go on. The sad fact of the matter is that this is a short-story-gone-novel written by an author who doesn't possess the historical know-how or creative writing skills to flesh it out appropriately. Conroy is flag-waving, America-first writer who would probably argue that the United States also single-handedly won World War I and World War II, and perhaps even the Napoleonic Wars, conveniently ignorant of the fact that we weren't even involved in the latter. It's a darned shame, because the basic premise of a one vs. one duel between the United States and Imperial Germany is a stirring one. However, Conroy's setting, characters, logistics, and unfolding strategy are all either flawed, broken or nonexistent. Unless you're more concerned with bloody, pointless slaughter, predictable romances, and stilted, hollow characters than plausible 'what-if' historical story writing, Robert Conroy's 1901 is one to avoid."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Simply put, this book is terrible. The fictional characters are one-dimensional and boring and the historical characters are... well, they're one-dimensional and boring as well. The passage where Teddy Roosevelt breaks down into uncontrollable tears after one of several cartoonishly stereotypical German atrocities was especially cringe-inducing. The author stops short of having the Germans march through Jamaica, Queens with babies on pikes, but he doesn't stop much short of it. Conroy even stoops to the mind-numbing cliche of injecting a romantic storyline, complete with hilariously clumsy sex scene. It's not quite as unnecessary as a sex sequence in a Ken Follett book, but it possesses the same disregard for fundamental elements of eroticism that make it about as stimulating to read as a clinical description of a vasectomy.My personal impression is that the bulk of the \\"research\\" for this novel involved reading \\"Empire\\" by Gore Vidal and then cribbing as much of the historical \\"flavor\\" as seemed ethical to graft on to an inane story. There was just too much about this book that felt like the author went out to Barnes & Noble and bought a \\"Build Your Own Novel\\" kit. There was the aforementioned romance angle. There's a reluctant German soldier who reminded me of the line in Full Metal Jacket about inside every Vietnamese there's an \\"American waiting to get out.\\" But more than anything, I was irritated by the lack of action. I wasn't expecting Melville when I bought this book, but I was at least expecting a trashy read with some exciting battle sequences. However, the bulk of the novel contains very little actual fighting. That means the novel needs to rely on characters to carry it. Unfortunately the characters are so poorly conceived that there's nothing to carry the book."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"I gave this book 3 stars only because I couldn't give it 2.5. As a history buff when I first read the premise of 1901, I was excited. It was new and refreshing in a genre dominated by \\"what ifs\\" dealing with either the Civil War or WW2. So when I finally spotted a copy I grabbed it and dove in eagerly. The book starts off well enough and is quick to get to the main plot without meandering. Though not expertly written it is still pleasant to read at first, but it is evident that this is the author's first novel. A plethora of characters were introduced within the first half of the book, and they all seem, at first, crucial and intriguing.But soon I found myself wondering where the plot was going. About three quarters through, I was already getting completely bored. It felt as if the author began to forget about certain characters, and they disappeared for a bulk of the second half of the novel. The plot became stale as nothing new or exciting occurred. The climax of the novel was at best tepid. The fate of many of the characters was left to the reader's imagination. I felt as if the author didn't really know how to end the book and just rushed it. There were historical and political occurrences that I absolutely detested and I hope the educated reader will feel the same way. Sadly the author missed a chance for a groundbreaking novel, and also missed out on so many opportunities to expand on it. The novel should have also been shortened by 100 pages or so, there was so much useless fluff it was disgusting.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes alternate history. For all its faults I did enjoy reading it somewhat. The idea was amazing; the execution was what was lacking. 2.5/5"},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"I sought this book out with some enthusiasm; the premise of a turn of the century conflict between the German and American \\"Empires\\" seemed to be fertile ground for some alternative history making. Instead the author chose to make the Germans into essentially two-dimensional cut-outs of evil storm troopers... such as- commiting countless atrocities - slaughtering prisoners, pillaging and raping without a second thought, shelling cities without essential military value.- the Kaiser is painted as a mad-man. From my reading, he was an egotist, and not too bright, but not a monster.- would the desire for an Empire cause the Germans to start a cross-Atlantic war without securing at least an entente with other european powers?- If the Germans wanted to \\"steal\\" an empire, wouldn't they consider invading little Holland next door, who had a large colonial empire, were militarily weak, and thereby not risk picking on a nation larger in population, across the ocean?The atrocity episodes could have been written as a response to partisan activities by american patriots (as they were in Belgium in 1914); instead they are commited without any apparent goal in mind. There are but a few German characters who question the overall merits of such an approach.The American Army of 1901 is armed with single shot black powder rifles in the book, but I recall them having the magazine fed Krag rifles of 1898...Overall, a missed opportunity for opening another road through history's \\"What-Ifs\\""},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Many other reviewers have commented already on Conroy's lack of attention to detail and poor research base. What is most bothersome for me in this book, and in 1862 which I have also read, is the complete lack of a plot. He starts with a good idea but at no point did he actually work out how he was going to get from start to finish.Thus we have the literary equivalent of \\"and then a miracle happens\\" in the plot. In 1901 it is single brand new torpedo which misses the massive heavy cruiser it was aimed at but miraculously strikes one of the ammunition carrying ships behind it, causing every ship so loaded to detonate, sympathetically I'm sure. This reduces the German army to an unfed, unclothed and unarmed military mob. In 1862 Conroy has every throw of the die going America's way, every throw of the die going against Britain; not just one miracle here, a veritable legion of them.Why can't this author actually plot out his stories before he starts writing? I have wasted my money on two of his books because I liked the ideas. I won't make the same mistake again."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Conroy takes a risk here in exploring an actual plan that now with hindsight seems wildly unlikely. It's easy to forget that the U.S. wasn't perceived as a much of a military power in 1901 in any measure and really wouldn't be one until 1942-3, although Conroy's drawing on our Civil War and Spanish America experiences is very reasonable. I think any fan of alternate history and the period will find this a quick and enjoyable read. My only quibble was Conroy's obsession with smokeless powder German bolt-action rifles against American black-powder Springfields until the arrival of the regulars with Krag-Jorgenson smokeless rifles...sure it's a big advantage but Winchester and Remington were making vast numbers of smokeless, repeating rifles after 1894 and their plants are in very close proximity to the German invasion so rearming National Guard, veterans, State Militia, West Point's cadets, etc. extremely quickly would be unusually easy here, as opposed to anywhere else on the continent. One reviewer asks about the citizenry but I don't think folks in that region might be as heavily armed with smokeless powder hunting rifles as say the Western states. He also ignores calling back up the tens of thousands recently mustered and somewhat trained soldiers from the 1898-1899 enlistments to fight Cuba...far from all stayed in the Army and transferred to the Phillipines campaign, most would again be living along the East Coast and Midwest in rail-served communities. Of course ignoring this makes for a more dramatic climax and tension so it serves the story well."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Interesting premise, but Conroy seems to follow the same patterns that Turtledove does. Mix together possible war scenario, create multiple viewpoints from several cardboard cut-outs, add in a ton of military set-pieces and let simmer.The resulting work is entertaining but it is too simplistic, glossing over political and social complexities.Conroy's Americans are presented as incredibly noble and earnest and innocent. Conroy barely mentions the racial unrest or America's concurrent massacre of Filipino freedom fighters, showing only the bravery of the black soldiers or that America came to a noble peace agreement with the Phillipines to free up some troops.Conroy also struggles to make Wilhelmine Germany just like WWII Germany, fast-forwarding German political development about 32 years so that he can have a \\"Third Reich\\" in place for a sequel that he probably has in the works.This kind of plotting, plus characters referring to themselves as \\"unlike other women of this period\\" (how...forward-looking)and stiff dialogue combine to produce a work only of interest to the alt-history buff."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"...for this book (I thought the premise was fascinating, and involved a time period/scenario that's received too little attention in the alt-history genre) were quickly dashed as I started trying to read it...Mr. Conroy's research is no doubt accurate, and it's a truly great idea for a book, but the writing itself is just, well, horrid.

It could have been an interesting read if it was readable."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"This has an interesting plotline. It is based off the little known of plans that Kaiser Wilhelm II had for attacking America. It isn't a well known fact that the Kaiser despised America and capitalism in general. He wanted a greater worldwide empire, similar to France and Great Britain. He had his sights on Cuba, and wished to set up a millitary base there to give Germany a presence in North America. The plan called for the invasion of New York, the economic heart of the USA. Since our country was based off captialism, if he successfully captured and held New York, the US would suffer economic chaos and be more willing to negotiate for Cuba.This novel explore the idea that the headstrong and impulsive Kaiser would have made this a reality and invaded a relatively unprepared USA.he also raised some eyebrows when he decided to use an unlikely hero for the US. The US wasn't very focused millitarily at that time, and had few generals with experience. So they brought out former confederate General Longstreet, and offered him an advisor position.While its concept is intersting. The book suffers from flaws that are apparent in his other work. Though he seems to have a grasp on certain rare historical concepts, but no grasp of how culture or people were in that era. He has them acting like people from our era, with a lot of politically correctness that didn't exist then. Especially in regards to race, religion, and culture. The Germans are definitely the bad guys, and are depicted and arrogant, murderous, and incompetent. Which doesn't fit with the fact that they had what was considered the best trained and most organized land army in the world. It is also a stretch that he would have been able to undergo this venture when Germany's primary concerns were Europe. Why waste its resources on a war in a country 3000+ miles away? How would his government allow this? Especially when things started to go so badly.All in all interesting concept. But not really in the historical fiction genre as it fails to take too many important aspects and doesn't seem aware that people had different attitudes in 1901 as opposed to today."},{"Title":"1901: A Novel","review":"Robert Conroys story of a German invasion of Long Island in 1901 is a fascinating idea.

I am a graduate of City College of New York. I attended in the years 1975-1979, right after Open Enrollment began. I remember then how shocked I was when I found out I was among a minority of students who would not need remedial help. My father attended CCNY as well, so he read the book too. Mr. Traub's portrayal was extremely accurate. I reread passages to see if there were areas I thought he was mistaken. There were none. It helps to have grown up in New York and have attended CCNY, for much of the book to have meaning, but for other parts of the book, the issues are important throughout the United States in examining education, and the American Dream."},{"Title":"City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College","review":"James's Traub &quot;A City of a Hill Testing the American Dream at City College&quot; has sadly gone out-of-print but you can find it an second-hand outlets or even here at amazon.com. Perhaps one reason for this is that it's theme, that affirmative action served to undermine a great institution, has gained a wide following and affirmative action is being knocked down all across the country. (Traub claims that his book takes no position on this debate but I believe it does.)If for no other reason this book is great to read because it chronicles the City College of New York from it's heyday to it's decline. (The current mayor of New York, Rudolph Gulianni, has reversed the policies of City College and embraced meritocracy once again.) But before I describe that I need to say in all fairness that only the humanities part of the college suffered under affirmative action. The medical and engineering schools continue to be strong. After all, as Traub points out, you cannot relax standards in, say, civil engineering. If you did we would have bridges falling down.In the 1930's through the 1960's the City College of New York was where young white Jews aspired to go to school Woody Allen went there. The student body became mainly Jewish. The main City College campus is located in Harlem which is, of course, neither Jewish nor white. It's geographical location is one reason that progressive educators and the community clamored for lowering standards. The result was the school accepted students who were not prepared so they start remedial education courses.Anyway important Jewish scholars went to school there. Getrude Himmelfarb, Irving Kristol, and I believe Alfed Kazim and Irvin Howe are all alumni. Traub's book describes how these budding scholars gathered at a certain table in the cafeteria to discuss rarefied topics. Socialism was what these students believed. (Of course Himmelfarb and Kristol, husband and wife, later broke with the socialists and started the Neo-conservative movement.) The intellectual excitement described there is endearing and reminiscent of the movie &quot;Yentel&quot;. O to be a part of a community that loved learning so.I think this book says a lot about the Jewish community that I admire. In New York and in Easter Europe, they saw their means to advancement and a way to avoid persecution as education. Their rabbis were learned mean who often did not physical work but sat and pondered all day long. Their own Torah is a work of great intellectual import. Isn't that wonderful?"},{"Title":"City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College","review":"The question is simple. What does one do about the fact that many minority students simply are not qualified to go to college? As I see it, there are three solutions. One is to simply say \\"too bad.\\" The second is to admit severely unqualified students and try to provide them with remedial education and get them to a point where they have accomplished something. The third choice, which I favor, is to help these students before they get to college, in grades 1 through 12, so that they can qualify legitimately. Of course, one can do a little of all three.The City College of New York took the second choice in 1970, and not surprisingly, standards dropped. About half the students were either taking English as a second language or were in SEEK, a program which gave admission to otherwise unqualified students whose family incomes were below a poverty threshold. The graduation rate of the SEEK students was somewhere below 15%.Hopefully, standards are going up again now. As a person with a love of academia, I sure hope so. We'll see what happens.The author spent a year at the campus, attending classes, interviewing students, and interviewing faculty. We see a class teaching English as a second language. We see a few SEEK students who struggled and survived. But still, that means just getting by, maybe on track to graduate from college with the equivalent of a tenth-grade education in most fields (although having been trained to write papers that at least looked academic in form).I don't know what has happened on the campus since this book was written ten years ago. But one hopeful sign was a proposal requiring incoming students to have college preparatory training in high school. The lack of high school college prep courses was making it too difficult for many students to accomplish anything in college.The alternative would be to lower standards to nothing, but then one's degree would eventually be worthless.Still, standards were high in some fields. More than one quarter of the school's graduates were in engineering. Engineering schools need to meet national standards, and this one does. Any student could enroll in engineering, but classes were difficult and had serious prerequisites. And many students were weeded out.I think the most intriguing part of the book was the question of the teaching of racist ideologies on campus. And that meant dealing with the issue of Leonard Jeffries, a notorious teacher at the school, \\"who often implied, though rarely said outright, that blacks were superior to whites not only culturally and morally but biologically.\\"I agree with the implication by the author that the success of Jeffries at the school ought to be thought of not merely in political terms but also as one more instance of failure to meet academic standards.This was an interesting book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Miller's: American Art Pottery : How to Compare & Value (Miller's Treasure Or Not)","review":"Yet another book on American Art Pottery? Give me a break!And thats exactly what the authors here have done. Theyve given us a break. Given us entree to insights and opinions formed from their handling and viewing more than 100,000 pots and tiles over some 30 years. And theyve done it in a refreshingly readable, yet authoritative style.This work is aimed at the less experienced collector as well as those of us who will admit to still having a few things to learn. Whether new to the game or an old hand, if you love pottery, but your experience doesnt quite stack up to that of the authors, we think youll find this a helpful -- and very enjoyable -- addition to your antiques library.Longtime art pottery aficionados, dealers, auctioneers and, for the past five years, appraisers for the &quot;Antiques Road Show,&quot; authors David Rago and Suzanne Perrault have taken a leaf from Albert Sacks popular &quot;Fine Points of American Furniture&quot; to give us a look at &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Better&quot; pieces from 43 American art potteries, from the popular and ubiquitous like Roseville -- to the relatively obscure like Walley.Using a reader-friendly format, they present, for each pottery, a Good and Better example on facing pages, together with a value range for each -- 60 such combinations in all. Then, for each piece, they highlight and analyze the key features that distinguish it from its neighbor and tell us why they value one more highly than the other.You may argue with some of the cited prices which they readily admit reflect their own biases, to wit, &quot;I like Grueby more than Wheatley&Eacute;and I like Weller less than Roseville&quot; but youll find the careful and thoughtful analyses nonetheless interesting and helpful. The prevailing biases of other collectors as regards their attitudes toward the effect on value of damage, one pottery vs. another, are but one example.Encompassing 124 pages, this comparison section alone is more than well worth the price of admission. But the sections on Understanding the Market and An American Art Potteries Primer are equally helpful, as a learning experience for newer collectors, and a thoughtful refresher for those whove been to Zanesville more times than they care to tell.Few antiques authors manage the authoritative and colloquial with such ease and aplomb, and to such enjoyable effect. It is in these sections where that effect is most evident.Here were helped to understand and make sense of a market where, from 1975 to 2000, an 8&quot; Rookwood Standard glaze, floral decorated vase increased in value by 450%, while a similarly sized and decorated Iris glaze vase soared by more than 1600%. And here were provided a thoughtful analysis (though not without bias) of the essential elements which serve to distinguish the producers and the products of the Ohio Valley, New England, the South and California.The one fault we found is in the brief section on How to Clean a Pot. Recommended is soaking &quot;for at least 24 hours in a bucket of very hot tap water to which is added a cup of sudsing ammonia and at least a half a cup of Spic and Span. After the soak, remove the pot and soak for at least another 24 hours in clean hot tap water.&quot; Perhaps inadvertently deleted in editing is any caveat restricting this approach, at best, to non-porous pots. DO NOT try this on porous pots like Peters &amp; Reed Moss Aztec -- or cracked or crazed pots.With only slight and otherwise forgivable puffery, the book jacket heralds this as &quot;a master class in appraising art pottery.&quot; And a &quot;master class&quot; it may be. But as anyone whos earned and gone forward with a &quot;masters&quot; will attest, you have to get your hands dirty before it pays off. &quot;The best you can do,&quot; say the authors, &quot;is to learn enough about pottery to form your own biases&Eacute; learn to appreciate the beauty of the objects, and integrate the history that fueled the kilns&Eacute;(and) Allow the works of these great potteries to enter your life and delight your soul&Eacute;&quot; as they have quite obviously done for the authors.And take this book along."},{"Title":"Miller's: American Art Pottery : How to Compare & Value (Miller's Treasure Or Not)","review":"This book is not only a great source for reference, it also details the most important aspects of the art pottery movement (with great photographs as examples!)."},{"Title":"Miller's: American Art Pottery : How to Compare & Value (Miller's Treasure Or Not)","review":"I might be biased because I think everything Rago touches is genius but you just can't beat this art pottery expert.

This one exposes in its few pages the pharmaceutical fraud governing our bodies and minds.Large-scale randomized trials fool professionals with their facade of scientific respectability, the author explains. They fail to satisfy the fundamental principles of science, namely that the objects under study are precisely definable, the variables identifiable, the results directly observable and consistent, the research replicable, and the predictions emanating from it reliable. These principles were already established by Francis Bacon four centuries ago. Bacon also warned us of bias, which causes researchers to focus on results that seem to confirm their proposed hypothesis while ignoring contradictory evidence. And Bacon surely hadn't dreamed of the mega-profits that would be biasing pharmaceutical research in the 21st century!Penston is no enemy of upfront pharmacology. Anesthetics for surgery, insulin, and antibiotics are examples of medicines that have an impressive record in helping to save lives. There is no need for large-scale randomized trials to investigate the benefits of these drugs, as their benefits are immediately apparent. However, many diseases and discomforts have proved resistant to medical researchers' best efforts. There have, in fact, been few important pharmaceutical breakthroughs in the last half century.Most of the conditions treated by drugs in over-developed societies are not acute life-threatening illnesses but vague complaints, the natural consequences of aging, or even the test results of perfectly healthy people. In acute illness the patient either rapidly improves or dies. Both outcomes terminate the need for treatment. It is in the chronic categories mentioned above that the potential for the most humongous profits lie for the pharmaceutical industry. But how do you persuade doctors to prescribe medicines for such nebulous conditions, particularly when no benefit to the patient is discernable?Whether or not originally designed for this purpose, large-scale randomized trials fit the bill. Because of their size, which includes thousands of words of text along with an array of tables and figures, they are highly susceptible to mystical statistical tricks, epitomized by the meaningless term \\"relative risk reduction.\\" The fallibility of the background theory is illustrated by one such mega-trial, which wound up recommending the drug under study for a different condition than it set out to. Furthermore, because of their dimensions, the trials cannot be controlled or replicated, and they easily conceal fraud. Rules set up for them by professional organizations or government watchdogs, which are always directly or indirectly funded by the pharmaceutical industry, only serve to further obscure the fuzziness of the research and protect it against criticism. Busy peer reviewers may base a recommendation for publication on the abstract, which often suggests conclusions not justifiable by the body of the paper. The only valid generalization that can be derived from these trials is that the test drug has no beneficial effect on 98% or more of the study population. Yet randomized trials remain stubbornly sacrosanct. Finding fault with them is taboo, unless the treatment under investigation is not a bonanza drug but less lucrative, such as prayer.This book is understandable to even the less sophisticated lay reader, so it should also be understandable to physicians, who are widely credited with superior intelligence. I wonder how they have received it? Have they embraced it (we should be so lucky)? Have they marginalized and defamed its author as they do Szasz and Duesberg? Or do they ignore him and hope nobody will notice, like they doMary Boyle?As regarding most of the books I review, no matter how enthusiastically I endorse the author's argument, the conclusions I draw from it are different from his. Penston is a physician. He fleetingly mentions that patients are misled, but his focus is not, as is MeTZelf's, on the individual's freedom and empowerment. Unsurprisingly, he is concerned with the ramifications for physicians. Guidelines based on these trials usurp the medical profession's power and dislodge physicians as the sole arbiters of their patients' treatment, Penston laments. He is worried about the trend that other medical professionals increasingly perform services formerly reserved for qualified physicians, and fears the specter of litigation on the grounds that a doctor failed to comply with guidelines produced by panels of experts with ties to the pharmaceutical industry. He admits that medicine is the business of managing patients, and suggests that only the clinical experience of physicians justifies that role. But clinical experience is also fuzzy and unreplicable.The author does not question the state's licensing of drugs, nor its investing in physicians the power to forbid, advise, and even compel an individual to take them, on the premise that most of us are too stupid or ignorant to regulate our own drug use. Surely the non-existent science illuminating the decisions of those supposedly wiser than ourselves, as the author argues so well, exposes the folly of the state's interfering with private decisions? Drug regulation resembles the obedience once demanded of us by priests and kings on the authority invested in them as appointees of The Mighty Creator Himself. At a certain point in history, most of humanity revolted against kings and abandoned allegiance to priests. However, as illustrated by a survey that Penston cites, people today continue to regard doctors as the most trustworthy of all professionals. As long as we live in parliamentary democracies (or some variation of them as in the US) rather than in free states, belief in Dr. Santa Claus will continue to erode our liberty and bring us closer to completepharmacracy*.*This term was coined by Thomas Szasz. He was referring to the union of health care and state, rather than to rule by the pharmaceutical industry.Copyright MeTZelf"},{"Title":"Fiction And Fantasy In Medical Research: The large scale randomised trial","review":"This little text is an excellent introduction to the problematic \\"metaphysical\\" assumptions underlying large scale randomized clinical trials.(RCT's) The author nicely summarizes David Hume's philosophy of causality and includes some trenchant methodological criticisms of RCTs.

Not only do you want to read them, but you want to get to know them too. It builds up to the last story, a novella about a man who still struggles with the death of his daughter. He eventually joins a support group and finds the others there are just as bad as he is. He finds someone, a woman, and they manage to get along. But along the way he comes across things that steer him towards another direction.

It gives, in my opinion, a very good idea of what it was like for a young Basque to come to this country and try to make a living. It also describes well the choices the decendants of these immigrants have made to continue the Basque culture. It does so in a very direct way, making me think about my choices and the convenience of the aspects of Basque culture I have chosen to keep alive for myself. In some areas, I wish there was more depth (for example, the discussion of Anaiak Denok, a group I hadn't heard of before), but, overall, it is a very good introduction to what it means to be Basque-American and why some of us choose to identify with both the Basque and American culture.

First, there is no indication at all in this book of how expensive Kampala has become over the last decade, so I ended up taking not enough money and had to have my parents wire me cash over Western Union. Not that the book would have helped in that regard, of course, because there is no information in the guidebook about Western Union or how to get cash to Uganda.In a section at the back of the book there is a list of hotels with, of course, no prices listed, and, while the authors list theatres, tour operators and even libraries, they conveniently leave out restaurants. There is also an extensive list of wildlife species although, without any pictures to help you identify the animals, I don't know how this is supposed to help anyone. In the language section there is a helpful English-Kiswahili section, which is nice except for the fact that Luganda is much more widely spoken in Kampala, Entebbe and central Uganda than Kiswahili.Additionally, there is a massive lack of good maps here: the map of Kampala is so small it doesn't even cover the centrally located Rubaga cathedral and the map of Uganda lacks so much detail that it is almost impossible to use it for driving. (This in a country where street signs are almost non-existent.)

This is a novella which questions the boundaries between life and art, asking us all the while where love resides in self, family, and society.&quot;First Love&quot; begins in a style reminiscent of Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales.&quot; Following a long dinner party, three men are in the middle of a calm conversation, when the unnamed host proposes that they all share the stories of their first loves. Two men's stories are quickly dismissed, leaving Vladimir Petrovich, a pensive middle aged man, who offers to give his story after having a chance to write it out. Vladimir's story concerns a summer when he was 16. Living in the country with a dissatisfied mother and an agonizingly Byronic father, Vladimir happens upon a dispossessed 21-year-old princess, Zinaida. From her shabby home, the beautiful and mysterious Zinaida commands a court of six men of varying ages and backgrounds - a poet, a doctor, a minor nobleman, a soldier, and Vladimir - each of whom is desperate to win her affection at any cost. For his own part, Vladimir attempts throughout the story to discover the roots of his own fascination with Zinaida.Part of the appeal of &quot;First Love&quot; is its point of view. It is a true first person narrative - we only ever know Vladimir's experience - the effect is a realistic account of the infatuation, love, doubt, and inner turmoil of a young man told through the hindsight of age and experience. Perhaps I've grown too accustomed to omniscient narration recently, but the desire that Turgenev evokes to know the minds of others, which of course in reality, we cannot, is both appealing and frustrating.Turgenev's literary background is broad and multicultural - he evinces knowledge of Russian, British, German, and French, Classic and Romantic traditions - all of which give us the sense that the tale being told is at once extremely personal and terribly universal. &quot;First Love&quot; is well-worth the investment of the short time it takes to read."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"I read this book one very, very cold winter's night in St.Petersburg, sitting at a sleazy 24-hour bar by the Gulf of Finland, where I was the only guest.

By then I'd gotten unreasonably buzzed, so I stumbled over to the barlady (who, needless to say, was called Natasha), and congratulated her on being Russian, for that meant that she'd been born in the same country where Turgenev wrote this lovely, tragic, wonderfully sentimental story. I felt stupid the next morning, but was still overwhelmed with the beauty of what I'd read. I am uncertain how much the setting I read this book in had to do with how much I liked it, and I wonder what it'd be like to read it now, sober, at home, but I suspect it of being pretty damn brilliant no matter where you read it. Well, maybe except if you're from California or something. At any rate - &quot;First Love&quot; rocks."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"At the risk of not sounding manly, I must admit I love Russian literature! And, Turgenev is one of my favorites. I've also felt that he has never been fully appreciated to the degree he should be. When most people think of Russian literature obvisously authors like Dostoevsky (my favorite author), Tolstoy, and Chekhov come to mind but one rarely hears someone speak highly of Turgenev, or maybe it's merely the people whom I hang around with. &quot;First Love&quot; is so wonderfully written, it's so full of charm, wit, humor, and basic human emotions that as one goes on reading we almost relive our own first love experience. We think back to when we were young and how we felt when we had that crush on someone. How the whole world seemed different and exciting. Well, Turgenev managed to recapture those feelings we may have put aside. The story is about Vladimir Petrovichand he tells how he has fallen for Zinaida, the daughter of a Princess. He takes us along with him as he recalls his memories of what it was like when he first met her. And how he also was able to grow up and learn from this experience. I can't praise this book highly enough. A wonderful read!Very good translation by Isaiah Berlin.

(It's probably been around since the dawn of man, but I've heard it since the 1970s).FIRST LOVE is a short but powerful novella that captures a young man's awakening while exploring all the \\"ecstacy\\" and \\"that slow poison\\" of adult love.What struck me about reading it was how little people have changed. Societies and manners may shift a bit but the passions and betrayals that take place in the novel are as dramatic and real as anything you hear about today.\\"O youth! youth! you go your way heedless, uncaring--as if you owned all the treasures of the world; even grief elates you, even sorrow sits well upon your brow. You are self-confident and insolent and you say, 'I alone am alive--behold!' even while your own days fly past and vanish without trace and without number, and everything within you melts away like wax in the sun...in the snow....\\"For such a short work, there were many such passages that really connected with me. Turgenev was a master."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"I am one of those modern American readers who scratches their heads at the idea that Turgenev's stature in his own time rivaled, if not exceeded, Dostoevksy's and Tolstoy's. This is the first piece I've read that has given me a sense of what all the fuss is about.While I'm sure that some feminist critic has taken Turgenev to task for the femme fatale qualities of Princess Zinaida, the depiction of the main character's by turns painful and euphoric infatuation with her is brilliant. It's vivid in its own right, but almost doesn't have to be: it pushes so many memory buttons that it creates an overwhelming sense of \\"Been there, done that. Maybe aging isn't so bad. . .\\"The novella as a whole has a most unRussian sense of economy and tight structure. Indeed, it's probably the one piece I've read out of translation from Russian that I wouldn't mind being longer: the characters are well-drawn and sympathetic, their foibles and weaknesses so compelling, that I wanted to hear more about them.If there's a flaw in this piece -- and this is debatable -- it's that Turgenev became too fixated on a point of suspense. He seems uncertain about whether he has already shown too much of his hand and plays a kind of peekaboo with details that makes the main character seem a little slow at comprehending what was happening. The story itself is so compelling that the suspense seems almost like a gimmick. It might have been better to lay it all out from the beginning and then indulge us with more perspectives on the story.My particular edition had \\"First Love\\" paired with \\"A Fire at Sea\\" -- a self-serving autobiographical short story that loses much in comparison to similar stories written at roughly the same time, like Conrad's _Lord Jim_ and Stephen Crane's \\"Open Boat\\".

Turgenev's influence on Hemingway was probably never more brilliantly expressed than in these understated words from A Moveable Feast: \\"I had read all of Turgenev...(of Dostoevsky) frailty and madnesss...were there to know as you knew the landscapes and roads in Turgenev...\\"This book is more than a simple love story between a young man and an older woman, though the idea of the shortness and depthlessness of young love is an important theme. There are also such themes as the dissolution and fall into poverty of the Russian nobility as seen in Zinaida and her mother, a former princess; the idea of 19th century Russia shrugging off the chains of serfdom and royal dominance is also explored in the vastly superior Fathers and Sons. Another noteworthy theme is alienation from parents and society in general; Vladimir Petrovich is dominated utterly by his menacing father and carking, gossipy mother. He grows to become a bachelor, rehashing his tragic story before a fireplace in an inn. Towards the end of the book, when Vladimir's father, who shares with Vladimir a strong affection for Zinaida, flogs the young girls arm with a riding crop, as well as the threat the father gives to one of Zinaida's numerous suitors, we are made to wonder exactly what part romantic relationships have in the alleviation or exacerbation of violent mental illness, or at least a violent and cold mindset.This book, however deep and lovingly crafted, is a cipher next to Fathers and Sons. It's also a lot shorter; first time Turgenev readers might want to start here."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"First Love is enjoyable, romantic, emotional, touching, and just a little bit twisted.

Four young men clustered round her, and she was tapping them one by one on the forehead with those small grey flowers---I do not know their name, but they are well known to children: these flowers form little bags and burst loudly if you strike them against anything hard. The young men offered their foreheads so eagerly, and there was in the girl's movements (I saw her in profile) something so enchanting, that I nearly cried out with wonder and delight, and should, I suppose, at that moment, have given everything in the world to have those lovely fingers tap my forehead too. My rifle slipped to the grass; I forgot everything; my eyes devoured the graceful figure, the lovely neck, the beautiful arms, the slightly dishevelled fair hair under the white kerchief---and the half-closed, perceptive eye, the lashes, the soft cheek beneath them...\\"That's about all Turgenev has the main character say about that character's infatuation with the above mentioned female in this short story. Yes, the story is only about 85 pages of not fine print so there isn't a lot of meat in this book, but from a story entitled \\"First Love\\" I expected more about why Turgenev's character even liked the gal named Zinaida herein. Almost the only interesting thing about this story is the following: Turgenev wrote this story about the first love of a 16 year old young man when he was about 42. Turgenev's father died at age 42 when, what a coincidence, Turgenev himself was 16 and in this story the main character's father sort of double crosses his son's dreams. Turgenev, too, never married. In other words, the story seems to have been written to address, in some way, the author's feelings about his father; and, I guess, this is why so little detail is given about Zinaida herein and why, after reading this work, I had no more interest in her at the end than I did when I read the words above at the beginning of the story. If you like Turgenev already I am not going to say don't read this tiny book. It will only take a few hours to read, after all (and you can find it online for free, by the way, too). But for others interested in reading some fine Russian literature try something by Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy or, if familiar with those titans already, I'd suggest trying something by Bulg&aacute;kov, Pasternak, or even Boris Pilnyak or Fyodor Sologub if you want to read Russian literature wherein the characters are a lot more alive and interesting to read about."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"This book is not by \\"Constance Garnett\\".It is a famous classic novella by the great Ivan Turgenev.Be aware that this photocopied edition- complete with tacky cover design - is somewhat inferior to other editions."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"This short book is a life lesson.

After the plates are cleared away and the middle-aged gentlemen are enjoying cigars, they trade stories of their first loves. Two of them tell stories that are completely lacking of passion and soul, revealing the shallowness of the men themselves. The third, Vladimir Petrovitch, has a story that is so out of the ordinary that he is reticent to tell it. His companions, desperately lacking any passion of their own, beseech him to tell them his tale. Reluctantly he agrees, but in order to do the story justice, he must first write it down, promising to read it to them at a future date.Thus begins Ivan Turgenev's 1860 novella, First Love. At age sixteen while living in the country, Vladimir meets twenty-one-year-old Zinaida Alexandrovna Zasyekina, the daughter of a titled but very poor family living on the adjoining property. Zinaida is a beautiful and spirited young women and Vladimir falls hopelessly in love with her. Zinaida toys with him mercilessly, enticing him with hints of a deep and romantic affection and, alternatively, pushing him away and treating him with condescending, sisterly affection. (Perhaps the 19th century equivalent of \\"Let's just be friends.\\") At one point, she even asks Vladimir to look after her twelve-year-old brother, emphasizing the their age difference and that Vladimir is still just a boy.Adding to Vladimir's frustration are the numerous suitors who come calling on Zinaida every evening. They are all older than Vladimir and superior to him in either wealth or social class. She plays them all off one another, but occasionally indicates that she favors Vladimir. On these occasions the young man's heart swells and there is no joy greater than the joy felt by a young man in love for the first time. There is also no sadness greater than the sadness brought on by unrequited love.Vladimir is a sensitive and observant young man and he is able to see through Zinaida's extreme coquettishness and notices a gradual change in her manner. Beneath her faade, he can see that she truly is in love, but not with him. Nor is it one of the other suitors, although at first he suspects it is one of them. The penultimate heartbreak for Vladimir is that Zinaida's secret love turns out to be Vladimir's own father. In the final chapters, this heartbreak story, as all good heartbreak, turns tragic.Turgenev is one of the early practitioners of literary realism. First Love is told in first person and adheres strictly to the limitations of omniscience that that point of view requires. Turgenev uses that to his advantage in several specific places, such as when Vladimir witnesses an altercation between his father and Zinaida. He is unable to hear what they are discussing, but his visual observation provides enough for for us to understand the depth nature of their relationship.The true artistry of this novella is revealed at the conclusion when the reader reconsiders the entire story once again, this time taking a far more sympathetic view of both Zinaida (and really, the first time through she's very hard to like) and Vladimir's father. What is finally revealed is that this story is not only a tale about a youthful unrequited love but also about Zinaida's place in society, society's expectations of all of us, and ultimately about the nature of love itself.Turgenev's influence is even more apparent in the development of psychological fiction. He has a gentle touch that captures complex and nuanced emotional states in his characters and can be seen as a precursor to Henry James and Joseph Conrad. This same approach to fiction can still be seen in such contemporary works as Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach.Turgenev lived during changing times in Europe. Later events would sweep away the aristocracy in his native Russia, but during his lifetime the social order, and the aristocracy that it supported, was already crumbling. The characters in First Love reflect this along with the very nature of the story that the older Vladimir tells to his shallow and passionless companions."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"Turgenev's brief novel, \\"First Love\\" is about growing older and lossing innocence. Vladimir, the central character who tells the story, makes a large memory excersice to remember, to write and to communicate his unusual first love experience when he was sixteen. He does that in beautiful prose, realistic and lyric simultaneusly.Love in this novel for Vladimir is mainly an emotional experience, not physichal. There is no sex and, more important, not explicit sexual desire. This could be considered old fashioned or artificial by contemporary readers but somehow Turgenev manages to make it credible and moving.The translation by Isaiah Berlin is excellent, at least much better that the one I've read into Spanish."},{"Title":"First love (Peacock books)","review":"This book is good, with language anyone can understand and a story that is interesting from the start.

I would take all Botkin writes with a grain of salt, but it is a look at history in his view."},{"Title":"The Case Against Christ","review":"Some people think that being a Christian means that you have to put your brain on standby modus. John Young does not agree.At the time when he published his first book, The Case Against Christ, John Young was chaplain-lecturer at Bishop Otter College in Chichester, England. He wrote the book both to present non-believers with the evidence for the Christian faith and to equip fellow believers to know how to answer common attacks against Christianity. Hence the subtitle \\"Some Statements for the Defence.\\"THE QUESTIONSThe following are the main arguments against Christianity that Mr. Young addresses:1. Isn't it only odd people who become Christians?2. Hasn't science disproved Christianity?3. Isn't the Bible mostly fiction?4. How can you believe in God if you look at all the suffering in the world?5. What makes Jesus so different from other founders of religion?6. Do you really expect me to believe something so fantastic as the resurrection?7. Where is the proof for God's existence and the truth of Christianity?THE ANSWERSThe answers provided by the author are these:1. Christianity attracts all kinds of people, including the odd ones. But this does not prove anything about the truth or falsehood of Christianity; it merely proves that Christianity is a religion in which the down-and-outers find acceptance and forgiveness.2. No, science has not shown Christianity to be false. The very nature of science is to look at how reality functions; it does not deal with the issue of why it functions or what makes it work. To the question \\"Why is the kettle boiling?\\" science would answer \\"When the temperature of water is raised to 100C (at standard pressure), extremely rapid evaporation takes place.\\" But this only explains the physical processes of boiling water. The answer as to the why of the boiling in this particular case might be \\"Because it is 4 o'clock, and old Mrs. Brown always makes a cup of tea at that time.\\" The former scientific statement does not contradict the latter statement about Mrs. Brown; both answers are true because they address different issues. It is the same with science and Christianity.3. No, the Bible is not mostly fiction. There is enough evidence to believe that the most important things in the Bible (such as the life of Christ) give us quite an accurate picture of what really happened. John Young uses several arguments and research data to substantiate his position.4. The suffering in the world is not an easy problem, but the ultimate answer lies in the cross of Christ. Whatever God is up to in this difficult world, He Himself has taken his own medicine, so to speak.5. The main difference between Jesus and other founders of religion is His claim of being God. This shocking claim gives us three options: (1) either Jesus was an outright liar, (2) a lunatic, or (3) the God that He claimed to be. Mr. Young shows the only sensible answer is number 3.6. In light of historical evidence, the resurrection is not so fantastic as it might seem.7. Once again, the main proof lies with Christ Himself. Once we have accepted His claim and His resurrection, the existence of God and truth of Christianity automatically follow.MY EXPERIENCE OF READING THE BOOKThe book was an extremely easy read. All the points are stated in a clear, succinct manner, and are underlined by easy-to-understand illustrations.Its main weakness, however, is its brevity. Due to its size, the book does not address possible counter arguments to its position.THE HEART OF THE BOOKThe heart of the book, and thus also of this review, is stated well in the author's own words:\\"The basic reason why I am a Christian is not because I have a religious temperament (I'm not sure that I have); nor because I find it convenient (its moral teaching is often extremely inconvenient); nor because it brings comfort (although it does); nor even because I find in it the strength I need to live my daily life (although I do).I am a Christian because I am convinced that Christianity is true. If anyone could show me that it is not true, then I would have nothing more to do with it.\\"- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C. S. Lewis Book on the Bible: What the Greatest Christian Writer Thought About the Greatest Book"},{"Title":"The Case Against Christ","review":"This is a thorough revision of the book first published in 1986 and it is updated with large numbers of modern references - The Da Vinci Code, Hurricane Katrina, Britney Spears. The book sets out the case for Christianity whilst exploring potential objections about the church, science, the Bible, suffering, Jesus and proof.It's easy to read with lots of helpful quotations but by necessity in a 200 page book it doesn't delve all that deeply into any of the subjects. Although argued well, I am dubious that it would convert any atheists or agnostics - I suspect it's most helpful as a tool for Christians to be able to \\"give reasons for the hope that is in you\\"."},{"Title":"The Case Against Christ","review":"Over his long ministry in the missioners' network York Course co-founder John Young has identified numerous witnesses and stories that serve to build Christian conviction. This revision of his best seller The Case Against Christ has new riches that were being presented in my own sermons days after completing John's book. It is a preacher's gold mine!The story of Bishop Stephen Cottrell's vocation flowing from the impact upon him of the Jesus of Nazareth film fitted Holy Week, just as the perceived appearance of an additional person on Shackleton's life-saving march fitted Eastertide. Preachers and chloroform have an affinity! Did you know the first surgeon to use the anaesthetic properties of chloroform, Sir James Young Simpson (1811-70), asked to name his greatest discovery wrote: \`It is not chloroform. My greatest discovery has been to know I am a sinner and that I could be saved by the grace of God'.John would appreciate humour in this review because he has seven \`take a break' joke pages interspersed among his 300 pages. I liked the joke about the pews that rolled to the front as they filled up, with a trap door opening under the pulpit after 15 minutes! And the little boy who finds an old leaf in a family bible and holds it up \`Mum, I think I've just found Adam's suit!'Humour apart Lord...Help My Unbelief is tackling an extremely serious matter: the fashionable culture of unbelief and how we can shake its complacency. I particularly valued the examination of the resurrection, deemed \`the heart of the matter', in Michael Ramsey's words: \`no resurrection, no Christianity'. Hans Kung's observation that no founder of a religion lived in so restricted an area or died so young is trenchant, as is John's assessment that the astonishing growth of the Christian movement is \`a big fact' requiring a sufficiently big explanation: \`Resurrection is exactly the right size'.Among the many contemporary witnesses to Christian truth quoted are: BBC's John Simpson, aided by his Anglican faith to come to terms with a colleague's death in a war zone; Francis Collins, former Head of the Human Genome Project, who sees \`no conflict in being a rigorous scientist and a person who believes in a God who takes a personal interest in each one of us' and Eglantyne Jebb whose encounter with God in Christ spurred a quest for social justice so that Save the Children grew out of her work for starving children.John Polkinghorne writes a chapter with a critique of Richard Dawkins \`The God Delusion' noting Dawkins' striking admission that \`we, alone on Earth, can rebel against the selfish replicators'. His inference that we should so rebel witnesses a deeper power at work than his \`selfish gene' and links to an altruism championed by religion. As said elsewhere in the book, a scientific explanation of the world does not disprove that of religion, \`to suggest that it does is like arguing that the scientific explanation for a boiling kettle proves that no one wants a cup of tea! The two explanations are complementary. They stand side by side and fit together'.This book is a great apologetics' resource with potential to engage enquirers and lift Christians off their back foot even if, as it says in conclusion, \`Christianity isn't an intellectual puzzle to be solved. It is a relationship to be enjoyed and a way of life to be embraced'."},{"Title":"The Case Against Christ","review":"I gave it a quick look over, it's a weak case for Jesus, when it is even mentioning him.

An excellent dictionary in every respect."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This is a well-written, inexpensive dictionary that covers pretty much every term and genre an English lit student is likely to come across. For those with an interest in continental European literature, a substantial number of critical terms from European languages (especially French) are included, even when those terms are rarely if ever used in English-language criticism. There is also some, but not much, coverage of terms from Asian languages.If you're after more examples of the metres and poetic forms described, many can be found in John Hollander's excellent little book \\"Rhyme's Reason\\" (ISBN: 0-300-08832-9)."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This reference book is an incredible bargain for its price.I decided to write a review only for one reason: when I purchased the book, I read the author's preface and was saddened to learn, that examples of meters and verses were omitted because of costs!!I hope that the editors who made that decision will have enough time left to deeply regret this decision. This book would be the standard reference guide had the author been given a chance to include the examples he had in mind."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This book would be a good resource for people starting out in an English program, or even advanced High School students but for more seasoned students in graduate programs, a heftier book is necessary, especially if you are working with theorists like Foucault, Lacan, Freud, etc. If you are using them, go with the Cambridge Literary Theory dictionary. It has many more references."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This book is strongly recommended for all undergraduate students of Literature. You can check out unfamiliar literary terms in this book and all explanations are thorough and easy to follow. Clear examples of how literary terms are used can be found throughout the book. Get one now if you have not done so!"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This is a handy inexpensive reference book with much more than a dictionary on some interesting items but less on lots of other things, so it is very specific to literary purposes giving special help in history of literary terms. Since it works more like a history of those terms it gives J.A. Cuddon a wonderful opportunity to display his research skills and demonstrate interesting connections that otherwise would be missed. It works well as a required text for entrance level literature classes in the undergraduate level."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"An excellent, detailed and comprehensive source for beginners and experienced alike."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"I am a first year PhD student in comparative literature and I was hoping that this book would illuminate some of the often obscure terms used in my field of study. However, the two times I consulted the book trying to find a concise definition of a rather common term (the first one being simulacrum and the second one being metaphysics), I was disappointed by absence. There is a definition of \\"metaphysical,\\" but it only refers to a British literary movement, and not to the term used in philosophy. I am sorry to be the first reviewer to give this dictionary less than three stars, but a so-called dictionary of literary theory that doesn't contain terms that aren't exactly uncommon in the field deserves no more."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"You get a lot of value for the money with this one. For a reasonable price you get almost 1000 pages of literary information. Every obscure literary term imaginable is here, but that's not why I am taking the time to praise this handy little volume. It's a browsers dream.What I found most interesting were the lengthy sections on genres. There are pages devoted to specific types of novels, dramas, and poems. There are luxuriously long sections on science fiction novels, crime fiction, pastoral writings, short stories, gothic fiction, comic drama, and a host of other such topics. When you go to the short story section, for instance, you will find 12 pages dedicated to coverage of authors and their works dating from biblical times to the present (1998). I quickly found recommended writers that I hadn't known along with those I was well acquainted with. Although this book was inexpensive, I have spent many times its purchase price buying new books that I found referenced in this Dictionary. There are no individual entries for authors or their works in this book. For that you need to go to books like the Oxford, Cambridge, New York Public Library or Benet's literature reference works.In poetry sections you will find examples of the type of verse being discussed. You will be amused at some of the entries provided under \\"light verse\\" and \\"limericks\\". There is even a heading for \\"shaggy dog story\\".Any weaknesses to the book? Well there are a few. This book has a single author, unlike many reference works that have a group of contributors. This can lead to weak sections that are outside the solo author's expertise. Every reader will find a favorite author or two missing from the genre sections. I was appalled, for instance, to find no mention of Flannery O'Connor in the section on American short story authors. As the author is English, there may also be a slight bias toward English writers. I was also somewhat annoyed that Mr. Cuddon often -but not always- didn't take the time to give a foreign title its English translation. Would it have hurt him to list the Victor Hugo novel as \\"Toilers of the Sea\\" instead of \\"Les Travailleurs de le Mer\\"?I am a hopeless book addict, and this little reference work really made my day(s)."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This addictive dictionary can be (and frequently is, I believe) read from cover to cover. Hundreds of fascinating poetic forms, genres and movements are covered, the definitions are informative and often ironically detached (note the studiedly lapidary comments on Welsh poetry), virtually all major European literatures are taken into account, plus there are comments on Slavonic folklore, Korean poetry, Welsh prosody, and ancient Greek literary theory.The wiring and plumbing of the book, its cross-referencing system, is admirably done and very helpful, luring the reader into a rollercoaster ride across centuries.Another notable quality is the rich number of examples, especially of the titles of a legion of important / interesting / fascinating / demented literary works often buried in the sands of time. Unfortunately, however, many metric and strophic forms must go without illustration for reasons of space: a fact deplored by Cuddon himself in the preface.But this does not detract from the book's worth: its logical structure and lucid explanations, combined with its author's awesome erudition, make this a priceless reference work."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"This comprehensive dictionary of literary terms covers much, much more than any other book I've found. It concisely defines literary periods, critical schools, artistic movements, techniques, genres, structural elements, and the derivations of each. No term is too obscure for this volume. Want to know what a rime &eacute;quivoqu&eacute;e is? Forget what is meant by post-modernism? What was the Florida Street group and with whom did the members identify? Need classic examples of a parody? How does the word &quot;forensics&quot; apply to poetry? You'll find it all in this book of nearly 1000 pages.This is a highly valuable book for anyone deeply interested in literature and its expressions."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"Under twenty dollars for a well thought-out, expertly assembled dictionary of over a thousand pages makes this Penguin an excellent purchase. As for the content, I will simply &quot;second&quot; the observations of earlier reviewers - and recommend that you look through their notes below to be sure this is what you want. This review is just to offer...One CAVEAT: This inch-and-three-quarters paperback is extremely valuable and deserves to get well thumbed-over by any student of English literature or criticism in general. One could only wish that the publisher had released it in a &quot;quality paperback&quot; format that would better survive such thumbing. The present release (a 2000 paperback reissue of the 1998 hardback) is closer in quality to a mass market paperback, with newsprint grade paper, etc. Annotators and highlighters will find their inks bleeding severely through the pages.Unfortunately, few of us will have the C-note to lay out for the (presumably much better produced) hardback edition... which would be a *real* treat to keep at one's writing table. Until you win the lottery(or Penguin releases a quality paperback), grab the affordable paperback: it's rewarding enough to keep you *wanting* to highlight, although disappointing when you do."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (The Language Library)","review":"If you are an English major (as I am) then this is the positively best dictionary you can buy for literary terms and theory.

I hadn't been planning to buy it, but my Aunt really thought it looked good. I thought it looked awful. My edition has a gold cover, with gems spilling over a map. I've had it kicking around my house ever since, and finally decided to give it a go.And you know what? It really wasn't bad. It was even pretty okay. Sapir spiced up a fairly stock story (Sekwet of the Holy Gwail Number 21345001) with clever details and knowledge of the world of gemstones. He didn't take many of the any number of horribly predictable things he could have done. The plotting was clever and fast-paced. I mostly liked the characters.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a *great* book. There were places where the prose was very clunky, particularly towards the beginning. Still, it didn't slow me down or detract too badly from the entertainment.I'll keep an eye out for more Sapir in the future."},{"Title":"Quest","review":"I read this book some years ago, mostly because I had read a few of the Destroyer series, which I found fun, but hardly of the caliber this book achieves. I found it to be one of the best crafted pieces of historical fiction I had ever read. Sapir does a wonderful job of weaving together the stuff of legends and history with the magnitude of the Grail. He splices it all together with modern political intrigue and builds the search around such well developed and complex characters it is truly a read which will stay with you, as it has with me, for years and years.

After reading the Introduction, I was excited to read the rest of Part I dealing with exam 70-219 - Active Directory Design. However, as I read chapter 1 and then chapter 2, I realized I wasn't learning anything at all. In fact, had I soley read this book as preparation for the 70-217 - Active Directory Infrastructure exam, I would not have passed the exam.The authors state that this book provides real-world case studies and in depth insight into the design of Active Directory based networks.This is simply not the case. The real-world \\"scenario\\" is Catywhompus Construction company which is hardly even mentioned at all, and when it is, in extremely little and/or vague detail.When it comes to practical industry insights, there are none. The authors mention the objectives of exam 70-219 but fail to provide any meaningful knowledge of the material. The only way I can describe it is imagine an Air Force jet doing a fly-by, one second it's here, the next it's gone, never really having touched down. That's exactly the kind of information you will get from this book. There are only 5 chapters on Active Directory design.If you are looking for a book that will teach you how to effectively design an Active Directory based network and give you insights into how Microsoft is thinking when they develop their exam questions, this is not the book for you.

Sorry I was just looking back to the day of the award ceremony. A Corner of the Universe has also won many other awards such as; Newberry Honor, ALA booklist, ALA Notable for Children and many more. The author is Ann M. Martin. She has also written the Baby Sitters Club and Here Today. I loved the book A Corner of the Universe, not only the plot but the loving connection and bond between Hattie and Adam.Hattie Owen doesn't have an average household. She lives in a boarding house that her parents own. Everyone in the boarding house is like one big happy family. But a new addition will soon be added. Hattie had discovered that she has an Uncle that she has never heard of, Uncle Adam. Hattie knows little of Adam and finds out that he has a mental disability. The extraordinary bond fills both Hattie and Adam's hearts. But when it all seems to be going fine an unexpected twist makes its way up to the surface.It's funny, because I find my self looking for the characters in real life. Everyday I find myself expecting to see the characters in my neighbor's yard or taking a walk. They seem so real. The characters in the book have so much personality. I felt like I knew everyone of them, they had such emotion. For instance, when ever Adam would come to visit Hattie, he'd always jump with joy, clap his hands and yell her name. They also had likes and dislikes. Adam loved \\"I love Lucy\\"; he'd always talk about it. Also Hattie wasn't too crazy about her Grandmother. If you read this by the end of the book you'll be looking for them too!The book is also very easy to understand. It's very clear because the author has a character telling the story, so it's like she's talking to you. It's very helpful to have it be easy to read because then you understand it, and stay tuned in with the book.You'll love the characters, the heart warming experience, and the bond between Hattie and Adam. This book is recommended for everyone above the ages of 8. You'll laugh out loud, and possibly a tear shall fall down your face, but whether it shall be a tear of joy or sorrow that's not for me to say."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I don\`t think that I will ever find another book in the world like this one.

A Corner of the Universe is a realistic fiction book.Hattie figured that it was going to be another lonely summer, until Adam came. Every summer Hattie spent home with her boarders because her only friend goes to a summerhouse. Then she found out her uncle, who she never knew existed, was going to come back to live. Adam's school was closing down so he had to move back with his parents. Hattie didn't care what people thought of him, she was going to love him and treat him normally no matter what. She ends up finding both good and bad qualities in Adam. Not only does she meet her uncle Adam, she gets to meet two new girls.I would rate this book a four. While reading this book, I could feel every emotion. Between parts I would feel both hurt and anger. Throughout the book I talked back to the characters.

Martin. Hattie's universe defiantly changes when her 21 year old mentally ill Uncle Adam, who she had never heard about stays with Hattie for the summer. It is one of my favorite books because it was a very moving book that had me captivated. When I was reading this book I truly felt sympathy for Adam when and for Hattie who tried to make her uncle's live more thrilling. I definitely would recommend this book to a friend!The book is taken from the perspective of a shy girl who is twelve who had few friends. I happen to be nothing like her, but I was still drawn into her character. It felt like I was living with Hattie and was able to feel what she felt. The book had a lot of realistic problems like autism, relationships, death, and even friendship. Hattie goes through a lot of things in one summer; this book takes you through her 12th summer in which a great quantity of events occurred.In the book a carnival comes to town and Hattie befriends the girl that works there. Hattie and the girl from the carnival take her Uncle Adam to the carnival so that he could have a fun time. Hattie's grandmother whom she calls Nana was difficult. Hattie felt that Nana was very harsh to her son Adam. I feel that sometimes Nana was a little harsh with her uncle Adam, but I know that inside all she really wanted was to protect her son. Underneath the rich, stuck up, white gloved woman there was love, love for her son! When I first started to read this book I thought that Nana was an evil woman, but when I got near the end of the book I realized that she wasn't at all unpleasant and dreadful. I loved how in the book the characters personalities changed.A Corner Of the Universe, by Ann M. Martin is one of the best books that I have read in two years! It has amazing characters and great descriptive details. This book taught me to enjoy life and to be thankful that my family and I are healthy and well. I would definitely recommend this book to both kids and adults. As I said in the beginning this is a touching tear-jerker that is hard to put down once you start reading it.

Adam is described as \\"mentally ill,\\" although \\"autistic\\" might be a better description. Adam is a young man with the mind of a child, and through her interactions with him, Hattie is drawn out of her sheltered, comfortable world and into a more nuanced understanding of herself and the people around her. The story takes place in 1960, a fitting year for a story about an end to innocence. Frequent but not glaringly intrusive pop-culture references ground the story firmly in its time setting, and Hattie is realistic as a child of her era while still fully relatable to the young people of today. A delightful cast of characters and some suspenseful foreshadowing will keep readers intrigued. I wouldn't recommend this book for readers younger than eleven or so, due to some relatively mature thematic content, but sensitive and intelligent middle schoolers will appreciate this book for presenting life as it truly is: poignant, vivid, sometimes sad, lacking in tidy resolution."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Ho, ho ,ho (as Adam would say) what a great book this is readers!

The other main character is Hattie and for the first time she meets her uncle, Adam. And guess how old she is? 12! Some misfortunate things happen though and let's just say Adam is afraid of Ferris Wheels.

Adam is so sweet he is my favorite character in this book and he acts like a kid even though he is 21 and Hattie's uncle. Honestly I would want to be related to Adam even though he is mental. There is much, much more I could say about this book but you will have to read the book to find what else happens! ~farve"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"This book is about a girl named Hattie Owen.

She asks her mother why she hasnt heard of him before and why her mom hasnt told her about him. Her mom replies that Adam has mental problems. Adam is Nana and Papas son. They took him to doctors when he was little and they say he's autistic and all sorts of things. Hattie's mom says that Adam's \\"special school\\" has closed down so he's going to come home and stay with Nana and Papa for a while. When Hattie meets Adam she feels awkward. Adam randomly recites phrases and quotes from I Love Lucy. He also repeats things.He also is in love with Angel Valentine and loves to see her but can't a lot of the times because she works at a bank. Hattie likes that Adam is happy but sometimes she feels like she has to babysit him all the time.As Hattie feels like shes his babysitter, mom, and niece she realizes that she and Adam have a lot of things in common. They both sometimes feel like aliens, like they dont belong.Hattie decides that she wants to go to Fred Carmels Funtime Carnival. While she's there she meets a girl named Leila. Leila works at the carnival and so does her family.Hattie tells Leila about Adam and Leila wants to meet Adam. So Hattie sneaks Adam out of Nana's and Papa's house and takes him to the carnival. Adam doesnt like rides but he wants to try the ferris wheel. When Leila, Hattie, and Adam get on the ferris wheel it gets stuck. Adam starts acting crazy and starts to climb out. So some people call the police and take Adam to the hospital. When he comes back home he comes to Hatties house. They sit on the porch and talk.Adam says that he thinks Hattie is one of the people that can lift the corners of our universe. Hattie doesnt get this and doesnt ask. Angel Valentine is at home so Adam and Hattie go upstairs. Adam goes inside and finds Angel with her boyfriend. He runs away and Hattie assumes that he ran to Nana and Papa's house. But when she woke up she found out that Adam hung himself. Adams death leaves the family with tragedy. In a way Hattie gets what Adam means.

The fantastic 189 page book takes place at Hattie Owen's house and the fairgrouds.A RETARDED UNCLE, AN AWESOME BOOK!Hattie Owen\`s uncle Adam is retarded. Not physically, but mentally. Adam can be feeling great, then burst into tears. Adam has perfectly normal characteristics such as his massive crush on Hattie's families' boarder, Angel Valentine. Meanwhile, Hattie finds a friend at Fred's Fun time Carnival that has just come to town, so Hattie takes her Uncle Adam. After they had gone a lot, Adam decides to do something with Hattie on her birthday... ride the Ferris wheel. Once they get to the top, something drastic happens. Where did Adam go?I'M FEELING IT!In this book, Ann M. Martin really makes you feel like you are there seeing everything. She gave me the perfect image. I can feel Hattie's happiness, and I can also feel Adam's anger at being called a freak.A SPECIAL PIECE OF THE UNIVERSEMy favorite part in this book is when Hattie describes the buzzer that her nana pushes on with her foot to get her maid.

Hattie now realizes that her nana and papa aren't the most perfect happiest rich people. She sees people living in her own boarding house lying to her parents. Most importantly she finds those you truly think are happy always hide something inside. This is how it is with Adam and when no one but Hattie starts to realize this something major may happen that Hattie doesn't know about until it happens.I feel bad for Adam because no one can comprehend how he feels and what its like. When Hattie starts to understand a little she can feel some of his pain. I believe Hattie appreciates the summer she spent with her uncle Adam. I feel this way because it opened her eyes and let her see the world in a new way. Adam made Hattie appreciate and love the world far more than she ever did before."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"A Corner of the Universe by Ann M. Martin is a great book.

As I was reading the book, I felt sad that some people called Adam names because that made him really depressed.I think this book had a doable length in pages. There are 189 pages in this book and I felt that was a great length to read. Not too long not too short. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.

Martin. Hattie's universe defiantly changes when her 21 year old mentally ill Uncle Adam, who she had never heard about stays with Hattie for the summer. It is one of my favorite books because it was a very moving book that had me captivated. When I was reading this book I truly felt sympathy for Adam when and for Hattie who tried to make her uncle's live more thrilling. I definitely would recommend this book to a friend!The book is taken from the perspective of a shy girl who is twelve who had few friends. I happen to be nothing like her, but I was still drawn into her character. It felt like I was living with Hattie and was able to feel what she felt. The book had a lot of realistic problems like autism, relationships, death, and even friendship. Hattie goes through a lot of things in one summer; this book takes you through her 12th summer in which a great quantity of events occurred.In the book a carnival comes to town and Hattie befriends the girl that works there. Hattie and the girl from the carnival take her Uncle Adam to the carnival so that he could have a fun time. Hattie's grandmother whom she calls Nana was difficult. Hattie felt that Nana was very harsh to her son Adam. I feel that sometimes Nana was a little harsh with her uncle Adam, but I know that inside all she really wanted was to protect her son. Underneath the rich, stuck up, white gloved woman there was love, love for her son! When I first started to read this book I thought that Nana was an evil woman, but when I got near the end of the book I realized that she wasn't at all unpleasant and dreadful. I loved how in the book the characters personalities changed.A Corner Of the Universe, by Ann M. Martin is one of the best books that I have read in two years! It has amazing characters and great descriptive details. This book taught me to enjoy life and to be thankful that my family and I are healthy and well. I would definitely recommend this book to both kids and adults. As I said in the beginning this is a touching tear-jerker that is hard to put down once you start reading it.

My daughter has read other books by Martin and when I read the synopsis it seemed to be very much in a similar vein.

The characters were all well developed and became life-like. The plot was very realistic and related a very touchy subject with perfection. Ann M.

I usually enjoy the books that win the awards, bu I must say, this book is very boring. Get to know the life story of 11-year-old Hattie Owen and her mentally ill uncle, who the author tries to portray as sweet and lovable, but he really just manages to get on the readers nerves. So does Hattie. Her only friends are the old people that live in her boarding house, and one girl that lives down the street who is introduced in the book then leaves the picture on a summer vacation that Hattie turns down an offer to go to, because she would miss all the old people in her house. Then her uncle shows up whom she never knew about. He lives with her gradnmother and gradnfather, who keep their noses way up high in the air. He is sort of a disgrace to their \\"perfect\\" family. Follow Hattie around with her uncle Adam, wonder about how she can actuallt put up with him, get to know her new circus friends, and then try to force yourself to cry at the ending to prove to yourself that you're humain, but you probably will just be relieved.

She sees a joy in life through his eyes that she has never seen before and she learns a sense of responsibility and righteousness in situations where she would otherwise not have been challenged. His presence and his own personal mental challenges/illness give Hattie insight into her family members and the lives they lived before she existed. And while Hattie does find friendship with a like-aged young woman who proves that not all teens are insensitive and self-centered, it is Adam who helps her understand herself and the world a little better, even when some of the lessons are hard to learn.While A Corner of the Universe is not a book that keeps the reader riveted at attention with action packed scenes of danger and fantasy, Hattie's growth as a character is exceptional and the treatment of difficult subject matter is handled with such skill that A Corner of the Universe is a wonderful read for any age."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I recentally read the book A Corner of the Univese by Ann M Martin and I personally think it's the best book i have ever read!

But one day her parents told her she had an uncle that she never knew about. But there was one problem. He was mentally ill. Also that he was coming to stay with her grandparents, who live down the street from Hattie and her parents. When Adam got to her grandparents house they came over to visit him. Hattie really liked her uncle but she felt more like a babysitter that a niece. Hattie spent all her time playing and having fun with Adam.

It is also about a 12 year old girl named Hattie Owen who gets to know her uncle, Adam, and his world. The story occurs during the summer of 1958 in a small town in Millerton. Hattie lives in a boarding house managed by her parents. Adam and Hattie enjoy going to Fred Carmel's Funtime Carnival together. The plot of this story is having Adam come back to live with his parents, after all these years of never mentioning him. Hattie is curious about her uncle and decides to meet him, and from there after Hattie begins to grow closer to her uncle. This book is influential because it causes you to think about how precious life really is, and about the obstacles the mentally disabled face, and to make you understand and realize that despite their differences, they are just like us. When I first began reading this book, I wanted to know more about Adam. After reading the book, I thought about people who are like Adam, and what it would be like if I were in his shoes; How would others treat me? Honestly, I also felt the need to visit the nearest carnival. This book tells me that the mentally disabled should be treated the way you would treat those you care about. From reading \\"A Corner of the Universe\\", I have learned how to cope with loss, and the true value of a life. Ann M. Martin uses figures of speech in her style of writing, including similes.

I thought this book was very good, and it was a page turner.Throughout this book, a family learns to accept people for who they are, and not what they act or look like. In the beginning, a twelve year old girl named, Hattie, describes her life. She lives in a boarding house with her parents and the other occupants. Hattie's grandparents live just down the street from her house, however, they don't come over a lot because they don't approve of the way Hattie's parents chose to live. That is the one and only problem Hattie has in her life, until she discovers a family member that she never even knew existed, her uncle.Adam, Hattie's uncle, is mentally handicapped and was sent home when his school was closed down. Hattie and Adam grow so close that people say they act almost like they are brother and sister. However, when the circus comes to town Hattie, Adam, and their new friend make some bad choices, and when they get caught, Hattie and Adam's lives are forever changed. They are no longer allowed to speak to each other and rarely get to see each other. This all happens because of her grandparents' choices. However, these choices will force someone over the breaking point. Will it be Adam or Hattie and will it be a life threatening choice? You will have to read the book to find out!Some likes I had for this book were how close Adam and his niece, Hattie were. I liked how they didn't know each other their whole lives, but when they met, they just clicked. A dislike I had for this book was how Hattie's kindred treated Adam. They treated him like a child, and not like the adult he was. Unlike, Hattie, who treated him like a human being, and that was why he always chose to be with her.People I would recommend this book to would be anyone. Especially, people who like page turners because this book was so good I could never put it down. It kept me guessing with every turning page. I kept wondering if Adam's family would ever treat him like he should have been treated, or continue to treat him like aChild."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I read the book a Corner of the Universe, by Ann a.

What's interesting is that Hattie didn't even know she had an Uncle Adam until she was 12 years old.Hattie is excited that summer has begun even if it means staying in town and helping her parents run a boarding house. Then, out of the blue, comes Uncle Adam. Uncle Adam is special. In other words, he has \\"mental problems\\" according to Hattie's mom and grandparents.But to Hattie, Adam has an out-going personality which is just infectious...well, just to Hattie. She just cannot wait but to hang out with him and show him off, especially to her new friend, who is in town as part of a traveling circus.However, not everyone in Hattie's family share the positive welcome and acceptance of Uncle Adam. Little by little, Hattie rebels, especially to her grandparents, because she is appalled by how they treat Uncle Adam. However, she starts to learn a little more, day by day, about her Uncle Adam. It is a summer that Hattie will never forget.I found this book by Ann Martin to be a wonderful read on acceptance and bias.

The young adults of this generation could use more books with that theme. A caution, though. My daughter, 10, was taken aback by a scene which alluded to sexual activity. Although not graphic, the scene does speak of clothing discarded, etc. If your child has not had \\"the talk\\" it may precipitate the need for it."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Hattie is a twelve year old girl who lives in Millerton with her mom and dad.

Adam is the uncle Hattie Owens never knew she had until he crashes into her life during the memorable summer of 1960. Hattie is the shy homebody who narrarates the events in A Corner of the Universe.The 11-going-on-12 year-old enjoys spending her summers talking to the boarders at her parents' house, chatting with adults in her quiet, little town, reading piles of books, and avoiding unpleasant characters like her overbearing Nana and rude classmates. Then the special school Adam has lived at most of his life closes and Hattie's newfound relative changes the girl's summer, and her life.Even though Adam is 21, he usually seems more like a friend or even a younger brother than an adult. Adam is different. He can be livelier, more enthusiastic, happier than anyone Hattie's ever known, but he is also erratic -- disturbingly, and even dangerously so.Within the small confines of a Midwestern town, Ann M. Martin creates a large, complex world - full of quirky boarders, a thrilling carnival, family dysfunctions, unusual friendships, and the girl in the middle of it all. Except for the occasional use of phrases no adult would utter, let alone a 12 year-old, Hattie's voice is well-developed and true to life: she raises questions and makes observations that go unanswered; she experiences strong, turbulent feelings that contradict each other.A Corner of the Universe is tightly written and quick-paced, guiding the reader through a bittersweet slice of life. It is an important novel about mental illness, family, and growing up and I would gladly recommend it to any mature youngster."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"The book, \\" A Corner of Universe,\\" by Ann M.

Adam is not your ordinary uncle. Instead he has problems, but this does not damper Hattie's love or compassion for her uncle. Hattie's, grandparents are somewhat ashamed of Adam, and strive to keep him out of public site. During the long summer days, Adam and Hattie, are happy with each other's company and find love and friendship, and are happy to be in each others company. Adam eventually meets Angel Valentine, and is overwhelmed with her beauty. He takes her flowers and finds her in the arms of her boyfriend. Since Adam is mentally challenged, he finds it difficult to face the fact that young Angel Valentine, does not return the same love for him. This story has a very sad ending.

ShimPeriod: P.6Hattie Owen, a teenage girl, just about to turn twelve, goes through the biggest change in her life as she soon meets her young uncle Adam. Hattie did not know the she had, yet, another uncle until she soon suddenly finds out that he is visiting in her town. She finds out that Uncle Adam is not a normal uncle, it didn't take her long to figure out that Uncle Adam had mental disabilities. Her parents ran a boarding house that was occupied with Cookie; the cook, Miss Hagerty; an old grandma that lives in her house, Mr. Penny; the old man who used to run the old clock repair shop, and Angel Valentine; a young worker in the bank. When Hattie first met Uncle Adam, she thought that Uncle Adam was the strangest person she had ever met. Later on, Hattie became to understand how to react to Adam's problems and soon got closer to Adam. Adam had a HUGE crush on Angel Valentine. She was a very beautiful woman and Adam liked her a lot, but Angel had a boyfriend, and soon Adam caught Angel's boyfriend in Angel's apartment and dropped the flowers that he was going to give to her. He ran away and didn't come back. No one knew where he was. Everyone was looking for him, and later, Hattie's parents tell her that Uncle Adam had hung himself, and Hattie understood why, he was hurt, his feelings were hurt of being teased, being pressured, and being heartbroken by Angel Valentine.I really enjoyed reading this book, because i got to understand how people really felt when they had a mentally ill family member. This book really spoke to me, when I read it, i felt as if I was there, as if I was Hattie Owen. My favorite quote is the last sentences of the end of the book, \\"It's all about changing what's handed to you, about poking around a little, lifting the corners, seeing what's underneath, poking that. Sometimes things work out, sometimes they don't, but at least you're exploring. And life is always more interesting that way.\\" That quote really helped me in my life too. I always would get upset if something would go wrong, but now I calm down and think, 'There's always a solution.' Another quote that really captured me was when Hattie, her mother, and her father sit together and talk about one thing that they really remembered about Adam, \\"But the next night, Mom says, \\"Adam was brave.\\" and Dad says, \\"Adam could see right into your soul.\\" And I say, \\"Adam was different.\\"\\"My most favorite part in the book, was when Hattie and Adam go to a carnival and ride a Ferris wheel with Hattie's friend Leila, and then all of a sudden the Ferris wheel gets stuck and they're on the highest spot and then Adam panics and starts shouting, he gets scared and starts trying to get out of the car of the Ferris wheel, Leila and Hattie try everything to stop him, they get bruised and hurt badly. I liked this part of the story, because I remember I was like Adam once when I was on the Ferris wheel with my friend and I started screaming, I started panicking, and i enjoyed reading that part because it was thrilling to read a part where I've experienced before. The part that I disliked the most was when Adam hung himself. I felt that was a very sad moment and it made me sad to know that Adam had killed himself, and also angry at Angel Valentine to have not locked her door and had let Adam open the door on her and her boyfriend. Most important of all, I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"A Corner of the UniverseBy: Ann M. MartinNonfictionThis book is about Hattie.

It's with Adam's extremely humerous self and Hattie's friendly spirit that they became insprarable that summer. they always had fun together until one night when Nana had a partyand told Adam to stay upsrairs in his room. Hattie wanted Adam to have fun so she sneaked Adam out of the house and took him to the circus.

The answer is obvious, hardly ever. That was what 12-year-old Hattie thought her whole life; her daily routine is always the same everyday. She was the narrator of the book, A Corner of the Universe by Ann M. Martin, in which a story took place in a small town of Millerton. Hattie was a loner who prefers the company of residents in a boardinghouse that her parents run rather than her rude and disrespectful classmates. When her 21-year-old Uncle Adam, who has mental problem, came to her life, she found him to be a challenging but valuable friend. Adam helped Hattie understand herself family, her friendships, and the world a little better. Together, they experienced a memorable adventure in a carnival with their friend, Leila. After a few trips to the carnival together, Hattie started to think that Adam was just like you and me; he was very intelligent, and most of all, he had feelings just like us. He fell in love with a very gorgeous, young lady, Angel, who lived in the boardinghouse. Then something went terribly wrong happened between them, and Adam went crazy and out of control. I think the author was trying to express this phrase, \\"Do not judge a book by its cover.\\" In other words, you should judge a person from what is deep inside his heart rather than how he looks from the outside. You should look at someone's strength not his weakness."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Are you looking for an awesome book that you can't put down? A Corner of the Universe by Ann Martin is an enjoyable realistic fiction. This book won a Newbery Award and was awarded ALA notable book for children. A Corner of the Universe has 192 pages of what I call a true book. Other books by Ann Martin are Here Today, Belle Teal, and the Baby Sitters Club series.At only age 11, Hattie discovers that she has another uncle that she has never met; Adam. When he comes to visit, Hattie finds that Adam is a great person but sometimes he can be childish. When a carnival comes into town, Hattie meets a carnival girl whose family owns the carnival. Adam and Hattie's new friend have a party together for Hattie's 12th birthday and she gets an unexpected gift from her carnival friend! After awhile Hattie gets in trouble and isn't allowed to go to the carnival again until her grandparents agree on the time in which she can go back. Soon after, Hattie finds herself in a tight spot which may just lift the corner of the Universe!While I was reading A Corner of the Universe, I couldn't help but notice the unique characters in this book. They are also described very well. Each and every character is unique in their own way. For example, Hattie's dad is an artist. He can paint fabulous paintings and still spend an equal amount of time with his family. I also noticed that when Adam comes to stay, he gets extremely excited and especially when Angel (She rents a room from Hattie's parents) comes home from work. The author describes Adam very clearly and I can visualize exactly what he looks like! What I find the most interesting is when Hattie meets a friend who lives in a carnival. Her Family owns the whole carnival and she can get whatever she wants for free.I was also impressed by the descriptive setting through this whole book. I saw vivid pictures in my head because of how the author explains each setting. One part in the book the author describes the summer heat. It almost felt as if I were in that same place suffering from the dreadful heat. Another part was when the author described the carnival lights. They sounded exactly as I would imagine it to be when you go to a carnival. One other thing is that when they are having their picnic on the fourth of July, you can visualize the fireworks exactly!A Corner of the Universe is an awesome book that I would recommend to anyone. It is appropriate and enjoyable to both kids and adults! This book is a great choice to read. Let me tell you now that you should read this book slow because it's hard to stop reading once the pages run out!"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"When I was researching the book called A Corner of the Universe I found out that it was a Newberry Honor book. It also made the ALA Book List.This book was obviously well thought of by many people. This book was published in 2002 by Scholastic Book Service. The genre of this book is realistic fiction, because it sounds like a real story that could happen in real life. Here is a list of books that the author Ann M. Martin has written: Belle Teal, Doll People and Here Today. In addition it also made the Kirkus Review. I am not familiar with these different reviews. My opinion about this book was that it was a great, thrilling book that never lost my attention.One boring day, a girl named Hattie meets her Uncle Adam, when he comes to Nana and Papa\` s for the summer. When Adam gets to know Hattie, Adam notices how nice Hattie is. Adam wants to come to her house everyday. When Hattie hears that there is a carnival coming to town she wants to go, so her and her and her family go. While they are there, she meets a carnival girl named Leila. During his summer visit, Adam falls in love with Angel, who is a border at Hattie's house. Adam is yelled at frequently by Nana and Papa. One example of his bad behavior included taking his hand and putting it into his drink to grab the cherry out of the bottom of his glass. After that, Adam has a birthday party at the carnival for Hattie. Then Adam tells Hattie that she can lift the corners of the universe. The carnival leaves town and Hattie misses her chance to say by to Leila, later on when Adam comes to give flowers to Angel, he finds her with Henry and is devastated!When Adam picked flowers out of Nana Papa's garden, he brought them to Hattie's house to give to Angel. But when he got there, Angel was with Henry. When he saw them he stormed off and went to Nana and Papa's. When he got to Nana and Papa's he dropped the flowers and went back into the shed. When he got there, he thought about what happened. Then he finally hung himself. That was the saddest part about this book.A sad part about this story is when Hattie left her house, she was passing where Adam was. While she was passing by, she thought of weather or not to take Adam to the fair. She decided not to. The sad thing is that Adam really wanted to go. It is probably a good thing that Adam didn't go, because it might have ended up in something bad. That was another sad thing that happened at a different time.A summary of my opinion isI think this is one of the best books I have read. At first I thought it was a true story but it was made up. If I were writing this book I might include a picture of Hattie, Leila, and Adam so you can have a visual of what they look like. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes stories that could be real but are fake. This Novel could have been a person's summer because it was so well written."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST INTERESTING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.

To Hattie, Adam and her are standing behind, in the dust. A Corner of the Universe manages to reach the feelings deep down inside. A compassionate tale of fine times, new friends, and every day burdens to mankind.Ann M. Martin takes the burdens that trouble everyone and composes a classic.A Corner of the Universe refers to the every day surprises and challenges brought to you by life. The only feelings that lie in you after you have read this book, Ann M Martin describes perfectly. After this book, you feel like Hattie Owen. Full of despair, understanding, and philosophically at peace.It is the early 1960s. Hattie Owen is your every-day girl. She lives in a small town, and she knows just about everyone. She has two parents, a grandma and a grandpa. Oh yeah and Uncle Adam. He is different. He isn't perfect. No one is. But Hattie's grandma, Nana, thinks she is the epitome of perfect. She expects everyone that is related to her to be perfect. And to make it worse, Hattie didn't know Adam existed until that summer. That was the summer that changed her life.Hattie meets Adam. There is an instant connection. He loves quoting from \\" I Love Lucy\\". That he does. Then Hattie starts seeing flyers all over the town advertising Fred Carmel's Funtime Carnival. She gets her everyone to go and check it out. Everyone but Adam, Nana, and Papa. Nana of course wouldn't want to go near the circus people. There, Hattie meets Leila. Leila works at the carnival. So does her family. Hattie and Leila are the same age. This means a blossoming friendship. And of course that is what happens. Only Nana obviously disapproves. But then Nana and Papa have a dinner, where Adam is of course forbidden to attend along with Hattie. Hattie knows that Adam will be locked in his room. Will Adam enjoy himself? Is Nana the cold-hearted fiend she is put out to be? Read and Find out.It was a perfect night. It was the night of Nana and Papa's big dinner. Of course Hattie couldn't go, so she figured she would go to the carnival and visit with Leila. However, she decided to take Adam along with her. Adam was amazed at the lights and attractions. The first thing he wanted to do was ride the Ferris wheel. But that cheerful event soon turned into a fearful one. Adam, Leila, and Hattie boarded the Ferris wheel.As they stepped into the cart and were buckled in, they rose to the top of the Ferris wheel. Suddenly the Ferris wheel stopped. Adam was horrified. All Hattie saw was the terrible fear in Adam's eyes. Adam unbuckled his seat belt and stood up on the seat of the Ferris wheel. People were beginning to tell the operator to call the police. Adam pushed Hattie to the side when she attempted to bring him back down. Soon enough the Ferris wheel started again. Hattie, Adam, and Leila got off of the ride, and found themselves standing in a crowd surrounding a police car. Hattie's father and Papa pulled up. Adam was put in a straight jacket and sent to the hospital. Hattie was in immense trouble.This book has a theme that you will find as you read through it. You will find yourself in your own corners of the universe, when really there is always someone else waiting to meet you in the same corner. From new friends comes new knowledge, and from new knowledge comes wisdom. Hattie found herself alone, as soon as Adam and Leila arrived, she was not lonely. She had friends. And they were all in their corner of the universe.I would highly recommend this book to any person fascinated with realistic fiction. If you're a person that really likes to read into the lives of someone that feels alone or not yet finding a friend, this would be a perfect book for you. Having read this book I even picked up a few pointers on judging and picking friends. So if you're waiting for one of the best books of your life, your in luck. Ann M. Martin has managed to cultivate a literary masterpiece with A Corner of the Universe."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"What would you do if you had an uncle that you did not know. Well, that's what Hattie Owen has to go through when she's about to turn twelve. Her best friend Betsy is going to Maine for vacation, but Hattie doesn't want to go because she doesn't want to change her everyday schedule.When Hattie meets her uncle Adam, she wondered why her mom did not tell her about him. She finds out that he is ill and was at a school/home for his sickness since Hattie was born. The school is shutting down so he has to come back to live with his family.If you like realistic fiction books, I think you will like this book. I really liked this book because you can imagine yourself in Hattie's place. Ann M. Martin is such a wonderful writer. You can imagine everything she says in your head. You get so into the book that you feel as if you have to finish it today or tomorrow. It is so exciting you want to know what's going to happen next, so you just read on and on until you finish the book. I wish there were a series of A Corner of the Universe.This story is somewhat slow in the beginning so, you have this feeling of you don't want to read it anymore, but then it picks up its pace when Hattie meets Adam. So, if you think it's slow in the beginning give it a second chance, just like what I did.Something surprising happens in the middle/end part of the book that changes Hattie's life, so if you want to know what happens, you have to read this book yourself!"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"This book was a strange book. That's why I didn't really like it. I think that they put in to much characters. Also there were that much of a setting. This was confusing at some parts,and it made me read on at some parts too.This book wouldn't be in my top 20 neither in my top 30. This book would get a three star."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"my friends and i agree that this book rocks!! we all agree that this book is very fun to read and can not be put down easy. this book does not drag on and does not hve to much or to little detail. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"This book, A Corner of the Universe, by Ann M. Martin, was a great book. I picked it up out of curiosity because I saw my friend reading it, and she said it was great. I read this 189 page book in four days I think. It was a real page-turner. I was almost crying at points, but I was laughing at others. I would love to read this book again, and I most definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"The book I read was called \\"A Corner of the Universe\\", by Ann M. Martin. The basic conflict throughout the story was about a little girl named Hattie and how she was growing up in a boarding house. Her parents owned a boarding house and everyday she was learning and growing up with new people that live there. Some of the people that lived there were a little bit strange sometimes but they all gave her good advice. She had an uncle that she had never known about until her mom thought she should know about him. His name was Adam and the reason why she was just learning about him was because the special school Adam had to attend was shutting down and he needed somewhere to stay, so he stayed with his parents that lived down the street from Hattie. Adam was a little bit mentally disabled and had trouble, sometimes, getting along with his parents. The whole story is about Hattie and her relationship with Adam and what she learns from him.I really liked this book because it is different from a lot of books you read. It had some sad and some funny parts but mostly it was about what Hattie learned from Adam. I liked how Hattie was learning from someone that wasn't really trying to teach her anything, but the things he said to her meant a lot. I felt I was in the book when Adam and Hattie were hanging out with each other because every time they were, there was something crazy going on that had a big effect on the book. The main conflict interested me a lot because Adam was usually doing something wrong and making his parents mad, but Hattie was always there to help him, and she was the younger one. The characters were very realistic because the grandparents and parents acted like what they would normally act like. Also, all of the people that lived in the boarding house were like anyone you would meet in real life. The books' ending was satisfying because it pulled the whole book together. Also, it was very touching and Hattie learns something really important.The voice the author was writing about was her point of view and how she grew up. The story is mostly true about her life as a little girl having a mentally ill uncle like Adam. The author uses vocabulary that is pretty simple but you kind of have to figure out what some of the things mean when Adam says them because he uses a lot of phrases from TV shows. The unique characteristics of the authors writing was how she used personification a lot throughout the book and she could describe places very well and the actions that were going on in them. The author's way of using dialogue was good because it always fit with what was going on and she really knew how to use it and when to use it. I think Ann M. Martin is a very good writer because she knows how to set the mood of the book and I think she can really describe and make the characters so they go along with the book.I give this book rating an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because some parts got a little boring and there wasn't really much happening but over all I really liked it and I thought it was kind of sad but in a good way. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a good but serious book that has some funny parts.I liked this book especially the huge important part that happens in the middle, which is one of the most shocking parts about the whole entire book. I like how every chapter ended with a part that made you want to keep reading. Also, how the book started and ended with Hattie watching her family home videos. I think everyone should read this because they will definitely learn something from it."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Our world sometimes includes harsh mental &/or physical challenges which must be dealt with and reconciled into personal realities. Children intuitively know that life is not always fair, but oftentimes their literature implies differently. With committed and loving effort today's parents can help their children understand and deal with our imperfect world.In her excellent, Newberry Honor Book, A CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, Ann M. Martin has prudently touched on a more intensive side of childhood.Ms. Martin's presentation of an 11-12 year-old child protagonist and the inner-dynamics she and her family experience because of her mentally challenged young uncle can help all children learn to face difficult times with courage and honor.I'm purchasing this book for my 12 year-old granddaughter."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"While the hardcover version of this touching story is geared for 9 - 12-year-old readers, it contains a message for all. It is a reminder of the need for compassion and understanding.Beautifully read by two time Tony Award winner Judith Ivey it is the story of a life changing summer for 12-year-old Hattie. Her life has been rather predictable to date. She shares a home with her parents, a boarding house filled with outre characters. The life her mother and father have chosen is not at all in keeping with what her grandparents would wish, but that's fine with Hattie.And then there is a visitor, Adam - a surprising and intriguing young man. What is even more surprising for Hattie is to learn that he is a 21-year-old uncle, someone the family has never mentioned. His school, a home for the mentally impaired, has closed and here he is. Soon, Hattie and Adam are friends. They go places together, and it is through him that her life expands in ways that she had never imagined.All will listen, enjoy, and learn from this tale of friendship and growth.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Hattie Owens is a normal girl in her town of Millerton. Hattie's summer starts the same as it always did, Miss Hagerty's breakfast tray, lemonade on the porch, walks downtown and her best friend leaving for Maine. But the night of the first day of summer Hattie is hit with something that she could never believe. She has an uncle, when besides, her uncle Hayden that lives in California. This uncle is a lot younger than her mother and her uncle. And he was mentally ill and went to school for people with mental illnesses. So when Hattie meets her uncle Adam, who is 21 years old. Overwhelmed Hattie more than she could expect. Adam became one of Hattie best friends, well besides Betsy who had been her friend since kindergarten, Leila, who comes to Millerton traveling with her family's carnival and Catherine who moved into then boarding house that Hattie's family owned. Hattie world change that summer, and as said in the book,\\"My father movies are great but they don't begin to tell the story of the summer. What's left out is more important than what is there. Dad captured the good times and only the good time. The parts he left out are what changed my life\\"I want to tell the ending of the book but I'm not going to do because by telling you the ending without you reading the book you miss the message of the book. I will say this that if you read the book, the ending will surprise as much as it did me. This book is a book that will make you cry and make you laugh, but it bring a message, that many miss. None is perfect, and everyone is the same at heart even if the outside doesn't show that. If I could rate this book pass 5 stars I would. So as Adam says \\"Hattie I believe that you are the one person who can lift the corners of the universe\\""},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I really enjoyed this book - but I read it in my late-twenties. I would lend it to my 13 year old cousin, and maybe my twelve year old cousin, but I'd think twice about giving it to the eleven year old or to my nine year old niece. It's a tween book, not a book for 3rd and 4th graders. Maybe I'm being prudish or old-fashioned (and maybe that's unfair because I was reading Danielle Steel, John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark and VC Andrews at age twelve) but I feel like seventh grade is the youngest a kid should be reading about suicide and sex, which both come up in this.That said, it's an engaging read by one of my favorite authors (I grew up with The Babysitters Club) that I would recommend to tweens and teens and other adults who fondly remember Kristy, Claudia, and Mary Anne, but not to elementary school students. I am always interested in books that feature characters on the autism spectrum. I felt that the character in this probably had Aspergers in addition to schizophrenia; he reminded me of a few other people I know. And it made me glad that we no longer throw our people with ASD in mental institutions to spend their childhoods sad and undervalued."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"This story has absolutely destroyed me. There has never been a book like this before. This tale starts with Hattie a simple almost 12 year old girl. Then enter Adam her estranged uncle she was never told about. Somehow this 21 year old man manages to completely change her life. She seems to be the only one who understands him, which leads her to believe she is like him. She is truly terrified by the prospect. Adam always gives her one compliment he calls her the type of girl \\"that can lift the corners of the universe.\\" She is stumped by this word choice, until the end of our time of peeking into her universe. She quotes at the end of this story \\" It's about changing what's handed to you, about poking around a little.\\" I have only one thing to add to that, it's also about ,to me, being totally fearless about what people think of you and not caring what they may call you, because who knows you may have the opinion to change the world. Thank Ann M. Martin for giving me the gift of guilt. I like so many others have seen someone and limited them have not believed in them when really, believing in someone is the only thing we should do.

This was a great book because it could tell about anyone really. I felt that since the main character Hattie was a person who wasn't anybody special just a normal person. She could be just like anyone that you could meet anywhere but something extraordinary happens to her and it changes her forever. She meets her uncle who has a different way of looking at things and she is forever changed by him. Her new friend from the circus also has a very different life and changes her.

His presence disrupts the orderly life of her wealthy and controlling grandparents, who are left with no other option than to accept him back into their home when his school closes. Hattie, an introspective only child with few friends, feels alternately enchanted by Adam's childlike exuberance and concerned that she might be somehow \\"like him.\\" She becomes protective of him as she witnesses the cruel reaction of those who deem him a \\"freak.\\"Ann Martin's authentic writing takes us back to 1960 with such details as rickrack as a fashion statement, nylons and garter belts, and \\"Dobie Gillis.\\" Her sympathetic treatment of the characters draws the reader into this poignant story, earning a well-deserved Newbery honor for 2003.Though the reading level is listed as 9-12, I would offer a caution that the emotional content is rather mature for this age group. I consider this appropriate for middle school and older. Younger readers might find Betsy Byars' \\"The Summer of the Swans,\\" a book with similar themes, to be a bit more emotionally on target."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"If I were reviewing this book for an adult reader or even a teenager, I would say that it was very well-written, and it kept my interest. But, I read the book because it was recommended to me by a school teacher for our mother/daughter book club. This book club was composed of girls in 3rd and 4th grade at the time. I don't read most of the books that my daughters bring home from school, so I was interested to see what type of book this was. It was pretty early in the book that \\"red flag\\" number one appeared. If this is a book for 9 year olds, is it really appropriate to have the main male character gawking at a female character's chest? Later this male character walks in on this same female and catches her \\"in the act\\" with another man. Please don't read any futher if you don't want to hear the ending, but this was the final straw in my book. This main character, who has mental issues, kills himself. And at the service for his funeral, the young girl in the story calls him \\"brave.\\" There is something definitely wrong with recommending this book for ages 9-12--at least for MY 10 and 11 year olds. Come on, sex and suicide for 3rd and 4th graders? I'm sorry, I've never considered myself \\"old-fashioned,\\" but where do we draw the line? Needless to say, I did not choose this book for our book club."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"My 11 year old daughter was deeply upset by this book after being given it to read by her school librarian. Struggling with similar issues of mood swings, rejection by peers, etc.(what young girl doesn't?) she really identified with the autistic boy, Adam, who later commits suicide. The story, while dealing positively about the relationship between an 11 year old girl and her autistic uncle, has an inappropriate resolution for a book for children and young adults. Adam commits suicide by hanging, and the 11 year old, Hattie, felt responsible. On page 178, Hattie reflects \\"I...realize that Adam's decision to take his life was not made easily. It took a certain kind of courage. Just not the kind of courage I choose.\\" With the rising rates of autism, mental health issues in youth, and suicide in youth, I don't consider suicide a \\"certain kind of courage.\\""},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Ann M. Martin has written, to my knowledge, three books now involving autistic characters - a stand-alone novel in the 80s, that BSC book, and now this one.I like to be complete, so I thought I'd check this one out and compare it against my memories of the others. This review WILL contain spoilers, I'm sorry, because there are a few issues I have with the book at the end.First, you should note that Adam's characterization clearly reflects increased knowledge of autism. This is as it should be - the other two books are painfully outdated... but it wouldn't be fair to judge her for writing a book in the 80s that uses the knowledge we had in the 80s. Adam is never officially diagnosed, but it's fairly clear from the speculation (\\"some thought it was autism, some thought it was schizophrenia\\") and a few specific details of Adam's behavior (he engages in scripted speech, he has the savant skill of calendar counting, he is totally lacking in the social awareness that says do NOT stare at women's chests) that he's intended to be on the spectrum.How accurate is this depiction? I don't know. I have a hard time believing that you COULD memorize many - much less all! - full episodes of I Love Lucy in the days before VCRs, but then, I didn't live in the 60s. The calendar counting did annoy me. Most autistics are not savants (and only about half of all savants are autistic - Kim Peek, the inspiration for Rain Man, was not autistic, for example).I was happy to see that Adam is a real character. He has interests and feelings and a life. You get the feeling that he has some greater purpose than to simply provide character development for his niece. This is in contrast to disabled (particularly autistic) characters in many other books, who really are just there so the people they come in contact with can have a renewed appreciation for life or be kinder or I don't know what. Some commenters has mentioned that his behavior is \\"inconsistent\\" - he's \\"sometimes childish, and sometimes adult\\". This is accurate, though. Adults with developmental disabilities are still *adults*. They still have adult feelings, even if in some ways their understanding isn't up there.Which brings me to another point, there are some mildly adult situations in this book. Adam stares at his crush's chest, and accidentally walks in on her with her boyfriend. It's not really that bad, but of course every family will have to make its own judgments about appropriateness.And now we get to the end of the book, and the reason I gave it such a low rating. THIS IS WHERE THE REAL SPOILERS COME IN.After seeing that he really doesn't have a chance with the pretty young woman who works at the bank (and after a trying few days where he had it made clear to him, again, that his family doesn't really want him to act the way he is), Adam goes and kills himself. And Hattie (who considers herself to be like her uncle in some way, although the reasons why are never given) thinks it over and calls this brave in her mind. Not the sort of braveness she'd like, but brave all the same.It's not the suicide or the lackluster condemnation of the act that concerns me - actually, it's very clear that suicide has major repercussions for the people you leave behind.It's the context. And this might be unfair, but I think the context is important. We're not living in a world where people love and accept the disabled. We're not living in a world where this is ONE voice about autism and suicide.We are living in a world where prominent autism organizations can make videos where mothers say - in front of their verbal autistic children! - that the only thing that has stopped them from killing those same children and themselves is thinking of their *normal* child. And when called on it, these same organizations can then claim that every parent of an autistic child really wants them dead. (Alison Singer, in the short film Autism Every Day.) We are living in a world where parents who locked their autistic son in a room and set the house on fire aren't convicted of murder. (Christopher DeGroot.) We are living in a world where it is common for people who kill their autistic children, in fact, to be praised for their \\"courage\\" and their \\"love\\". We're living in a world where there are parents of autistic children who feel no compunction about saying that autism is worse than cancer because at least the children with cancer die. ([...] - actually, the autism - cancer comparison is all over the place, along with the autism - AIDS comparison and the autism - kidnapped children comparison. But at least most of these people don't go out and say that those other kids are lucky enough to die faster than the autistic kids!)In short, we're living in a world where the lives of autistic individuals (and disabled individuals in general) are not considered as valuable as those of \\"normal\\" people.The suicide in this book could have been handled differently. Our main character could have reasoned that if his family loved him they could have accepted him better instead of hiding him away - remember, she had only found out about him that summer! She could have suggested that if he wasn't so ostracized and patronized, he might never have taken that drastic step. In fact, there is a real suicide risk among autistics, similar to the recently publicized risk among gays.Or, the \\"oh, it was brave not to want to live in this world he doesn't fit into\\" bit could have been made in isolation from a culture which says that all the time.But it wasn't. Instead, you read the book and her thoughts, and it's hard not to hear it saying yet another variation of \\"those people are better off dead\\". This is a message that society does need to hear again. In particular, it's a message that autistic children do not need to hear again. Yes, I said autistic children. In this day and age, we have to accept that you can't assume the only people reading a book with an autistic character are NTs with no idea about autism. Many of them instead will be on the spectrum somewhere. Or they'll be siblings of autistic children - they don't need that message either.I'm sure the underlying message was not Ann M. Martin's intent. However, unfortunately, intent isn't some magical glitter that removes all wrong. The message is there whether she intended it or not, and it's one that is actively harmful. \\"Their lives have less worth\\" is a contributing factor in the murder and suicide of autistics. I really can't advise this book for anybody, unfortunately."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Hattie lives in a typical small town in the 1950s and 60s United States--everyone knows all the gossip by sundown. And when Hattie's unknown Uncle Adam comes to stay for a while, the news spreads quickly, as usual. Adam is different--they aren't sure what is wrong with him, other than he has a mental disability. Hattie finds she really likes her young uncle (he's 21, she's 12), and wishes she could help him more. Ann M. Martin has created a realistic world in this book. Throughout, Hattie goes through a range of emotions when dealing with her family. The reader is able to understand where Hattie is coming from, and why she acts and reacts the way she does. Martin also captures history in this book--from the carnival, to the grandparents' idea of what is proper, to the everyday activities of Hattie's life--without making the reader feeling disconnected. Martin also manages to convey that families should talk about issues, instead of ignoring them, without sounding preachy. Overall, this book will move you, if you let it."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I give this book a great review because the author does a great job describing the setting and characters so it makes the reader feel as if they are a part of the story.
