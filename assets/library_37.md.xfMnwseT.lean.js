A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a novel remarkable only in its quality to inspire hatred from those unfortunates forced to read it. Melodramatic and unrealistic, it meanders interminably exploring the theme of a &quot;pure woman&quot; before finally finishing with an ending that has little impact on the disgusted reader.Tess is, in short, a useless book. Apart from keeping a healthy fire roaring in my hearth, Tess contains little of merit. Well, I suppose one could improve one's vocabulary by reading Tess (fun, but completely useless words like &quot;prestidigitation&quot; abound), but reading &quot;How to improve your verbal scores on the SAT&quot; is inarguably more concise and probably more entertaining.Not to say that there is nothing to be learned from the characters. Simply observe their actions in certain situations and do the opposite. The three main characters, particularly Tess, are just begging to have a little common sense smacked into them. However, Tess can be considered enigmatic in one respect. Hardy seems to be unable to decide whether she is just ordinarily pretty, or 'a dazzling fair milkmaid' so it is up to the reader, should he still be awake, to decide. At any rate, her big, multi-colored eyes and Pre-Raphaelite hair and figure hide a complete vapidity painfully evident to the modern reader. She only develops a spine near the end of the novel, when such a change is unconvincing and thoroughly out of character.So...a predictable and heavily padded plot, infuriating characters, too much symbolism, inappropriate philosophical discussions and a great dollop of Victorian fluff. The result? Tess of the d'Urbervilles roasting on an open fire."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"HARDY HAS A MAGICAL WAY OF CREATING A CHARACTER THAT EVENTUALLY BECOMES REAL TO US.

It is a pastoral - the set-piece descriptions of nature (the play of light at differing times of the day, the verdant plenitude during Tess and Angel's courtship, the astonishing effect of bonfires at dusk etc.) are among the most overpoweringly vivid in literature, genuine word-painting - and an anti-pastoral, with even the natural world infected with poisonous, unnatural social conventions, with the growth of Talbothays petrified into the sterile limbo of Flintcomb-Ash.As in Shakespeare, there is a conflict in 'Tess' between the surface, linear plot, which tells a transient, austere tale of some people whose existence is short and ultimately barren, and the movement of the imagery, eternal, self-generating. The abundance of the latter makes the relentless grimness of the former just about tolerable (although the Flintcomb-Ash section is painfully unreadable) - as in Shakespeare, the burden of sexuality and emotion denied by society is placed on the natural world, on the language and the imagery, so the emotional deprivation in the plot starkly contrasts with its potent, lubricious surroundings.The plot is not 'realistic', but ritualised and patterned, set in heavily symbolic, paganistic sites, human nature stylised in pageants and tableaux. The climactic part, where Hardy twice startlingly changes narrative point-of-view, ushers in a new age of anti-Victorian fiction."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I was forced to read Tess for summer reading. I have possibly never been so glad to finish a book, not out of joy at a good reading experience but because the novel was such torture to wade through, in all its melodrama, sensationalistic elements, unlikable characters, and gaping holes in the plot, especially towards the end. Tess is a weakling who acts illogically, vacillates and secures the reader's complete disgust before the end. One should already know it from the title and the first few pages, where Tess's father, a peasant, finds out that he is the relic of an old noble family (his real name is Durbeyfield). Why cannot books have sense? All through the novel I longed to be reading Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch. The time this book was written in has nothing to do with it; both the two books just mentioned were written considerably before it. I was left with a very poor impression of Thomas Hardy's talents as a writer.

Hardy knew that Tess' reality was filled with enough emotion and drama that there was no reason to add to it the things fairy tales are made of.When reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles you are brought into the story by Hardy's suberb way of sketching the scene. Though Hardy's descriptive writing can sometimes be hard to digest, his choice of words allow you to enter the landscape and smell the glen yourself.Overall, an excellent book for the more ambitious reader, and for the one who isn't afraid of the less popular unhappy outcomes."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy is one of the best books I have read in the past five years. It combines love and tragedy wonderfully. The characters leave memories enbeaded inside your mine. Especailly, Tess and Angel. Their love for each other is magical. It truly is a wonderful love story. By saying this you have to have a thought-provoking mind to understand the different subject matter. That is why most people read the book because you have to think and it is a sad story. I personally had to read it for class, and what honestly surprised me is the cleverness Hardy portrays to make his heroine more real rather than just another character. The way that it starts off how Tess and Angel don't seem like they are going to get together and how they eventually do. When they finally get together Tess has a confession to make to Angel. In the book we find out that Tess may have been raped or seduced by Alec. We are not sure but Angel leaves Tess because either way she isn't pure anymore. This is so hypocritical of Angel because Tess forgave him for having an affair with an older woman in London but he doesn't forgive Tess. So basically he's a jerk to be blunt with it. Eventually Angel forgives his wife, Tess and they leave Brazil. Tess goes back to Alec and murders him, so she can be with Angel without any worries. Due to this they hid away but get caught and the tragic ending comes. Tess is exacuted for what she has done.I like how the plot is not really &quot;realistic&quot; but follows a designed pattern, using heavy symbolic means. Hardy writes the book to leave an effect of you. You feel Tess's agony and confusion. You want to help her and wish you could show her the right path to take. I found myself talking to her when I read the book so she can do the right thing. That shows how Hardy gets you really involved. Difficult or not, if you like to read, I strongly recommend reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles. It is deservinly allowed to be called a classic. Hats off to Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a master craftsman. With the help of words that fit the sentences like a key into a lock, Hardy ensnares his readers like a spider traps a fly. Such is the power of Hardy's prose.\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\", was published in 1891. It was one of the last -- and arguably the best -- novels from Hardy's pen. It's the story of Tess, a country girl in a fictitious English county,Wessex, and her tragic struggle against destiny. As somebody has already mentioned, Hardy has chosen the backdrops of the story with the same care with which he describes people: valleys and moors are also portrayed as if they too are characters of the novel. The Vale of Blackmoor, Tess's birthplace, is described as \\"an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape painter\\", and \\"in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry\\". The Flintocomb-Ash, the place where Tess was subjected to some very rough manual work, is painted as \\"a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin\\". And the place where Tess fell in love, the Vale of Froom, is \\"that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts.\\"There are several tearjerkers in the novel but I found one moment particularly touching where Tess decides to baptize her illegitimate baby herself. And when the baby -- named Sorrow -- dies, Hardy becomes a little bitter: \\"Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of little brilliancy - luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginning\\".To put forth the case of an unwed mother so passionately in &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; was something of a stir in the English society of late nineteenth century, which was so obsessed with feminine virginity. The novel received some severe criticism initially, which ultimately forced Hardy to stop writing novels and concentrate on poetry."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I found myself disecting each paragraph and reading sentences over and over again, with no reason to may I also add.

The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying.

However, \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\" is the novel that has inspired me to give this genre another try. I found it to be incredibly moving; dismissing the idea that it was poorly written. I've found English literature too stifled by its own airs and graces, but this is not the case with Thomas Hardy. He paints a picture of great hope in a way that allows us to empathise (unlike some of his contemporaries) with the characters of a different era.I recommend anyone who wants to start reading classic English literature to begin with \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\".

Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring.

I was actually weeping audibly at times. These characters are so real you feel as if you know them. I found myself yelling at them as if somehow I could intervene in their lives.

In short, it is a passionate statement about man's cruelty to a woman.This book understands the differences between man and woman, and for the most part, it is not complimentary to men. Exceptions exist. \\"The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.\\"And during the hard times inflicted upon her, Tess refuses to reproach those men who made her life a miserable existence. It starts with her father, whose newfound nobility engage him in a mead house where he misses a deadline, requiring her to carry on the family business, which results in a horrible accident and family economic loss. From there, she must endure hard work, be sexually mistreated by an employer, move away from her castigated self from a problem to which she had no cause, live a life as a simple milk maid, and then marry.When she marries, it seems that all is well. But, her husband, when discovering during their honeymoon that her flower was violated (even though without permission) by one before him, immediately exiles himself to Brazil and leaves her in poverty and public humiliation. Her life is not good - and she knows it: to the point where she contemplates suicide.But, one day, when walking in the woods she sees maimed birds (hunting's collateral damage) which slowly walk about to a cruel and painful demise. When seeing their tortured final moments on earth, she says, \\"Poor darlings - to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o' such misery as yours!\\" \\"And not a twinge of bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and not bleeding, and I have two hands to feed and clothe me.\\" She is miserable, but she understands the relativity of such emotion.Men in this book really have to take the blame. Like the hunters who irresponsibly leave half-shot birds to limp to their graves, her husband must atone for his terribly misguided and failed judgment of her and her unwelcomed sexual experience. She was by modern standards too young to consent, and certainly did not consent. And, after years of review of the issue, her husband concludes what modern men would have been capable of doing in moments - ask for her forgiveness and pity her. \\"Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.\\"But, this is not a love story with undertones of happy endings. Shakespearean in many ways, devoted to tragic ending, this book raises the title character to sainthood. And, like most tragedies, only the cold can complete the final pages without welled eyes."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", first published in 1891, is set in Dorset (or \\"South Wessex\\" as Hardy called it) during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It tells the story of Teresa (\\"Tess\\") Durbeyfield, a beautiful and innocent country girl who is seduced by a wealthy gentleman, gives birth to his illegitimate child, and is eventually, after numerous vicissitudes of fortune, hanged for his murder.This was a controversial subject in late Victorian England, although perhaps not as controversial as we might think. Today we like to flatter ourselves that all great nineteenth century writers were effectively twenty-first century spirits avant la lettre, voices crying out in the wilderness against the hypocritical moral code of their contemporaries, and therefore doomed to be misunderstood by a scornful bourgeoisie. The truth is always more complex than that. In the case of \\"Tess\\", the subject of illegitimacy and unmarried motherhood was not unprecedented in English literature; Dickens, for example, had dealt with it in \\"Bleak House\\", as had Elizabeth Gaskell in \\"Ruth\\". The reception afforded to the novel was by no means uniformly hostile; indeed, Hardy himself admitted in the preface to a later editions that \\"by far the majority\\" of reviewers had \\"generously welcomed the tale\\".Hardy was a countryman, and all of his novels are set in the rural area of South-West England which he named Wessex. He had not only a deep feeling for the English countryside but also the ability to convey this feeling in vivid descriptive prose. This is not, however, mere description for description's sake; the landscape becomes a vital part of the structure of his novels- at times it can almost be regarded as a character in them- and Hardy uses description of the natural scene in order to amplify his descriptions of his characters' feelings.There are two passages in \\"Tess\\" which particularly exemplify this. The first comes when the heroine, following the death of her illegitimate son, is working as a dairymaid on a farm in the Frome valley in southern Dorset; it is here that she meets Angel Clare, the man who is to become the great love of her life. The second comes when Tess has been abandoned by Angel, after he discovered the truth about her past, and is forced to find work on a farm on the Dorset Downs, slightly further north. The scenes set in the valley take place in summer, and Hardy's writing is dominated by images of heat, of ease, of fertility and of luxuriant growth, symbolising the burgeoning growth of Tess's hopes for her future happiness. The scenes set on the bare, stony Downs take place in winter, and the imagery is of cold, of hardship and of bleakness, symbolising the dashing of those hopes.In this novel Hardy's powers of description are matched by his powers of characterisation. There have been few, if any, male English novelists who have had such a gift for creating memorable female characters- Dickens' heroines are pale and insipid by comparison- and Tess is perhaps his greatest. The author used to speak of her as though she were a real person, and wrote \\"I have not been able to put on paper all that she is, or was, to me\\". If it were possible to fall in love with a fictional character, I would have fallen in love with Tess and so, I suspect, would most of Hardy's readers.Another feature of the book is that it reads as both of its time and timeless. It is not set in some unchanging Arcadian landscape but in the real English countryside of the late nineteenth century, a period of rapid social change. Agriculture was becoming increasingly mechanised; one key scene takes place while Tess is operating a steam-powered threshing machine. The position of the traditional landed gentry was being challenged by the rise of a new moneyed class, a phenomenon illustrated by the history of Tess's own family. The start of her tragedy is the discovery, by a local antiquary, that she is a descendant of the aristocratic and once-powerful d'Urberville family, of whose surname her own is a corruption. Her seducer goes by the name Alec d'Urberville, and Tess mistakenly believes him to be a distant cousin, but in reality he is neither a relation nor an aristocrat, but a parvenu. His father, a wealthy financier from Northern England, changed the family name (originally Stoke) when he purchased a Dorset country estate.The countryside has also been changed by new learning and ways of thinking which have challenged the power of old ideas. Although Tess is from a poor family, she is significantly better educated than her parents' generation. Hardy describes the gulf between Tess and her simple, superstitious mother Joan as being as great as that between the Victorian and Jacobean eras. Angel, the freethinking son of a pious clergyman, represents the growing force of religious scepticism, although his views on sexual morality turn out to be just as puritanical as those of his father's generation. Indeed, Angel's Puritanism may be connected with his personal philosophy; he seems to have kept the Christian injunction to hate the sin while rejecting that to love the sinner.The book's timeless quality derives partly from Hardy's prose style, formal even by the standards of Victorian novelists (although Hardy can be demotic when writing dialogue for his rustic characters). This style is characterised by an elevated vocabulary and by allusions to the Bible, to Greek and Roman mythology and to Shakespeare and other English poets. These allusions help to create the idea that Tess is not just a Victorian country girl but also a tragic heroine comparable to the heroes of Shakespeare or Aeschylus. Tess's downfall can partly be attributed to the social structures of her day, which made it all too easy for a rich man like Alec to take advantage of a poor girl, but also to a tragic flaw. She may be pure and innocent, but she is also a poor judge of character, too besotted with Angel to realise how priggish and self-centred he is, making excuses for him even after his callous rejection of her.Having recently reviewed Manzoni's \\"I Promessi Sposi\\", widely considered the Great Italian Novel, I started wondering what might be considered the Great British Novel, and thought I would celebrate my 100th review for Amazon by putting forward my own candidate for that honour. The book is a complex one, both in terms of its plot and of its themes, and there has not been space to do full justice to these aspects in this brief review. What I have tried to do is to set out some of the reasons why Hardy is my favourite novelist and why I regard this as the greatest of his novels. I cannot think of another novel with so loveable a central character, nor one whose plight has affected me so deeply. This is a work of immense emotional power."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy, who wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles, also wrote one of my favorite poems, The Blinded Bird, and another wonderful one called The Darkling Thrush. He has beautiful gift for words, character development, and emotional imagery. He has some vivid descriptions of the passion of love and the beauty of life. As many critics complain, Hardy seems to view life with some skepticism. He seems to believe that life is hard and people sometimes are not treated fairly by the very ones who should be there to help and protect the hurting. This philosophy parallels the feeling of many people that the Church has hurt them. A friend of mine wrote an impassioned essay about the personal pain she and others had experienced through transgressions of the Church.The difference is that she recognized a loving, all-knowing God who loves us deeply and whose love is sometimes not reflected in his people - whereas Hardy's story reflects the world's perception that a callous church represents an absent God. Still, I detect in his writing a subtle thread of hope as reflected by the hope of his characters, though not by their plight. I appreciated this book because it made me realize I am the hands and feet for the people in the world whose hope is gone.Anyone who hurts for others will be as greatly frustrated if you read this book. But you will also gain so much if you keep the perspective that God is in control and cares deeply about every person's plight. In this story, I see the undying faith Tess had in Clare as a picture of the way our faith in Christ should be, and the kind of love I want to have in another person.Tess' pain would not have been so hard to bear if the church had acted toward her as Jesus acted toward tax collectors and sinners in Luke 15, and as the people in those three parables acted. If the Church had applied the anxious determination of one who has lost an important object, Tess would have received the support she needed during her time of hurt. It makes me ponder the question: What will I do for the hurting Tess's of the world?"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The story is well known; one can choose from many editions or printings. If given the choice, choose Norton Critical Editions for the classics.This edition includes factual background provided by Hardy's pre-eminent biographer, Michael Millgate, who opines on the \\"originals of, and models for, Tess Durbeyfield.\\" Absolutely fascinating.Critical essays include contemporary criticism: Robert Louis Stevenson panned it; Henry James enjoyed it despite it being \\"chock-full of faults and falsity.\\"Virginia Woolf's six-page essay regarding \\"Tess\\" is worth the price of this edition.But most illuminating is the verbatim interview with Thomas Hardy himself concerning the ending of the story. When asked why he gave \\"Tess\\" the ending he did, he answered: \\"For the simple reason I could not help myself...When I got to the middle of the story the characters took their fates into their own hands, and I literally had no power.\\"Reading \\"Tess\\" without the supplementary material and criticism will leave you having enjoyed a most wonderful buffet but having missed out on the dessert.One will also get so much more enjoyment from \\"Tess\\" if one reads either Millgate's or Martin Seymour-Smith's biography of Thomas Hardy. I prefer the latter."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book will capture you and pull you in as you follow Tess Durbeyfeild, the blameless rape victim whose tragic jounrey through Wessex, England brings her love, despair, comedy (yes, there is some), friendships, tears, self-awareness, empowerment, but ultimately tragedy.This book is sad...yes, but Thomas Hardy's poetic prose litterally makes the insides of the reader do summersaults. This story printed on the pages of \\"Tess\\" are more than a novel, they are a portal into the world of a blameless woman. You'll feel the pain of these characters, escpeically our heroine Tess."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"One favorable evening, Tess in her white garb attends May-Day dance in sleepy town of Marllott. A passerby not used to sophistication will incline to notice her. It is not the extravagance, nay the ostentatiousness of the girl's beauty, but the softness in spirit and demeanor conspicuous on her big, beautiful eyes that sets her apart. The same passerby endowed with experience will not pinpoint Tess among the young, comely girls as someone prone to vicissitude of tragedies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Tess Durbeyfield later known in the novel as Tess d'Urberville is the hapless victim if not the heroine of this tragic tale. Born from poor parents, she is whisk away to work for the rich d'Urberville family. There she meets Alec, the handsome scion of d'Urbervilles clan. His incessant seduction of the young maiden results in violation of her rights. Forlorn, she returns home to the embarrassment of her parents and her neighbors. Stripped of clear prospect in life, she travels miles and miles away to be a milkmaid. While in the vast dairy field of Thalbothay, Tess falls madly in love with Angel Clare, the fledgling agriculturist of noble descent, convinced to make the newcomer his wife. Thus the journey that leads Tess from one farm to another is side by side with her lamentations over the two Englishmen and becomes her heart's landscape that stretches beyond endurance.Hardy, an architect by tuition, molds his male characters in an anvil of insensitivity. Their frozen hearts incapable of thawing by burning tears of a woman's pleading. As to his female character like Tess, Hardy constructs her similar to obelisk with solid foundation of faith that gradually narrows at the peak.Unsurprisingly, Victorian society scorned Hardy when this novel came out in 1891. The way he chose to describe Tess and her violation were less subtle in comparison to Eliot's writings. At present society however, Thomas Hardy is as impeccable as the clock ticking on the wall. He is in command of his story as if time is in command of denizens elsewhere. Under no circumstance he pauses to please his readers. He continues and takes them where nothing exists but the certainty of time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is among the best novels I have read when judged on its purely literary merits. Hardy's command of imagery in his creation of the nuanced satire of society and the values it imposes upon Victorian women is outstanding. And, Hardy uses nature to structure the novel and reflect the plot. He is also able to introduce a fatalist approach to the characters' actions that flows seamlessly with his characterization of them. However, Tess is more than an invaluable piece of English literature.Tess of the D'Urbervilles is also a strong insight into the forces of nature that shape our lives. It is a tale about the unlucky girl Tess, who has to endure suffering on two fronts: from the man who takes advantage of her, and the man who rejects her. She is symbolic of the person within us all, who is oppressed by the outside world, and depressed from within. She is humanity, and her story will speak to anyone who reads this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I read this in about 8 hours. I loved the prose, the descriptions, the whole feel of the book. I have to say I have a hard time with the type of heroine who just lets things happen to her like this. You know the characters I am referring to---I mean this book was kind-of like an 8 hour train wreck. I knew what was going to happen, well, at least that it wouldn't have a happy ending. But the writing is so great I couldn't help myself!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book has touched me in a very different way than many others have. It is a tragic story and envelopes the reader in a different kind of sadness - a sadness which one cannot pull out of quickly or just draw aside. Many thoughts contained in this book are worthy of reflection. Each lingers in your heart. The happy moments are all tinged with a bitter taste. Each character is flawed as a natural human being and each mistake they make reflects on their future and affects them drastically. Tess Durbeyfield is one of the most tragic characters I have ever read of. From the moment she leaves her home to the supposed D'Urberville relatives, she is pushed into catastrophes and heartaches that just lead to more doom. I recommend this book to any reader who is willing to undergo the myriad of emotions that accompanies Tess's journey through demise. It is not for the flippant, unconcerned, and unsympathetic reader. Everything that happens to Tess happens for a reason, and the reader must be able to realize how each affects her to appreciate this book. Read this book and expect to ponder on many philosophical wonderings. This book WILL affect you! It is worthy of any person seeking a deep and life-affecting novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"My review is based on the Oxford Classics Edition.Thomas Hardy seems to have been interested mostly in sad, unhappy characters who lead troubled, disappointing lives, struggle against fate, and lose. There is beauty in artistically represented sadness, though, and notably so if we are only spectators. I am not giving away the ending by writing that &quot;Tess&quot; is a sad novel. I think most people who choose to read this book do so because they know it is a sad story, or they have read Hardy before. In my case, I had to read it for school, and what truly surprised me is the ambiguity that Hardy so masterfully portrays in order to make his heroine more of a real person instead of a mere character. By the book's end we really do not know whether Tess was raped or seduced by Alec; whether he took advantage of a sleeping girl and forced himself upon her, or she allowed it in a moment of weakness, tired after a strenous day and grateful to him for &quot;saving&quot; her from the other workers. However it happened, Tess's life is radically changed after the fact and this event will have grave consequences for her and Alec.The ambiguity is troubling with the entrance of Angel, the hypocrite who falls in love with Tess because she looks angelic, virginal, and beautiful as a child, but rejects her when she tells him that she is not a virgin (therefore not a child) anymore. Her other qualities are there, but Angel equates purity with virginity --something many people still do when it refers to women-- so he can construct a perfect excuse for his terrible behaviour towards the woman he has said he loved. In spite of the forebodings that Hardy drops before Chapter 35, this particular chapter, at the beginning of Phase the Fifth, is very powerful and almost surprising in its intensity. The level of troubling ambiguity goes up several notches at the end of the novel, when it appears that Angel may indeed get his &quot;little girl&quot; as a replacement for the one he just lost.&quot;Tess&quot; is a sad and beautiful story. There is much more to write about this novel, but I have decided to concentrate on what Hardy seems to have intended when he wrote so beautifully about so sad a theme, but in such an ambiguous way. He calls Tess &quot;A Pure Woman,&quot; and she is that. But as only a truly great writer would, he does not present her as an outright victim: there are plenty of opportunities for Tess to escape Alec before they have sex, and plenty of opportunities for her to deal in a different way with the cruel hand that fate has dealt her. She does not escape Alec, and she chooses Angel (rotten luck with men). There are tragic flaws in Tess, and that is what makes her human while making &quot;Tess&quot; into a true tragedy. Hardy knows this. His prose is elegant and, at times, it reads more like poetry, going from good to beautiful.This edition of the novel is helpful, but it could be better. I prefer foot-notes rather than end-notes. If they have to be end-notes, they should have numbers. The Introduction by Simon Gatrell is original, although I do not agree with its main premises: that there are two Thomas Hardys at work in &quot;Tess,&quot; and that &quot;A Pure Woman&quot; refers not to purity, but to &quot;essential, wholly&quot; woman. This is valid as an opinion but unsupported by evidence. I recommend &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles.&quot; If you have never read Hardy, read this. If you have read him, you know what to expect."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I was supposed to read this book 25 or so years ago in high school. It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says about its time and place."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"But if you get the Wordsworth Classics edition, don't read the introduction until you finish! I'm going to make this standard practice for all classics from now on. I was hoping for some background on Hardy but before I even realized what had happened I'd read a summary of the entire story in one paragraph, plot twists and all. And it really did ruin the climactic last couple chapters for me. I hate it when editors / publishers assume that if a novel is famous and critically acclaimed then the reader must already be familiar with the story. Completely false: In this day and age reading for pleasure isn't as widespread as it used to be and the old classics are fading into the distance. The story in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is certainly not common knowledge anymore, so when you discover a gem like this I beg you not to ruin it for yourself by reading the canned introduction.Still a fabulous read, certainly. The story centers on the simple, sincere, hard-working farmgirl Tess Durbeyfield who is fated to stumble into a few serious and unfortunate challenges over the couple years that the novel spans. Hardy spins a truly magnificently written and plotted tale in narrating poor Tess's adventures & mishaps.I read another Hardy classic, Far From the Madding Crowd, several years ago and enjoyed it immensely. For the life of me I can't remember any of the story in that novel except that the central character was rather strange, but a few pages of \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" instantly resurrected my memories of Hardy's unmatched power of narration. He truly brings every scene and character to full animation and vitality, does the poignant scenes full justice, and even handles humorous situations with aplomb.Easily five stars, one of the best classics I've ever read. Just don't read the introduction!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as \\"damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around\\"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"if i'm being truly honest most 'classics' leave me cold. Pride and prejudice ? Bored me rigid. The amabassadors ? A guaranteed way to induce sleep. Remembrance of things past ? Still only read two of the books...and have no real desire to read more So when i picked up tess i was expecting more of the same. Worthy, intellectual, dull .I was wrong . Tess was a page turner , populist in the best way and strangely, considering cinema hadn't been invented yet , rather cinematic in it's description and creation of scenes . Even the passages that described the countryside add to the overall feel and mood of the book, rather than just describe for describing sake . As for the reviewers who accuses Hardy of being verbose, I can only say that for the time he's positvely Hemingwayesque.Yes, the book is a little melodramtic and if it wasn't for all the tragedy and downbeat ending you could see it being made into a mini series on tv but frankly.... what's wrong with that ? It's precisely this approachability that lets Hardy get you thnking about issues like women's rights , men and women's relation to each other and predeterminism.Finally to those that say Angel and Alec's behaviour is inconsistent .I can not agree. Alec is exactly the kind of person who rushes from one passionate extreme to another and Angel is exactly the kind of idealist who has trouble excepting the realities of life and the failings of the average person.Finally a word on Tess herself .She is one of the sexiest characters i've ever seen written in victorian fiction .It interests me that a man should write such a character and then have her killed as if such beauty (both internally and externally) can't be allowed to exist on the earth becuase of men like him, me and maybe you...."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Bleak and depressing, as far as the plot is concerned it's sort of like Hardy was experimenting with how many terrible things he could make happen to a trusting, wonderful person, until she's finally crushed under the weight of the world and her society. Really makes you feel awful to read it, honestly, but that's ok because the writing is beautiful and the structure is flawless. There are moments of pure poetry on a Shakespearean level, that make you want to weep for all humanity. The characters, especially Tess, are very believable, and the psychology effecting their decisions is what drives the story, for me. I'm impressed, I'm going to read more Hardy. I've looked around and it seems like most of his books are similar - a great set-up to a disaster, all the while people's hearts being ripped out of their chests and their hopes and dreams crushed one after another by a cruel world and cruel circumstances. He obviously had a pretty tragic and pessimistic view of our human situation, but a view that must have filled him with sympathy. He really goes into his characters' heads and makes you feel their pain through it all, going through the stages of their grief, with really amazing descriptions that feel dead on. Or at least that's what he did in this book.Also, it's pretty amazing that he blatantly pointed out the sexual double standards of his time and their utter hipocrysy. It's so crazy that people in Hardy's day were outraged after the publication of this book by the subtitle, \\"A Pure Woman,\\" because Tess was raped. When you keep in mind how firmly these ideas of purity and female sexuality were implanted in people's minds, it makes the plot completely believable."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Completely boring and a hard read.

From the very beginning, Tess comes alive. Her parents are witless drunks with two many children, and Tess must care for them.

If you are into reality, check this book out."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is possibly the saddest novel I have ever read. I have been thinking about it ever since I finished it. Few novels have evoked so much emotion in me. Tess makes me feel sad, frustrated, and angry.Tess of the Durbervilles is the story of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of poor, alcoholic parents who learn that they are of a noble bloodline and send Tess off to work for her noble \\"cousin\\" Alec Durberville. While there, Alec rapes Tess and she has his illegitimate baby. This event ruins Tess's life. She is no longer pure, and virginal, and therefore brings shame upon her true love Angel Clare when her past is revealed.It is hard to believe, in this day and age, that Tess is shamed and ostracized because she was the victim of a horrible crime. Hardy's novel is a powerful statement on the questionable morality of Victorian society. Tess, who is a heroic, brave, caring, selfless woman, is not worthy of Angel because she is somehow impure due to the rape. Angel, who has lived with a woman out of wedlock and is clearly not a virgin himself, feels justified in punishing Tess when he learns of her past.The writing is beautiful, but the story tragic. It will stay with you a long time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I love all of Hardy's books but this is my favorite thus far. The ending is definately not what I expected and I could not stop thinking about it for days afterward. It is a break from his earlier works in that things do not really turn out for the better in the end. In typical Hardy style, people and events in the main characters past come back to bite her in the behind at the worst moments. This story is like a powder keg which is gradually packed over time until the fuze is lit and everything explodes into a million pieces."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I think Thomas Hardy is an interesting mixture of romantic poet and social realist novelist although his dramas take place in primarily rural settings. The poetic strain in Hardy's temperament makes him romanticize some of the same things the romantic poets did. For instance few settings in his work are more powerfully evocative than a ruin. And his sense that we are at the mercy of both nature and our own emotions makes reading a Hardy novel a bit like reading romantic poetry. So if you like romantic poetry especially the bleaker of those poems you will like Hardy's novels. Tess was made into a great film by Roman Polanski in 1979(and another more recent film version appeared on A&amp;E) and it is hard for a Victorian novel to compete with that kind of entertainment but what the novel has that the movie versions do not is Hardy's descriptions of landscape. You may remember a scene from the (Polanski)movie when Tess is walking through a field and as beautiful as that scene was visually it is even more beautiful to read Hardy describe it poetically linking Tess to nature in a very sensuous prose passage. Hardy is not known for his optimism ( most romantics aren't after all so very optimistic) and both his prose and poetry seem to seek out the starkest surrondings and settings to offset and emphasize the fleeting nature of those rare moments of beauty. If you like spending time in the country this novel is a kind of hike back in time and into the countryside where men and women live out their days affected by forces they cannot altogether explain and that conspire in ways that do not lead down the rosiest of paths. Most of the men in this novel are weak, but Tess's strength which is perhaps linked to her heritage makes this an unusual and powerful story. She is perhaps the best bit of poetry Hardy ever came up with. She is certainly the strongest thing ever to appear in a Hardy landscape."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Much else has been said. Hardy in this book describes better than anyone I have ever read, the experience of being in love. Not one sentence, not one paragraph and not one scene: It is full of the description-excellent.... Of course, this tragedy was panned by the Victorian press as pornographic and terrible...."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I really really liked this book, but what I really think should happen here is to put full text cliff notes or barron's book notes so that they're easy to find.

It's insane-driving."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"After many years of reading and prodding classics in my courses, Tess of the Durbervilles was not at all a book I wanted to read. But obliviously, I had to read it...and Lucky I had to because Tess is one of the best of English literature! Such a masterpiece! Such a creation! Such a tale!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy really outdid himself with the creation of this novel. Tess is the quintessential protagonist to pity, sympathize with, and root for. Wronged by at least three men--her father, her cousin, and her husband--she remains pure in every sense by the corporeal. There is an overriding sense of despair that pervades the novel. Yet, what's a Hardy novel without that feeling?With this book, Hardy solidified his place as my favorite author. The author's ability to perfectly describe the English countryside, the charm, yet provinciality of the country folk, and the repressiveness of Victorian morals, makes this book one of his best. His subtlety often makes the reader question what it is that he just read, and leaves many things open to interpretation. Thus, as with many good texts, rereading it might lead to different understandings of different scenes that took place.All in all, there are few books that I have read that have made me want to give up sleep just to read them. I adored Tess, and I adore this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I am collecting the Penguin cloth covered books.

Now on my kindle fire and will go with me everywhere."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" tells of the titular heroine; a simple rural girl who, because of her beauty and gentle, trusting nature, is used and abused by those around her. The story begins when her impoverished family is informed that they are descended from a local wealthy clan. Her family sets about trying to better their situation by having Tess approach their distant relatives; unfortunately, this decision results in Tess meeting the devious Alec d'Uberville, who agrees to help Tess, with the intent of seducing her. Despite being the victim, Tess is the one who will pay over and over again.Hardy has created a genuine masterpiece. The characters are complex - even the seemingly simple Tess. The incredibly sad story is used to explore human nature and the ways in which people treat each other. I found myself highlighting passage after passage of the book and noting the fundamental human truths Hardy describes. I was particularly struck by a passage in which, after her seduction, Tess ponders, \\"The past was past; whatever it had been, it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over them.\\" She further muses, \\"To all mankind besides, [she] was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought.\\" How true, but unfortunately, Tess' past would never stop haunting her.When Tess meets the aptly names Angel Clare, she thinks that she has finally put the past behind her. Angel accepts her unquestioningly. Once again, though, fate intervenes and Tess is made to suffer for her past misdeeds, which are not really even misdeeds. At times, her victimhood is a bit much, and Tess appears weak, but her treatment is reflective of the sexual mores of the time, and Tess's willingness to endure mistreatment to protect her family and others is noble. The plot marches toward tragedy, with Tess managing to miss every opportunity for happiness. A truly devastating book.Note: This review is for the Kindle Duke Classics version. The text has fairly few noticeable errors aside from a few scattered misspellings. Occasionally, a paragraph has not been indented properly. However, these problems are minor and do not impinge much on the reader. The only major issue is that the Table of Contents is not linked, which is a hassle with such a long book. It is also decidedly no-frills -- no introduction, no appendix, bland cover."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I purchased the movie and wanted to read the book also.

Hardy's classical allusions alone make the book worthwhile, even though I already know it's a train wreck in the making and dread every page turn because I know Tess is going to take it in the chops, over and over.But why do I know we've got a train wreck on our hands? Because of the bleeping Introduction, which gives everything away! Please! Post a spoiler alert, for the love of all things literary!What I really wanted to share, however, is that this is a lovely book, just as far as the book itself goes. I read a lot of books on my Kindle and am very happy with it, but there is something so very seductive and special about this hardover edition with the pretty sheaves of wheat (red, of course...that crops up a lot in this story!) and I love the little red satin bookmark that is included. Just wish there were two of them; one for the placemarker in the story and one for the notes at the end, which are copious and another great addition to this edition."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I love the book but the size is very unwieldy.

For a modern love story containing these themes, check out Sophie Simons'l'Amour, available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I read this novel immediately after viewing the PBS Masterpiece Classic Theatre version starring Gemma Arterton as Tess. As the production follows faithfully all the key plot of the story, it really helped me with the book. In lieu of this, read the Wikipedia entry which outlines the plot in depth.The book is wonderful for analysis and discussion. There are many questions that can be created. The book has a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing.For instance, after Angel Clare and Tess marry, Angel finally learns from Tess why she has hesitated for so long to marry him. He mentions once that the only way he can feel released from his difficulty with her past is if Alex D'Urberville was no longer alive. One wonders if this is a seed planted in Tess' subconscious. Technically, Tess had no real functional reason to murder Alex. He was no woman beater, Angel had finally reached the point he needed to be in in order to accept Tess again, etc.The very first scene of the book is the cornerstone that starts the sealing of Tess' destiny and fate and nothing she does or doesn't do from then on can stay her from this. Her father's learning of the real family name of D'Urberville and not Derbyfield leads her to meeting up with Alex, her rape/seduction, subsequent pregnancy, inability of initially being able to marry the love of her life (Angel Clare), Angel's initial inability to live with his new wife, Tess' murder of Alex and her ultimate fate by a hanging execution.To me, the whole of the book is greater than it's individual parts. That is it's ultimate greatness. One can criticize the hugely long section of Angel and Tess' courtship at Talbothays Dairy where Angel/Tess seem to go on endlessly coming together and falling apart as Tess struggles with whether Angel can accept her if she tells him all the details of her past. (And then the subsequent hugely long time it took Angel to come to see a way to have a full married life and future with Tess.) But I took this time to appreciate Hardy's writing style, the way he uses Nature as a character in and of itself, to learn the real and authentic \\"what it was like to live\\" in that time in England, etc.I don't feel inclined to pass a negative judgment on Tess. In many ways she was the most moral, strong, and contemplative of everyone. Alex attempted to turn good by becoming a traveling evangelist but couldn't keep up the pretense. Angel, who rejected the more obviously suited to his moral viewpoints (Mercy Chant) to choose his more emotionally compatible love, Tess, had to undergo a huge personal struggle to rise above his concerns over what society would think of them. Angel's concerns were such that he states that even if they traveled as far off as America or Australia, that they couldn't be really certain Tess' past wouldn't come to affect them and even said it could continue to affect even the lives of their children. I really felt that Angel had the weakest courage of all the various main characters.Tess, on the other hand, continuously makes tough choices in life. At times, she uses pride to keep her head up and at other times, leaves pride aside to choose paths she feels benefits her family, her ability to be a good friend, to support herself honestly and the like. For her, love should conquer all and she struggles valiantly to understand Angel's point of view.I definitely will be reading more of Hardy's novels."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The shipper sent an email immediately that they were on vacation so would be cancelling the order.

Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"How amazing. Thomas Hardy actually makes you fall in love with his leading lady, Tess, yourself. Other reviewers have complained she allowed herself to be walked on; that is not true. She had a deep sense of the (false) injury comitted to her husband and accepted what she percieved as justified punishment. Mr Hardy simply rips out your heart and makes you bleed with her. I don't expect your average high school student forced to read the novel for an assignment will agree, but as pleasure reading, this definitely has money on any modern day romance or drama."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"An utterly terrifying tale of a woman and her difficulties in life.

It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them?

Hardy does indeed capture the English landscape fairly well into his somewhat lengthy, verbose paragraphs. But his plot (to be frank) stinks.The moment the reader meets Tess Durbeyfield he or she knows exactly what her fate will be. The book is a ridiculous web of intertwined coincidences which finally succeed not in giving the novel the air of a distinguished and accomplished work, but of a silly contrived plot line filled with poorly developed characters that could easily be crammed into 20 short pages. And the book might be all the better for it.The point is that after I read this book and labored through the hundreds of pages and looked up archaic English phrases and fluffy words that Hardy seemed to fill the pages with, I was struck at how much time I had wasted to learn so little, how disappointing it was to be forced to read so much obsequious symbolism and heinous happenstances.Don't read this book unless you have to.

I had no idea what I wanted, because she wouldn't allow me to read anything by Stephen King, and I had no other ideas for something worth reading. My friend suggested Tess of the D'bervilles, and so I took it from the school library.Unfortunately, I started reading it a week before I was supposed, and finished it the next day, and so I must choose another book to read for class.This is an excellent book that makes you think about what women had to go through a few hundred years ago. It makes you think about the complete lack of backbone shown in Tess untill the very end, when she finally realizes the injustices done to her were NOT her fault. You must remember that she had not been brought up to understand certain things, and could not have understood how to cope, or over come with problems that many women of her time had to face.The ending was excellent, and rather sad.If you enjoy learning about history, I suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book is tragic and wonderfully written. Hardy uses words to create a scene for you that creates the visual for you completely. I think that the sadest thing for me was to realize people did live like this, life really was that hard. As a 21st century woman I was outraged at the way that Tess was treated by men and by society. Who is the true bad guy, Alec or Angel? When we read it with our societies mores we perceive it one way, but if we were ken to the morals of that society how would we see it? Are they really dastards, or are they all just victims. I am not a scholar, I liked the story for being a good story.After reading the book I rented the A&amp;E movie. As I watched it, I realized how well the book translated into video, because I had already seen the exact same scenery in my mind. The only thing that surprised me was the bleakness of the trunip farm and Tesses horrible conditions. I couldn't imagine anything that awful.There are a lot of words, similar to DH Lawrence, but I wouldn't get rid of a one of them. If you come to this book as a great story and not as a classic novel, you will hold Tess to your heart and never forget her tragedies."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tess. Many years ago, after completing a grueling mind-numbing week of exams in college I sat down to read this story, as a sort of reward for living through the previous five days. I have since read many of Hardy's novels, but Tess remains the dearest to me. Early on, in chapter 4, Tess is on a journey at night with her little brother Abraham and he is asking her if all the stars in the night sky are worlds similar to ours. She compares them to apples on a tree and concludes that most of them are &quot;splendid and sound - a few blighted&quot;. &quot;Which do we live on?&quot; asks Abraham. &quot;A blighted one,&quot; says Tess. Minutes later, their carriage crashes into some oncoming traffic... the family horse Prince is killed, and Tess is plunged through this incident into predicaments that will result in her complete undoing.Those who are familiar with Hardy will know of his fatalistic tendencies. His themes were not exactly &quot;jolly&quot;. And here, in the above incident he sets that ominous tone that is so omnipresent in his work. Tess is the story of an exceptionally gifted and beautiful peasant girl of decayed aristocratic stock who is betrayed by two men: one is the rich and sensuous Alec D'Urberville, the seducer of her body and for a while of her emotions; by him she has a child which dies in infancy. The other is the intellectual free-thinking son of a clergyman (Angel Clare), whom she loves with her whole being, and who abandons her when he hears, immediately after their marriage, of her earlier violation. Here is a picture of that Victorian double-standard that similarly condemned Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Angel fully expects Tess to forgive his own past indiscretions (and she does), but he, in turn, will not forgive hers. More precisely, he flounders in his disillusionment, and cannot move from forgiveness to forgetness... as is obvious when he says to her in Chapter 35 &quot;O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another.&quot; The double-standard breaks our heart even as we read of it.And hearts are broken here. It is not until many years later that Angel realizes his error by pondering on the Biblical story of &quot;the wife of Uriah being made a queen&quot; (2 Sam.11:1-27). Realizing (a bit too late) that he had judged Tess by the deed rather than the will, he searches for the girl... only to find that the extreme poverty of her family has driven her back to the other man. So strong is Tess's love for Angel Clare, and so powerful her disgust at what Alec D'Urberville has forced her to become, that she kills Alec. Now husband and wife are re-united but on the run from the police, and they spend a few days of loving reconciliation before Tess is arrested, tried, sentenced to death for murder, and.... (read the book).Hardy considered this to be his finest novel, and claimed that Tess was the most deeply felt character he ever created. Originally published in 1891, it yet remains a timeless story of the power of love to overcome the most profound betrayal. Significant is Hardy's choice of the subtitle: &quot;A Pure Woman&quot;.&quot;...Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.&quot; - Shakespeare -"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The great thing about Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the poetry and the depth of the main character.Tess is an extremely complex character and yet a very simple person. It is hard to explain her:Hardy seems totally in emphatuated with his character. She is a thing of beauty like a beautiful flower growing on the road side. The flower knows nothing of why it is or how it grows, and so Tess is naive of her existance and surroundings only driven by the knee-jerk of her emotion, egged on and commented on the romantic and love struck Hardy.Hardy makes a character , falls in love with her and then day-dreams about her. Guarding her innocence amd jealously defending it by - 1)making her so complex that no other character in the book can love ,know and understand her truely.2)She ends up tragic so no one else can have her. Thus destroying her and tearing himself away from his ideal.It is true he builds her up only to tear her down. Such a tragic figure makes the reader feel a lament amd deep sorrow for Tess having tried to fathom her whilst becoming enchanted by her.I found all of this made the book frustrating and it flawed the main character. It is a very difficult, long and hard book to read- which would have made the book very hard to write by anyone other than a very idealistic romantic poet. 4 stars because I am a romantic fool for Tess as well."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the &quot;heroine&quot; she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then.

In an attempt to create a social connection and to gain financial assistance for her family, she entreats the d'Urbervilles to acknowledge an ancient familial connection. Unfortunately, Alec d'Urberville is taken with Tess and rapes her. Her life is haunted by his sexual assault from that point forward. Eventually, Tess begins to recuperate and finds employment elsewhere as a dairymaid. Her days as a dairymaid are happy and peaceful until she falls in love with Angel Clare. She agonizes over telling him of her tainted past, and when she confesses the truth on her wedding night, Angel is repulsed over her past and her deception of waiting to tell him. Tess is parted from her true love and never fully recovers, even when he returns to her.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is more than a sad story. It pays homage to the type of unhealthy family atmospheres that many children are raised in. The death of the horse is a direct result of her father's drunkenness and irresponsibility, though Tess never realizes this. When her parents hear of her misfortune, her mother reprimands her for not seeking marriage to the very man who raped her. The story also explores the mental effects that sexual assault can have on a person. Tess experiences extreme guilt, depression and feelings of unworthiness - common feelings for victims of sexual assault. In the end, as she is continually subjected to Alec d'Urberville, she experiences insanity which results in extreme actions.This particular edition included an introduction and notes about the text which I found helpful. However, I thought the girl on the cover did not resemble the maiden of the book. The girl on the front is plain and unremarkable, whereas, Tess, according to the text, is remarkable.I can see why this book is considered a literary classic, but I can't say I enjoyed it. That being said, I think everyone should read this book once. Tess is a memorable character that one can not help being fascinated with."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant!

To the modern reader, this tale of love and morality may seem like kid stuff at first glance (they talk about more serious situations in my niece's junior high sex education class).Hardy's genius is in his incisive character portrayals and the depictions of the social and moral structure of 19th century England. Tess and her feelings and decisions stay with you long after the last page is finished. I kept wishing we had read this in college so that I could have argued with someone about the moral themes."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles plays out in Shakespearean tragedy-like fashion, but maybe there is more to the word tragic in the case of Tess, being that her problems are not self-inflicted, but more in line with blind fatalism. In fact, Hardy underscores the theme of injustice playing out in the common folk's lives, with Tess being the microcosm of ill-fated individuals. The book isn't an uplifting read, but who's to say that a tragic--or even downright depressing-- novel can't have power, essentialness, importance, and beauty. Some condemn this novel as being \\"boring and depressing\\", but I would argue that there is a beauty in Hardy's prose, as he such a power in its way of making Tess' story coming to life with poetic descriptions, and this adds such an element of pathos to passages depicting her fate. Despite her suffering and pitfalls, Tess is a tragic character you feel for by novel's end, and there's a sense that Hardy is sympathizing with his tragic heroine all along.When Tess' father learns of supposed relations with a family of nobility, this sets in motion a series of events which leads to Tess leaving her family to go work at the D'Urbervilles estate in hopes of getting in good with the family. Tess' foolish father sets the tone for the themes of poor calculations and mistiming repeated in the novel. As it turns out, Tess' family is not related to the D'Urbervilles (a fact which no one from the family realizes). Tess, while here, falls under the clutches of manipulative and superficial Alec D'Urberville. Returning home pregnant and somewhat disgraced, Tess experiences more setbacks when her baby, who she names Sorrow, falls sick and dies; she cannot even get a proper Christian burial for her baby. For the duration of the novel, Tess' existence is synonymous with an emotional rollercoaster. Just as she is mourning her loss, she then goes to another place to work, where she encounters Angel Claire, a man she saw previously at a dance. Slowly, the two begin to get to know each other and fall in love, although Tess, based on earlier experiences, is mostly resistant to the idea of marriage. Tess wants Angel to know about her earlier experiences, but has a difficulty bringing herself to tell him; finally, she attempts to leave a letter, but once again fate intervenes and Angel never sees the letter. After Angel wins her over, they decide to exchange their previous indiscretions after their marriage. However, as fate seems to plague Tess, Tess is more forgiving of Angel's previous affair with an older woman than his forgiving of her relations with Alec. He can't forgive her. There is a sadness experienced as Angel leaves Tess; perhaps we feel even more pity because we know that Angel, for all his goodness, is acting a bit too impulsive and rash, hypocritical at an important moment in Tess' life. While it is a sad scene, Hardy is able to evoke great power in this moment. Tess once again finds Alec and Angel later in the novel, and each character acts in line with their character, but, as others have alluded to, the stars just seemed to be against Tess, and she makes a foolish, hasty decision.Despite this range of pathos experienced, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a powerful, poetic read, one that moves you. Hardy takes on a ride of emotions through Tess' life, and, she becomes a sort of martyr for the injustices in the world, a point that Hardy insinuates throughout. Hardy can capture the essence of detail one moment, and then invoke humanity the next. Sure, it's not a picnic reading Tess, and it is a bit emotionally draining by end, but this is a deep, emotional novel that works on many levels, one that has stood the test of time for a reason. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one novel I'm glad is required reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I know this is great literature, and I'm glad I finally read Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but I could not get past the fact that our plucky heroine Tess is a bit of a twit. While the injustices done to her may have reduced a lesser person to perpetual self-pity, Tess actually comes out the hero and pulls herself together, making a real life for her away from her family and her tormentor, Alec D'Urberville. It's only when she meets, falls in love, and marries Angel Clare that she begins acting the twit, the fool, and the loser. For some bizarre reason, she decides to be excruciatingly honest with her newly-wed husband (on their wedding night, no less), about her past trouble, involving apparently a rape, and her child born out of wedlock. I suppose it's hard for modern audiences to understand Angel's reaction (leaving her) when he realizes that she is not a virgin. Ah yes, the hypocrisy of Victorian culture. I understand that there's a huge sub-text going on in this novel about the social hypocrisy of the Victorian age, but it doesn't make sense that our formerly plucky Tess would now allow herself to fall to pieces.Great story, in all. The writing itself, however, is not great. Hardy's prose is really rambling, roundabout, and he just does not get to the point. Sure to wear out even the most patient modern reader. So, great literature, although Tess is a twit and the writing itself is rambling."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The most depressing book in the English language. And yet, I think I was the only person in my high school English class that actually liked it. Does this mean I'm depressed? We'll leave that question for my analyst and just say I think I have a thing for melodramatic novels.Tess starts out a poor peasant girl with a drunk father and a stupid mother. After their only horse dies, they send her to their rich \\"relations\\" the D'Urbervilles, to beg for work. Her supposed cousin, Alec, rapes her and she has his child. The child dies in infancy and Tess leaves home to seek a new life and better work at a sunny dairy farm. At the dairy farm, she falls in love with a clergyman's son, Angel Clare and they get married. On their wedding night, he tells her he is not as virtuous as his name, that he went on a bender in London and slept with a prostitute. She says \\"That's great, because I'm not a virgin either - now forgive me.\\" And he's like, \\"Um, no. My hypocritical moral beliefs will not allow me to be with a woman who is 'impure'. Here's some money. I'm going to Brazil to be a farmer.\\"So he leaves her and she wanders the land again searching for work and a new life. She's doing back-breaking labor for little money on this awful farm when who should show up but...Alec D'Urberville, her rapist cousin. He's found Jesus -- until he sees Tess's face again, and then he goes back to smoking cigars and being a general d-bag. He tries to get her to marry him, so he can possess her legally. She says no multiple times, until her father dies, leaving her family with no home and no money. So her mother sells her into marriage with Alec (This is the point in the novel when you, the reader, start thinking that suicide would be a good option for Tess).Who should show up next, but Angel Clare! He's back from Brazil, having realized what a hypocrite he is. He finds Tess and begs her to be with him -- she tells him it's too late. After Angel leaves, Tess kills Alec with a bread knife. Then Tess runs after Angel, tells him what she's done and asks him to forgive her -- again. He's like \\"Whatever, we gotta get outta here. You're on the lam now.\\" So they run away and get as far as Stonehenge before the fuzz catch up with them, arrest Tess, then execute her for her crimes. The End.A fun, feel-good novel for the whole family."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Hardy writes beautifully, tells stories, evokes feelings and describes landscapes, times and cultures that touch the reader's core.Read this novel for the story and description, savor it later for the depth of existential questions and half-answers. Hardy is an early modernist, raising the big questions, describing the loss of classical innocence and hinting at potential paths to solutions. But, he does not provide definitive answers. His work suggests that the time of certain answers is permanently gone, to be replaced by a difficult journey, at best.Man has a burning need for significance and meaning, but can find neither fully. Character is the most important thing, shining through all situations ... but it is partially shaped by fate, chance, history, family, society and the environment ... and while potentially noble, ultimately inadequate to fully address the challenges of life.The reader leaves the book exhausted from the journeys, the hopes and the many pursuits. The flow of life and history continues in spite of the heroine's choices. In the end we are left with a bittersweet memory of this life which Hardy personally inserts as narrator, \\"will never be forgotten by those who knew her\\".Perhaps this is the best current answer to the ultimate questions."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles may be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel and would certainly be almost anyone else's. A dark, sweepingly tragic vision, it is a masterpiece in nearly every area: characterization, plot, meaningful themes, prose, and more.Hardy is well-known for being depressing, and this may be his most depressing novel. The structure of his dark novels is greatly influenced by Greek tragedy, and this is probably his most purely tragic. Many have thought of him as taking a near-malevolent attitude toward characters like Tess, who indeed seems born only to suffer. The concatenation of dire circumstances engulfing her is truly stunning, and perhaps even more notable is the ceaseless way in which they flow together to wreak the greatest possible devastation. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and melodramatic coincidence, and this has some of his most highly wrought examples. Tragedy of this extent requires a very deft hand to pull off well; it is all too easy to become hyperbolically implausible or even melodramatically corny. However, Tess is so well planned and finely executed that the events unfold not only with verisimilitude but almost with inevitability.This last is another distinct Hardy characteristic. He had long been an agnostic by, abandoning belief in a benevolent overseeing power - nay, in any force that took account of humanity at all. Added to this was a profound awareness of human insignificance and a consequent absence of conventional meaning. However, he wrote nearly throughout his artistic career about a concept that he eventually came to find very plausible - the Imminent Will, a blind force controlling the fate of humanity and perhaps all else. Hardy is also generally considered a naturalist - a writer depicting environment as a crucial, almost insurmountable force in shaping personality and destiny. Like all of his greatest fiction, Tess dramatizes this vividly, portraying characters unable to escape wretched circumstances and even more wretched fates. Such ideas held great sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers but was almost entirely replaced by existentialism. Few will now agree with the shadowy forces underpinning the book's tragedy, but the dramatization is so well-done and stunning that it will at the very least provoke thought about important philosophical and theological issues - and of course bring admiration for Hardy's great artistry.As all this suggests, the novel is incredibly moving. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more pathos-drenched story, and Hardy runs us through a dark emotional gamut. Much of this has to do with the character of Tess, generally considered Hardy's best and seemingly his favorite. The subtitle calls her \\"A Pure Woman,\\" and so she is in a sense; an innocent, nave, and ignorant country girl of the kind no longer possible in the developed world, she is far closer - in spirit and otherwise - to people from civilization's first few thousand years than anyone from the last century or so. Hardy plays up her symbolic worth, making her a sort of Eve and giving her many pagan goddess elements. He is well-known for his heroines and generally for depictions of women far removed from Victorian stereotypes. Though not current feminist ideals, they stood out as strong individuals with real feelings and thoughts; Hardy's gender and sexuality views were well ahead of his time, greatly influencing his portrayals. Tess is his most famous, fully realized, and complex example. The most obvious sense in which she is pure is sexually and otherwise morally, but she is not the virginal domestic queen of most Victorian fiction. The pivotal scene in which she loses virginity is deliberately ambiguous, leaving it unclear if she is raped or seduced. Either way it is a sort of reverse Genesis story, as the pure woman is made impure - by Victorian standards - by a worldly, sensualistic man.Hardy uses this dramatic scene and its aftermath to boldly confront gender and sexuality issues that had always been central to his artistic concerns. He pushed the proverbial envelope in these areas from the start, often facing censorship and always struggling to get his point across in print. A few years before Tess he wrote a famous letter saying his goal was to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have a fiction at all, and Tess was his bravest and most direct attempt. She is in many ways a simple village girl but is not unaware of her beauty, and Hardy was one of the very first modern writers to even acknowledge that women could experience sexuality. We must remember this was several years before Freud revolutionized this area and also keep in mind that this was a time when statues were covered and it was not socially permissible to even mentions legs or ankles. Women were idealized as non-sexual beings meant only for domesticity and with no thoughts beyond it. It is now near-impossible to appreciate just how daring the character was or adequately convey her impact. Hardy's depiction and the issues he uses her to discuss made him world famous - the talk of high society and casual conversation as well as the literary world. For example, in his autobiography, he recalls how a society hostess told him she seated guests according to whether or not they sympathized with Tess and then had them debate. The novel received many glowing reviews but also about as many condemning it as perversely immoral. Hard as it is to believe since it was positively pass&eacute; even a few decades later, many thought it nothing less than pornographic - and a shockingly bad influence to boot. Perhaps the greatest sign of how much things have changed is that Roman Polanski's faithful 1979 film version was rated PG in the UK.This was clear reactionary hyperbole from a society so repressive that it had become pathologically hypocritical. Tess was a long overdue wake-up call. Victorians were essentially scandalized by the idea - from a man! - that it might not be a woman's fault if she is raped or seduced. This would be laughable if it were not so sad, but their offense hardly ended here. The novel vividly portrays the plight of many women at the time, especially lower class ones. Far too many women unfortunately identified strongly with Tess' problems: unsought attention from higher-class men that may have been flattering but was above all confusing; pregnancy resulting from rape or seduction without a father to raise or even acknowledge the child; suffering at the hands of grossly unfair sexual double standards from prospective and actual husbands; and, perhaps worst of all, consequent ostracism not only from society but often even from family and friends. Hardy was astounded by how many women, including quite a few high society ones, wrote him saying they were in Tess' position or a very similar one and how much the book meant to them. All this shows how strikingly well the novel dramatized contemporary issues; it is in many ways a novelistic equivalent of Henrik Ibsen's contemporaneous \\"problem plays\\" dealing with current social problems.This was a large part of the reason for Tess' impact and success, but the book would not still be so widely read and appreciated if it were the only feature. As Hardy envisioned, time has proven him right and the reactionaries wrong; the violent outbursts are now seen as perversely fascinating and mildly amusing historical curiosities, but the book's themes shine at least as brightly as ever. Feminists have unsurprisingly long had great interest in Hardy and this novel particularly, which has many themes of note to them and numerous others. Sexuality and morality aside, Tess strikes a somewhat subtle but ringing chord for women's rights via its bleak depiction of their woefully low Victorian status. Hardy movingly and accurately shows how barren life was for women, especially intelligent ones; there was not only a dearth of intellectual stimulation but hardly any stimulation at all. Sexual politics are still hotly debated and may never be resolved, but hard as it may now be to believe, rural women at the time of the novel's setting were actually kept in such ignorance that it was possible for them to not be aware of seduction even as a concept. The novel shows the tragic consequences that could so easily result from this and associated complications. Perhaps more importantly, and even more movingly, the novel also shows the grinding poverty that many rural English women faced. Worse still, it starkly portrays the consequent necessity of earning money without training, help, or encouragement. Hardy sometimes goes into considerable detail to describe the farm labor that girls like Tess had to turn to, putting particular emphasis on then-new machinery. Some may find this somewhat boring, but the point is well taken, especially as the infernal imagery used to describe the machines is particularly emphatic and highly symbolic.This leads in to some of Tess' other themes, giving the novel relevance to many with no particular interest in women's issues. Rural poverty in general - a perennial Hardy theme - is on grim display, letting readers see just how much life has improved for farmers and other laborers in the last century plus. Hardy's work is also notable for showing what one critic calls \\"the ache of modernity,\\" and Tess possibly depicts it most painstakingly and memorably. It is important to remember that Hardy grew up in a world without automobiles, electricity, railroads, and many other modern conveniences that were beginning to appear when the novel was written. Tess shows how such innovations were slowly filtering into rural England, profoundly changing a society that had altered little since the Early Middle Ages. It is thus of significant historical and sociological interest.Relatedly, and as always with Hardy, place is of great importance. Perhaps no one equals him in depicting settings with such close detail and vividness that they become an integral part of the story; setting is never mere backdrop in Hardy. Tess is one of his Wessex novels depicting the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. We get a good idea of what Hardy country looked like and how its people lived. The landscape is not as important as in some Hardy novels, but we still get an unforgettable depiction of a bygone era.But the novel is great over and above all this; one can indeed love and appreciate it without knowing any of these factors. The engrossing and profoundly moving story is a large part of this, but Tess herself is at least as important. One of literature's most sympathetic characters, readers have found her irresistible from the start. It is often said that Hardy's depiction is so idealized that he almost seems to be in love with her - and there are indeed some interesting biographical stories behind the claim -, but beauty is only one of the factors making her memorable. Hardy describes her so minutely and reveals her inner thoughts with such breathtaking force that she seems truly alive in a way very few characters do. Labeling her \\"Pure\\" caused more controversy than any other element, and perhaps all will still not agree, but it would be very hard to find another character so much more sinned against than sinning. Some of her thoughts and actions may seem extreme - or, in our greatly changed society, perhaps absurdly nave -, but only the few who have suffered comparable sorrows can say what they would do in her situation. It would take a very hard heart indeed not to feel for Tess, and the strength of her characterization, along with gut-wrenching depiction of her downward spiral, continues to fascinate and move readers - and indeed viewers, as the novel has been filmed no less than seven times and also been adapted into numerous plays, operas, etc. - more than a century after she first became a sensation.Nor is she the only worthwhile character; Tess has perhaps Hardy's largest, most varied, and most interesting cast. Though set almost entirely in Wessex, we get a good cross section of humanity: Angel Clare, who is intelligent and sensitive but selfish; his father, who is a Christian in the truest sense and a rare example of Hardy depicting a minister positively; Alec D'Urberville, the kind of hedonistically and hypocritically evil man who habitually preyed on girls like Tess; Tess' father, an alcoholic and possibly insane deadbeat of the kind who may first seem harmless and even comical but who inadvertently lead many rural families to ruin; and Tess' mother, who though well-meaning, has a combination of harsh practicality and ignorance leading to near-Machiavellian scheming that often has unforeseen negative consequences. Characterization is not Hardy's acknowledged strength, but this proves that he was on par with the greatest writers here as well as elsewhere.Another of the book's biggest and most easily recognizable assets is incredible prose. Hardy was a poet at heart, and it shows. An autodidact, he has a distinct style with a strong self-taught air that can be hard for current readers to immediately grasp; his eccentric vocabulary, full of archaisms and \\"dictionary words,\\" and his heavy use of dialect can easily make his work seem stilted and older than it is. However, this is the apex of his prose as prose; its beauty and power are simply undeniable. Though a very dark novel, the writing often reaches heights of sublime beauty, and philosophical asides about humanity's insignificance, the absence of providence, fate's apparent malice, and social stigmas' drastic effects are immaculately phrased and stunningly forceful. The narration during Tess' lonely ride, the short segment with her son, and the final chapter is almost unmatched in literature, and the writing throughout is incredibly strong - so much so, indeed, that the book would be worth reading for it alone.In reality, of course, there are many other reasons. Elevated prose and other complexities may mean it is not the best Hardy introduction, and new readers would probably be better off with more accessible masterpieces like The Return of the Native or The Mayor of Casterbridge. Some who have read Tess first have also said they found it so depressing that they vowed never to read Hardy again, but its undeniable greatness forced nearly all to break the vow. Thus, whether you read Tess first or not, Hardy is a must read for any serious lover of literature, and Tess is at or near his considerable summit."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"There are many good things I could say about this novel: it is excellently written, the characters are vivid, the message is clear and important, the setting is richly textured and gives a detailed glimpse into the past, and it is never boring.Yet, one thing I cannot say is that it was a fun read. Even in the essay in the back of my copy of the novel, critic Irving Howe admits that, \\"The book begins to mobilize and direct large masses of tension which, until the last page, will make the reading of it an experience slow and grueling, a drain upon emotion.\\" There is such a ludicrous amount of tension and tragedy in this novel that reading it is a stressful experience. In a way, it reflects how *good* the author is, because he made me care so much about the characters that I wanted to throw the book against the wall when one of them did something stupid. Finally finishing the novel created a feeling of palpable relief.Despite how stressful it was for me to read this book, I still appreciate its many qualities.

Twelve years before Hardy's Tess hit the shelf George MacDonald's Paul Faber: Surgeon received a less controversial if almost equally popular release. While the two books could hardly be more different it is interesting that the fundamental plot elements are identical. A careful comparison of the scene in both books immediately following the confession of the recently-married protagonist of her youthful indiscretion to her unforgiving husband will reveal a passage where Hardy essentially quotes from MacDonald--and then flatly contradicts him. MacDonald's Faber is a longer, more complex story--perhaps less accessible than Hardy's. Where Hardy finds despair, cynicism, and ultimately destruction, MacDonald mercifully provides forgiveness, hope, and evidence of the divine in humanity.Other reviewers have heartily recommended that you read Tess to discover how accurately great literature can portray life's struggles.

Without spoiling the ending, her last act was the crescendo of all of the small ways in which she held herself back. There were times that I pleaded with her to &quot;go to him&quot; or &quot;tell him&quot; but it would have been out of character for a woman of her day. Hardy kept us informed of the landscape, weather and all living things in Tess's environment, which I found breathtaking on many occasions. He painted the picture of his perfect woman.

It's very touching. It's the kind of reading experience that will leave you thinking about it for days or weeks. The writing style is elegant and poetic. Anyone who has tried to write will appreciate the grace and beauty.It's not a light read, like something you take on a plane to ward off boredom. It's the kind of read that takes a little effort. The reward is definitely there, however."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) created one of the great heroines in all of world literature when his pen drew Tess in 1891. Tess Durbeyville is a poor girl in rural Wessex. Her father is a drunk with a weak heart. Her mother is childish and her parental skills are sadly lacking. Tess is the leader of the family. Her father learns their family descends from the aristocratic but decadent D'urberville clan who came to Britain with William the Conqueror. Tess visits a nouveau riche branch of the family. She is quickly seduced, drugged and becomes pregant by the evil Alec D'urberville.Tess returns to her family in disgrace. She baptizes the illegitimate child Sorrow who dies soon after birth. Tess travels to a a dairy owned by the Cricks. Here she meets Angel Clare the nonbelieving son of a ruralclergyman. Complications and irony ensue as in all Hardy's well plotted novels. Angel is a weak man who is a fallen angel on what Hardy calls this blighted star (earth). I did not care for him or his pious family!The culmination of the novel comes when Tess murders Alec; flees with Angel; is captured at Stonehenge and is hanged for murder. These are the plot developments but Tess is so much more.The book is a poetic prose masterpiece. Hardy the countryman provides rich evocations of the English countryside yielding its pristine beauty to the coming industrial age. Reapers and trains are intrusions into old Wessex's slow progress of the bucolic season. Throughout the novel I appreciated Hardy's hatred of killing animals and birds such as the poignant incident of the dying pheasants in a field following a wantonhunting expedition by humans. Tess too is hunted, hounded and caged like a bird entraped by her dire circumstances.Hardy fell in love with the fictional Tess. Who is she? She is woman!An earth mother; sacrificial victim; a panther; a temptress; an innocent country girl; a pagan goddess sprung from the soil of England; a mysteriious presence who is often pictured in the fog and mists. Tess dreams as does a fairy tale princess. Tess is a woman of strong passions inherited from the D'urberville family who kills and loves, laughs and sings, cries and rejoices in the complicated and tragic life she is given.The prudery of Victorian England disdained Tess causing Hardy much pain. He often had to change the text of the novel to assuage the prim souls of his editors. And yet Tess lives in the minds of the reader as the acme of his creation of memorable female characters. One can never really understand the multifaceted Tess; we can simply spend time with this fascinating witch and madonna. Tess will live forever in the minds of all of us who consider Hardy a genius."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess's father, Mr. Durbeyfield, is told by a minister that his family is the direct lineage of an old, noble family that was once thought to be completely gone. There's nothing left of the family's land and fortune, except the family name (d'Urberville).However, Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife see this as a chance to move up on the social ladder. They devise a plan to send their daughter to become acquainted with a rich woman who's last name is d'Urberville. From then on, Tess is left to try to maintain her dignity and honor and to pick up the pieces of her broken life that resulted from her parents' need to be important.This is my first time reading anything by Thomas Hardy. I was warned that he was cynical man, and I'll agree that Hardy's prose is cynical, yet heartrending. I couldn't help feeling bad for Tess through all her troubles. This is not a happy novel. For a moment, you think that things will get better for Tess, but the fates seem to be against her.The landscape of the novel changes with the mood of what's happening. The land itself almost seems to be a living person that he described.He uses vivid, beautifully described imagery to describe people and places in his novels. There are themes of theology (Hardy had internal conflicts with believing in God), virtue, the boundaries of love. He employs everything from Greek mythology to modern (or what was modern in his day) poetry.There are no illusions of a happily-ever-after in this story. This was simply a beautiful novel, a novel that portrays its female heroine as the strong woman she was. She could put more modern women heroines to shame."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Since Hardy can be rather boring in his poetry, I expected that I wouldn't even be able to finish this book. On the contrary, as soon as I had started to read it, I couln't put it down! This is a work of great depth and Hardy has an amazing way of expressing himself, one that really captures the imagination (like Dickens)! I heartily recommend this book for anyone, Victorian-lover or not. The articles are also highly illuminative; this book is definitely worth reading more than once!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I had Peglet's experience when reading this book (and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; as well). I recommend, as she does, that the reader not try to empathize with the characters; it'll make you too angry. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle Angel a few times, for reasons that are obvious to anyone who has read the book.I must point out that one reviewer has stated incorrectly that Tess was &quot;raped.&quot; If she had been, the book would not have had the force it does. It would have just been another &quot;victim of society&quot; or &quot;victim of men&quot; book. Take a close look at Tess' confession to Angel on their wedding night.Think of this book not as an indictment of marriage and Victorian mores (although it certainly was meant to be, as &quot;Jude&quot; further develops), but rather look at it as the relationships of three people who are never quite able to understand themselves and their natures well enough to avoid disaster. An excellent book. But once again, don't try to empathize with the characters."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"When is pain the necessary entry price for involving oneself in great fiction, and when is it simply something you might call \\"author abuse\\"? I believe the tipping place can be found somewhere in the pages of Thomas Hardy's most famous novel.In it, we meet young Tess Durbeyfield, a simple English farm girl who struggles to make it through everyday life. Her father, convinced he's the rightful heir of an extinct family of Norman nobles, the D'Urbervilles, is a shiftless layabout who drinks and lets his numerous children do his chores. The family starves quite pitifully until fate puts in the first of several appearances. Tess meets a rich young bravo who goes by the D'Urberville name and decides to merge his bloodline with that of Tess, no matter what she thinks about that.Alec D'Urberville is one of two men whose attentions cause Tess much heartache and make up the substance of the book. Actually, there are three such men if you count Hardy, which I pretty much do. Alec is a right cad and Angel Clare, the other man, manages the impressive feat of being much worse, but neither lays for Tess the snares Hardy does, of horrible coincidences, contrived reverses in character, and way too much tolerance for ill treatment. There's even a letter-swallowing carpet. Man, I hate when carpets do that!When Hardy isn't pounding poor Tess into the ground, he's doing the same to us, pointing out how Tess in her misery represents the nullity of our common existence. \\"She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly - the thought of the world's concern at her situation - was founded on an illusion,\\" he writes. \\"She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anyone but herself.\\"If only!Here's the rub. \\"Tess\\" is a pretty pleasing book to read if you manage to ignore or at least discount the plot. Hardy writes with great verve and knowledge about the world of his characters, fictional Wessex with its villages of hayricks and barn dances. At times it's like reading Wordsworth, and at others it's like reading Lovecraft. I don't know how else to describe a writer who can wax so lyrical and then shift into something darkly surreal and macabre without missing a beat. He was a master of description at the height of his powers in 1891 when he published this.\\"Tess\\" is also a deep book, with much Biblical allusion and symbolic foreshadowing matted into the subtext. Reading the novel with an online study guide helps bring out a rich harvest of Hardy's learned genius, as you can see the careful layering and connecting up he does throughout the book.Alas, it doesn't make the story itself any more digestible.Tess herself is hard not to care for, but she's frustratingly passive in a way that can not be blamed simply on the time and place where her story is set. She seems more of a piece with something Hardy was trying to say of the human condition, of suffering being one's lot in this vale of tears. You keep hoping things will turn around, but pretty soon you see the author has other ideas. Hardy pretty much wants her to suffer, so she does.Maybe in some imaginary alternative existence, I'll be treated to the scene of Hardy being called to some kind of literary court of law, answering for the misery he put me through here. I'll gladly waive my charges against him - only if they let me watch when it's Tess's turn to collect."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Ubervilles is sooo tragic! I can't even... So good, so romantic... so sad... so wonderful. Shakespeare's tragedies never EVER touched me like this! Promise me you'll read it! Just promise me!The most I can say in the way of analysis right now (and having just finished this story I probably shouldn't be writing this review with tears and the utter agony of human love and despair both streaming down my face) is that Tess is a classically tragic tale of what might have been but could never be. I hate to write anything so simple in the way of anyalyzing anything this vast, and there is no ONE LAYER or way of reading this story, but this to me is the overriding principle.That, at least, and the concept of what does it mean to be a pure woman/person? Clearly Tess was pure, even in light of all that had happened to her. What a fool Angel was to let such a treasure slip out of his hands, and what a hypocrite! I know I'm understanding this from an American, 21st century way of thinking, but come on, Angel?! Seriously!? You don't blame the victim for their crime, and YOU had done the same thing WILLINGLY! Blame yourself for bringing her to this end, you and the elitist group of fools you come from (author's note: I realize it's not very sound to be venting so much rage on a fictional character, especially one in a story particularly designed to make a social comment about the day in which it was written, but seriously, why didn't he just scoop her up in his arms and run away with her when he had the chance? Bad form, Angel! Bad form!)."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I read Tess of the D'Ubervilles two years ago. I have read several of Hardy's novels and this is his best work. I recommend that everyone should read this novel.I am somewhat confused on some of the low ratings of this book and do not agree with the opinion of Tess. Tess is a strong woman who has weathered through some tough adversaries and situations. As with many books written in this time period, many women are weak, can not handle themselves and require a husband - not so with this novel.At the time this book was originally published there was much controversy and reviewers were very negative against Hardy (he stopped writing novels after bad reviews of Jude The Obscure). This is unfortunate since this novel teaches us many things about life and respecting people even after 105 years.Update:I have read most of Hardy's novels and still believe that Tess of the D'Ubervilles is his best work. I have since bought the Hardy complete poem edition by Palgrave and am looking forward to reading his poems (I like some poetry but not a total fan; I am sure I will his poems)."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book was a good book at times and a somewhat boring book at times.

Now I'm thinking she was switched at birth with some stranger. I won't go as far as saying I hated the book, (though I really did) but it's sure close. Tess is a brainless twit with no backbone and NO common sense at all. I wanted to shake her into reality. Even her own mother thought she was nuts for confessing to her husband (on their wedding night) that she wasn't a virgin, even though it wasn't her fault. Of course the self-centered husband can't even look her in the face and leaves her as soon as possible - sending her home to her mother. The book is all about Tess and every wrong turn she makes - not one good decision. I was disgusted with Tess and had to fight my way through to the end. I had to force myself to pick it up.

She goes to live with some guy named Alec and falls in love with him or something. I never read it but have studied Thomas Hardy's works and that is all I know about this classic. I also know it has a very sad and tragic ending because I ruined it for myself by reading spoilers on wikipedia so don't ruin it by doing that, read it and reach the tear jerking ending, if you can survive a TOME! HA HA HA HA! (Of course you can \\"survive\\" this one. I was just cracking a joke about the length of this book. Thomas Hardy was one of the greatest writers who ever lived and this book proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt)The story attacks the role of woman in Victorian society and because of that, it wasn't really well received in 1891 but at least it did better than Hardy's final novel Jude the Obscure, published in 1895 (some sources say '96 I'm not sure) Jude the Obscure was hated so badly that it was mockingly renamed \\"Jude the Obscene\\" and Hardy stopped writing novels altogether and focused on poetry.This is essential Victorian age literature and is Hardy's most famous novel. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I was a little bit disappointed by Tess, but it is a good outlook of late Victorian Era on the progress of woman.

However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter.

Very sad."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"By today's standards certain passages of this book may seem rather vague and subtle, but they were shocking when first written--enough that the book was subject to heavy censorship--vital passages from it were removed. And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it.

It is not the most exciting, nor the most stunningly transformative(that honour goes to \\"Altas Shrugged\\") book, but the construction and execution is exquisite.The book is in fact slowly paced - so much so in the first couple of chapters that I was rebuffed the first time I started reading it. However, a little patience will grant you entry into the gorgeous spell Hardy invokes. Yes, it is a \\"victorian\\" novel, but the sublimity of the writing and of the plot's tragedy emancipates it from the staidness of the genre.The upshot is that you shouldn't turn to this book if you want a fast paced thriller or \\"clever\\" writing.

My wife will attest to the fact that I have a strange affinity to depressing stories. With that in mind, let me say that I really enjoyed this book.The writing was at times a bit too much for me for the reason that I get annoyed at many 18th and 19th century novels...namely, that Hardy focuses far too much on minute descriptions and in-depth analysis of setting and location. Don't get me wrong, I love a vivid and lush environment and I much prefer a fleshed out character to a flat one. I just sometimes feel that all of the flowery descriptions slow down the story telling element too much. There were a few paragraphs/pages that I tried to skim through in order to get to the next relevant points of plot. Still, I don't know that I'd want to edit out the descriptive text since it does comment on the narrative itself in a metafictional sort of way.The main characters in this book are wonderfully composed. They are absolutely and completely frustrating but they are superbly crafted nonetheless. I wanted to smack each of the main characters on many occasions.Tess is far too willing to simply be acted upon and then to bemoan her fate. Alec is an absolute pig (although towards the end of our experience with him, it's debatable just how awful he truly is). And Angel is far too inconsistent to be liked at all...at first he seems almost lovable...then he deserves to be hated...then he seems slightly adequate...then he becomes repulsive again...he's just far too wishy-washy in his behavior and ideals to ever be fully redeemable.The story itself falls into the realm of realism taken to its extreme. The plot elements felt almost like the Bible story of Job...whatever could go wrong willgo wrong. And even though Tess was generally found to be almost whining about her circumstances rather than trying to make things better for herself, the story was still rather thought provoking since it makes you wonder just how you would handle horrific circumstances and what can truly be done about them. Is it better to try and solve the problem or better to just let fate and happenstance take its toll.Personally, I try to make the best out of any bad situation...perhaps that's why I like \\"depressing\\" stories...they make me realize my life could be worse and they help inspire me to always think of the best possible outcome.I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Those who want a happy fairy-tale romp through a girl's life would do better to stay away. Those who are easily frustrated by fallen characters, will find themselves hating all of the primary roles in this book. The book isn't terribly lengthy (~300-400?) but some of the longer descriptive passages do crawl by at times.Still, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those who are willing to look imperfection and awful situations square in the face and come away smiling. It's not a happy book. It's not a terribly fast past book (which can also be frustrating...I wanted to shout Just do it to Tess many times).But it is a wonderfully rich book and definitely worth getting into.*****4.5 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Any woman who has been pursued by the likes of an Alex D'Urberville will appreciate with a shudder his sinister characterization. Hardy's pastoral description is beautiful as is his handling of diary life especially if one is familiar with such rural settings and labors.However, as Tess's persistently over-sensitive conscience regarding her past rumbles on and on and on, I began to wish she would find the river and put herself in it. But there are philosophical gems here and there such as \\"By experience...we find out a short way by a long wandering\\" that make the reading worthwhile."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a definite for anyone serious about literature. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is not to be passed up, it's a treat. I didn't find it at all over descriptive nor boring."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Having read Tess several times years ago and then revisiting it now, I am reminded how frustrating a book it can be: frustrating that Hardy's 19th century England could be so cruel; frustrating that Tess (and others) blamed herself for being ruthlessly violated at 16; and frustrated at Angel's initial behavior after he learns of Tess' tragic and blameless past. It's just too incomprehensible for someone living in the 21st century to relate to--and you wonder about Angel's incompatible behavior--for someone of his supposed character. As much as I love the pastoral beauty of Hardy's described vales and heaths, I loathe the society under which the characters lives are always ruined. The whole books starts to seem silly and tedious when viewed from such a perspective."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Although written well over a century ago, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a surprisingly modern novel with unmatched poetic beauty. The author, Thomas Hardy, jabs at the age-old issues of sexism, social class, and morality in this seemingly simple tragic romance. The heroine is the titular Tess, an elegant but unassuming countryside beauty from a poor farming family. Her misery begins when the family discovers that they are not the shabby Durbeyfields after all, but rather the descendants of the illustrious and ancient D'Urbervilles. But Tess' doom goes hand in hand with her heritage. Introduced to her newfound rich relations, she is forced to become the mistress of her cousin Alec D'Urberville. Naturally she is blamed for her \\"defilement\\" and resulting pregnancy. Tess of the D'Urbervilles cynically examines the high-strung, sexist Victorian society and the hypocritical Anglican Church, while simultaneously providing a window into the human soul. Hardy captivates the reader with his luminous heroine, a saintly creature forced to commit terrible deeds against her will. He questions the very nature of morality, asserting that neither society nor the church has the authority to judge virtue. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a masterpiece of literature--tragic and romantic, poetic and critical--a wondrously perceptive literary work. The reader is captivated from start to finish, from the opening imagery of the lovely English countryside to the fateful, deeply symbolic conclusion set amid the cragged rocks of the Stonehenge."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Deep. Tragic. Memorable.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a wonderful read and highly recommended. I had high expectations of this book and they were all surpassed after reading it.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles must be one of the most moving and beautifully written novels ever created. Hardy's writing doesn't just move the plot from one point to the next, it undulates and flows from season to season with Tess as her life flows from one point to the next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, it does have a good amount of pagan imagery and associations. Tess is dancing on May day (the first of May) when Angel and she first cross paths, Angel often calls her by the names of pagan godesses when he is wooing her at the dairy and she agrees to work for Farmer Groby until \\"Old Lady's Day.\\" The imagery that Hardy interweaves in the novel is even more pagan. Tess is virginal and innocent and hopeful, like a nymph or thing of nature. And even when she's no longer a virgin (a rather important event in the novel) she's still innocent and hopeful. Truly, she does not lose her hope until the very end and then she is allowed to regain it, if only momentarily. The hardest thing about reading this novel is that it is tragic, for Tess anyway, the whole way through. But that's the way Hardy meant it. And in the end it breaks your heart. But not in a melodramatic way, drawn out, Hollywood ending/Braveheart kind of way. More like the slice of the guillotine: quick, clean, but certainly not painless. It's definitely worth the time and effort to read this masterpiece of a novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Angel's perceptual turnabout comes a day late and a dollar short. In Hardy's Victorian world, the victim was the co-perpetrator. He had to justify to his audience that despite her technical loss of virginity, Tess was pure in essence. She was a victim of bad luck, particularly that of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I loved when Irving Howe remarked that \\"Tess is...goodness made interesting.\\" Unfortunately, Tess never got to appreciate or even recognize her goodness. She was so full of (unmerited) shame and a sense of inferiority. Angel's liberalism and code of ethics gave way to censure, and he reinforced Tess's self-doubts. He could overlook her being a milkmaid from the fallen D'Urbeville lineage, but not a victim of rape. That even a man like Angel would be influenced by the Victorian attitude (and not recognize the timeless double standard) is Hardy's sharp social critique."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy).

I thought that The Return of the Native was good...Tess of the d'Urbervilles by the Great Thomas Hardy was a very long novel for me. Hardy's scope and incredible projection of Wessex was very admirable and how he presents Tess as a person is very beautiful.The novel begins with Tess' father learning that his family, the Durbeyfields is descended from a long gone ancient regime, the d'Urbervilles. I really love how Hardy makes you feel like this is the ultimate cross for Tess and her family to bear. How Tess grows to hate this fact. After the Durbeyfield's horse is impaled, yes impaled, when Tess and her brother are trying to deliver something that her father is too ill (or too drunk) to deliver, Tess blames it all on herself and is sent to work on the manor that her parents think that her \\"cousin,\\" the cruel Alec d'Urberville resides in. A great Hardyan lustre of that element of the story is that Alec d'Urberville's father just bought that name after lookin it up in some book, so Tess falls into a trap of fate and is continually punished. Tess' whole life is told through the novel and is filled with very tragic scenes, so if you like feel good books, stay away from this one.This novel is full of beautiful and moving tragedy, incredible projection of Victorian rural life, and just about everything Hardy can give you in one novel.Definatley essential Victorian Literature, definatley essential Thomas Hardy, and without question one of the greatest novels ever written....Only a poet could've written such a beautiful novel..."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book is wonderful for many reasons and especially for its portrayal of Tess.

I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part.

It is more like a Greek tragedy or Shakespearean tragedy. The characters are larger than life and the events of the book mythic in scale. Nevertheless, just like with, say, Macbeth I was drawn into the plot and actually found myself getting angry and upset about the turn of events. So I got my money's worth. Hardy definitely has cast this story very darkly. Tess is no mere innocent victim. And Alec is not so clearly just an evil villian. Nor is Angel an angel.

Never again be whisked into this particular world so far removed from my own and yet so heart-wrenchingly close. Never again turn the pages of Tess of the D'Urbervilles with baited breath and a longing ache that realistically shouldn't stem from mere fiction.Phenomenal, this work of Thomas Hardy's is.Not since reading Jane Eyre have I been so totally immersed in the life of a character, so in tune with her sufferings and joys, so hopeful yet fearful for her future. Tess seems so real, sometimes pathetically so, but always wishfully so. Her story is a sad one, but it brings with it its own reward.I almost wish I could have stopped reading at a point before the ending, so I would be free to imagine my own perfect conclusion. Or better yet, so Tess could live on, could still have that elusive chance at fulfillment and lasting joy. But Mr. Hardy's ending is the best one, the most fitted to the rest of the book. Still, I was shocked.

Thomas Hardy's writing is simply brilliant, and poignant.Thomas Hardy imagines a new way of being for British society. One that is not so hung up on narrow social conventions, one where people are rewarded for hard work and positive moral attributes.SPOILERS BELOW!Tess is supposed to be the embodiment of this new society as it comes into being, but runs into trouble at every step of the way in her development. Her parents do not work as hard as she does, she is cruelly seduced, her baby is cruelly denied a Christian burial, even her true love Angel Claire rejects her because of her past and the narrow social conventions he has been brought up with. And in the end, she dies, a Christ figure for Hardy's new society, with Angel and her sister \\"apostles.\\" The ending is even slightly ambiguous...What will Angel and Liza Lu do? Will they advance Hardy's new society?"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy was written in 1891 and challenged the Victorian sensibilities of the time and to this day it offers much to the reader. It is a book which has intense atmosphere, character development, romance, an interesting storyline and yet still gives us much food for thought.At the start of the book our beautiful heroine Tess is a teenager of a poor family with a father who is an alcoholic. She is a young woman who always tries to do the best for her family which lands her in trouble. Tess is eventually raped and gives birth to an illegitimate child. That she remains a good person who still tries to do her best and is a heroine of a book was shocking at the time of publication.In many ways it is obvious that Tess' story is going to end tragically. Even while we root for Tess and grow to admire her courage and perseverance we are aware that it is against all odds. This then provokes interesting questions about how the story would appear in today's world and the moral questions involved in contemporary society.Growing up as a farm girl, I enjoyed all the interesting details about the various types of farming in the late 19th century England. I loved the descriptions of the walks and travels by coach across the rural countryside."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"'Tess' is a beautifully-written classic that kept my kindle dictionary busy. It is a story about how painful and unfair life can be, and especially to those who are by-nature the most loving, kind and sensitive. You will fall in love with 'Tessy' and wish only the very best for her. Be forewarned, however, that Hardy wrote very little of the 'best' you will wish for Tess into this story. As a result, you may want to delay reading this book until you feel 'up' for reading a very sad and tragic tale. That caveat aside, 'Tess' is an exceptional work of literature, and a book you aren't likely to forget.Caution: Amazon has posted an editorial review that gives far too much of this book away. If you plan to read 'Tess,' I don't recommend reading its editorial reviews."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I was looking for another edition of TESS and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the \\"average customer rating\\" was only three stars. So I'm taking a moment to correct the balance.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English. It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero. It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology. It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies. It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does. It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes.The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure. Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work. Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first. Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of \\"Wessex\\" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison. Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation.Hardy's style is like no one else's. It is not snappy, as Dickens can be. It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's. It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either. It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as \\"modern.\\" Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest. Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions. Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere. The effect is not pretentious but timeless.There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here. Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience. I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best stories I've ever read. Its characters, especially Tess herself, are so alive and memorable that they stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. That being said, though, it's also not a novel for the casual reader. This book is so thought-provoking and, ultimately, heartbraking that it can't be easily forgotten, and will more than likely leave you with an overwhelming sadness for a long time afterward. I read a lot, and material with very different subject matters, so I'm not being melodramatic when I say that this book left me extremely choked up, and almost on the verge of tears. For a guy in his mid-20's who never gets emotional, I think that's saying quite a lot. It certainly left me with a lot of respect for the author. The reader comes to care so much about Tess, and agonize over the way her life turns out, that it becomes almost unbearable at times. For a fictional tale to have that effect on a person is quite incredible. Difficult or not, anyone who is interested in reading a brilliant and moving story that deserves to be called a classic should read Tess of the D'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Recently, my brother and I were discussing the \\"poverty penalty,\\" the concept that the poor pay more for what they must buy because they have no bargaining power to invite competition, which drives down prices. This is obviously not a new phenomenon, because poor Tess Durbeyfield pays quite a poverty penalty through the course of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy.This is the first novel of Hardy's I have read, but I chose it after reading \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\" by Daniel Pool, a fabulous book about 18th century daily life.Hardy's title, as quickly becomes evident, is tongue-in-cheek (he is author of my favorite title of a book, Jude the Obscure, which I haven't yet read) is ironic and mocking. Tess, the lovely and somewhat educated daughter of a cottager in Hardy's British district of Wessex, has the last name of Durbeyfield, but in the first pages of the book, her father, the ne'er-do-well, learns that he is descended from Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles, and there aren't many of them left, except his clan, as the local reverend informs him. He instantly thinks himself very grand and takes it as an excuse to go carousing, which causes Tess and one of her many younger siblings to have to make an early morning journey with the horse for the family's means of making money. Sleeping on the journey, Tess wakes to find the horse impaled in a wreck and killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to be sent as a poor relation to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles to seek assistance of some kind. (They are \\"new money\\" and have bought the name \\"D'Urberville\\" to build position for themselves, so they are actually no relation.)There she encounters Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her vigorously, though she repeatedly eschews his attentions. She takes a job for his mother, watching her fowl, but one evening, separated from her friends in the village on the way home from a Saturday night out in the village, Alec stops accepting no for an answer.Later she falls in mutual love with a gentleman (the son of a minister) who has rejected the pulpit himself in favor of learning the trade of dairy farming so that he may run his own farm some day. Angel Clare does fall in love with Tess, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to really know her, or want to... he thinks of her as a pure country maid, and has no idea about her past. When she tries to tell him, he shushes her, thinking he knows all about her. When she finally confides in him after the marriage, the results are disastrous and Tess is once again dealing with harsh reality.I won't recount the rest of the story, but it's clear that the bourgeois (Alec) and the gentry (Angel) have a great deal to do with the pain and hardship of Tess's life; they inflict the poverty penalty on her. The idea of the fluidity of the aristocracy in the 18th century -- Tess is descended from them, but has no rights thereof, Alec has taken the name due to his money, and Angel has rejected the career of his familial role in favor of farming whilst entertaining a very aristocratic (and inaccurate) view of the \\"peasantry\\" -- is prominent in the novel, with Tess's inability to care for herself and fulfill her perceived familial goals without resorting to asking for help from those who don't have her bloodline at all. The town of Kingsbere, where Tess's ancestors are said to be buried, figures somewhat in the novel, and one cannot help but think that this symbolizes their use to her as being just as dead as they are.There are some motifs of paganism in the book... Tess meets Angel for the first time at a May dance, a pagan rite, and she has another climactic plot moment at Stonehenge toward the end of the book. Angel himself seems to reject his father's Christian teachings, and the beliefs of Tess and her society are often deemed superstitious or quaint and encompassing of pagan belief systems. Tess often wishes to be free of her life of burdens, and who can blame her? She didn't cause the horse's death that plunged her into this chain of events, and yet she is punished and punished and punished.Hardy's writing is beautiful and engaging. The book, though long, seems to quickly move from event to event, and the author's descriptions are enlightening and complete. I really liked this book and look forward to reading more by Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"When Thomas Hardy first had \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" published in 1891, the controversy that surrounded it ensured for him financial security and status as one of the most popular authors of the time. The novel's scandal was concerned with the plot itself, in which an innocent young maid is seduced by an aristocratic cad, and pays for such an indiscretion with everything she holds dear in her life. In Hardy's journal (as recounted in Margaret Higonnet's introduction in this edition) he records that one of the Duchess of Abercorn's dinner parties ended in an argument between those who believed that Tess deserved her fate, and those that sympathized with her plight. However, by today's standards (in which premarital sex barely registers an eye-blink) one can't help but wonder if such a novel is relevant anymore.I'm going to argue, that yes, of course it is - if not simply to illustrate how lucky we are to no longer live in a world where a woman can be utterly destroyed through the hypocrisy of the society she lives in. However, there's considerably more to it than that, particularly as the remnants of this ideology remain to this day; and since one of the central themes of the novel is the negative effect of past traditions on the present, this bears keeping in mind.Tess Durbeyfield is a simple country lass, easily manipulated and with a limited education, but with a keen intelligence and insight into human nature. However, when her foolish father is casually told by the village minister that he is the offshoot of a once-noble family, Tess is thrown into her parent's ambition mechanizations. Made to leave her home and younger siblings, Tess begins work tending chickens at a relative's house whilst attempting to ward off the unwelcome attentions of her devious cousin Alec D'Uberville. However, her resolve slips one night when she is alone with Alec, lost and (as the text suggests) intoxicated, and he takes full advantage of her vulnerability.Having borne his child and lost it soon after (all without Alec's knowledge) Tess seeks employment elsewhere, and finds a sense of peace and security as a milkmaid in a neighboring village. That is, until she meets the parson's son Angel Clare, a very different kind of man from Alec D'Uberville. Falling in love, (along with every other girl on the farm!) Tess finds herself in a new moral crisis. Should she reveal her secret to Angel? Would he accept her if he knew? Her family (not to mention her common sense) warn her to keep her mouth shut, but can any relationship last if it is based on a lie? Shouldn't she have faith in Angel's testimonies of love to her?However, you've probably already guessed that the story doesn't have a happy ending, and this is a tragedy in the old grand tradition. When young Tess is seduced by a man her fate is sealed. She is a fallen woman, carrying the shame of her indiscretions throughout the rest of her life. However, the novel is remarkable because of Hardy's ability to find light amongst all the grimness. In the depths of Tess's drudgery and despair, we feel her moments of tranquility and appreciation of the beauty that surround her. Likewise, in moments of joy and peace, there is the underlying dread of the secret threatening to rare its ugly head. The emotions stirred in reading this novel are relentless - not to put anyone off from reading this novel, but I was in a constant state of agitation and discomfort in reading; that's how vivid the circumstances of the novel were. I mean that as a good thing of course; books these days are like movies - you sit, you watch, you more often than not feel nothing. But I was truly moved by \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" and her story; and I can't remember the last time I became so invested in a character and her happiness. Despite the pain it brought me in reading it, \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" was worth every agonizing word.In many ways this is a feminist novel, and although I would hate to put too modern a spin on it, it is very easy to see that Thomas Hardy's sympathies lie with Tess, writing in a letter: \\"I lost my heart to her as I went on with her history.\\" It is impossible not to feel a swell of indignation when Alec D'Uberville makes Tess swear not to tempt him anymore (as if his lust for her attractiveness is somehow *her* fault!) and a sense of bitter frustration at Angel Clare's inability to accept Tess's indiscretion, particularly when he himself is guilty of the same crime. When his lofty image of Tess as his pure \`child-bride' is taken from him, you can't help but feel he's doing it just as much out of injured pride than any sense of propriety.But this propriety is all-powerful in the novel; a heavy weight upon Tess that destroys her life. Hardy brings forth the idea that this is indeed a fallen world, but that it is so because of mankind's own structures of tradition and circumstance, rather than any divine ordination or original sin. To be free of some of them is a great release, though there are plenty that remain in this and other cultures around the world. The story is one of endurance; enduring the condemnation of others, the physical trials of manual labour, the suffering of a broken heart, the terror of encroaching death. We cannot control any of these aspects of our lives - all we can do is endure them, as Tess did."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I'm many years out of college and thought I should start reading some more of the classics. Previous favorites of mine have been The Sound and the Fury, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice. I saw Tess of the D'Urbervilles on my sister's bookshelf and for about a year I considered reading it. Finally, I picked it up and began. Wow! I read it in about three days. I never expected I would feel so much by reading this book. I cried when she baptized Sorrow herself. Her concerns that he be buried in the churchyard and her efforts to ensure he was were touching. I wanted to help Tess Durbeyfield. I thought she was a very complex character--she was sweet and unworldly but she wasn't actually stupid. And she was strong in many ways--for example, her family relied on Tess for so many things--eventually even their support. In fact, I hated her family for not working harder and making their own sacrifices. All the burden was on poor Tess. I also wanted to shake some sense into Angel. He really did wrong by Tess--although he eventually realizes this, it comes too late. The only thing I really did not care for was the sudden inclusion of a minor character (who we met earlier)into the end of the book and the implication that she would play an important role in the future of a major character. I barely knew this minor character and NOBODY could compare to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. If you are reading this to find a good book, ignore the negative reviews by high-school students and buy this book NOW. It's unforgettable."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, \\"Pay attention to ME!!!\\" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read \\"mind candy\\", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"In a certain light, Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" might be seen as a Cinderella story horribly disfigured by a tragic twist. When we first meet the heroine, Tess Durbeyfield, as a poor, hardworking farm girl who has to take care of her five younger siblings and fulfill the responsibilities abandoned by her inebriated father, she seems like a girl destined for greater things: a brilliant career in a more stimulating occupation, a blissful marriage to a wonderful man. But Hardy likes to illustrate fate's capacity for cruelty, and Tess is merely an innocent woman who is seemingly punished for her innocence.The name Durbeyfield is a vulgarization of d'Urberville, a family with a rich history descended from Norman knights and wealthy landowners, but various misfortunes have reduced the lineage to the commoners who presently inhabit the impoverished Durbeyfield household. (We learn later in the novel that the Durbeyfields are not the only local family to have suffered this appellative fall from grace.) Although the d'Urberville nobility is defunct, in the near past an enterprising businessman named Stoke sought to increase the prestige of his own family by appropriating a distinguished name from the county annals, and d'Urberville is the one he chose. Thus when Tess, to aid her family's finances after an unfortunate accident deprives them of their income, takes a job tending the fowl at the nearby d'Urberville estate, she mistakenly believes she is working for her relations.This ostensibly minor detail is really the basis of the irony which drives the novel. Had Mr. Stoke been honest and not assumed the name of the Durbeyfields' ancestors, Tess would not have been likely to meet the lecherous, skulking Alec d'Urberville, who rapes her after she rebuffs his attempted seduction and impregnates her with a baby that dies in infancy. Of course Hardy, evading the risk of censorship, is decorous enough to suggest in the subtlest manner possible that the rape happened rather than describe it explicitly, but Alec's immoral behavior is clearly implied.Mortified, heartbroken, Tess then goes to work as a milkmaid at a dairy farm where she and a young man named Angel Clare, the heartthrob of several of the farm girls, fall in love. Angel has defied his father, a vicar, by spurning a career in the clergy for agriculture and marriage with a middle class girl for Tess. He scoffs at his parents' snobbery, but after marrying Tess, he reveals a disturbing hypocrisy when she confesses to him the vicious treatment she had received from Alec and its consequences. Angel's reaction is far from the gentle sympathy one would expect from the magnanimous personality he projects; he is disgusted that she has been robbed of her purity and draws a strange parallel between her violation and the fall of her family's ancestral prestige. He rejects her, they separate, and once again she is mortified, heartbroken, and looking for a job.Tess is destined to rencounter both Angel and Alec before the end of the novel, and the changes to their characters not only advance the plot in unexpected ways but further emphasize Hardy's utilization of irony. The starkly contrasted images of the novel's penultimate scene at Stonehenge and the last scene, which takes place outside a prison where a black flag flies announcing an execution, raise the question of whether even Hardy knew when he started exactly how this somber story would end.The novel contains several recurring Hardy elements. Like most of his major work, it takes place in the southwestern part of England he calls Wessex, this time in the fertile Blackmoor Vale, and his evocation of the scenery sets the stage beautifully. Tess's co-workers at the dairy farm are a realistically cheerful lot and provide the continuum of humanity that such a story needs as a reprieve for its tragic mood. An interesting touch which shows that Hardy is not above recycling his own motifs is the similarity between the death of the Durbeyfield horse (a definite foreshadowing for Tess) and the tumbling sheep in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd,\\" in that both incidents cause their respective protagonists to take distant jobs with fateful results. The incentive to read Hardy lies in his ability to put language at the service of one of the greatest functions of literature: to express the deepest desires and emotions of mankind."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I see \\"Tess\\" as the story of how a beauty is wronged by evil and by arrogance.But oh, what a story. Hardy's novels read like poetry. Tess is so lovely, innocent and good, Alec so relentlessly hideous, and Angel so pathetically self-righteous, that I find the gradual destruction of Tess (with whom I empathize) at the hands of these two men, to be difficult to experience again, line by line!What a masterpiece of the human condition, and I'm told, of the female experience. Hardy's bitterly honest portrayal of the worst and best of human behavior is as powerful as any I've found in literature.When I need a Hardy fix and I don't want to be depressed, I turn to \\"Far From the Madding Crowd.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"(Warning: Tells Plot of the Story)Through many revisions and editions, Tess of the D'Urbervilles A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented By Thomas Hardy still holds readers captive over a hundred years later. Tess's plight though childhood innocence to womanly revenge is similar to other fairy tales and classic novels. It is said to be a love story for young girls or an adults' treasure of allusions and serious themes. Tess grows up fast, having to deal with the wrongs of mankind, her social class, a noble lineage, and the renewal of her true self. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel that can surpass the ages as a heartbreaking tale for any reader who believes in redemption and compassion for the all-encompassing heroine.In 19th Century Britain, Tess searches for a little pleasure out of her wronged life. Through many novels, Thomas Hardy has told the stories of characters and flaws. Hardy's insight to a woman's life is remarkable. He shows the injustices women have received and the stereotypes that follow women still today. Without knowing the narrator to be a man, it could easily have been a woman who told this very feminine tale. The book was very controversial at the time of its release in 1891. Parts were censored and seen as obscene because of it's sexual views. Hardy continually revised the story, changing the interpretations of the main characters. He did this through including information on some facts and removing statements on others. Alec D'Urberville could be seen in one edition as only the antagonist, not the villain he is in this version. His alterations lead to the 1912-13 edition that is usually the book available now.Hardy focuses on many themes throughout the book, mostly on the feminine role and social class. Tess Durbeyfield realizes her social struggle when she caused an accident to happen sending her family into financial need. With the recent discovery of their family's lineage to be that of the once very prominent D'Urbervilles, Tess is sent off to her wealthy relatives. The relatives in reality are not D'Urbervilles, only a family that had taken the name because questionable activity was attached to their old name. Alec D'Urberville realizes Tess's financial need and uses it against her to join him at his mother's estate. Gender roles are brought up when Joan Durbeyfield, Tess's mother, believes that \\"her face\\" (53) is her one advantage. Only D'Urbervilles advantage is greater. He holds the blackmail of economic need over Tess's head until he eventually takes advantage of her. \\"An immeasurable chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm\\" (74). The pregnant Tess, as an unmarried woman isolated from others, escapes home to have her baby. Tess tries her hand as a field worker where women \\"were the most interesting of this company of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature\\" \\"A field-man is a personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field\\" (87-89). Roles are defined by gender again as women being earthly and beautiful, men having no goodness, and in the end the man still gets the better of the woman.Tess's baby dies, leaving her to start over at Talbothay's Dairy. Finding real love in Angel Care, he convinces Tess to marry him. She tries to tell him of her past only to have him refuse to hear her each time. After their wedding, Clare admits his previous sexual experience asking for forgiveness and receiving it. When Tess relates her story, he can no longer be with her, claiming that \\"forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another\\" (228) \\"the woman I have been loving is not you\\" (229). Men's double standards are shown. Clare leaves her for Brazil to decide if they could fix matters. During his long extended absence, Tess is reduced to farm labor. Her father dies and her family is evicted from their home. Her economic welfare falls again into Alec D'Urbervilles hands. His advantage persuades Tess to be his wife because her real husband was never coming back, according to D'Urberville.Clare came back to find his wife living with D'Urberville. Tess, in a moment of revelation, avenges the wrongs of D'Urberville by killing him. Clare and Tess have a few days of paradise together before she is taken away for D'Urbervilles murder. Tess understands that this is how it has to be. She will be able to die before Clare can despise her again. She dies a fulfilled woman, \\"'I am ready,' she said quietly\\" (396).Besides being a wonderful tale, Hardy's strength in writing merits the book to be an excellent read. Hardy achieves his goal of relating the story of an innocent girl whose life was simple before the villain D'Urberville comes into the story and nearly perfect after he is out of the story. Hardy portrayed his \\"Pure Woman\\" with brilliancy and faithfulness. Social class issues are displayed though Tess's country girl nature yet noble lineage. If her family had not been in economic problems, her tragic flaw would never have occurred. She could have lived as a farmer's wife and lived a simple life. The feminine stereotypes and generalizations are represented by the actions of others upon the poetic Tess.Hardy's background in poetry gives the novel a lyrical quality missing in the books of today's generation. Hardy alludes to several other works of art including Greek mythology, Shakespeare, fairy tales, and the Bible. He utilizes imagery as well. His uncanny imagery creates the entire world of Tess for the reader, down to the little window reflections upon a dress. The extremely detailed and well articulated descriptions can easily be seen in the readers mind. These literary elements are well used and fit the tale accordingly.Enjoyment would be received from Tess of the D'Urbervilles by those hopeless romantics who value depth to a story and appreciate the British setting. Gender roles and social class issues are blatantly raised with no subtly. Love story or social issue awareness, the beloved heroine, innocent, strong, loving, and pure will reach into one's heart and capture it forever in the world of fairy tales and happy endings."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Even though the length of this book is very long, it was one of the most compelling books I have read.

A classic tale of women's suffering and the unfortunate things that happened before women's rights were liberated. Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles, written by Thomas Hardy is a classic novel set in the countryside of England at the turn of the century . It reflects the lifestyle of the 19th century-- women didn't have many rights back then, men being superior in every aspect. Communication was not very fast and effective, increasing social and personal isolation.The main character, Tess, is a very credulous and naive daughter of a poor cottager. At the beginning of the book, the cottager learns that he is a descendent of Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles. The cottager instantly thinks of himself as a rich man because of the money his relatives have, and celebrates the great news by going to a bar to drink. When their dad doesn't come back from the bar, Tess and one of her many younger siblings go to get their dad from the bar with their family's horse, Prince. On their way to the bar Tess and her brother fall asleep and lead Prince to a near fence with sharp nails, causing Prince to stab himself on the chest with the nails and dies. Tess, feeling guilty, agrees to go to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles so that she can work to help the family. It turns out that the 'relatives' living there were just trying to build position for themselves and had bought the name\\"d'Ubervilles\\", a secret that no one knows until too late.While working at the D'Urberville Tess meets Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her endlessly until he gets what he wants. Tess goes back to her home village and learns she is pregnant, but soon loses the unwanted baby. Trying to make a new start, she goes to a farm where she makes a few friends and learns basic farm work. She falls in love with Angel, the son of a minister, who chose the peaceful farm life in hopes of running his own farm some day. It seemed like Angel did love Tess, but didn't want to really know her. Tess then gets into a self conflict where a part of her wants to tell Angel about her past, but the other part just hopes to keep it a secret. They get married, and that same night, Tess makes up her mind, thinking that Angel will accept her past if he really loves her because he had been in a similar situation before. But, unfortunately, Angel refuses to give her a chance and leaves to another country. This episode describes a traditional, but altogether hypocritical, male attitude towards females.The character development is realistic, Tess gets stronger and more mature as her life gets harder. At the beginning of the book, Tess was this a fragile and somewhat responsible girl who cried very easily and as the book ends, she shows her strong side where she can actually defend herself. In my opinion, she was a good daughter who cared about her family even though they used her as a source of money. Her parents, in contrast, are selfish, trying to earn money the easy way.As one reads this book, the impression emerges that Tess' love for Angel was greater than his love for her. Angel wasn't 'innocent' when he married Tess, yet he was disgusted by her past. If he hadn't left her, then she wouldn't have gone to Alec to help her family and she wouldn't have died a tragic death. Thus, this insensitive man was actually responsible for the tragedies of other innocent people. I believe that Tess' love for Angel was somehow 'greater' because even after Angel leaves her for months, she accepts him back and even kills someone to be with him. In this way, Hardy suggests that women are actually are actually more steadfast and strong in their love.Tess' death was unfair if we think in modern day terms. Alec had pursued her, ruining both her marriage and her entire life. The books describes how Alec and Tess get into a fight when Angel comes back for her. Tess killed Alec for both revenge and self defense, but British justice did not acknowledge that and executed her. Again, we have a criticism of social rules and practices which treated women unfairly.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a tragic novel which will make readers feel gloomy, sad and upset for quite a while. It is definitely not the best read for summer, or in that case any other time of the year if the reader seeks pleasing entertainment.It will, however, make readers think deeply just how different the whole system of justice and society operated in the past and how much has changed."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I'm not going to write a long, flowery review.

Without a doubt, this is the most probing and moving novel I have ever read in my entire life. It hit areas of my heart and mind as no other book ever has, especially in terms of being a woman. It was never required reading in any area of my schooling, even college. Yet as a former administrator, grade advisor, and mentor in a private school, I now realize that many of the students were required to read this book, but I never thought of reading it to discuss it with them; what a mistake. Had I known, this book would have been an invaluable tool for bringing out the horrors of the double standard.Every man, woman and child alive should read this book to find out the true sentiments of a woman who is brutalized sexually and mentally and shunned, not only by the man in question, but by the community, her family, the clergy, and ultimately, the man who claims to love her. How she deals with a \\"shame\\" that has been thrust upon her is crushing, and brings to mind that even in this 21st century, the double standard has not changed one iota, not even in the biggest of cities, regardless of what we see and hear in books, films and music. Go into any neighborhood, in any town, and in any city, and we see that this still exists.

The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book, while perhaps well written, is just so ridiculous and self-contradictory that it's maddening to read. While it's necessary to forgive him some annoying parts of his style as being a part of his age, one cannot overlook the horrible plot and characterization.Not one of the characters in the entire book is coherent or believable. He begins with a stereotype--the innocent country lass (Tess), the skeptical intellectual (Angel), the depraved rich dandy (Alec)--describing mainly their appearance and superficial thoughts, so that they never rise above the stereotype. Then, if they stereotype doesn't suit the plot, he'll simply have them act in complete contradiction of their previous shoddy characterization, without any explanation of how they might have changed. Angel's rejection of Tess, for example--he, the skeptical nonconformist who questions conventional social mores, suddenly repudiates Tess for being the victim of a rape, despite his own questionable conduct. I might expect that behavior from a conceited hypocrite, but not the all-around good guy that Hardy has made Angel out to be. And it's not like we've made a discovery here about Angel's real nature, because Hardy goes right on describing him the way he had before. Of course, he takes her back, which is perhaps believable, except that he has not a moment of hesitation when he finds out she murdered Alec. So when your wife tells you she was raped, you leave her, but when she kills someone, you help her to escape without even a second thought?Then there's Tess. She seems like a pretty resourceful and sensible girl right up to the point where Angel leaves her for a stupid reason and she spends the next five years or whatever pining for him. She writes him one scolding letter, and then regrets it. And even though she can't muster the courage to approach Angel's father, or tell Angel off, or rebuff the advance of Alec--although Hardy describes her as having \\"natural fearlessness\\" at one point--she can somehow stab Alec later.Alec, of course, is the one who first becomes a preacher because someone talks to him on the road, and then gives it up because Tess is just too darn beautiful. You'd think some more convincing would be needed for either conversion, but nope, Hardy can't spare any time for actual character development when he could describe Talbothays again.Finally, I can take an example from a minor character. At one point in the book Hardy describes Izz Huett, a milkmaid, as \\"by nature the sauciest and most caustic\\" of the milkmaids; a mere 20 pages later he describes her as \\"a girl of tact.\\" Did he read what he wrote before sending it to the publisher?Aside from the contradictions in every one of his major characters (and a lot of the minor ones too), there are also points in the book that are just plain ridiculous. I mean, Stonehenge? Come on. How cheesy can you get? Not to mention the fact that he sent sixteen cops after them so they could be surrounded in the morning. It's as if he put stuff into his book because he thought it would be cool. Same deal with Angel going to BRAZIL. Also, apparently Angel can pick berries with his whip. Hardy also tends to get carried away with his own writing. He once mentions the plains of Brazil (if by \\"plains\\" he meant \\"rain forest\\") and describes a cow's \\"large-veined udders.\\"Lastly, the book oozes prejudices about country folk and women--mostly to the effect that they're naive and ignorant. In fact, Hardy seems to share the prejudices of Angel Clare. In any case, this book is a lot of reading in return for all the reward of a trashy romance novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I'm a French student of English, in my third year at university. I have to read \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" for my British literature class and it's just terrible. The author spends so much time describing Tess' beauty, virtue, kindness and courage, that I wonder why her name is not Mary Sue. There is no character development : instead, we are told a hundred times that Tess' eye colour is somewhere between blue, violet, grey and black -- seriously, can you picture that ?Furthermore, the heroine's so-called \\"kindness\\" is nothing but stupid weakness in my opinion. Her love interest, Angel Clare -- who, for some obscure reason, is also loved by most of her dairymaid friends --, blames and rejects her for being raped, and yet she still worships him and behaves like his obedient slave, despite his cruelty to her. This is merely a ridiculous and unhealthy obsession, not a true love story.To my mind, the only likeable character is Alec D'Urberville.

This book was so terrible no one is my class read it, out teacher would have to come to class with 25 photocopies of the pages we were going over because no one would &quot;remember&quot; to bring thier book to class. As a story it was poigent and overdone, as a character, Tess was an insult to women everywhere.

No more than anyone else, perhaps, but a decent few that i could get my hands on.I've never read Hardy, and though his style was different, it was not hard to follow. The flaws in his characters are realistic enough, but it is those flaws that made me dislike the book. Tess is a simpering simpleton who should be smarter than she is. Angel is a Devil, who is the most hypocritical, bigoted, delusional idiot that walked in the book. The evil man, Alec D'Urberville, was terrible, but his evils could be comparable to Angel's. And in the middle is the lost child Tess, who can't be counted on to have a milliliter of sense or perception concering people throughout the entire book. She worships Angel, and blames herself for her rape, because Angel blames her despite his insisting that he doesn't.The plot could have been better, the characters could have been likable, and for God's sake it could have been less repetitive. Yes, we all understand, Tess you love him, Tess you need him, Tess you live for him, whatever, we understand, stop obsessing. Well written, but only worth reading at most once.

From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man.

Unlike most classics, this book was very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her &quot;husband&quot; Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and &quot;footnotes&quot;. In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books?

Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again.

It is so beautifully written that even through the frustrations and hardships the heroine faces, you are drawn on by the power of the language and the force of the story. Hardy was trying to make an important point in the writing of this story, and while such a tale seems unimaginable in today's world, it nevertheless resonates, particularly with women. Shocking in it's day, Hardy's efforts were felt. Tess is a provocative look at the plight of the 19th century woman, unnaturally naive to a world run by world-wise men. I'm not sure I've ever recovered from this book, and it has been a powerful influence in my own work.But yes, it's always wise to read the forward and preface LAST in any book, particularly literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A MUST READ! Although I was originally recommended this story alongside The Scarlet Letter on a reading list, other than the theme of love and extramarital pregnancy, Tess exceeds in every way. My favorite aspect is that it is intricately woven with complex characters that make the reader question whether they should love, pity, or hate each (or all of the above). And I love that the story is complete... almost a series of stories following Tess, flowing from one stage of her life to the next. I can't go too in depth with this review without giving away important details I think you'll enjoy discovering along the way. All I can do is recommend that every read Tess of the d'Urbervilles at least once!

Hardy's novel must have been quite scandalous back when it was written for its treatment of a taboo subject. Things inevitably go from bad to worse.

The language was full of beautiful imagery and the characters were unforgettable. Hardy's use of birds and colors as symbolism provide a vivid picture of the novel. Tess's story is compelling, tragic, and beautiful. Despite the difficult language, once one begins to catch the flow of the novel, it is almost impossible to put the book down.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is the tragedy about a young maiden who is seduced/raped by an incorrigible Alec Stoke-d'Urberville. Her life from there only becomes worse. She falls in love with Angel Clare, who does not know her secret, so their relationship is doomed from the start. Circumstances and human nature drives the innocent Tess to unspeakable bounds, finally leading up to a murder and an execution. Like a bird, Tess has unknowingly flown too high and tragically falls from grace. She is the 19th century version of Eve. Hardy's subtle yet profound allusions to the Bible, more specifically Genesis, cannot be mistaken.This novel is one that should, or must, be read by all. It is a grand tale about love, fate, and the human condition. Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a classic novel because it never goes out of style."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"A CAST OF KILLERS is a compelling look back into the 1922 unsolved murder of William Desmond Taylor. The author tells the story through the eyes of director King Vidor, using his actual research of the murder during the years sixty-six and sixty-seven.Once I picked this up, I could not put it back down, or rather, I didn't want to put it down for a second. Sydney D. Kirkpatrick knows how to grab ahold of a reader and keep them locked into the book until the very end. To make sure nothing spoiled the book for me, I didn't look anything up online (as I'm apt to do) until after I had read the last sentence. This proved to be for the best. Unfortunately, this is not the definitive answer to an unsolved crime, but just Vidor's (and I assume the author's) theory in a case that will likely never be truly solved. Also, the newsletter called Taylorology, which specializes in the murder, found 175 errors and contradictions in the 1986 edition of the book (the one I read). According to their website, most of those errors were corrected in the Twentieth Anniversary Edition.Still, I found the book to be absolutely riveting and was a good starting place to learn the basics of a crime I had never heard of before. A CAST OF KILLERS is written like a novel, therefore it's a fast read and very entertaining. I take the theory used in it with a grain of salt, but all-in-all, it was a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"I first read this book when it came out in the 80's, this book introduced me to the careers of William Desmond Taylor and MMM, I already knew a little about Mabel. I loved the mystery surrounding the case and how it has never been solved. I bought the new book mainly because my original was pretty beat up and it's one of those books I like to bring out now and then and re read. There is a new intro from the author and the bio's at the back have been updated slightly, no new pics which would have been nice but all in all I love revisiting this story. Does it solve the mystery??? Depends on your views, everyone who knows of the case has their own opinion but I enjoyed the book and am glad to have it in my collection."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"I found the book to be very intriguing, not only because it explored a very interesting aspect of Hollywood history, now fading into legend, but because it gave insight into King Vidor himself. I never knew he was involved with Colleen Moore and I feel very sad that they never married. I also think that his conclusion is the correct one...the possible perpetrator would be very capable for doing it, I think."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"This book reads like an exciting Hollywood murder mystery (which it is), but after reading Robert Giroux's version (Deed of Death), I am inclined to believe that Kirkpatrick's version (based on research by Hollywood director King Vidor) has taken a few liberties and definitely put more weight in some of the juicy (but not necessarily true) anecdotes. Still, if you want a \\"can't put-down\\" book that talks about Hollywood of the Silent Era, you won't go wrong with this one. The subplot about Mary Miles Minter and her family is a little creepy, and at the end, somewhat sad as well."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"This book has everything- murder, mystery, and a love story. Best of all, it's all true!!! While there are some errors in the story itself, none take away from King Vidor's solution of one of Hollywood's first scandals. I first read this book ten years ago and have read it again and again. Not until I got a second copy was I willing to loan it out. Find a copy, sit back, and settle in for a great read!"},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"King Vidor was one of the pioneer directors of the movie industry in LA. He knew personally several of the key figures in the notorious, unsolved 1922 murder of another director, William Desmond Taylor, one of the three incidents that spawned the creation of the Hays Office (at first to regulate the morals of the stars, and later to censor the movies themselves.)In the 1960's Vidor, then somewhat unwillingly retired and looking for good material that might be used for a come-back film, began to investigate that long-buried crime. Surprisingly enough, he solved it, but never went public with his findings. After his death, his would-be biographer Sidney Kirkpatrick found Vidor's box full of notes... hidden under the hot water heater in Vidor's basement.The tale Kirkpatrick spins here is the double-story - of Vidor investigating the crime and rekindling a long-dead romance, and of the crime itself. The answer Vidor found is both obvious and surprising, and the reason it remained so long &quot;unsolved&quot; is the purest look into the truth about Los Angeles that I've ever read. And the ending, the reason Vidor never published his findings, is a melancholy triumph of real life over art. The narrative - both narratives, really - are fascinatingly told, enthralling and appalling at the same time. A top-notch book about Hollywood and Los Angeles, and the difference between the two. Now out-of-print, this is a book well worth waiting for... but don't look to see my copy on the used book-market."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"This is an unusual and rather special book which successfully combines factual and dramatic writing, while at the same time attempting to solve one of Hollywood's most puzzling and notorious murder cases of all time. The special and - for me - most appealing aspect of this book is that it is, in effect, written by two people: author-journalist Sidney Kirkpatrick and famous Hollywood director, King Vidor, whose extensive notes and research Kirkpatrick used in constructing this story. It is fair to say, therefore, that without King Vidor's original thorough research in 1967 into a cold case already over forty years old, this book would not have been written. On the other hand, without Kirkpatrick's own interest in the life of King Vidor, whose authorized biography he was about to write shortly after Vidor's death, this story also might never have been told. Looking for new material for a screenplay, King Vidor returned to the infamous 1922 murder of his contemporary, director William Desmond Taylor, and the cast of suspects which included actresses at the height of their careers at the time. He spent the whole of 1967 researching and interviewing people, as if perhaps he, as a Hollywood insider, might find the missing clues or evidence the police could not. Such fascination or perhaps even obsession for an unsolved crime is understandable, and also quite contagious: not only was Sidney Kirkpatrick compelled to re-open Vidor's investigation, but surely everyone else who begins reading Kirkpatrick's book will find it hard to put down. This is so regardless of whether one believes all the statements, accounts and interviews presented in this book because the style of writing is vivid, captivating and suspenseful. Having found King Vidor's hidden box and files on the Taylor murder, Kirkpatrick verified as much of the evidence and information as he could, and then set about telling the story through King Vidor's eyes instead of his own. This fascinating angle allows the reader to get to know Vidor himself as well as the lives of other well-known stars of the silent era, recounting meetings and conversations in the dialogue style of dramatic fiction writing in the way it may have actually happened. This reconstruction makes the book read like a classic whodunit mystery thriller which would already appeal to the general reader of this genre, but being based on facts as well as involving big names of early Hollywood, this becomes a book any true-crimes reader and especially a silent film enthusiast would absolutely relish. True to its reputation, this Hollywood murder mystery seems to have it all, from the murdered director with a dark, mysterious past, the famous comedienne with an alleged cocaine habit, the child star controlled by her domineering mother who wrote love letters to her director, as well as non-Hollywood suspects such as the director's houseman and secretary, each with their own suspicious backgrounds. Come to think of it, this cast of possible killers sounds even too preposterous for a Hollywood screenplay, but they do say \`truth is stranger than fiction', and perhaps this book proves it! In fact, the amateur armchair detective might feel like giving up a few times while reading \\"A Cast of Killers\\", at which point I suggest simply continuing to read the book as an entertaining novel until more clues and revelations shed light on a possible lead - or not. In any case, this book can be whatever the reader wants it to be, including King Vidor's solution of the case."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"An EXCELLENT book on probably the most baffling Hollywood murder &quot;mystery&quot;, excluding the Black Dahlia&quot; case, in that town's history.Such a GOOD book that I own THREE copies, knowing that it would become a classic and quickly fall into the hard-to-find genre! Rare is the occasion when I let a copy leave my home!!I can't believe that it has never been considered as a viable film project!! A MUST BUY book!!!"},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"A Cast of Killers is a fascinating account of the murder of William Desmond Taylor and a sleuthing director King Vidor on the trail of who murdered him. Vidor wants to make a film about the Hollywood scandal which turned up no results and left an open case for the police. Along with Colleen Moore, lover and business partner, Vidor researches a case filled with contradictions and cover-ups.This book's print is rather large, and it makes the 300 pages go back rapidly with aid from the intriguing story. It is also highly suspenseful and entertaining. Even if the reader has no idea who William Desmond Taylor, Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter, or King Vidor are, he or she will still most likely enjoy the book.The afterward is outdated by now because the book was published in 1986. All of the Hollywood names mentioned are no longer living, and it is doubtful that any of the others are alive anymore.Even under the assumption that the story is true, one finds it hard to believe because of the format of this book. It reads like a fiction mystery novel or an episode of the popular television show Law and Order. However, this book is hardly credible. The \\"facts\\" in it are said to be from private papers King Vidor had together that were set aside for his film project. These documents consist of transcripts illegally obtained from the police and interviews from witnesses or friends to witnesses that are not deceased. None of these documents are properly cited; there is a lack of a bibliography or an appendix. The only citation states that the information was received from Vidor's son who made his father's notes available to the author. The claims the author makes about this book being the \\"true story of Hollywood's most scandalous murder\\" seem strange considering how much effort Vidor put into attempting to prove his theory. Kirpatrick seems to have made no such effort.Other questions come to mind when regarding the validity of this book. How did Kirpatrick come across the information that Vidor knew who killed Taylor and why were the findings so easily given to him after Vidor decided NOT to publish the information in fear of hurting people? And if the book were published because the author felt that no one alive who remembered or was attributed to the case would be negatively affected, why then did the police department not confirm the accusations in the book as being valid and close the case?This book is controversial, even today. If it were less sloppy, it could have been a major breakthrough in the case of William Desmond Taylor. As it is, A Cast of Killers is a highly entertaining and enjoyable work of fiction. Taken literally, it is only comparable to such trash as Hollywood Babylon."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"While \\"A Cast of Killers\\" makes for an entertaining read, rest assured that that's all it is - entertainment. To be blunt, not only is the book full of errors, but it reads as either the hokiest mystery ever written, or at a failed attempt at irony, the irony being that it plays out like a Hollywood murder mystery.The biggest problem with this book is that one never knows whose research the book is relying on - Vidor's or Kirkpatrick's. There are holes in this story big enough to throw a cat through - if they are holes left by Vidor, then Kirkpatrick should have filled them. If they are holes left by Kirkpatrick....ahem.While the books does most certainly invoke the Hollywood of the 1920s, when the movies were in their infancy, it ultimately fails to either, A. shed a great deal of light on just who William Desmond Taylor was, or B. even plausibly solve the mystery of his death. I.e., most of the information about William Desmond Taylor in this book is either assumed or inferred - with little evidence to corroborate it.SPOILER ALERT:And as for the facts surrounding the murder that Vidor and/or Kirkpatrick present... to say that most of them conflict or simply do not compute is an understatement. For example - apparently Paramount wanted to hide the fact that Taylor was a homosexual, and sent in a team of studio employees to scour his bungalow in the hours after his death. Vidor/Kirkpatrick's evidence for this assertion is what Vidor (or was it Kirkpatrick?) apparently read through the lines of the police reports, and the insinuations of a not-so reliable associate of Taylors. Yet, after we are supposed to be convinced that Taylor was a homosexual, we are then asked to believe that Mary Miles Minter's mother killed Taylor because she thought he was going to run off with MMM. And considering that part of the evidence for this solution to the mystery is calls back and forth between WDT and MMM around the time of the murder, with WDT encouraging MMM to leave her mother and come live with him, and MMM's belief that he wanted to marry her... well, you get the picture. One doesn't know what version of WDT to believe, which ultimately hurts the book.And, to sum it all up, in his acknowledgements, Kirkpatrick mentions Bruce Long, whose Taylorology website/newsletter provides more intelligent insight into the WDT murder than Kirkpatrick or Vidor ever imagined, calling Long a \\"fan\\" of the murder. A FAN for the love of God! Kirkpatrick would have been wise to heed this FAN'S counsel. Maybe the book would have been better."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"This wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I ordered it but I was pleasantly surprised after the first few pages. It's not so much a story of Wm. Desmond's mysterious murder as it is King Vidor's search for the truth. Sidney Kirkpatrick did an outstanding job of putting the pieces together from Vidor's own notes and interview's with nearly everybody involved. I would recommend this for anyone interested in true crime, murder mysteries and above all, Hollywood's silent era."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"I read this book when it was first published.

Taylor is virtually unknown today, but he was a noted director in the silent era.This book explores the travesty of justice that occurred after his death including how evidence was lost or stolen at the crime scene. More importantly and tragically it explores what became of 2 Hollywood stars of the silent era: Mary Miles Minter and Mabel Normand. Both of their careers were ruined by this scandal, and unfairly so, because Normand was the last person to see him alive, besides the killer; and Minter because her underwear was found in Taylor's bedroom.Noted Hollywood director King Vidor, who personally knew Taylor, played amateur detective and interviewed people who knew Taylor decades after his murder. Vidor deduced who the probable killer was but hid his notes in his home. They were subsequently found after his death. This book is a published account of Vidor's detective work.This is a well written account of a very tragic event in Hollyood history. If you are a fan of old Hollywood and love true crime stores, you will enjoy this book immensely.

It kept me on the edge of my chair and I am still wondering who done it."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"King Vidor was a legendary film director largely forgotten by Hollywood at the time of his death. Sydney Kirkpatrick came to Vidor's home after his death to research a well deserved biography but instead discovered a buried box full of dynamite. In the box were notes for a planned project which was to be the director's comeback film. But the explosive nature of his findings had prompted Vidor to bury it, literally.This book is based on what Kirkpatrick found in that box. It is full of mystery and murder, love and lust, and in the end, sadness at the solving of one of the most famous and sensational scandels in the history of tinsletown. It is a mesmerizing journey into the early days of Hollywood and the lengths it would go to to cover up its secrets.In 1922 the murder of director William Desmond Taylor was so filled with scandel it ruined careers and nearly destroyed Hollywood. If the absolute truth had been known, it might have. King Vidor had been a part of this Hollywood in its formative years and planned to make his comeback film by telling the story of it. Kirkpatrick could have turned this into a pulp type expose but instead, and to his credit, takes a respectful and nostalgic tone, both for Vidor and a time gone by. He uses Vidor's notes and findings to let this murder mystery unfold just as it did for Vidor.For every film buff with a fascination for old Hollywood this is a book you can't put down. It is juicy but never tawdry, Vidor sifting through the misinformation of Hollywood and the corruption of the police to slowly get a picture of the truth he himsef couldn't yet tell because some of the players were still alive. The homicide and the aftermath is filled with names like Mabel Normand, Alan Dwan, James Kirkwood, Gloria Swanson, Claire Windsor, and Charlette Shelby and her waif like daughter Mary Miles Minter, an early rival of Mary Pickford.Vidor's reputation and the fact he had been a part of this Hollywood way back when gave him weight and would prompt many to open up and talk to Vidor in a way in which they would not have to someone else. He would even get to look at police files that would contradict most of what was reported at the time, raising even more questions.As Vidor plays detective in order to write the screenplay that he hoped would put him back on top, Kirkpatrick lets us see a man who was once a vital part of the film industry, fighting to be remembered. During his investigation he would come into contact with old flame Coleen Moore, a lovely silent star with a fine career of her own. It was a happy coincidence and would force Vidor to make decisions affecting the rest of his life.A Cast of Killers is a fun, fast read tinged with sadness, King Vidor somehow knew it would be. Before beginning, the legendary director likened it to an old bottle of wine. If you love a good mystery, and or Hollywood, this is one you have to read.\\"I realized it was vintage stuff-the rarest vintage of all: a murder that has never been solved. One opens such a bottle at his own peril.\\"King Vidor, 1967"},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"In 1922, director William Desmond Taylor was found shot to death in his home, and two celebrated stars fell under suspicion. The case was never solved, and lingering questions about the crime spelled finish for the careers of the brilliant comic actress Mable Normand and the popular ingenue Mary Miles Minter. But in Hollywood, old sins cast long shadows: the case continued to be investigated off and on over subsequent decades, providing considerable fodder for the tabolid press. In time, it became a legend, and in the the late 1960s director King Vidor--who had been acquainted with most of the individuals involved--began his own investigation in hopes of developing the story into a film.Vidor eventually set his findings aside, and after his death biographer Sidney D. Kirkpatrick uncovered his extensive notes on the Taylor case. The result is A CAST OF KILLERS, a book which purports to solve the case for once and for all. Although he writes with a somewhat superficial tone, Kirkpatrick spins out his story with considerable conviction. What emerges is an extremely distasteful portrait of greed. According to Kirkpatrick, the studios decided to protect themselves even to the extent of implicating innocent parties while the Los Angeles Police Department preferred to extort money from the killer instead of bringing the case to court. But more disturbing than this is the portrait Kirkpatrick paints a profoundly dysfunctional family, the head of which was dominated by a need for money, fame, and absolute control.Ultimately there is no hard proof for Kirkpatrick's conclusions, but--and in spite of several errors that have crept into the work--he makes an extremely convincing case for their validity. While A CAST OF KILLERS is far too popular in content to satisfy students of the crime (described as Taylorologists), it is largely in line with current theory re this famous murder, and it makes for a fascinating read. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"Edited Review: By correcting or qualifying most of the historical errors found in the 1986 edition, this twentieth anniversary edition has greater historical value, while losing none of the entertainment value of the original edition. I would now improve its rating if I could."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"A Cast of Killers is a once-in-a-lifetime read: a nonfiction tale told in the style of the best detective fiction, based on the memoir kept by the \\"private eye\\", moviemaker King Vidor, discovered by would-be Vidor biographer Sidney Kirkpatrick. Vidor didn't make the film he wanted to, based on the facts he uncovered and the conclusions to which they led, because some of the principals in the case were still around, and could have been hurt by the revelations (they also could have sued, forcing him to prove the allegations in the now forever-unmade film in court).But Kirkpatrick wasn't under that kind of threat in 1986, and he told the story in book form much as I think Vidor might have told it on film--except that Vidor would have set the film in the 1920s when it all took place. The book follows Vidor's own investigation, undertaken in the late 1960s, and offers the conclusion he arrived at, not as the final word forever, but as the only possible conclusion given the information he'd uncovered.The murder of prominent film director William Desmond Taylor in 1922 nearly destroyed Hollywood--or, at least, the resulting scandal nearly did. Two prominent stars, Mary Miles Minter and Mabel Normand, did have their already star-crossed careers destroyed by the revelations that came about as a result of the murder. Vidor's investigation gives reason to doubt some of those revelations, if not all of them.What is obvious is that a murder investigation was tampered with, and quite possibly severely, by a number of the principals in the story, with the hoped-for (by the tamperers) result that the truth was never known, the most likely suspect never brought to trial. The way this all happened, as revealed by Kirkpatrick in true detective fiction style, is fascinating reading.Then there is the matter of the movie studios' (specifically Paramount's) desperate need to do \\"damage control\\" after Taylor's murder to keep even bigger scandals from emerging, the kind that would have condemned the movie business for sure in the moral atmosphere of the 1920s, in which such a \\"sin\\" as drinking alcohol was forbidden by law. How and by what means this \\"damage control\\" was accomplished is another fascinating aspect of the story.There have been and will be those who carp at the conclusions King Vidor (and Kirkpatrick) have reached as to the identity of William Desmond Taylor's murderer and said murderer's motive, citing this possible discrepancy and that not-fully-proven assertion. The credo of a great detective of popular fiction asserted: \\"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\\"To accomplish this, you have to be in possession of a great deal of information about the crime, and about everyone even only peripherally involved, as well as the intelligence to sort it all out. Vidor had this uniquely complete perspective, knew many of the people involved, and most importantly knew the Hollywood of the era in which it all happened.I don't think we will ever get a better, or more surprising, or more satisfying take on one of the great unsolved crimes of the early 20th century. I'm personally sold on Vidor's conclusions. I wish he'd made it into the good film he'd have been capable of doing, though his reasons for not doing so are clear and compelling.Most importantly for those who love detective stories, fiction or fact, this is a \\"fireplace and hot chocolate\\" kind of book, guaranteed to provide great recreation and something to think about. I loved it, I've read it through six times, I'll probably read it a few more!"},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"Mr. Kirkpatrick lays out a compelling version of the likely killer of William Desmond Taylor.

I've read other books on the same subject over more recent times but this one is still the most entertaining by far. I agree with another reviewer who said that the description of King Vidor's meeting with Mary Miles Minter who had become a sad recluse by the 1960s was a great piece of writing.I felt that I was actually sitting in that gloomy \\"Norma Desmond Style\\" house with King Vidor as he gazed around at all the photos Mary had of herself. The author paints a fascinating portrait of a once great silent movie star whose life spun out of control.By the end of that part of the book you can't help but to feel extremely sorry for Minter who became a victim of fame .

Sydney Kirkpatrick came to Vidor's home after his death to research a well deserved biography but instead discovered a buried box full of dynamite. In the box were notes for a planned project which was to be the director's comeback film. But the explosive nature of his findings had prompted Vidor to bury it, literally.This book is based on what Kirkpatrick found in that box. It is full of mystery and murder, love and lust, and in the end, sadness at the solving of one of the most famous and sensational scandels in the history of tinsletown. It is a mesmerizing journey into the early days of Hollywood and the lengths it would go to to cover up its secrets.In 1922 the murder of director William Desmond Taylor was so filled with scandel it ruined careers and nearly destroyed Hollywood. If the absolute truth had been known, it might have. King Vidor had been a part of this Hollywood in its formative years and planned to make his comeback film by telling the story of it. Kirkpatrick could have turned this into a pulp type expose but instead, and to his credit, takes a respectful and nostalgic tone, both for Vidor and a time gone by. He uses Vidor's notes and findings to let this murder mystery unfold just as it did for Vidor.For every film buff with a fascination for old Hollywood this is a book you can't put down.

In doing the research for the book after Vidor's death, Kirkpatrick discovers why the film was never made - Vidor actually solved the crime years and years after the police had given up. Since innocent people were still living who could have been hurt by the revalation, Vidor sealed his files and dropped the project.The murder of William Desmond Taylor is filled with intrigue, scandal, and coverup.

As a lifelong movie buff I found the conversations between Vidor and those who had been there and done that absolutely fascinating. And that is the problem. At times it reads like a Chandler novel and I was left wondering how the author constructed the book. Did he take Vidor's papers and take license to put words in the mouths of those interviewed or did he write verbatim from the notes? Other reviewers have noted there are no citations or bibliography and I find this unsettling as well. I would love to see an addition to the book showing examples of Vidor's papers and an explanation by the author as to how he went about putting it together. I, for one, have nodoubt about the conclusions drawn: the lawsuits filed by Shelby, Minter, and especially Minter's sister Margaret,are public record. The next edition should include testimony from those proceedings with proper citationsfor all the author's sources.

Otherwise, one finds himself spending time thumbing through the book looking for a reminder of how a particular character moved the story along.Beyond that, Kirkpatrick takes the reader on a great ride through a believable tale of intrigue, jealousy and murder. I found this book plausible and very readable: it is as much a story of Hollywood from the inside as an investigation of a long ago murder.We may never know for certain who killed William Desmond Taylor but this scenario is as believable as any.Whatsmore, it is a fun read. And that's what matters, right?"},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"Although there have been other and more solid theories out there about the motive and perpetrators of director William Desmond Taylor's murder in 1922, this one has an added level of interest because Kirkpatrick tells the story of a high-level sleuth. King Vidor, well-known director and contemporary of Taylor's, investigated the crime over the course of decades and this book is the result of that inquiry. As I said, the finale is not completely convincing (and may be a bit of a cop-out), but for anyone interested in Hollywood's dark side in the 20s, this is a great read.

Vidor wants to make a film about the Hollywood scandal which turned up no results and left an open case for the police. Along with Colleen Moore, lover and business partner, Vidor researches a case filled with contradictions and cover-ups.This book's print is rather large, and it makes the 300 pages go back rapidly with aid from the intriguing story. It is also highly suspenseful and entertaining. Even if the reader has no idea who William Desmond Taylor, Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter, or King Vidor are, he or she will still most likely enjoy the book.The afterward is outdated by now because the book was published in 1986. All of the Hollywood names mentioned are no longer living, and it is doubtful that any of the others are alive anymore.Even under the assumption that the story is true, one finds it hard to believe because of the format of this book. It reads like a fiction mystery novel or an episode of the popular television show Law and Order. However, this book is hardly credible. The \\"facts\\" in it are said to be from private papers King Vidor had together that were set aside for his film project. These documents consist of transcripts illegally obtained from the police and interviews from witnesses or friends to witnesses that are not deceased. None of these documents are properly cited; there is a lack of a bibliography or an appendix. The only citation states that the information was received from Vidor's son who made his father's notes available to the author. The claims the author makes about this book being the \\"true story of Hollywood's most scandalous murder\\" seem strange considering how much effort Vidor put into attempting to prove his theory. Kirpatrick seems to have made no such effort.Other questions come to mind when regarding the validity of this book. How did Kirpatrick come across the information that Vidor knew who killed Taylor and why were the findings so easily given to him after Vidor decided NOT to publish the information in fear of hurting people? And if the book were published because the author felt that no one alive who remembered or was attributed to the case would be negatively affected, why then did the police department not confirm the accusations in the book as being valid and close the case?This book is controversial, even today. If it were less sloppy, it could have been a major breakthrough in the case of William Desmond Taylor. As it is, A Cast of Killers is a highly entertaining and enjoyable work of fiction. Taken literally, it is only comparable to such trash as Hollywood Babylon."},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","review":"You just saved me the price of this book. Nice work--now I already know who dunnit."},{"Title":"The geography of Lograire (A New Directions book)","review":"Among authors who have shaped my understanding of the world, Thomas Merton is a perennial favorite of mine, especially his poetry like \\"The Geography of Lograire.\\" I was in Provence not long ago, and thought of him as we drove past a Cistercian monastery - the Trappists are the \\"strict order\\" observers of the Rule of Benedict. Merton's decision to become a monk was the act that defined him for his audience, but reading him redefines one's ideas of what a life of contemplation can achieve. So I am once again returning to this marvelous man of letters. Thomas Merton's \\"book of directions\\" points across the breadth of his lifelong pursuit of the signs and scripts that shield and ferment the mysteries and truth(s) which embody god(s). Imagined and arranged as a landscape extending through the time and space of Mayans, Cargo Cultists, Ghost Dancers, Levelers and other millennial testaments old and new, this book of poetry is both \\"found\\" and invented. Merton is a clear eyed mystic, however, as well as the jester to power and a scorn when his dander gets up. His erudition is never showy, and the cryptic seals of the sources will pop open suddenly like a jack-in-the-box, the weighty subjects often as not taking flight in humor and a sheer delight in the human side of the spirit. It is wonderful to think that a life of silence and meditation could result in such a worldly grasp of this \\"geography\\" and it compares favorably with prose territories such as Yoknapatawpha County and Erewhon, although the path through Paterson and Gloucester is more likely to land you in Lograire. Physical and metaphysical circle round and sometimes dissolve in that \\"other\\" which is \\"neither\\" - the Void. The man had such respect for truth, whether unadorned or tarted up, veiled or resplendent, sheathed in stone or loose in the ether. If you have any interest in Merton as a literary figure at all, this book is a must read, a shorthand for all his interests, catholic and parochial, where he traveled and where he hoped to journey. Be forewarned, however, that repeated readings are sometimes the only means of navigating through this rich notional terrain."},{"Title":"Dreams and Nightmares: Terry Gilliam, The Brothers Grimm, & Other Cautionary Tales of Hollywood","review":"The surprising thing to me about this diary of the making of The Brothers Grimm is that my sympathies were not wholly with the nominal director, Terry Gilliam.He is my favorite director and I have felt steadfastly in his corner during his fights over Brazil, Munchausen, and the aborted \\"Quixote\\".But here, it is hard to see him as heroic. Time after time when reading this admirably fair book, I found myself thinking that for all that it was a chaotic production (and Gilliam's certainly not wholly responsible for that)...you know what?He TOOK the JOB. He knew he didn't have a script he liked, and he also knew Miramax/Dimension's reputation. Matt Damon repeats here the story he told to Peter Biskind relating Harvey Weinstein to the scorpion in the tale of the scorpion and the frog, and he seems right.Gilliam and others speak here of his feeling \\"raped\\" by the Weinsteins in the pre-production nightmare, but he is a victim who welcomed a known rapist to his bed.Two voices I wish could have been represented in this diary are original screenwriter Ehren Kruger and female lead Lena Headey.Kruger's voice might have served as a reminder that however much of a mad dreamer Terry Gilliam may be (and he is that, gloriously so, and god bless him for it)...this was not his dream.This was not Brazil, which sprang from the well of his head, and which he made exactly as the script Universal bought...and which they then tried to take away from him. Nor was it Fisher King, which had a script so great he didn't need to \\"fix\\" it, only interpret.Gilliam made the mistake I am convinced is responsible for more mediocre films (which Brothers Grimm definitely is)than any other element: He accepted a script he didn't like in the egotistical belief that he could \\"fix\\" it, just because he wanted to get back on the treadmill again. And he was wrong.Headey was forced upon Gilliam by Weinstein, and evidently had and/or gave something of a hellish time on the production. Periodically we hear of dinner conversations she had with Gilliam that helped her performance (which IMO turned out to be one of the strongest things in the film). I would love to have seen what they said to each other, and her thoughts on the excruciating way (for all concerned) she entered the movie.It seems Gilliam got a strange case of \\"buyer's remorse\\" after taking the job and went, by his own admission, into a kind of catatonia. Believe me, I understand how it can feel for a creator to have his \\"baby\\" taken away from him...but there were other people involved who needed Gilliam to engage them.Damon and virtually everybody else involved with the film tells McCabe their biggest if not their sole reason for wanting to work on the movie was this: The chance to make \\"A Terry Gilliam film.\\" It seems the only person who didn't want to do that is Terry Gilliam."},{"Title":"Dreams and Nightmares: Terry Gilliam, The Brothers Grimm, & Other Cautionary Tales of Hollywood","review":"In the introduction, the author stated that \\"this is not your typical 'making-of' book\\"; the problem was that it should have been.With the exception of the intro and a wrap-up chapter at the end, the book is composed almost entirely of excerpts from interviews and diary entries from several of the main casts and crew members. The problem is that without an editorial hand to summarize and give us a big picture, it all ends up feeling disjointed, with jarring shifts in writing style every few paragraphs or so as the point of view changes. It's easy to lose track of who's narrating and the initials and short-hands used in the diary entries quickly become jumbled together. It feels like there's about half a dozen authors (which in a sense is true) instead of just one.The sad thing is there actually is a good story to be told here, as some of the excesses and stunt pulled by the producers are pretty self-indulgent, but it's hard to really get into it since the narrative is so patchy. It's like someone who gives you all the ingredients necessary for a great meal, but won't cook it for you. The author certain had access to some great materials, but it almost felt lazy that he would just cut and paste the information together instead of presenting it in an interesting way. Compared with similar works such as \\"Losing the Light\\" and \\"Final Cut\\" this book simply falls short. The illustrations within are very nice and the narrative style is different, but it feels like too much style over substance and that's a shame."},{"Title":"Kathy Ireland Total Fitness Workout","review":"I've been using this video exclusively for the last six years.

Today this consciousness is so widespread that no one could become a hero of his stature by trapping jungle animals for profit.But he understood animals and respected them, even displayed toward them the care of a mother for her child. When they were injured or sick, he personally tended them, a risky business. A 600-pound tapir he was treating almost killed him. A python saw him as a meal, and a cobra spewed deadly venom in his eyes. Attacked by another cobra, he threw his coat over the snake and pounced on it. He held it beneath him as it wriggled to get free until aides could get a grip on its head and pull it out, like a bird extracting a worm from the ground. The python that had him in its grip was one of the very few he had to kill. He managed to get one arm free enough to reach his sidearm; then he put three rounds in the giant reptile's brain.From his headquarters at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore, he operated a collecting network that spanned the lush jungles of Malaya, Borneo, Sumatra and India. Over the years, he brought back hundreds of thousands of birds and animals of all kinds for sale to zoos, circuses and private collectors. In 1922, he provided Dallas with an entire zoo of more than 500 specimens. In 1948, he returned to his hometown of Gainesville, Texas, to dedicate the Frank Buck Zoo and the Frank Buck Zoological Society.From Mr. Buck's eight books, Steven Lehrer has selected the \\"best\\" of the material. He has fine sensibilities as an editor. However, the books are so full of good, old-fashioned, movie-serial-type adventures in wild, exotic settings, that Mr. Lehrer could have closed his eyes and picked 19 chapters that would make a good collection. The surprising thing is that, until now, no one else has.What few could have done better, however, is write the illuminating introduction summarizing Mr. Buck's early interest in animals and birds as a boy in Plano and along Turtle Creek, and his brief dalliance with crime, marriage and other enterprises before setting out on his lifelong search for \\"the source of the wind, the mouth of the river, the oceans to which the fish swam, and the far lands to which the birds flew.\\"Free-lance writer and reviewer Tom Dodge lives in Midlothian; his new book is Tom Dodge Talks About Texas."},{"Title":"Bring 'Em Back Alive: The Best of Frank Buck","review":"November 2000, p 554 History of Science &amp; Technology38-1532 QL61 99-86898 CIPBuck, Frank.

Buck was a familiar and heroic figure to many growing up in the 1930s and 1940s; the numerous illustrations recapture those days. The great zoos of the day owed much to him, partly for the specimens he obtained for them but even more for the publicity he generated and shared. His exploits could not and should not be repeated today, but that should not detract from the sense of adventure his stories evoke. His persona was mirrored in the white hunter in King Kong (the Fay Wray version), but his real life adventures were even more thrilling. The comments by Lehrer (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) are interesting and useful, and his choices of episodes from various of Buck's books are well done. All in all, this is an extremely entertaining book, illustrating a different time and written in a way that brings that time to life. General readers. -F W.

These animal stories told by the intrepid Texas animal collector and jungle adventurer enraptured generations of boys. Buck spent his life capturing alive every kind of animal, from birds to snakes to elephants. Because there were no tranquilizer darts in those days, he learned to build traps and snares in ways that prevented injury to the animals he caught. Buck always accompanied his animals on shipboard to America to be sure they were well treated, and refused to sell to anyone who did not have an impeccable reputation for animal care. The creator of the Dallas zoo in the 1920s, Buck was a hero ranking with Lindbergh, Ruth, and Dempsey. The dashing and powerful Buck leapt easily from Simon and Schuster's published pages to the silver screen, portraying himself in Wild Cargo and Fang and Claw.

Bolton. 1902. 258 pages.I found this book in the library catalog and requested it. It took about two weeks to arrive, as they had to dig it out of the storage stacks. The copy the library has is the original first edition from 1902, though it was rebound in 1986. The pages are quite brittle. But there is something very pleasing about an old book; the way it smells, the way the paper feels ....The book in terms of the genre of history is a bit out of time. It predates the social history era of the 1960's and beyond by over half a century, and yet it stacks up very well to the more modern accounts. The prose was period and therefore more inclined to the poetic at times then the drier stuff of modern writing. I appreciated this as it made the tale the author spun weave and dance across the pages and through my thoughts much more then just a simple data download.The books goal is to relate the reader what it was like to serve as a private soldier, a man in the ranks, in the Continental Army of 1775-1783. It does this by relying on a few well chosen primary sources. His sources tend towards individual diaries and letters notably George Washington himself and about ten or so other diarists. He choose, interestingly, a majority of his sources from the diaries of Continental Army Chaplains. This was not done for any religious reason or to grind out an agenda, merely I think because the chaplains tended to be better educated, trained observes of people and the men felt freer to talk with them then their own commanders which puts the chaplain then, as now, in a unique position to observe and comment on soldier motivation and attitudes.He does a very good job of covering the mundane and the grand. Everything from uniforms, weapons, and training to the horror of the medical care and prison ships. He does not merely cover the main Army with Washington either. He makes extensive use of a Chaplain's diary who was assigned to the Sullivan Campaign of 1779.All told this is a very good book in terms of its research and prose. It pre-dates the Marxist influence you find in later books of this type and instead primarily lets the soldiers speak for themselves. The Author does not seem to be trying to push and agenda, and this is like a breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"The Private Soldier Under Washington","review":"This is a short narration and compiled version of many books that I have read on this subject. It is well done and would start as a good opening book for those who are interested in our Country's war."},{"Title":"A Share of Honour (Charnwood Library)","review":"the book was fair, not as i expected, the book just draged on and on,i quit reading half way through."},{"Title":"The Unfolding Tradition: Jewish Law After Sinai","review":"What is halakha (loosely translated as \\"Jewish law\\".) This book systematically discusses questions such as: Where does it come from? Are Jews obligated to obey it? If so, why? What does it mean to be obligated? How does one decide questions of Jewish law?Unfortunately, most Orthodox authors do not study philosophy, and make no attempt to systematically describe their approach of halakha. On the other extreme, Reform authors do not view halakha as authoritative in any way. They have produced no systematic view of Jewish law, and wildly disagree themselves over whether any part of should be normative at all.In contrast, it is Jews affiliated with Conservative, Traditional and Masorti Judaism who have thus produced the most intelligble and systematic writings on this subject. Not only does Rabbi Dorff systematically present his own philosophy in regards to the above questions, but he presents the views of many other Jewish thinkers, both inside Conservative Judaism, as well as Reform and Orthodoxy.Dorff presents a serious philosophical critique of every theory of law discussed: What are the strengths of each position, and what are the weaknesses. No partisan polemicist, he is equally critical of his own theory of law as he is of other people's theories. Why should anyone care about this subject? Rabbi Dorff writes:\\"A theory of law describes how the author understands the nature of human beings and human society, the role of law for people and societies construed in that way, the sources of authority of the law, the ways in which the law can retain authority and yet change over time to remain relevant to current circumstances, and the relationship between law and morality, religion, and custom. The reason why one should care about such matters is because the way you understand such matters has a critical effect on how you understand yourself and your community, the role of law in your life and that of your community, and the ways in which law can and should remain the same or change over time.\\"This book includes readings by Zachariah Frankel, Solomon Schechter, Mordecai Kaplan, Robert Gordis, Jacob Agus, Abraham Joshua Heschel, David M. Gordis, Louis Jacobs, Joel Roth, Neil Gillman, Edward Feld, Alana Suskin, Raymond Scheindlin and Gordon Tucker, as well as theorists on the right and the left of the Conservative movement. The book also compares Jewish and American law, and asks questions about the nature of legal systems, the relationship between law and religion, and the evolution of law."},{"Title":"The Unfolding Tradition: Jewish Law After Sinai","review":"this is a well written compilation of opinions about law and halakhah that spans the conservative movement and beyond."},{"Title":"Management Teams","review":"This extraordinary book was written by Dr. Belbin nearly 20 years ago and remains in a class by itself in providing a useful theory for building and operating effective decision-making teams. Nowhere else will the reader find a set of principles that are so soundly based on direct evaluation of competing teams, explain so much of effective and ineffective team behavior which otherwise confounds explanation, and which is so beautifully and succinctly written.While Belbin's title suggests this book is simply about business management, the content of the book is of much wider applicability. This book is a valuable, perhaps indispensable, source for anyone involved in collaborative endeavors. The book would be useful if it merely answered the question &quot;Why do collaborative (creative, decision-making) teams succeed or fail?&quot; Belbin goes much further than that. He tells us how to proactively build teams that are predisposed to succeed and, equally importantly, how to adopt strategies that will lead to success on the part of teams not so fortunately constructed.I have found this book very useful in building, and teaching the building, of software product development teams, and heartily recommend it for that purpose."},{"Title":"Management Teams","review":"This book is a must for all trainers in the HR arena. It explains the background to Belbins research, it explains the roles in detail and goes on to explain what the roles mean and how to use them to optimise team performance.The language Belbin uses is friendly and easy to read and so the book is ideal material for trainers and students alike.A classic book which should be included on every HR Trainers bookshelf."},{"Title":"Management Teams","review":"This is really the story behind Belbin's Team Roles. The book show how he, through painstaking research for over twenty years, discovered nine different styles of work (which he calls &quot;Team Roles&quot;) that are typical of individuals in teams.His team role theory is fascinating, and has been shown to correspond with Cattell's 16PF and with the Big 5 personality taxonomy (see e.g. John's chapter in Pervin's Hanbook of Personality).His ideas on the problems with &quot;perfect fits&quot; in organizations and how to discover &quot;surprise fits&quot; are very ingenous.Belbin perhaps spends too many words on his discoveries, but they are good words."},{"Title":"Management Teams","review":"R. Meredith Belbin's text, Management Teams: Why the succeed or fail is quite applicable to my studies in small group communication. However, I would not choose to read it again outside of this context. I did not enjoy the writing style or the setup of the book, yet it contained helpful information for the assignment I needed it for. The review on the back cover perfectly describes the intended audience of the text, with a line drawn from PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT that says &quot;It should be read by all who have responsibility and authority for guiding organizations in their selection of management teams.&quot; For the purpose of writing a speech with the intended audience being a startup corporation looking to build new management teams, this text was very useful and informative. Beyond this, I did not learn much that I had not already learned, or could have surmised on my own. Without having the time to read the text from cover to cover in order from beginning to end, it was difficult to follow some of the associations drawn to other material. There were a few concepts that I did not fully understand even after reading the information, and chose to leave these things out of my speech, such as the Apollo Syndrome. Given that this text is probably not meant for use in coursework, or at least not so much in the area of communication, it was quite applicable to the study of team communication. The focus of the text is more geared toward management research, which seems to be common-sensical at times, yet I think needs to be put into print to establish general guidelines for all to follow. Overall, I would probably recommend this text to someone completing the same or similar assignment or to someone looking to get ahead in a management team. This is definitely a very directed reading and intended for a very tailored audience."},{"Title":"All About Power Tools (Ortho's All about)","review":"I am just starting on wood working and needed some practical advice on what tools to buy first and why.

In fact, even a Philosophy Major can get a bit tired of such writings. However, Danto's writing style is clear and fluid with a broad description of the major problems of metaphysics and epistemology. His style is eloquent and literary which is a refreshing change from some of the more commonly encountered tedium. This all-encompassing text is divided into four parts, with each part broken into chapters or sections with articles on a wide range of relevant philosophical topics. Some of them include: The Intelligibility of the World, Totalistic Thought, The Notion of Existence, and Mental Causation. I find myself referring back to this book for its articulate explanations of some of the more esoteric concepts. If you are looking for a somewhat easier to read introduction to the major ideas in Western philosophical thought, this book is a nice first choice."},{"Title":"Connections to the World: The Basic Concepts of Philosophy","review":"Dr. Danto has provided a nicely balanced, well-written overview of the fundamental concepts of Philosophy. This volume offers rich historical context by comparing and contrasting familiar views of both the ancients and contemporary thinkers while incorporating Danto's own perspective. This book is enjoyable to read and accessible to most anyone."},{"Title":"Connections to the World: The Basic Concepts of Philosophy","review":"Connections to the World is an elegantly written, non-technical survey of basic issues in metaphysics and epistemology. The discussion of modern debates is woven into the broader history of philosophy and culture, giving the book a scope and appeal that extends beyond standard classroom philosophy. If the narrative doesn't hold the reader's interest at all points, or if it seems like \\"much ado about nothing,\\" it's the fault of philosophy, not the author. However, the reader should be warned that the book is too advanced for most high school students or college freshmen. The ideal reader is someone who has already taken a few philosophy courses and is now interested in stepping back to get a \\"big picture\\" view of the discipline. Beginners would be better off with a book like Thomas Nagel's excellent (five stars!)

I'm looking forward to reading more of Danto's books."},{"Title":"Coresponsibility in the church","review":"The following is the information from the dustjacket on the 1968 hardcover edition: \\"The articulation of collegiality was surely the most significant internal development of the Second Vatican Council. In making this principle explicit the Council Fathers registered formally the Church's rediscovery of the people of God as a whole and its rejection of a Catholicism which would give credence to only a single, defined channel of authority. In CORESPONSIBILITY IN THE CHURCH Leon-Joseph Cardinal Suenens spells out in detail precisely what this newly affirmed collegiality and its corollary, universal responsibility, mean to each member of the Church.He sees coresponsibility of all Christians as the dominanting pastoral theme of the Council, and as the fact which will define pastoral activity of the future- at the cost of it being otherwise 'neither pastoral nor successful.' In separate sections of the book he explores the meaning of this conscious coresponsibility for each of the major grouups in the Church: the laity, the religious, the deacons, the theologians, the priests, and the bishops. The picture he draws is explicit and renovating, insistent on the fact that all the charismatic wealth of the people of God must be pressed into Christian service.Cardinal Suenens, one of the most articulate, truly pastoral, and visionary bishops in the Church, writes in a Johannine language and spirit appealing to all men. His combination of theological ability, ecclesial experience, and personal, rich understanding of the needs and desires of the modern world, both Christian and non-Christian, makes CORESPONSIBILITY IN THE CHURCH at once a throughly practical and a deeply phrophetic book.\\""},{"Title":"Jitterbug Jam (New York Times Best Illustrated Books (Awards))","review":"Alexis Deacon's distinctive artwork offers an impressive visual context for Jitterbug Jam, Barbara Jean Hicks' original story about Bobo, a young monster who is afraid of what is under his bed at night.

It has some hugely original touches - the grandfather monster, the jitterbug jam, and the scary ginger haired boy under the bed (who is making bobo scared). The story is less interesting than the illustrations though. It is fun, original, but it doesn't seem to flow as easily as other children's books, relying on some good ideas to take it through rahter than smoothly flowing text.As I said, the illustrations are just so amazing. The characters are appealing, and the way emotion is conveyed is really great. How the head is held, the carriage of the body, the hugging. There are a huge array of presentations too - full page pictures, sometimes small figures on a ribbon.My children are fascinated by it. It is simply a wonderful book and I will be looking out for more of the same. It desrves to be a classic"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Jam (New York Times Best Illustrated Books (Awards))","review":"Here's what I love about children's books. Any author can take a worn overdone concept and make a book out of it. If the author is good, however, the worn overdone concept becomes storytime gold. Adult books, for all their charms, haven't the advantages that children's picture books have in this respect. Now when I first heard the concept of \\"Jitterbug Jam\\" I was unimpressed. Seemed to me we'd seen it all before. Monster under bed, kid scared, monster scared, they meet, and all ends up ducky by the title's finale. Ho hum. Adding to my ignorance was author Barbara Jean Hicks. It appears that prior to this book she was best known for her Christian romance novels. I kid you not. Such written works may have their following, but they rarely cross over into kiddie lit very smoothly. Illustrator Alexis Deacon was slightly more familiar, if only because he created that odd little bugger, \\"Beegu\\", not so long ago. Then I took a deeper read of \\"Jitterbug Jam\\" and all half-hearted whimpers about familiarity went skittering out the door. Cute without pandering and treading a delicate line between the precious and the preachy, the book ends up being a highly intelligent cry from a little monster that all children will be able to identify with.Bobo the jammy-wearing monster and hero of our tale is not going to bed tonight. No sir, nuh-uh, not gonna do it. Why? Because it is crystal clear to Bobo that there is a boy under his bed. A particularly scary boy at that with, \\"pink skin and orange fur on his head where his horns by right should be\\". Fortunately his one-monster protest is interrupted by the presence of his beloved grandfather, Boo-Dad. When Bobo tells Boo-Dad his fear, his grandpa tells him a story of when HE was a little monster and encountered a real live girl of his own. And what did Boo-Dad do in the face of such a threat? Why he ran away, of course. To Bobo, though, Boo-Dad tells him the number one way to deal with a boy. You just look \`im in the eye, grin, and say, \\"Hey, Boy! I'm Bobo! You new round here?\\". Bob follows his grandpa's advice but rather than scaring the boy he finds that the kid is hiding under the bed cause he's playing hide and seek with his brother. Bobo's brother never plays with HIM, so he is naturally envious of his new acquaintance. But when the monster thinks about it, it seems clear enough to him that in this boy he might find a playmate of his own. So the next time that boy comes around Bobo is, \\"going to slide a slice of bread and jitterbug jam down under my bed...and see what happens\\".Barbara Jean Hicks adopts a comfortable down-home vernacular when she relates Bobo's thoughts and feelings. When she says that, \\"everyone's swiggin' hot bug juice and scarfin' big old monster slabs of homemade bread with jitterbug jam like they been starved since half past June\\", you feel so doggone comfortable taking in Hicks' words that you may be inclined to read them over and over and over out loud. Though the prose itself is lovely, it's what the story is trying to say that really comes across. This is an extraordinarily subtle book about accepting someone who is different. Unlike some books that shall remain nameless (you know who you are!!!) it doesn't bash you over the head with the message or shout in your ear that you should love thy neighbor yadda yadda yadda. The book never makes a big point about it, but it is clear that Bobo's beloved Boo-Dad and mother don't understand humans in the least. They may even harbor a few prejudices about them. Young Bobo, on the other hand, finds the boy to be a surprisingly familiar guest as, \\"he has a brother and plays Hide \`n' Seek and says \`please' and \`thank you' just like Mama taught me\\". So it is the youngest person in our story who has the guts and the wherewithal to look beyond the boy's frightening orange head fur to see someone remarkably like himself.A first glance at this title may remind the reader of the picture books, \\"No Such Thing\\" by Jackie French Koller and \\"Papa!\\" by Philippe Corentin. In both cases a monster is just as afraid of a boy as that boy is of that monster. Why is it always boys, by the way? Are girls not supposed to be afraid of monsters? Are the children's authors of the world under the impression that while girls go to bed every night fearless of the critters lurking in the dark, boys are essentially beddy-bye cowards? But I digress... The point is that the plot of \\"Jitterbug Jam\\" isn't original. Not a jot. The writing and illustrations though? Completely one hundred percent new and sparkling. And the book couldn't be any cooler.Let's consider the illustrations on their own, by the way. Alexis Deacon outdoes himself with this work, fully earning the praise garnered from London's \\"Sunday Telegraph\\" that proclaimed that his pictures, \\"carry distant reminders of some of the best illustrators of the last 100 years and yet still remain uniquely his own\\". This is not only true but it is so doggone correct that I am deeply depressed that I didn't say it first myself. Growl. In this particular outing Deacon deserves as much praise as Hicks. Some picture books are good because they rely so heavily on an illustrator's pictures (as with Ana Juan's books) or because they are worded in a particularly clever way (as in Kevin Henkes'). \\"Jitterbug Jam\\" offers equal amounts of brilliance on either ends of the spectrum. In Deacon's case, his pictures do beautiful things with light, fabric, and small easy-to-miss details. He's also not afraid to decorate a fancy border when the mood strikes. When Boo-Dad tells the story of meeting a little girl when he was young, the story is suddenly embroidered with illustrations worthy of Beatrix Potter herself. The borders are sometimes black and white sketches of creepy-crawly animals, sometimes plain black backgrounds on which four separate panels can pop out at the reader (not literally, of course), and sometimes are lush green leafy images of scary (to monsters) sunlit gardens. The first two pages of this tale within a tale also are awash in a creamy yellow light that makes it perfectly clear that the story takes place in the middle of the day. Finally, consider the sheer detail Deacon is capable of. Did you notice that the tip of Bobo's tail ends in a mace? Or that the boy forgets one of his shoes and Bobo meditates on it while curled comfortably up in his mother's lap? How about the eyeballs and bugs on his mother's dress? Did you notice that? A person could stare and stare at this book until their eyes blurred out of focus and still not catch all that there is to see. Amazing.It's funny to consider why it is that America got \\"Jitterbug Jam\\" secondhand. You see the book was originally published in Great Britain in 2004. Why is this, you might ask? Well, according to Ms. Barbara Jean Hicks' website, the book was turned down by twenty American publishers before Hutchinson Children's Books in London took at chance on it. In 2005, the United States got a taste of it as well via the now certainly humbled Farrar, Straus and Giroux. What is clear is that we're lucky to have gotten it this book in ANY form at all (no thanks to you, you silly American publishers).These days the whole monster-below-your-mattress genre has pretty much been devoured by Disney in, \\"Monster's, Inc\\". This may not be a bad thing, however. Kids who adore the film may easily be tempted into monster-related literature, and \\"Jitterbug Jam\\" is nothing if not an eye-catching, eye-popping delight. Not too spooky for the little ones and heads and tails better than the aforementioned \\"Papa\\" and \\"No Such Thing\\", this is bound to be a book beloved of children everywhere for years to come. A wonderful discovery of both author and artist. Consider pairing it with Mo Willems', \\"Leonardo, the Terrible Monster\\", for a truly benign monster storytime."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Jam (New York Times Best Illustrated Books (Awards))","review":"We were already big fans of Alexis Deacon's, thanks to \\"Slow Loris\\". But we were really impressed with the complexity of the illustrations in this book - they're gorgeous (always important if you've got a preschooler or two).As for the story - what a great way to introduce kids to the idea that differences don't have to be a basis for fear. My elementary-schooler was blown away by the thought that a kid monster might find a kid human scary - and then she grasped really quickly that having the kid experience in common outweighed any other differences between the protagonist and the scary creature lurking in his room."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Jam (New York Times Best Illustrated Books (Awards))","review":"A sweet little bedtime story for children and parents alike.

Although I will read romance, too many times authors ruin a good historically based story with clumsily written dialogue or unrealistic character development in their attempt to include romance. This story is gritty, very accurate in its detail and just a plain well-told story with a touch of romance that enhances rather than dominates the story. I haven't cried in a long time while reading a book and this one made me cry. The character development is wonderful, the narrative gripping and the reader gets a very real sense of what it must have been like to be one of the first families on the prairie as our great United States frontier was first settled. The Christian themes are well written, appropriate and appreciated. I couldn't wait to purchase the second book in the series and look forward to reading much more from this author. I have seen Lauraine Snelling for years as an author but never picked up one of her books. I'm so glad I chose this one as my first."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"Actually, I had previously read this book and enjoyed it very much, so much in fact that I ordered it from Amazon as a gift for someone else. It is well written, interesting and the theme especially appealed to me. It is about learning to depend upon God no matter what you are going through.Ingeborg Bjorkland comes to America from Norway as a new bride in the 1800's. She, her husband, and her in-laws settle in the Dakotas where they are homestead farmers. Many trials and joys occur during the first few years of their new life here. The arrival of children, blizzards,illness, family conflicts and Ingeborg's tendency to be headstrong are all useful in her learning that God is in control.This book is not preachy or judgemental, but there are lessons to be learned. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I enjoy historical, Christian reading and found this series very enjoyable. Though some may think it slow or boring in parts, it really describes the believable life of the settlers on a daily basis. By today's standards they would seem boring, but Ms. Snellings careful descriptions of life in that setting was intriging to me and kept my interest.I like the way she grew the territory with different characters and wove their lives into existing families. No extremes such as over-done sex scenes or violence to haunt me. Just realistic life-scenerios for the era.I look forward to reading more of Ms. Snelling's work."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)(Paperback)I own all (so far) of the books from this series for a couple of years now. I am re-reading them, as they are such a joy to read! If you like historical Christian fiction, you will love this book, and all the ones to follow. Do not delay in buying it! At this point, there are 14 more books to follow (these books start with the Grandparents in Norway and go all the way to the Grandchildren who are not even born yet in this book). The family starts out in Norway, and immigrates to New York's Castle Garden. There are very happy moments, and also horrible moments as you continue to read. As Ingeborg and Kaaren depend on the Lord God, they get through the times in their lives that forge them together. You'll learn they are much more than sisters-in-law. The times are trying and difficult at times. You will not want to put this book down, believe me. And at the end - you'll be ready to read the 2nd book in this series (of 14 right now) as well.

The story itself was wandering and unfocused although it showed how hard life was for the homesteaders. The characters were pretty much one-dimensional but Ingeborg and Kaaren were likable and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. It almost felt like the Mitford series and would be worth trying for readers who liked those stories. The limp, unbelievable ending was a serious drawback. Snelling rushed through several significant events in the epilogue and Ingeborg's change of heart did not ring true. I enjoyed the first 3/4 enough that I'll probably try the next book in the series, but I did not leave satisfied."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I loved reading of how people from other countries came to America.

I call them \\"Little House on the Prairie for adults\\" but totally suitable for children, as well. Very Christian based and inspirational. Hard to believe the hardships the early immigrants went through - even though fiction, I'm sure it's not very far from the facts.

You should too!"},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"In 1999 I bought this book for my Norwegian mother who later passed it on to my Asian wife. They both loved the book. I have continued to buy later books in the Snelling's Norwegian immigrant series as gifts to this day (April 2010) which now comprises sixteen books, plus four ancillary works in the same genre (the Dakotah Treasures series). I started reading An Untamed Land myself in 2008 and I am now starting on my eleventh \\"Bjorklund\\" book.Reviwers would categorize these books as Christian chick lit, so what is a man doing reading them? It started with curiosity because of the Norwegian connection, in addition to my interest in European 19th century immigration to North America. In this world of much pessimism, violence, cynicism, family disconnection, Hollywood hype and disbelief in the Divine I thought it might be worthwhile to spend some time with positive, character-building, and inspirational, family oriented literature. Lauraine Snelling knows how to write books infused with elevated human values and the emotions that accompany doubts, trials, depression and tragedies as well as joys and celebrations.I must say that I was quite disappointed by this first books lack of genealogical research and historical integrity. I can't understand how Snelling could venture into this project without getting information verified by Norwegians. Since I found myself editorializing as I was reading this spoiled some of my reading pleasure and it became a sufficient irritation for me so I began to mark the book whenever I met with these distractions. Here are some examples (apply also to the second volume, A New Day Rising):The worst errors concern personal names, first names as well as last, many of which are improvised and inauthentic. For a starter, the Bjorklund (Bjrklund, Swedish Bj&ouml;rklund) name has historically been ten times more prevalent in Sweden than in Norway. In the same vain, surnames which Snelling consistently ends in the patronymic \\"son\\" (e.g. Knutson, Johnson, Olsson, Hanson, Thorlakson, Hjelmson, Sjornson, Peterson) are thus marked by their Swedish origins. Norwegian patronyms end in \\"sen.\\" Quite a number of names in the books have quaint spellings incompatible with Norwegian lore. One might wonder why the author didn't use a Minnesota or Dakota's telephone book to choose common traditional names. The spelling of Carl, rather than Karl, is also commonly Swedish. The spelling of Kaaren, with two a's, is nonexistent in Norway; Karen is correct. Thorliff may be Icelandic but is definitely not Norwegian. The correct form would be Torleif or Thorleif. Thorly would not be his nickname but Tor/Thor or Leif. To be authentic Gunhilde should be Gunhild. Bridget was not a 19th century Norwegian name; Birgit would be. Andrew is not a name new Norwegian immigrants would name their son; Anders or Andreas would be. Haakan should be Haakon or Hakon. Hjelmer is a nonexistent name; should be Hjalmar. Hamre is nonexistent. Soren is named as the wife of Johann Bjorklund but it (Sren) has always been a man's name, never a woman's! Katja was not a 19th century Norwegian girl's name, but German or Russian; Kaja would be Norwegian. In reference to the city of Oslo it was called Christiania up until its name changed in 1925.As far as \\"norsk\\" is concerned, why did Snelling not take the time to ask a Norwegian and get it right? \\"E Jesu naven gor vi til brod,\\" should be \\"I Jesu navn gaar vi til bords.\\" \\"Takk fer matten (meaning the mat!),\\" should be \\"takk for maten (the meal).\\" \\"Hu tu me tu!\\" should be \\"hutte meg tu!\\" \\"Mor's den lille gutten,\\" is insensible; it should be \\"mors lille gutt.\\" The expression \\"uff da\\"--popularized in America--is way overused. Normally it is correctly uttered light-heartedly. It wrongly trivializes a situation when used in a serious context. \\"Mange takk,\\" is also overused. \\"Takk,\\" or \\"takk, takk,\\" or \\"takk for det,\\" or \\"takk skal du ha,\\" are other variants which could have been used in between. From the start, Ingeborg frequently refers to Thorliff as \\"den lille,\\" which means \\"that little one,\\" which lacks gender. In most cases, in his presence, it should be \\"du lille,\\" meaning \\"you, little one.\\" When Carl goes shopping in New York City, he asks for \\"egg\\" and \\"melk\\" and amazingly is NOT understood when the English of these words is pronounced similarly! In all the Bjorklund books the German and Norwegian languages are presented as conversationally easy for speakers of either language to be understood by each other. This is a complete fallacy.In this book we are told that the Bjorklund clan hails from Valdres which is a mountainous landlocked inland valley in southern Norway. But the menfolk are fishermen and refer to working on fishing boats, which can not be related to Valdres. In the second book, inexplicably, the Bjorklunds' origin shifts to Nordland in northern coastal Norway, which then does fit in with the reference to ocean fishing.Ingeborg goes bird hunting with the same rifle used for deer. The birds would have exploded! She should have used a shotgun. The native half breed who befriends them they call Metis but in subsequent books the spelling changes to Metiz. Burning deciduous trees does not produce pitch; conifers do. Deciduous trees have sap. Unlike what the author states evergreen trees were not uncommon in the Dakotas before land was cleared extensively. The Bjorklunds' first sod house is only twelve by fourteen feet, which was common, but as the story progresses it would have been impossibly small for all the people, furnishings and activities described. Incredibly it states three men could build the sod house in one day, including the roof and finish raising the walls for the barn the next day! Oh, and contrary to what is stated numerous times, ducks do not fly in a V-formation and mosquitoes do not buzz around in the late fall. And, chairs can not be \\"pushed back\\" on a dirt floor. They must be lifted. These are some of the more obvious errors.Fortunately most readers of this book will not be distracted as I was by any of the above. Now having completed my tenth book I can say that occasions to become irritated diminish greatly with each subsequent book. I give Snelling credit for keeping readers' attention from beginning to end. They can easily feel involved with the characters' personal relationships and the drama of their experiences. There are hardships and tragedies but also happiness, comfort and joy. Each book introduces more children and unique characters, having personalities we probably recognize from our own life journey. There is no lack of tension and conflict but love and co-operation usually win the day. I recommend this first book but perhaps more for its necessary groundwork, establishing the Bjorklunds in Dakota Territory, than for what it has to offer on its own."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I read this book almost two years ago, but I still remember how much it captured my attention. I think what made the book so interesting is the fact that it didn't create a phony atmosphere. Everything was so real and their problems were so crushing that I think I better understood what a hard life many immigrants went through. I appretiate the spiritual side of the book too. I think it's a great witness when writers use Jesus Christ as a key player in their character's lives. I have also read the next two books in the series and am looking forward to the third.

Excellent character development helped me to really come to know the main characters,and she really made me appreciate and admire the fortitude of the emigrants/immigrants that they were determined to make a successful life in this country after a horrendous ocean voyage,and suffering exploitation at every train stop on their journey from New york to the Red River Valley of North Dakota. for every item the travelers might need.After living 3yrs. in Minot,ND ('65-'68) when my air force dad was stationed there,and hating it more than any other place we ever lived,I am amazed that any human being ever chose to stay there! At least our home had central heat and we had neighbors and modern conveniences.

With relatives in the Red River of the North country in North Dakota near Snelling's fictional community, I have travelled in this area many times and have listened to many stories of the old days and its emergence into the rich agricultural region it is today. It is a worthwhile experience to recall some of the travails of those who settled and developed the land at any time and especially when one is driving through the region on good highways in modern vehicles with heaters in the cold months and air-conditioning in the summer and with timely weather forecasts to help ensure our safety.Not having read much in the genre of Christian fiction, one of my first impressions from this book was the importance of religious concern by many of the characters. In time I decided that this too was probably good as it helped balance the view we have generally synthesized from the writings of secular authors. It also meshed well with those stories I have heard from oldtimers who lived during some of these formative years and shared their memories and those of their parents and grandparents. I believe that enhancing our perspective is a valuable part of life.Enjoy the book and the sequels.

Early on he opposed Lenin's conception of the hierarchal, tightly centralized working class party and was very active in the Petersburg Soviet of 1905. Lenin accepted Trotsky's view of &quot;permenant revolution&quot; after the February 1917 revolution and Trotsky joined forces with him to oppose the liberals and leftists in the workers and soldiers soviet who supported handing over power to the liberal bourgeoisie, in the case of the leftists apparently because they thought the bourgeoisie should have their revolution first. The Bolsheviks won overwhelming majorities in the soviets accros the nation. They seized power from the liberals and then proceeded to liquidate their opposition which seemed to be excused by Trotsky on the ground of centralising power in order to fight the Whites and the imperialist invaders and the especially brutal &quot;war communism&quot; was instituted. Trotsky directed the violent repression of the workers and sailors at Kronstadt in 1921. He pretty much played the good solider, occasionally making noises about the suppression of democratic debate and the growing power of the bueracracy until Stalin consolidated his power after Lenin's death in 1924. He unwaveringly opposed Stalin who finally expelled him from the country in 1929. He was murdered under Stalin's orders in Mexico in 1940.Trotsky once in exile gave full flower to his best thinking. The bueracracy in the Soviet Union owned everything (the means of production,etc.) and would not give up power but perpetuate itself as dictatorships tend to do. Trotsky advocated destroying the bueracracy, reinstitue free debate and, according to Mr. Ali, wanted to &quot;restore the Soviets.&quot; What this last means, I don't quite know. Does it mean he wanted to restore to them the power they held in 1917-18, as they were conceived to function during the revolution of 1905, perhaps even as the narodniks conceived them? Very interesting. Ali also points out that Trotsky saw clearly the menace of Hitlerism before just about everybody else did and advocated that the communists and social democrats join forces in a &quot;united front&quot; to try to stop Hitler which earned him even more violent abuse from Moscow and their sattelites in Germany. He vigorously attacked the &quot;United Front&quot; concept adopted at the seventh congress of the communist international in 1935 which called for Communists accross the world to join forces with social democrats and liberals in &quot;popular fronts,&quot; effectively maintainging the status quo, which had such disasterous results in Spain during the civil war.I thought Phil Evans's illustrations were entertaining."},{"Title":"TROTSKY FOR BEGINNERS","review":"An excellent introduction to some very complex and confusing history. This biography of Leon Trotsky, also explores some very complex marxist theory. Historically, it covers not only Trotsky's life and idea's, but the Russian Revolution, the Russian civil war, and the usurpation of power of the fledgling workers democracy by Joseph Stalin and his co-conspiritors from the democratically elected politburo. This book is much more entertaining then the new &quot;For Begginers&quot; series, as it has much more artistic diversity, then the mostly cartoon, drawing style of the new books. It contains colages, and many photos of historical figures and events. Overall a great introduction to history, that is not taught in school."},{"Title":"TROTSKY FOR BEGINNERS","review":"My favorite page of this book is page 84, which has some small print at the bottom of the page, &quot;Lenin sees Trotsky's position as attractive but too risky.&quot; The illustration shows a three-way argument among the leaders of the Bolshevik Central Committee on how to get an immediate armistice with Germany in World War One, for which Trotsky had been sent to Brest-Litovsk to negotiate peace at the end of November 1917. Somehow, page 82 reported, &quot;The Allied Powers are desperately against Russia signing a separate peace with Germany.&quot; Trotsky's position in the argument on page 84 nicely avoided the possibility of conflict with the Allied Powers, &quot;Prolong the negotiations. No war - No Peace - till the German workers revolt!&quot; According to page 83, &quot;The peace delegation at Brest-Litovsk distributed pamphlets to the German soldiers.&quot; The cartoon shows a soldier looking at a page and exclaiming, &quot;It says - shoot your officers!!&quot; The Germans might not have been used to reading that kind of thing, but there is a historical Who's Who on pages 168 to 173 which shows how much support there was for this when someone's idea of justice supported it. The Who's Who contains anarchist activists like Vera Zasulich, a Narodnik militant who &quot;Shot and wounded the Governor of St. Petersburg, General Tepov&quot; [which might not be spelled correctly] because a Narodnik student &quot;was flogged for failing to remove his hat in Trepov's presence. Her trial and acquittal by the jury caused a sensation and was popularly supported.&quot; (p. 173). Back on page 76, following a cartoon that looks a lot like some famous painting of the last supper, there is even a picture of Joseph Stalin, who praised Trotsky in Pravda for the &quot;practical organisation of the insurrection&quot; (The October Revolution) only 84 years ago in November 1917, but the picture is saying, &quot;I said that? No - you must be thinking of some other Stalin!&quot; The humor of history is perfect for a cartoon book like this, which is history at a level which everybody ought to be able to understand. Unfortunately for the Soviets, they were probably not aware of the work of the young Karl Kraus in Vienna during this period, who observed, &quot;Satires which the censor understands are rightly prohibited.&quot; This book is too true to be considered satire in a thoroughly comic society like our own."},{"Title":"TROTSKY FOR BEGINNERS","review":"This book is a great starting point for Trotsky and at the same time a friendly introduction to the often confusing political situation in Russia during the period of the Alexander II's death and the Bolshevik revolution until Stalin. It integrates primary sources from contemporaries, including Bolsheviks and Trotsky himself, and some secondary source from historians that are particularly informative.The book weaves through humorous and brief summaries of some stages of Trotsky's life (particularly his early life and conversion to Marxism) yet this is redeemed by its concise and very useful segments on complex issues such as Marxist ideology, the role of the Comintern, the various congresses of the Soviets/Communist party and united frontism. I found that the illustrations were actually quite useful and not simply humorous in many cases, such as the 'hear no evil, etc.' monkeys in the section on the power struggle.However, it is after all a beginner's guide and the sections on Trotsky's role in the 1917 insurrection was lacking, as well as the Civil War. Nevertheless, I still recommend this book to high school students studying Trotsky and general Soviet history as an introductory text, and Trotsky enthusiasts regardless of their level of education as both an informative text and ultimately an entertaining read."},{"Title":"TROTSKY FOR BEGINNERS","review":"One of the best books to detail the rise of communism and the reason it is doomed to failure every time it is implemented.

The scales used are very generous, usually 1:25,000,000 or less. Topography is shaded to give some indication of the terrain, and the selection and use of color is very tastefully done.

The book speaks about what it means to be an authentic human being through a parable about a special kitten who must find his way in the world on his own and triumphs over loss, disappointment, and exploitation to find self-realization. \\"'Sing your own song,' said the River, 'sing well.'\\" It is never too late to sing your own song, if your heart will let you. How the cat learned to do this is worth learning at any age. Now this is how I interpret what goes on in the story in today's vocabulary, not how the author puts it, but my point is the book is just as relevant today as when originally written. The experiences of this cat will hit home with all too many people today, both children and adults. The book is beautifully written by Catherine Coblentz, a lady who by the way spearheaded the establishment of the Cleveland Park branch of the D.C. Library, where there are etched glass drawings from the book. If kids today would buy in to a book like this and Wordsworth's Happy Warrior, they would have a better chance of growing up whole."},{"Title":"The Blue Cat of Castle Town","review":"I read this book in 4th grade. The reading level is about 5-7th grade, not for babies or toddlers. The plot of the book is based on a number of items in the Metropolitan Museum of Art which all hale from a town in Vermont called Castleton. One of them is hand-woven carpet with a blue cat depicted on it. Another is a pewter teapot. Around these artifacts and the small amounts of information that could be gleaned on their history, the author has built a charming tale of a blue kitten in search of a home. Since he was born under a blue moon, the kitten can only find a home and a hearth in the house of a human who knows (or can be taught) the River's Song. The River's Song is the Song of Creation, of the making of beautiful things. The kitten encounters many inhabitants of Castletown in his quest and finds them falling under the dark spell of Arunah Hyde, whose whole interest is speed and wealth. The kitten himself nearly falls under the same spell, but escapes at the last minute. His quest seems doomed to fail, however, until he crosses the path of a lonely, ugly girl. This is a book that does not deserve to be out of print. It could easily be used in the classroom as a lesson in early American culture and history, but is also a just a very enjoyable and moving read."},{"Title":"The Blue Cat of Castle Town","review":"I read this book when I was eight and it was one of my favorites--something magical and yet so real about this blue cat and its quest. Yet it was The River's Song that was the most compelling part of the book for me...the need to find one's own song, to create beauty in one's life and work, not directly to seek riches and power. I would credit it as one of the influences in my choosing writing children's books as a career. Over 60 published books later, I am stilll happily trying to sing my own song.

It has a mature message about the importance of beauty in art, rather than creating art for money alone. It is based on historical information which gives additional interest."},{"Title":"The Blue Cat of Castle Town","review":"Set in a kinder, gentler Vermont this quiet charmer by Coblentz permits readers to relax and savor the humble pleasures of a sleepy village through which a river meanders--a town where craftsmen take true pride in the creation of works of beauty. But then rich resident Arunah Hyde decides to make Castleton the center of the universe, with his fast coaches and dreams of even faster trains. Speed is all that matters as he insidiously weaves his Dark Spell--demanding faster work and shoddy standards, for he is obsessed with Time and cares naught for things of lasting beauty.Inspired by a visit to a NY Art Museum the author was impressed by a tapestry which included a blue cat in one of the hand-woven squares. While accompanying her husband on an extended business trip to Castleton, she decided to research the local folklore surrounding a blue cat, whose almost invisible trail included works of handcraft admired to this day. A church pulpit and a hand woven linen table cloth are among its treasures.A blue kitten is born in a fragrant field by the river, and to his mother's dismay, and against her strict warning, begins to listen to its song--unable to resist; yes, destined to learn its song. No normal life will this kitten with only three black hairs on its tail live out, for he must teach the river's song to one mortal before he may find his home and hearth. Not an easy task when Arunah Hyde is spreading the dark spell throughout the town; besides, who will listen to the plaintive mewing of an orphan cat? Will the trusting Blue Cat be able to resist the clever trap set by Arunah--who has evil designs on him?You too can seek and enjoy the Bright Enchantment of this storybook village, if you visit this charming town in September. Then the locals reenact the tale on a delightful Blue Cat Tour, by a uniformed guide, during which the story comes alive for readers and all cat lovers. This has remained one of my favorite childhood books for many decades and may secretly have whispered to me that I should move to Vermont some day."},{"Title":"Russian Spacesuits (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"This is an excellent book with details not before shown outside the formerly closed confines of the old Soviet space program, except in various technical society papers. It has many excellent b&amp;w photos and diagrams of Russian spacesuits from the SK-1, used for Vostok, up to the most modern Russian investigations of Mars EVA suits. The text is somewhat general in content though well written. It is also done in the typical style of Russian/English transliteration. Readers in the West, if they have not previously read any Russian technical papers, may find the transliteration hard to follow at times; but, this does not detract from the value of Mr. Ibramov's good work. If I had any complaint about the book it would be two items. First, the book lacks some technical detail in specific areas, so it sometimes creates more questions than it answers. If I did not already have a background in pressure suits some explanations would have confused me. The inclusion of a few explanatory drawings could have avoided this. Second, while the book gives credit, for the first time, as to which designers at Zvzeda created various general concepts, it does not often shed light on specific contributions, or the dynamimics involved in individual contributions. Nevertheless,I recomend this book. It is a MUST for your library. If the reader wants a technical look at Russian spacesuits I recommend &quot;Pressure Suits and Systems For Work In The Open Cosmos&quot; by Abramov, Severin, Stoklitsky and Sharipov. It is, however, a nearly impossible to find textbook."},{"Title":"Russian Spacesuits (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"In Russia, the need for suits to be worn in the upper atmosphere, developed in the 1930:ies, engendered the suits to be used in spacecrafts, outside spacecrafts and on the Moon. Naturally, the use of a protective garment inside the space cabin was the first usage, Juri Gagarin wore such a garment on his historic flight. Even today the protective garment is the iconic spacesuit, which we see Cosmonaut wearing as their uniforms for the trip off the Earth. Suits for extravehicular activities, EVA, are quite different. The Soviet Union, of course, never made it to the lunar surface, but had a cosmonaut, probably Alexei Leonov, made a landing, he would have been dressed for the occasion. After all, the first Space Walk ever was also a first testing of a garment to be worn on the Moon, by the man who was supposed to wear it!The space suit technology, as developed in the Soviet Union, was even applicable to our canine friends, some of which did ballistic flights into space dressed more or less like the dog Milou in Herg&eacute;s \\"Tin-Tin on the Moon\\". Thus we know where to turn if we want to walk our dogs on the Moon.When Westerners started to fly in space alongside the Soviets, later Russians, in Saljut, Mir and International Space Station, it was as had inhabitants from different planets met. Now we may appreciate all those differences in technical culture as exemplified in the space suits of the Cosmonauts. There is, of course all the common ground resulting from like problems demanding like solutions, but overlying we see these subtle differences arising from different technical and engineering usages of two different cultures.The book is co-authored by some of the actual developers of space suits in the then Soviet Union, later Russia, and thus as authoritative on the subject as can be. Fascinatingly, also, the historical developments inside the Soviet Union/Russia and internationally, reflect in much that the space suit developers had to contend with.The scope of common activities betveen the Russians and the West European ESA was news to this rewiewer. We also note, that the Chinese \\"taikonauts\\" wear protective suits designed by the nowadays \\"Zvezda Development and Production Company\\". We also read of the challenge of rendering original technical texts in Russian into readable English, and concomitant difficulties inherent in the fact that, not only is translation of language required, but even the transliteration from one system of letters, i.e. Cyrillic, into our Roman alphabet poses its own problems and pitfalls. On the whole, the endeavour has been crowned with success. The system of measurements are, thankfully, the same on both sides of this barrier of language and glyphs.All in all fascinating facts from a space program now slowly opening itself to inquisitive Western eyes. Great hopes for the future is embodied in the prospects of joint developments of the advanced spacesuits for space station EVA and the lunar and martian surfaces."},{"Title":"Russian Spacesuits (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"Spacesuits should be of renewed interest with the upcoming private space tourist ventures.I bought this book after I had the opportunity to examine, hands-on, a Russian SOKOL rescue suit. What struck me was the sheer simplicity of the design and I wanted to know more about this suit.This book provides much of that background, plus that of the famous Orlan EVA suits and others in the history of the Russian space program.Compared to the related books onUS Spacesuits (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration), it is remarkable how different Russian suits are, and how much more conservative their designs are. Russian suits, like their spacecraft are relatively stable designs undergoing incremental improvements, probably in response to the much fewer resources available to them for development.The book covers the development well, although I did not notice any mention of ideas borrowed from US suits, whereas the book on US spacesuits has a wry mention of the remarkable similarity of some US suit components to Russian ones.As with the US spacesuit book, the same comments on the lack of color illustrations and technical details apply."},{"Title":"Writing Fiction for Children: STORIES ONLY YOU CAN TELL","review":"This guide to writing fiction for children is readable and practical, and contains a number of excellent exercises for generating ideas, clarifying characterization, working out plot details, and handling point-of-view problems.

When I saw the 1999 edition illustrated by Yan Nascimbene, I was initially pleased that a new generation of children would enjoy this wonderful story which has been out of print for many years. Unfortunately, this sense of satisfaction soon turned to displeasure when I realized that the original text had been severely abridged. What was originally a short story with plenty of text per page has become a picture book with only a few sentences per page. Let's compare one section:1972 ORIGINALWhen Mr. Crockett moved in it was plain that he was neither elegant nor fashionable. They saw him on weekends washing the dirty windows of his brownstone with ammonia and water, and they snorted. \\"He's a strange little man,\\" they said, and their lips were tight as they talked about him. \\"Imagine doing it himself!\\" They had regular window washers who squeegeed their windows clean during the week. But the gnarled little man named Donald Crockett washed his windows until they shone and sparkled like a sheet of mountain air---fresh and clean. No one knew much about Mr. Crockett because the neighbors didn't care to talk to someone who worked all week and scrubbed the white steps of his own brownstone on weekends. He did it slowly and carefully, as though he enjoyed it, dipping his gnarled stubby hands into the bucket of foamy water, scrubbing back and forth on the step. Sometimes he took a pocket knife out of his corduroy jacket and worked the point around till the dirt came loose. The neighbors clucked when they saw him on his hands and knees that way. Since they had other people to scrub their steps, they never looked carefully enough to see the city dirt that was not scrubbed out of the corners of their stoops. One fall day they saw Mr. Crockett come out with a spading-fork.1999 EDITIONWhen Mr. Crockett moved in, it was plain that he was not fashionable. His neighbors saw him washing the dirty windows of the brownstone himself. \\"A peculiar man,\\" they said, watching him scrub and polish until the windows shone and sparkled like a sheet of mountain air---fresh and clean. One fall day they saw Mr. Crockett come out with a spading fork.Not only was the 1972 text severely abridged---the publishers didn't indicate ANYWHERE in the 1999 edition that the story had been radically altered!Once the text was shortened, the meaning changed as well. For example, in the paragraphs cited above, the original version makes it clear that the neighbors believe it is beneath their dignity to maintain their properties themselves. The neighbors hire cleaners who don't do a thorough and loving job, and eventually, the neighbors' properties suffer.In the abridged version, it wasn't clear that the neighbors were doing ANYTHING to maintain their properties. A child reading the picture book might conclude that elegance equals slovenly behavior when that was certainly not the author's intention.Fortunately, unabridged copies of the 1972 version are inexpensive and readily available.

I've read the paperback edition from front to back twice and parts of it three times. I recently managed to find a copy in hard back in excellent condition that I've added to my collection of keepers, and I'll read it again before I make my next trip to southern Utah. It astonishes me that I have yet to find this book at any of the national park bookstores. This book is very highly recommended for anyone with an interest in or planning to visit the most remarkable region of the continental United States. It's a great introduction to so many facets of this awesome area! In my opinion, it communicates the flavor of the country as well as John Wesley Powell's classic documentary of the first formal exploration of the Colorado River. Don't miss this one.Michael Shea, MD"},{"Title":"Four Corners: History, Land and People of the Desert Southwest","review":"If anyone has been to the Four Corners area, particularly the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley, you will appreciate the author who takes you well beyond those more obviously known pleasures and takes you into more remote and attrarctive parts of the large four corners area giving the reader an introduction to geology while explaing in the initial chapyers how the land and continent was formed. The books goes on to discuss each area, its rock formations including mountains, plateaus and valleys and the vegetation that makes each area unique. The author includes interviews with numerous specialists throughout the book along his own personal journey through these ares that he hikes and camps and spends time in some very remote areas. His discussion of the people that once lived on the land and the ones that currently do provides a human linkage to present day. The mystery of the Anasazi is quite fascinating as these ancient cliff dwellers disappaered around 1400 AD but may have become part of the present day Hopi tribe. The description of their cliff like fortess dwellings and the archelogical studies is one of the most interestiung parts of the book. Why did they live along a cliffs in large communities and what happened to them? The book is not a quick read but one that deserves patience to appreciate the indepth descrptions that Brown provides. The only downturn, which is very slight, is that the author has little tolerance for tourists that in his opinion, along with the specialist he meets, strongly feel that tourists overwhelm these sensitive sites. However, for one who loves to travel these wonderful places with great respect for the sensitivity of the environment, we must all do our part to try to rein in those few that unfortunatey create a negative impact no matter where they visit or live."},{"Title":"Four Corners: History, Land and People of the Desert Southwest","review":"This is a fascinating account of the land and people of the Four Corners region of the southwestern US. Brown is as interested in the geology of the region as he is in the settlers of it. The book is basically divided into five large sections, one for each major point on the compass and a fifth entitled \\"Center.\\" He begins each section with a thorough discussion of its geology. From there he proceeds to the peopling of each section, from the early hunters and gathers to the Anasazi, Spaniards, and Mormons. His long sub-section on the Anasazi is especially good. One thing Brown makes clear is that, unlike the \\"politically correct\\" view held by many today, the Americas were not a Garden of Eden before European contact was made. Native tribes fought ferociously with one another over land and resources; even slavery was practiced among the tribes. And after the disastrous Pueblo uprising of 1680 that virtually emptied the country north of the Rio Grande of all Spanish inhabitants, the Spanish realized they would have to cooperate with the Natives to insure security and success.Brown is an excellent writer and captures the uniqueness of the desert Southwest well without going into rapturous (and phony) doggerel. He is a \\"loner,\\" however, relying on historical records or scientific textbooks for most of his information, and rarely brings along another geologist or historian to hash out information. (This being the case, it's surprising that there is no bibliography included.) Even his own personal observations, other than a few camping/hiking scenes thrown in here and there, are kept to a minimum. Some might object to this impersonal approach, but it didn't bother me at all. The book is interesting and informative - an excellent overview of the desert Southwest."},{"Title":"Soul Survival","review":"hey cristina....I find it really good that youve written this book its just so interested its the type of book that i canr eally say has impacted my life and touched my heart.....just like it will to tons of other young ladies....this is worth buying all the way..Its great to see how many lives you can impact with just writing one great amazing book....for the glory of God..."},{"Title":"Soul Survival","review":"This book is a must read for anyone.

It's actually a book that stands against 'christianity'.I read these books over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed them.

In my opinion, the ideas Dr. Simon presents are accurate and everything he has to say about sexual offenders and murderers is in line with every firsthand observation I've made throughout my career of these individuals. That being said, his book is extremely difficult and frustrating to read. I've been to Dr. Simon's seminar and he can be tough to follow in person because he bounces from topic to topic, but reading him is even harder. It seems like every sentence starts with \\"For example\\" or \\"Hence\\" and they aren't even used correctly!! The book is awful to read and I'm shocked that a publisher let it print in this condition.

With incredible insight into the weaknesses of human political structures, the checks and balances in the constitution provide a system of counterweights that make up a very stable government. While not generally considered among the leading tier of the founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin was present at the creation and made significant contributions.In many ways he is also a model for the American ideal of the self-made man. He rose from poverty to become a writer, editor, publisher, inventor, scientist and diplomat. He charmed many of the leading figures of France so much that it entered the war of independence on the side of the colonies. Granted that there were many reasons for France to come to the aid of America in its war with Britain. However, it is quite possible that it would not have happened without the expert diplomacy of Franklin.This book is the result of a search through his private correspondence. Therefore, it is a description of his personality as he communicates with friends, business and diplomatic colleagues; relatives and acquaintances. It appears that Franklin was quite a ladies man as well. There are hints that he had numerous affairs, although given the style of his letters, it is possible that his high degree of politeness could be mistaken for something deeper. The results depict a man very much of the world, one where life was slower and personal relationships were more significant.It is unfortunate that political rivalries and geopolitical realities combined to lower his standing after the military victory that led to independence. Disputes arose with George Washington and John Adams that were no doubt political in origin. Franklin had both the domestic and international prestige to be considered presidential material, with only his advanced age as a hindrance.The real problems were the geopolitical and geosocial realities. America was an offshoot of British culture, so once the severance was complete the natural affinity reasserted itself. Britain was also the supreme maritime power and America was a small nation consisting mostly of seacoast and the Canadian colony was on the northern border. Therefore, friendship with Britain was essential to the survival of the new nation. Franklin represented an alliance that was no longer critical, so as the political wind shifted, he found himself pushed aside. Until I read this book, I was unaware of the animosities that existed between Franklin and some of the other founders of the new nation.Benjamin Franklin is the American model of the Renaissance man and his contributions to the success of the revolution are not to be underestimated. In reading the summaries of his personal correspondence, I found it clear that he is a person that you would have liked very much to converse with and would have considered yourself graced to have been his friend."},{"Title":"Eppie: The Story of Ann Landers","review":"I've always enjoyed reading a good biography.

If your attention span is as short as a Sunday comic strip, you will like it.Each topic is built like Arnold Schwarzenegger: powerful, yet compact and scientifically engineered with a distinct German accent. The bad side; the subjects are told with the same amount of humor as Arnold displayed in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;.The Germans have a knack for maintaining the discipline of getting to the academic bottomline without starting to ramble. But this did not come easy: The beginning editor, Professor Grochla either died or retired or both during the process and it took more than 10 years to complete the books, sort of a biblical comparison.Amazing breadth of related topics.Not for how-to fans, browsing the mall bookstore for get-rich-quick recipes, but an excellent reference, especially for students of the subject who don't want to look through tons of books, but prefer one-stop-knowledge shopping.

YES Venny sleeps with everyone in the book. Usually I like books (even Black Lace) that have some discretion about the sex life of the characters. But this one was fine. Once you figure out that NO ONE in the book is bothered with fidelity or morals - Let the good times roll. There's a little of everything in this book. Light bondage, multiple partners, & sex with strangers. If you're looking for lots of sex scenes with little plot than this is the book for you. It was well written and the sex scenes were HOT."},{"Title":"The Naked Flame (Black Lace)","review":"The book deals with a young restaurant owner, Venetia Halliday, Venny, as she tries to keep her struggling establishment open. The fact that Venny has the business sense not to sleep with the help she manages to break that rule with prctically everyone in the restaurant except the valet (and thats only because the restaurant didn't have a valet)! I didn't like this book(how can ya tell) because Venny gets intimate with everyone including men she really doenst like. I knew I was in trouble when in the first 18 pages she gets it on with Bill, her chef, and after doing the goodie she fires him! I mean we may not be looking for love in erotic books but please give me a break. Right after that she goes to the bank wearing no more than her coat, and, when she finds old Mr Mustek has retired she gets it on with Mr. Thelwell without even blinking so much as an eye. After making the young manager see the stars in his office he then tells her NO to the loan request. Anyway, the book is full of Venny doing people that a reader certainly gets to hate from point one. The only two people I really liked were Dani, Vennys roomate and Flora the sis in law of the replacement chef. But, the scenes with the Deni and Flora were always cut short, stilted and a downer leaving the reader in the cold."},{"Title":"Singing Guns","review":"Recorded book on 6 cassette tapes.Sheriff Owen Caradac had spent years trailing the man, and when he finally saw him, his sombrero peeking through the branches of a tree, he would have said it had been a fair fight.

The whole book is carried solely by the interesting subject at hand and mister Sens endlessly excellent commentary on it.That having been said, I agree with none of it. I do not value equality in any way, and my politics are thoroughly aristocratic and Old Right. So perhaps the possible reader should take that into account: I have nothing but praise for mister Sens books, and this book in particular is an excellent dive. Perhaps praise from a trenchant enemy is worth more than praise from the ideologically like minded.I will be reading it and making notes and attacks on it for a year to come, at the very least. No matter how you view equality, I advocate mister Sen without reservation. This is excellent. Please buy it."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined","review":"Sen, a Nobel prize winner, has had many great ideas in his career, but this book just sticks to a few of them. The big point he hits early on is that all political theories are theories of egalitarianism: The only difference is how they answer the question, \\"Equality of what?\\"For instance, libertarians believe that everyone has an equal right to negative liberty, utilitarians believe in a right to an equal weighting in the arithmetic social well-being function, and Rawlsians believe in a right to equal \\"basic goods.\\"Where does Sen fit in? A little hard to tell from this work--he's good at the \\"consider this alternative\\" style of writing--but he emphasizes a blend of utilitarianism and Rawlsianism, one that takes seriously what it would really mean to give every human being a decent shot at a humane life. His standards are actually quite low--non-utopian to be sure--but he looks in every nook and cranny and finds much more than you'd expect.In particular, Sen emphasizes how accidents of birth such as health create an underlying inequality across people that often can only be reversed at great expense. On a non-health-related issue, I often ask myself how many tax dollars the people of Britain had to pay to ensure that Salman Rushdie was able to enjoy his right to life and his right to free speech. The point, of course, is that it often costs quite a bit to guarantee some citizens the bare minimum of liberty.So egalitarianism requires unequal government action, as Rushdie himself could tell you. In many different ways, Sen makes this point throughout his text.If you're looking to read a book by Sen, I wouldn't make this the first one: Read his Development As Freedom first--it's his summary of his life's work, well written and deeply insightful. My economics students love reading Development As Freedom. But if you're looking for a second book by Sen, one that will challenge you and please you, I can recommend this book without hesitation."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined","review":"The most basic idea, that one person's equality is another's inequality, is explored in detail. Sen illuminates many of the flaws in standard economic thinking, and how the philosophical underpinnings of economics guide and distort economic reasoning."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined","review":"I just received my copy of this book thinking it contained current ideas of Amartya Sen only to discover it was published in 1992.

He finds the local healer and diviner, Hope, being held prisoner by the abbot. In spite of the fact that she tries to kill the enemy of her people, Roland helps Hope escape her incarceration. Doing so, they have made an enemy of a powerful church figure. As Roland and Hope flee, they fall in love.

It was somewhat choppy and hard to follow, and the motivations for the hero and heroine didn't make sense at first, partially because I was confused about what was going on. However this low expectation start was only a hurdal to a good story.This book was a second away from becoming a classic example of your told therefore you believe, and the reader is left with h/Hs who they are only supposed to care about/ But rather then rush them into anything, the author set up their change of hearts and made it clear that they were fighting their feelings, at least the heroine."},{"Title":"Hope and Glory","review":"I appreciate books that are not run of the mill, and this one certainly isn't.

It's also full of sound advice and delivers its message in the perfect parenting tone -- patient, amused, astonished -- with a keen understanding of the bewilderment and frustration we all go through. My hat is off to the author for his fine work.I actually gave the book to my husband for father's day, but have been snatching it from him to read myself. We have several friends who are about to have new babies -- I'm planning to give them copies of the author's book covering the first year as shower gifts.For nineteen months I've been reading about parenthood and pointing out this and that passage in some parenting book to my husband. In every case, the book spoke about the mother's role, but the father was at best a shadowy figure who might help out once in a while.

So I liked this book, partly because it helped me appreciate every detail of Catherine's development, starting each month with what's gone with the baby physically, intellectually, verbally, emotionally/socially. Then what's you're going through, including how to help your partner. But the best part was this table of benefits and costs of \\"involved fathering;\\" I was blown away by how it articulated the satisfaction of watching her grow, pride that you've achieved something meaningful, love received, personal self-discipline and role modeling, percetual shift/expanded self through increased interest in family, a legacy, lifelong learning just to keep up with kids, life purpose and direction and shared focus in marriage (pp. 204-205). While it wasn't lyrical like Lamott's great book Operating Instructions, I liked its action ideas, like pointing and naming everything in sight, and ways to talk. Like using \\"no\\" and \\"don't\\" minimally, and instead specifying \\"It's not safe to try to put things in outlets\\"--I even use a lower voice so that she doesn't get drama out of \\"no.\\" I'm only sad bottle feedings have ended, so I've lost that time reading. I'd grade it a B+."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"This author does a great job of covering all you will need to know in becoming a dad.

As a result, it went on the shelf like all the others ;) One day, we dipped into it and have found it to be the best \\"one stop\\" resource we have. Although written with a fathering focus, we have found the book to be an invaluable resource for us as our child has grown (he is now 18 months and we are using the Toddler edition). More than any other book, the developmental stages outlined at the beginning of each paragraph have proved spot on every single time; remarkably so in fact. Furthermore, these books cover issues that you really battle with as new parents (separation anxiety, sharing, etc., ) to great depth and with a pragmatic approach. eat. A great series!!"},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"I started reading the book after my child was well in his second year and it hit the nail on the head.

So much time and energy is devoted to mothers, it is nice to know that someone realizes that fathers play an essential role in their children's development.As the author of Your Children are Under Attack: How Popular Culture is Destroying Your Kids' Values, and How You Can Protect Them (Sourcebooks, 2005), I especially appreciated how Mr. Brott addresses concerns related to the emerging influence of popular culture on young children, e.g., time in front of computers.More than anything, I enjoy Mr. Brott's compassionate and humorous style of writing. Though rigorously researched, he offers the information in a reader-friendly format and that is accessible and understandable.For any father, this book is a great follow-up to The Expectant Father and The New Father."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"Didn't read this book but bought for my sons father.

Armin Brott has a way of addressing the common (and not so common) concerns of parenting in a humorous, honest, and educated way. More than just a parenting book though, he also discusses the issues within the other relationships in your life that are inevitably affected by having a toddler (your spouse, your parents, your worklife, etc) and offers great solutions and tips on how to cope. In fact, reading this book with my husband has helped me to better understand some of the struggles he's going through as a dad and has helped to open up the lines of communication a bit more. The author includes great ideas for playtime, learning time, and discipline that we have found to be very helpful. This is a very well-rounded read and one that is used regularly as a reference guide in our home."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"I was really excited about this book..at least until I read it. Granted, I only read a few chapters then decided it wasn't worth my time, but I felt like this book didn't say much about the actual child. It was more of what the dad should be doing (like great detail on how to save up for the child's college). That's good info but I bought the book to learn about stages of my child's development and different techniques to handle these, not finances. So yes, this book is probably good for a very specific target group (let's say 9-5 job upper middle class 30+ year old father with the traditional role) but didn't apply to our equal responsibility, equal respect, young, just barely making it financially, household."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"I got this book from the library because I thought it would be something great for my husband to read. Of course, I flipped through it first--and wow--did it freak me out. I'm not sure where this guy got his age-appropriate behaviors he listed, but he had me thinking (after reading about two pages) that my 20-month-old is seriously behind in practically every single skill! My experienced mom friends tell me not to read these type of parenting books because they will just make me crazy, and I have to admit they're right. I don't have the book in front of me anymore (it went straight back to the library) but it said things like \\"At age 21-24 months, your child should be able to...draw a straight line, dress himself, etc.\\" WHAT? I told my friends that, and they immediately told me their THREE YEAR OLDS couldn't do that stuff.So, while there might be some good daddy/toddler information in there, I didn't get to it, because the other stuff overwhelmed me and freaked me out enough that I stopped right there."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"To be honest, I didn't read the entire book since it was so general. I was hoping for a more personal view of the author's experiences but there weren't many. This book was a total compilation of other's views. I am tired of reading books on children. I don't want multiple references for multiple issues. I was hoping this was a dad who had real experiences to share with other dads. Unfortunately, this is another author trying to sell books. Do yourself a favor and buy 'What to Expect, The Toddler's Years' by Arlene Eisenburg. This is a reference we trust."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"This is the second book I have received as a gift by this same author. Same cute cover (that I am sure led to the gift purchase), same insanely horrible content. Who on earth wants to be given a book about raising your toddler to flip through and find a chapter on the best strategies to get through a divorce (if the author actually took his own advice in the prior book, I have to assume the divorce information is from experience).Once again, the author wrote a book focused on his own self doubts and fears, and couched it as a healthy way to raise children.This is the second book I have ever stuck in the recycling bin instead of contributing to charity after reading it. No one on earth should be punished with this book."},{"Title":"Fathering Your Toddler: A Dad's Guide to the Second and Third years (New Father Series)","review":"I read through this book and learned more about how inadequate the author feels than about anything else. This book is full of generalization, politically correct tripe, and features a disclaimer for the anti-marriage crowd.I would prefer a book from someone who offends me and takes a position, over a book (like this one) where the author is a coward and refuses to say anything that might be considered politically incorrect.Not surprising that this author ends the book with a section on how to survive a divorce."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am so pleased to see that the Count of Monte Cristo has moved up to about 2880 in Amazon's rating out of over 6 million books. It was about 280,000 3 years ago when I checked. Imagine, a book over 150 years old has again, like it did when he was alive, captured the world. Penguin was perspicacious in providing the first complete English translation of this inspirational classic written around 1840! I have read it 3 times and never tire of it.It is difficult to add anything of value to the fantastic comments already made on the site, as the book has over 5 out of 5 stars and I agree with every one of the reviewers. I am thrilled that this generation is reading the author that I personally consider the best author that ever lived. It goes to show that true art is immortal. One member of royalty, on their deathbed in the 1800s, said they read Dumas because he gave life in his works. I agree.The book, as well as his over 1000 works, is riveting, enthralling and full of plot twists and great characters.Alexandre Dumas was the ultimate wordsmith and studied, and studied, on his own, to master his craft, never getting his dues until recently, by the French government. They dug him up from his hometown of Villers Cotterets, France, and moved his body to the Pantheon, finally calling him a national treasure. I read his biography and he wanted to be buried in Villers Cotterets. The move was disheartening in that the town lost revenue from tourists. Also, you can find pictures of the Chateau he built on the web. The man's personal life is as fascinating as this book, but beware, there are many lies circulating about his father, a brigadier general in Napoleon's army, being born out of wedlock, as well as Dumas himself. Neither is true, according to his 5 volume autobiography.Current reviewers also love to emphasize the illegitimacy of his son, an author in his own right, named Alexandre Dumas, fils (Jr.), the father being pere. No child is illegitimate and the two were close. People were admitedly jealous of Dumas then and, in my opinion, today. The writing academy only recently admitted him and that was a goal he held when he was alive. Great men, superior men, as Dumas points out in his narrative about some of his characters, including Dantes, are generally hated. Dumas was one of those hated men.If you loved this book, I'd suggest going to cadytech and checking out his other works. In the Count of Monte Cristo, Dumas's ability to capture the emotional spectrum of the human heart, to portray a wide array of human interactions, his mastery of dialog, demonstration of the conflicts of man versus man and man versus himself, his ability to paint descriptive pictures and completely draw readers into well defined and thought out plots, his expertise in interjecting philosophical truisms as food for thought, to make you feel the experiences of the protagonist and construct a perfect story of revenge, indeed one of the best ever stories of revenge, in my opinion, all make this my favorite book of all time.Dumas loved Shakespeare and many other authors and if you are as interested in the life of this fascinating man, as I am, please don't forget to go to cadytech. It is maintained by one of the most prominent translators of Dumas's works from french. Also, for another good read by this author, check out the complete 3 musketeers musketeers series, comprised of 5 books: The 3 Musketeers, 20 Years After, 10 Years Later, The Count de Bragelonne, and finally The Man in the Iron Mask. Dumas actually wrote 1 book but it was later divided into the 5 mentioned above. I could go on and on but will stop now."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book was amazing. I first learned of the story watching the tv show \\"wishbone\\" as a child. Which opened my eyes to this great story teller Dumas. I am also ashamed to admit that I saw the movie before reading the book. =( If its not too late to warn you, dont watch the friggin movies! Does not do the book any justice whatsoever. They throw in a bunch of hollywood BS. sword fights are thrown out like candy to a bunch of school kids. And no matter how good the movie is, your cramming in 2 weeks worth of literature into a 2 hour clip. The penguin copy is the best Ive seen. The intro is very informative and the notes in the back are helpful. Dumas made tears swell up in my eyes 3 times. While i am not a macho man, I am pretty reserved in terms of cryin out but this book really hits a couple emotional buttons. Worth the read. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Do you want to read an exciting book? Then the Count of Monte Cristo is the book for you. The Count of Monte Cristo is a very good book. It is a fiction adventure book about a man named Edmond Dantes who lived in Marseilles in the 1800s. In it Edmond is accused of being a Bonaparist and had to go to jail for fourteen years until he ecscapes and bec omes wealthy. He then set out for revenge. I like this book because it is very exciting and has lots of details that a lot of other authors would have kept out. I also like it because it is told in lots of points of view. Like one moment it is telling about Edmond and the other it is telling about Albert and Mercedes {characters in the book}. I recommend this book because it is very thrilling and ends in a wasy that makes you want to know what happens to all the characters in it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dantes seems to have it all.

Even though the book is over 500 pages, he couldn't put the book down, nor could we."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Apart from 'The Three Musketeers', this is probably Alexandre Dumas' most famous work and one of the greatest novels in Western literature: a novel every literate and educated person should read at least once in their lives.In this story, Edmond Dantes is an innocent man who was caught in the intrigues of Napoleon's escape from Elba and his 100 days of power until Waterloo. A sailor entrusted with a sealed letter of highest importance by his dying captain, Dantes delivers it into the hands of the evil prosecutor Villefort who, for reasons unkown to him, immediately sends him without trial or appeal to spend the rest of his days at the Chateau D'Iffe: a dark and isolated island prison presumed to be inescapable. With the help of Abbot Faria, a dying prisoner who knows the secret of a great hidden treasure on the small islet of Monte Cristo, Dantes escapes and prepares to unleash his revenge on those who did him wrong. For years he spends his time meticulously preparing his vengeful scheme against the treacherous friends and characters who left him to rot in prison for years and years. He refines his arts of disguise, alchemy, and manipulation to content himself with the ruin of his enemies.Unlike the adventure themes in his works such as 'The Three Musketeers', this story is a deep character study on being the victim of utmost injustice and how cruel revenge is sweet after all: how a wronged man is entitled to become the agent of divine retribution when God and mortal laws have abandoned his cause. The various themes, complex plot, profound character development, and rich prose makes this long work undoubtedly one of the greatest works of literature ever written: Dumas was without question a literary genius.This is a great story for people of all ages and should not be ignored by anyone who has a profound love of literature. I think this is Dumas greatest work far surpassing 'Queen Margo' 'The Three Musketeers' or 'The Corsican Brothers.'"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most thrilling tales of betrayal, adventure and revenge that I have ever read.

This thriller will have you on the edge the whole time until the last ounce of revenge is exacted.

Have you heard the saying don't judge a book by its cover? Well I learned that by reading this book. After picking it up I didn't really expect to like it but stranger things have happened. From the first page to the last the book is full of excitement and drama. It starts out with the main character Edmond Dantes sailing on the boat whose captain has died so he takes control till they get back back to the island of Marseilles. Dantes is betrayed by his fellow shipmate and friend and is sent to jail. After escaping he is rescued by a ship that hires him to work from them until he gets back to the island of Marseilles, where he changes his identity to the Count of Monte Cristo after unearthing his hidden family treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Upon arriving there he finds out his farther has died his friend have left and his wife has moved on and left not to be seen again. He moves to Paris to become one of the richest men there. No longer the poor sailor he use to be leaving his last life behind him to go and do great things. Follow along as the Count lives his rich and wonderful life doing as he wishes living as he does. Learn about how rich people lived back then. Well after reading this book I was pretty impressed by it and would probably read it again some day. So if you are looking for a exciting, dramatic, romantic and adventurous book all in one the Count of Monte Cristo is the right book for you. It was very entertaining from the fist page to the last. So I would give it five out of five."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas truly surpassed himself with the publication of The Count of Monte Cristo. The gripping beginning is full of mistrust and betrayal, as the main character Edmond Dates, is imprisoned as a result of his supposed friends. The story covers the turbulent years of his imprisonment, starting with depression and thoughts of suicide, followed by years of being educated and developed. After his phenomenal escape from prison, Dantes sets out on a journey to seek fortune and revenge himself. Years of tragic, surprising, and dynamic events follow, in which Dantes is exposed to old \\"friends\\" and even an ex-lover. The plot thickens as infidelity, bankruptcy, danger, and astonishment are incorporated into the scheme. The story ends the way it begins, full of love, and adoration.The Count of Monte Cristo is beautifully written, and truly a story that intrigues you the moment you pick it up. Its fast-paced plot line is full of revenge, love, and lying. The length, although extensive, is irrelevant, because the story that the many pages tells is revolutionary, and truly inspiring."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"You see all these reviews on this site of highschool kids says 'SOO BOORING' but these are obviously immature lazy students, who cant appreciate a great book.

Dumas's style has been criticised for its luxuriousness, but it has the great virtue that it always has the vision of something half-comprehensible behind the humdrum life. Some of his sentances are crafted with such mastery of language it is almost inconcievable. The beauty of this book is that, though we understand Edmonde Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo is eternally a mystery. With every other character we get incites into thier mind, thier reactions, passions etc. For the Count, we get only the perceptions of others and thus never know the main character of one of the greatest books of all time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I love this book! It's a great story about love, lust, money, and revenge. The first few chapters are a little dry, but after the main character is falsely accused of treason the pace picks up remarkably so stick it out. The plot keeps unfolding and there are a lot of little twists and hints. The ending might or might not surprise you, but suffice it to say Dumas is the one author that doesn't cop out and put everything in a neat little package tied up with a red bow. This ending is real.

After escaping, he transforms into the Count of Monte Cristo (with the help of an uncovered treasure), and infiltrates Parisian high society with the intention of ruining the men who unjustly imprisoned him fourteen years prior.An interesting story with a lot of drama, but the Count is a bit larger than life, richer than the wealthiest man in Paris, extravagant, and omnipresent in a really annoying way. Rather than retaining the modesty of the Marseille sailor he used to be, he turns into this perfect, almost deity figure who can do no wrong, cures the sick, solves everyone's problems,walks on water, etc...There are alot of detailed discussion about money in the novel, perhaps a sign of the times and the birth of capitalism. Money and politics are the tools used by the Count to get revenge.This novel is definitely better than the movie that came out last year (distorted Hollywood [junk]) but it was not as amazing as I'd expected. By the way, I read the full, unabridged edition, but this was the only edition I could write a review for."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an excellent book for people who like classics with an actual meaning to it. This book desribes a man's life and the friends who betrayed him because of their jealousy. As he makes a &quot;comeback&quot; as a completely different and sophisticated man, the Count of Monte Cristo gives no mercy to those who betrayed him. With all this merciless revenge, Dumas shows the real meaning of love and how forgiving may be the solution to your problems. The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite number one book and I recommend this book to people of all ages!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The depth of Edward Dantes' revenge upon his betrayers is only hinted at in the recent movie.

It is a book packed with themes such as betrayal, imprisonment, revenge, romance, history, drama, mercy, and ultimately forgiveness. It is a novel about a man named Edmond Dantes who has a good life up until people he thought were his friends betray him and end up taking away everything he holds dear to him: His wife to be (Mercedes) is stripped from him on his arrest for false conviction for being an agent of Napolean, this causing his father to die of grief and hunger. With the help of Abbe Faria, a former prisoner, teaches Dantes the ways of the world. He escapes one faithful night from the prison known as the Chateau D'If, finds the island of Monte Cristo with the treasure Faria spoke of and tracks down and punishes those who have wronged him under the avenging angel persona: \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". After reading the full Unabridged novel I could see why people loved the book so much for it's rich detail and lush writing in politics and French history to undertone the great revenge of Edmond Dantes. The way in which Dantes carries out his vengeance is cold and swift; whatever they did to make him suffer he launches twice back at them. Dantes also finds romance from the girl Haydee who is the long lost princess of the Pacha Ali Tebelen of whom he rescued from a sultan after her parents' deaths. It was nice to see the count get a beautiful girl and find happiness again for the very reason his Mercedes was stolen from him by his enemy, Fernand Mondego. I don't want to ruin it for you so just go and read the darn book. If you are interested in reading the unabridged version (Which I recommend you do and not some stupid abridged edition) get the Modern Library hardcover like I did. It is a 1,462 page book and the longest novel I've ever read in my life, but it moves along at a fast, steady pace. Thats all I can say is if Alexandre Dumas was able to construct this huge genius book with great characters and a great plot all back in 1844, he must certainly have been ahead of his time along with his book. A beautiful piece of literary art and probably the only classic I've been able to read all the way through. Definitely one of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dantes, a kind compasionate young man about to begin the journey of his life.

Everything from the treasure to the intricate tangled web of the people involved in the central plot.In the first part of the book, I felt the emotion of Dantes. But towards the middle of the book, I became completely disconnected. It all came down to character development, but I lost my emotional connection to Dantes.The book is a marvelous read to discover the upper-class world of France in the 1800s.

Not long after an interrogation, he is condemned to life in prison at the Chteau d'lf. Unfortunate souls sent here are never heard or seen again. Death is the only way out of this dark place. Many of Edmond's precious years are spent alone, forgotten, and in despair and wretchedness. When all seems lost, he has an unusual encounter with another prisoner, Abb&eacute; Faria. A strong friendship forms as they plan their elaborate and final escape. But only days before their escape, Abb&eacute; Faria falls ill and cannot make the journey. On his deathbed, Abb&eacute; Faria gives his beloved friend the whereabouts of a forgotten treasure. With the life of his friend fading, he must make the most important choice of his life. Spurred by the hope restored to him by his friend and by the vengeance that has grown and festered in his heart throughout the long years spent behind bars, Edmond attempts his final escape. Whether it be death or great riches that lie outside his four prison walls, he is determined to play his part as the avenging angel. Those who have ruined his life will pay, and those who were undeserving of their fate will be avenged. He will have what is rightfully his, what he deserves...or...so he plans.This is one of Dumas's greatest novels. It will draw the reader into its story within the first few pages. It is a book that is hard to put down or walk away from. If you enjoy tales full of unexpected twists and turns, you will love this one. Yet, as a warning, it is a book that you cannot just breeze through. It takes your full attention to catch all the details. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to take the time. So, if this is you, just sit back and prepare yourself for the ride of your life."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just finished this book this morning, and, as any good book should, it moved me to tears (and not for the first time). Of course, this made me look a little strange when I showed up at work.When taking on a book of this size that is this good (and therein lies the catch), it becomes a part of your life. Some of the characters will remind you of people you know and bring them more to life, but already Dumas' characters are so lifelike and incredibly, amazingly real, and that with each chapter you have spent that much more time with them, learning something new about them (up to the very last chapter!), the story literally becomes a memory that you will be fond of looking back on.It is interesting to note that this translation is from an anonymous person. I had several issues with the translation unfortunately. I feel it was completed by at least two people, and I believe one can tell (in the first half of the book) because the chapters are clumped together in specific styles. It probably won't affect many readers, but I noticed it and thought I should point it out. This edition, unfortunately, has typos! Beware, that though they are sparse, they are blatant. This saddens me when I see a beautiful edition slighted by the hands of lazy-eyed editors. (I expect no less for modern authors!)I have waited years to read this. I would have loved to have read this when I was younger, but a lot of it would have gone in one eye, out the other (so to speak).Enjoy, and let the story take you away from this life for awhile."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo,&quot; Alexandre Dumas weaves a tale of love, revenge, intrigue and adventure to make one of the greatest novels ever written.This story follows Edmond Dantes as he becomes the captain of the Pharaon and is going to marry the beautiful Mercedes. During his betrothal feast for his wedding, Dantes is arrested because he is thought to have been a follower of Napoloen. When Dantes think he is going to get put off the hook, he is sent to the Chateau d'If where he spends over a decade of his life in prison. When he meets Abbe Faria at the prison, his life is changed. He gets out and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. And this is only the beginning!&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is one of the greatest books ever written. Dumas is a master at telling a great story and it really shows in this novel. I strongly recommend that every person that enjoys a good book read this.HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"When I received The Count of Monte Cristo, unabridged, for my 16th birthday, I thought to myself, \\"Yeah right. This is over 1400 pages! I'll never get around to reading it!\\" Although an avid reader already, I was not prepared for this amazing work of art. My friend and I read it over the summer, and we both say it is the singular greatest book we have ever read! We agree that Alexandre Dumas must have been a genius to be able to think of such an intricate, fascinating plot. The characters are believable, moving me to tears at times and laughter at others. I recommended this book to all my friends and family, and to all people who love reading a good story as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have read 6 different translations of this book starting with a children's version when I was 6. I know, that doesn't count. But the 5 other ones were full versions. I know that such a thick book can be intimidating but it is worth while. Each turn of the page feels like unwrapping a new gift. By the time you get to the end you will miss it and wish that it was even longer. This is the best translation that I have read thus far. This book is for anyone that likes to treasure their time with their books and is not for impatient people who just want to know the plot."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a great book full of betrayal and deceit. It may be long but it's definitely worth reading.Edmond Dantes was a sailor from Marseilles, poised to be married to Mercedes, a beautifl village girl. However, enemies of Dantes plan his arrest on the day that is planned for his wedding and he is condemnned to imprisonment on a desolate island in the dreaded Chateau D'If. Here, he meets the priest Faria who helps plan Dantes' escape and tells him of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond escapes the prison and goes to retreive the treasure and changes his identity. Now he is called the Count of Monte Cristo. He goes back to the mainland to retreive his love and seek revenge on his betrayers.I used a copy by signet classics, the editing was terrible and I found at least five typos; it was kind of distracting. I do highly recommend reading the book though!!!(only get a different version)"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Enough good things can't be said of this book. It is rightly considered Dumas' masterpiece. The story in a sentence is how a man named Dantes is falsely accused and imprisoned thanks to the machinations of his treacherous enemies, escapes jail, comes across a fortune and spends many a year spinning a sweet, sweet revenge on all.Of course the brilliance of the novel can't be described. It truly is great in its descriptions of the machinations and the motivations of the characters, as well as its insight into the human condition, second to few. Just because a book was published serially as popular fiction doesn't make it less worthwhile than the most pompous novel. The book explores the moral justification of Dantes in his revenge.This is a work where the hundreds of details come together (nothing being told for no reason) to pack a powerful punch. As such, no abridged version will ever do. It's long but it's a good read and worthwhile. A must."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is about a nineteen year old sailor named Edmond Dant&egrave;s, ion the post Napoleon era. Edmond is engaged to a beautiful Catalan woman and, after his captain died, became the captain of the Pharaon. His life seems to be very good and blessed, however, while his captain was sick, he stopped, under orders, on the Isle of Elba where he encountered Napoleon and received a letter from him. Once Edmond is found with the letter, he is imprisoned in the Chteau d'If, an island prison.I found this book to be very interesting and filled with excitement. It shows how a man, through faith in God, can prosper. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, conspiracies, and classic books. This book has been around for a long time and is still flourishing."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I originally read this book for school but it turned out that I really enjoyed the book. This book allows you to take a look into the life of royalty and of peasants during the early eighteen hundreds. The action in this book took a while to start but when the action started it kept up throughout the novel. I saw the movie before I saw the book so I thought that the book would be the same as the movie. The book in fact is very different than the movie. There is fighting in the movie and the details of the story are different. This story filled with deception, but you know whom to trust. But Edmond does not seem to realize whom to trust. Edmond does horrible things to the people whom he has revenge for. Edmond only does this however to get back what he has lost and he still helps people along the way. Edmond plans out this revenge that he destroys the people he is out to get. He makes them into laughing stokes."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is THE book to read. No other book that I have ever read comes close to the excitement, passion and feeling that this book portrays. As I read it, I could feel the emotions Dantes felt... Dumas does a wonderful job of grabbing the reader and pulling him/her into the story, so that it is no longer just a story... but rather, it becomes reality."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'm sure everyone is familiar with what the book is about so I won't tell you any of that. This book is a great read. Yes, it is 1000+ pages but it's difficult to put down and easy to get through. The Count of Monte Cristo is an interesting and mysterious character. Although the reader can easily see that Monte Cristo is Edmond Dantes, the author does not state this until near the end of the book, and even then continues to refer to him as Monte Cristo, as though Edmond is no more. This adds greatly to Monte Cristo's appeal, although you come to miss the sailor from Marseille when learning more about the bitter, vengeful count.I have to say, I wished the author would go deeper into Monte Cristo's mind, and show us his thoughts and actions when he was alone, rather than follow wherever there is action or dialogue. Although by no means am I critisizing, I couldn't possibly, being an amateur reader in the classics.I found that the beginning, during his imprisonment, and the end, as the story comes to a close, are the best and most moving parts of the book. It gets a little disturbing near the middle, with the executions and bandit stories and all! The moments when you see some of Edmond in the character of Monte Cristo are a delight. The story stirs your moral ideas, and you ask yourself as the story progresses whether the Count goes too far in seeking revenge. Other characters are equally interesting, such as Villefort, Maximilien, Danglars, Mercedes, The Viscount Albert and even Abbe Faria, who is a bit like the Bishop in Les Miserables. Don't hesitate to read the book because of its size, the pages fly by! And it's mostly action and dialogue anyway. I haven't seen any of the movie versions, but as is often the case, I'm sure they lack a lot of what the book can offer. Same goes for abridgements. So don't waste anymore time, read this book!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The real thing is about twice as long. I'd prefer that merchants and publishers would plainly label the abridged versions. As for the content, Dumas's &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is central to the development of modern western literature, a precursor to Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and a grand yarn in the league of Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Your grandparents read this story. Your grandchildren will read this story."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Unfortunately, the only copy of The Count of Monte Cristo I could find was the unabridged version in my school library. At the time I was glad I was reading the short version, 1,500 pages seemed a little too overwhelming at the time. But after reading the short version, I found myself wanting more. I could tell when they cut stuff out and it drove me crazy, I kept wondering what I was missing.I found myself wanting to read this book in the first place because I saw the commercials for the movie on t.v. (Which I know I'm not going to watch because they changed everything.) My mom told me it was a really good book so I checked it out. It took me a little bit to read because of school and chores. But once I picked it up I read 20 or 30 pages at a time. Sometimes more. Alexandre Dumas is a genius. His writing style is so unique. He draws a beautiful picture inside the readers head. All the characters in this book were multidimensional. I'm not used to seeing characters like that.At the beginning of the book Edmond Dantes was leading a happy, perfect life. He was engaged to the woman he loved, Mercedes. He was going to become a captain. And he had wonderful friends. But before he knows it his wonderful life becomes nothing but misery and pain. Two of his so-called friends, blackmails him and he's thrown into a dank prison for being a Bonapartist. Over the long harsh years ahead of him he plots his revenge on the people who sent him there. . .I'd love to tell you more, but there aren't enough words in the world to describe the impact this story had on me. I'll just give you a quick overview: This story is mostly about a man who gets revenge on those who made his happy life miserable. He slowly ruins their lives and they don't even realize it's him. No one recognizes him, except Mercedes, but she doesn't let him know for a long time. She becomes a very weak woman, who lives only for her son. But she still loves Edmond and I believe in some ways he still loves her. But he's a completely different person, then. He knows their time has passed.This book is very well written and has all the elements of a good story. Romance, adventure, revenge, mystery...And anything else you can think of. I'm going to have a hard time reading a book after this one. Other books will pale in comparison, I'm sure. Someday, I'll read the abridged version, but not today. . . Maybe when I'm older and have enough patience and time to read the whole thing. This story will stay with me forever, even if I never read it again."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I learned French for this book. Simply, I wanted to read such a remarkable piece in its original version. This being done, I can assure you of two things when picking up Buss' translation. First, you are guranteed of a precisely accurate and tremendous translation. Secondly, you will be smitten with Dumas' work. Period."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Buss' translation is brilliant - spares no blushes. The \\"adult themes\\" are complete and unbowdlerized. This is not a children's book.[...] sells the audio book which is the Lorenzo Carcaterra translation, read by John Lee. It is some 48 hours long, unabridged. While listening to the sample, I followed the same passage in the Buss translation. The difference is staggering. Buss' translation is not only more readable, but would make a far more listenable audiobook. This translation should also be made available for the Kindle. I'd buy it a second time if it were in that format. The paperback (1070+ pages)is heavy and hard for me to hold up, and the font is too small for these old eyes. Nevertheless, it is an outstanding translation of a wonderful story. If you read any other, you will have been cheated.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Wow. What an amazing book. The plot was so well laid and a joy to uncover. I am truly glad that I took the time to read the unabridged version, which is quite daunting, but worth the length.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"As human beings, we, for the most part believe in justice. When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the thickest books I've ever read, and it was worth every page. Don't be daunted by the size, the complete, unabridged Count of Monte Cristo is not just one of the best adventure stories ever written, but one of the best stories period. The simplicity of the story conceals everything the story has to say about life; the expectations, disappointments, despairs, hatreds, loves, joys and bittersweetness that everyone experiences. This book is timeless and unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is far and away the best book I have ever read, and considering I read about a book a week, that is definitely saying something.I'm not going to give you another review of the storyline because there are probably a hundred others on here already so to do it again would seem quite pointless. What I want is to give people a couple of reasons why this book is so great. One of them is that the book is so well balanced and what I call an \\"everything book\\" because it has a great balance of everything in it: adventure, romance, mystery, humor, etc. There is really no one category you could put this book under which I think makes it even better.The other thing that makes this book so great (along with the great storyline) is the writing style of Dumas. First of all, he is never overly descriptive which is something that a lot of authors tend to do. He uses just the right amount of description on the scene and then lets the characters take over from there. Also, he has this wonderful way of always making the reader want to continue on to the next chapter. You just can't put the book down! Everything just seems to flow in such an effortless manner. Many nights I was up at two in the morning because I just couldn't put the book down.Do yourself a favor and read this book (unabridged penguin classics version, of course) and I can promise you that you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Wow. I am so glad to have bought this book. I cannot put it down! At first I must admit I was intimidated by its size as well as the period it was written. I find that many period books are really dense and difficult reads. Not this one at all!!! Easy to read and such a gripping tale! It draws you in and you do not want to put it down. I am so glad that I am reading the unabridged version because I cannot imagine it any other way. I am also so happy that it is so long because I do not want the story to end!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a literary masterpiece. It has everything one could want in a book and more: adventure, fighting, planning, tales of riches, tales of suffering, tales of ultimate betrayal and revenge, and even a little love.This book may be long, but every single page is worth your time. It is written so perfectly and the story put together with such great design...an epic tale perfect for any reader."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I had never read Monte Cristo before and was at first reluctant to invest the time needed for this modern, unabridged version. I'm glad I did though, because it was a great story that moved along quickly in spite of its length. The freshly translated language helps, and because it's unabridged, it's satisfying to know that you're getting the full text that Dumas intended."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a phrase that most people are familiar with; the broad outlines of his story have become a part of everyone's general understanding via cultural osmosis: Edmond Dantes, wrongly imprisoned by the contrivance of four men, escapes jail after decades, and, armed with essentially limitless money, plots his revenge. With this in mind, those revisiting the original novel have a general idea of what happens with the principal characters. While it would perhaps be optimal to begin reading with no preconceptions, the novel does not suffer for knowing the general outline. In particular, adaptations always end up significantly cutting the original story, which clocks in at nearly 1300 pages in this edition; so there are plenty of story points normally omitted for the reader to discover.An English professor once related that in the Renaissance genre of revenge tragedy, there were only a few that really examined the toll taken on the revenger (Kyd's \\"The Spanish Tragedy\\" and Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" being the notable ones), while most simply offered a black-and-white story of wronged men slaying the demons who haunt them. Alexander Dumas' story, which has become perhaps the archtypal revenge novel, also falls into the more complex category. It is perhaps telling that while the novel follows Edmond Dantes' perspective from the beginning to the point where he escapes from prison and finds the treasure that will finance his scheme, as soon as Dantes becomes The Count of Monte Cristo the perspective largely shifts to other characters; Dantes, a young and happy man, becomes something different and less human; the Count is almost automaton-like in his calculations and actions, though, as the story wears on, pricked by resurgent emotions. It is the conflict between his assumed roll as the wrath of God and his mere humanity that serves as the major conflict in the novel's climax.Dumas offers a panoply of other characters, generally well-drawn, and absurdly interconnected in the best traditions of the Victorian novel; particularly notable is the oblique sketch of a lesbian couple who ride off into the sunset, a risky inclusion for the time period (and generally sanitized from most versions of the story).This is by no means a quick read, but it is very much recommended for fans of classic literature."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Whether you are looking for romance, drama or mystery this book covers so many exciting genres.

Several of the parts are rather longer than the need be, the Rome section in particular drags tediously (it was originally meant to open the book, it was only after he had scetched out the plot that he decided to tell the story of Edmond Dantes incarceration and break-out instead of us meeting the enigmatic Count in the middle of the Roman Carnival and moving on to Paris shortly there after).As most people know the Count of Monte Cristo is the story of a wrongfully imprisoned man who breaks free, gets a massive fortune and then sets out to revenge himself on the people responsible. What most people don't know is that the prison section serves only as a small part of the story and that it is in the main taken up by the Count's prolonged revenge. What most people also don't know is the bits that are often left out of the movies and the abridgements yet so enliven the tale such as suicide, infanticide, lesbianism, transexualism, murder and drug taking. On the whole then Monte Cristo is a brilliant if flawed tale."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A true classic with good reason.It's a great read.

Edmond's conspire to get him arrested as a spy, at a time in France when the political situation was very touchy. On trumped-up charges, he ends up in prison, in confinement alone in the dungeon.For awhile Edmond thinks he will die. He thinks he would like to die, and begins starving himself to death. But then a chance interaction with another prisoner allows Edmond to gain some insight into his situation. Despair gives way to fury, and Edmond decides to get himself out of prison and take revenge on those who did him wrong. Through a fortunate set of circumstances, Edmond begins to put his plan into action.I really liked the plot of this book; I loved the idea of Edmond having the mental strength as well as the financial resources to ruin the lives of those who had him locked away in his youth. I enjoyed watching the worlds of Edmond's enemies crumble.The book was rather simplistic, though, with far too many coincidences that allowed the characters to get what they needed to get, from stumbling into a fortune to being in the right place to eavesdrop on a critical conversation.

Edmond Dantes is a young sailor who has everything he needs in life. He has a wife and a large amount of money to start a family. He is betrayed by his friends and sent to the dreaded Chateau d'If, and is imprisoned for life. Edmond thinks his life is over, so he swears vengeance to all who betrayed him. Edmond makes a miraculous escape and puts his plans into motion. He is determined to gain vengeance and nothing thrown in his way will stop him. He adopts the name Count of Monte Cristo and becomes friends with the ones who betrayed him. He gains his vengeance slowly by revealing little secrets about each of them, while revealing nothing at all about him. This is a story of a man who was wrongfully accused, and was able to escape and return the favor to his friends. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing book by Alexandre Dumas, and it is also one of his best."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexander Dumas was an early 19th century writer who would be considered a writer of suspense novels or thrillers today. He wrote in the Romantic style of the day, but he wrote adventure novels that became popular bestsellers. The escape into the past, especially the reign of Louis XIV, or the Napoleonic Wars, was fictionalized and romanticized. One can imagine the mulatto French writer, mind off into a world of adventure and a quill pen writing endlessly as he burned the midnight oil. Escapist literature, it seemed, was well received in France. His novels enabled Dumas to live an extravagant lifestyle which resulted in his demise. He died penniless because he had spent so much of his money on women, alcohol, card games and pursuits of pleasure.Dumas most recognized work is The Three Musketeers but &quot;The Count Of Monte Cristo&quot; is his best work. It is his most well written, his most expressive, psychological and deepest work of fiction. It is not just a revenge tale. Ultimately, it sends a message against taking revenge and living a life of virtue. The hero, Edmond Dantes, is a young man in the French navy, who has jealous enemies. He is accused of aiding Napoleon's escape from his island exile, and sentenced to life imprisonment in a gruesome island prison (like a French Alcatraz). His fiancee, Mercedes, is left alone to grieve his terrible misfortune. During his imprisonment, Dantes befriends an old man who inspires hope in him and moreover, shows him a map of treasure worth thousands. Dantes escapes the prison and finds the treasure, becoming a powerful and wealthy Count.Finally, Dantes, in his guise as the Count of Monte Cristo, extracts revenge on his enemies, especially when he finds out Mercedes has married his worst enemy and birthed a son. The last parts show Dante at his most inhuman, as his revenge is manifested, he realizes he is losing his humanity, and even Mercedes no longer sees the good man she once saw. Mercedes and Dantes do not end up happily ever after, nor married, as films often portray. Their tragic parting is a reminder to Dantes of his flaw of revenge. The novel is poignant, well written, a classic sure to enthrall French literature fans as well as fans who love to curl up with a great book of meaningful adventure."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"somehow i managed to get out of school without ever having read this book. what a bummer, because i truly loved it! i couldn't put it down! i even brought it with me in the car and read it at the red lights. i started reading it because the movie was coming out and i thought i would just never get to it if i saw the movie first. but i waited, read the book and just saw the movie last nite. the book is better because it is more detailed, but the 2002 movie version is worth the [money], on its own. it's different enough from the book that those who have read are still entertained. and vice-versa to those who have seen the film...READ THE BOOK, TOO! it's wonderful and i had a lot of fun reading it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This edition is worthwhile alone for the translator's introduction, highlighting exactly what was missing in earlier editions and how the exclusions/changes grew in each version. His translation of dialogue retains some of the direct simplicity that Dumas' original has (per the experts), but lacks the faux, grande-melodramatic language of the popular editions I read as a child.This is THE classic 19th century saga, incorporating the Gothic and globe-trotting heroes of the tail-end of the 18th C. with contemporary Romantic sensibilities. If you've only seen film/tv versions you'll find some of their swashbuckling elements missing. This is not The 3 Musketeers; instead the search for a moral core to their choices is in all the characters. With a supporting cast of characters as rich as Dickens at his most memorable (Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist) the Count himself (and Sinbad the Sailor, and Edmund Dantes) still remains a complex archetype. I urge you to read this translation, whether you've visited the story before or not.

Dumas' novel is less an action story than a testiment to human endurance, ingenuity, and ultimately, self-forgivness. The story's protaganist, Edmund Dantes, is sent to prison on false charges where he lingers for years. During his unjust incarceration he mets a fellow inmate who teaches him, guides him, and also bestows upon him a fortune. Dantes uses this fortune to set a plan into action. For years he has dreamed of revenge against the men who put him in prison and now he will have it. More riviting than the web of intrigue Dantes spins to fulfill his scheme is the deeper quest for self-redemption that unknowingly haunts him. Retribution and revenge, though important plot points, take a backseat to Dumas' opptimism in this stirring tale. Magnificent!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read The Three Musketeers and loved it, so I decided to read another book by Dumas.

I called my cousin, who suggested the book to me, every night, and we had detailed discussions of what was happening. I was highly disappointed when I discovered that it was not on my school reading list for this year. If you like dull, informative books with few characters and no suspense or mystery, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! However, if you are normal, you should definitely read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I REALLY enjoyed this book! I actually went to bed early at night so I could get to reading! We read it for school and it was the first time my teacher had ever had a class that enjoyed a classic novel so much! Only 1 person in the entire class read the Cliffs' Notes! Now my mom is reading it and agrees with me that it is an excellent book! I do think, though, that the end could have been better...I didn't think I would like a revenge book, but there is so much more to this one. I highly recommend it for entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is a great book. The way the plot is structured, the way Edmond Dantes slowly takes his revenge, to make it all the more painful on his enemies.The setup is ingenious--Dantes is in the best situation he could possibly be in. He is getting married, and is going to become the captain of the Pharaon, a ship that he is first mate on...and then, out of the blue, some police come in, and he is put away in the Chateau d' If, an island prison, to die.Dumas is a master of conveying emotion. At some parts of the book, one is forced to be depressed, and share the melancholy with the characters in the book. The arrow of anger that Dantes must feel toward his enemies is shot from the pages and into one's heart. And the happiness when Dantes is going to be married and at other joyous occations is almost an aroma in the air, rising from the pages of the book.Unfortunately, this book does, like every book ever written, has some aspects to be criticized. First and foremost, the length: 1074 pages is quite a bit for the average reader! Even the abridged version is 500-something pages. And there are also French sayings, anecdotes, and words that you must look at the footnotes to understand. Of course, in the abridged edition, it doesn't even have footnotes. But overall, this book is an enjoyable book, and unlike some other books written by amateurs, this book makes you think about the very nature of mankind."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Worth all the 1,000 over pages.

I had read it when I was ten years old. I'm still in love with it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas was considered in his time to be the foremost adventure novelist. What he created in The Count of Monte Cristo is so much more. The story chronicles the journey of Edmund Dantes, a young and hopelessly naive sailor as he matures into the worldy and cynical Count bent on revenge. Had Dumas ended there, he would have written a stupendous and sweeping saga of adventure and drama. The greater relevence of the story is in its moral telling: Edmund Dantes regains his humanity and learns to live again. Here is a story of spiritual redemption, told against the backdrop of post-Napoleanistic France. It is a tale of love, of loss, of revenge, and of the rekindling of the heart. While the unabridged story is long, it is best enjoyed while seated in front of a fire, with a warm beverage in hand. Few narratives are as satisfying to the soul as this one is."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have never been enthralled with anything like I was with this piece of perfection... oh boy, now I don't want to read anything else - just the Count.

If you want to read Alexandre Dumas's complete masterpiece, find yourself another edition."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is definitely a must-read. One can be daunted by the length of this specific translation and the sheer thickness of the paperback, but do not be faint-hearted! It is worth the wait and effort.The story is loosely based on a true account, but this fact doesn't take away from Dumas' genius. He not only reveals to us the eccentricities and fashionable trends of the period, but also uses the protagonist to criticize the obvious faults of the upper class Parisian society. The novel touches on the defects of the society at large, ranging from the lack of accountability in the \\"justice\\" system, which condemns him to lifelong imprisonment through trickery and cover-up, to the philandering and adultery, which are rampant and almost EXPECTED among the rich. Edmond Dantes (the Count) is an especially useful tool for Dumas' purposes, because he leads a life of many facades. At one turn, the Count seems to fit right into the gossiping and brokering of influence, but in his private moments he despises and holds those around him in contempt. And with good reason, for most of those folks are his enemies.Like Victor Hugo and his Jean Valjean, Dumas creates a protagonist who is marred by society and abused to the point of no return. The grace (or miracle) of God provides the escape from that point, and both characters use their faith to build new lives. But we see in Edmond Dantes a very different path taken, compared to Jean Valjean. Dantes and Valjean use their faith to opposite ends, one toward revenge and the latter toward reform.The greatest challenge in this book is to go along with Dantes on his quest to destroy his enemies. Edmond Dantes firmly believes God gave him a divine purpose, to bring justice and judgment, and to execute vengeance as the instrument of God. His life after discovering Abbe Faria's fortune is wholly dedicated to this goal. He is a man obsessed, to the point of losing his humanity, and in danger of destroying himself in the process. Dantes does go through at least two situations where he doubts himself, but does not relent until he goes too far; his actions lead to deaths of those who are not his enemies, and he realizes his hubris. Near the end, he is able to forgive his last-remaining enemy; in addition, he becomes a blessing to his friends Maximilien and Valentine. For a man whose entire life has been dedicated to hatred and anger, Dantes is finally able to find hope and love, again. This book is certainly about the fascinating details of vengeance, but ultimately it is about the redemption of one man, Edmond Dantes, and the realization that without mercy, love, and humility, justice cannot be meted out.Finally Dumas includes relevant historical context (such as the return of Napoleon which provides the backdrop), as well as filling out the personal history of some of the characters. This adds much to the story, literally and figuratively. One can appreciate the intricacies of family history and the flashback-style stories, and we applaud Dumas for his brilliance and hard work, but the overabundance of names and historical references can be tiresome at points. It is also slightly annoying to be constantly flipping back to the Notes section in order to find out the significance of certain Italian phrases, when it might be better served to put those references in the footnotes.Overall, this book is highly recommended! I greatly enjoyed it, cover to cover. As great novels usually are, this work is intended not only to entertain, but it also raises questions of justice, faith, and divine purpose. It achieves a balance of social criticism peppered with nostalgic and chivalric romance, perhaps the reason why this book is one of the beloved classics."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I keep hearing that The Count of Monte Cristo is a great swashbuckling book of vengeance. I keep wondering if same said \\"readers\\" actually read the book. Au contraire, Dumas' serialized story that we now receive in a 1200+ page novel is actually an intricate waltz of a character study, that when read with patience and expectation almost feels as if the reader has been supernaturally imbued with the wisdom and experience of the 24 years that the novel covers.The story opens with an innocent Edmond Dantes who is brutally betrayed by those who abuse their positions, and it continues with ever increasing progression of Dantes' understanding: his understanding of suffering, of evil; his understanding of wisdom from the dear Abbe; his understanding of the abuse of position that originated his personal hell, his understanding of others' human natures, both good and evil; and finally, his understanding of his own self. After multiple sub-plots that orbit the Count and illuminate both the characters that revolve around him, as well as himself, Dumas wraps up the novel with a fitting and satisfactory conclusion that flirts with the philosophical.The novel's pace more than makes up for its daunting length-there are rarely slow moments. If it seems like Dumas is about to do something predictable, keep reading: his follow-up is always unexpected. I can only criticize Dumas for trivial concerns, which I won't get into here, but his handling of the plot is beyond reproach.What sticks beyond the reading itself, however, is the study of people that Dumas puts forward, replete with a sweeping spiritual hypothesis on the nature of humanity itself that can only be proposed using the method of the adage, \\"show, don't tell.\\" There are so many characters that we get to know well, who stay with us, reinforcing Dumas' observations. From the evil, such as Fernand and Danglars, to the pathetic, like Caderousse, to the unexpected--in Nortier, Albert, Eugenie--and even the angelic, Morrel, Haydee, the Abbe, we see a great slice of humanity parade before us in the vivid pages. And every one of them is somehow kindled by Dantes, the sparkling youth, then the supernatural catalyst and demigod, and finally, simply and totally, the man, soul bared and naked before his God. It is a breathtaking epic far deeper than the adolescent revenge romp that its literary reputation has been reduced to.Robin Buss' translation, notes and introduction are essential and very well done, worthy of the work itself, and sure to be the preeminent English version for a very long time. In short, this is not one of those books that you check out from the library and return: this is a work to be bought in hardback, to be read, re-read, and passed down."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Nowhere in the description of this item or in the book itself does it mention that this is an abridged book with a number of plot resolving sections omitted.

Nowhere on the book does it say it's abridged, but it is. It is approximately 600 pages long, while the original is over 1300 pages --- that is some SERIOUS EDITING.There are some pretty important words in the half they ripped out; including some major developments for specific characters -- a murder, a family leaving one of the targets of the Count's wrath, etc.This is a GREAT story, just not this edition."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read an abridgement of Count of Monte Cristo several years ago and enjoyed it immensely but wondered what I had missed. Later after I discovered Everyman's beautiful editions I searched their titles on their website and found they had nothing by Dumas. I wrote them a letter suggesting that they publish some.Apparently, enough people wrote in: They published what I feel to be his best novel. As soon as I was aware of it I obtained one of my own. As I expected the unabridged version was far better.Another reviewer said that the translation in this edition was one of the worst. I didn't notice it if it was. The story flowed and held my interest so that I could not put it down for the last third. It's definitely one I will go back and read again.The Everyman's edition is just beautiful with creamy paper, cloth cover and sewn binding. I carried it around with me in the few days it took me to read it.If you buy it from Amazon you will save a significant chunk of change. It's much spendier in the bookstores.I do hope they will publish more Dumas."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Listening to these 37 CDs seemed like a daunting task at first but once I started this enthralling story - I couldn't get enough. Actually, I loved the story so much that I listened to these CDs whenever I was in the car and read the bookThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)at all other times, by picking up where I left off with the CDs. I was able to finish the story in about a week by doing it this way, which is really something, since I had never read or listened to a book of this length before. The translations are a bit different between these CDs and the aforementioned version of the book translated by Robin Buss, but they are similar enough that it was not hard to go from CD to book and back. The man who voices this book is simply amazing. His accents, voice modulation, and pacing are all top notch and this kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story. I would highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to really get to know this story. Be warned though, its about 40 hours long...but worth every second!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Although I have not read any other translations of The Count of Monte Cristo, I can attest that the Modern Library Classics version is one that was scripted so beautifully that I had to reread many passages twice: once for the content and a second time for how the words just flow into your mind. When I checked this book out from the library, I was completely engrossed. Upon returning it, I ventured to bookstores to find the same exact version. Many different books had another translation (I read the same passage which was vividly engraved in my memory from the first read through!) and found that other translations do not pack the same emotional energy this version has.Enough said about the translation. This book is a sheer masterpiece. I may go on to read other of Dumas's works, such as the Three Musketeers 5 book series, but upon reading varied reviews, about half of the 3000 pages in that series is a huge miss. I'm still unsure if I want to begin the series. On the other hand, the Count of Monte Cristo has no boring passages whatsoever. Every page, every paragraph, every sentence was poetry to feed the mind. Everything flowed smoothly.The romance, drama, REVENGE, religion, suspense... everything you wanted is in this book. Some pages left me heartbroken, others made me rejoice. It is truly something that can be read again and again and you will find something new each time. This is by far the longest book I have read, and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. Sometimes you empathize with Edmond, at other times you question his actions. But overall, this book just packs so much into one. Just leave some time to read it all the way in one go. To leave it to finish it later will only make you confused when you pick it up again because there is just so many key characters in the novel."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I thought I liked the movie, until I read the book. Now I realize the movie was pathetic, and that the filmmakers could not have been more wrong when they decided to make it a \\"happily ever after\\" kind of movie. The book ends on somewhat of a high note, and certainly gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, but isn't exactly a feel-good book. But it's so much better that way, and more realistic. It left me feeling staggered.Another thing about the movie: it left out some of the best characters. Where was Haydee, Monte Cristo's slave and adopted daughter? Or Valentine and Maximilian, probably the sweetest couple in the book? I know the movie would have been more complicated if they were included, but come on.But enough about the movie. I can certainly see why this book is a classic. It's deeply moving, surprisingly easy to read for an old book, and has one of the most amazing fictional characters of all time in it: Monte Cristo himself. Edmond Dantes is the character every author wishes they could create. What else can I say? It's a thick one, but give this book a chance."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas, author of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and the &quot;Man In the Iron Mask&quot;, has given the literary world the adventure novel, forever bringing it to the level of the classic. The Count of Monte Cristo is mainly a story of revenge. The Romanticism in which the novel is characterized and the Napoleonic France for the setting, sets the mood for this nearly psychologically thrilling story that only a great French master like Dumas could create. Edmund Dantes, wrongly accussed of a crime he did not commit, taken to a prison of which there is no escape by his enemies, his only love taken by his best friend, spends years of suffering and harboring hatred in a rotting prison cell. But he also plans his revenge, how he methodically desires to bring upon the fateful end to his enemies and win back his love. He successfully manages to escape from prison and discovers a vast fortune. Assuming the identity of the Count of Monte Cristo, he extracts his revenge. What moral theme does Dumas really want to convey ? In the end, we discover how unfulfilled and how miserable our hero is, even when he has had the satisfaction of punishing his enemies. Dumas should be credited for such a marvelous work. He writes in the highest French Romantic fashion, and should be hailed with as much praise as Gustav Flaubert. The Three Musketeers, the immortal adventure story that made him famous, has been made into numerous films, and even The Count of Monte Cristo has had a terrific film version starring Will Chamberlain. A new release of the novel is set for January 25th of this year. Dumas may have died penniless, and he may not have been considered an excellent voice of the romantic age, but it is 2001 and we are still enthralled with the tales of intrigue, suspense, romance and adventure that this wonderful French writer conceived. Viva Dumas! Five stars for his terrific revenge story the Count of Monte Cristo"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The only way to get through a monster of a book like this is if the author grabs you by the collar on page one and doesn't let you go.

Otherwise you would have no chance of reaching the end.For the last several hundred pages I withdrew from the world into my den, emerging occasionally for a bowl of gruel and crust of bread before returning to the chore of finishing...this...leviathan!I recently finished A Tale of Two Cities, which though a classic in its own right of course pales by comparison to this in terms of complexity and grandeur. Though shorter, it took longer to get through than the Count. Not in number of hours, but in number of weeks. Once hooked you keep going back to the Count to get through another hundred pages.Buy it, read it, live it! But let your friends and family know you won't be around for a while."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The first week, I'm 200 pages in. Two weeks later, I'm 500 pages in. Three weeks after that, I'm 900 pages in. Another three weeks, I'm 1300 pages in. Another week, I'm 1400 pages in, and it still hasn't ended. It will go on forever. It's like a round trip from North Carolina to Amsterdam (I've never been to Amsterdam, but I'm sure it's a long trip).This is a huge book. Fifteen hundred pages: that's huge. I thought David Copperfield and The Brothers Karamazov were tomes. They're not. They're toddlers. They're babies in the shadow of Cristo. But you know something, it's a heck of a story. With the incredible girth of the book, Dumas still has the talent to keep you immersed in it. There are some 200 page books that can't hold my attention. This is why I rated it 5 stars. If you are going to write a LONG book, you better be a good storyteller who can make the reader's investment and commitment worthwhile.I originally bought the abridged version of Cristo, read it and enjoyed it. Then I found out about all of the stuff that was cut out. Entire storylines about the main characters totally discarded. So I bought the Modern Library Classics version. I guess I'll eventually have to do the same for Les Miserables.Regarding the actual plot, I don't like the Count. I like Edmond Dantes, but not his altar ego. He's evil. I know many fans may not agree with that assessment, but it's the truth. The Count of Monte Cristo has to abandon every ounce of decency and morality to exact his revenge. And is it just me or does the most despicable nemesis of Dantes get a much lighter punishment than the others? I mean, Danglars orchestrated the entire plan to bring down Edmond, yet Dumas has him redeemed and forgiven.The story is entertaining and narratively and morally complex. It's worth your time, even if that time will clock in at 2 minutes before eternity."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the most popular adventure novels ever written. Its story of the wrongly imprisoned Edmond Dantes who after four years in Chateau D'If prison where he is schooled in the wisdom of life by Abba Morio, makes the plunge into the ocean to escape and rebirth. He takes the instruction given him by Abba Moria and goes and finds the Renaissance treasure that makes him rich. Then as the Count of Monte Cristo he is able to exact revenge on those who have wrongly imprisoned him. He does so with great skill but when his actions lead to a great injustice he somehow understands the limitations of what he has done. His famous confessional words are.: \\"Tell the angel who will watch over your life to pray now and then for a man who, like Satan, believed himself for an instant to be equal to God, but who realized in all humility that supreme power and wisdom are in the hands of God alone.\\""},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"When I was in fourth grade I read an abridged version of the count of monte cristo, and I loved the story. I was determined to read the original when I was older. Now after finishing my junior year in high school, I have finished the full version. Once again, I was thrilled with the story. Though the length of the novel may appear daunting, don't let this stop you from reading the book. This truly is one of the best books I've ever read, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Compelling Description of Human Nature and MotiveThere is really no way to accurately review The Count of Monte Cristo. A simple review of its plot would be unfair to the genius of Dumas and to the profound insights into human nature and motivation that this book contains. Likewise, to approach this book merely for its psychological and anthropological value would be to ignore the imaginative flights of fancy and vistas for the mind's eye that this tome affords. Similarly, to approach The Count of Monte Cristo merely as a fable or a fairy tale is to forget that it is an accurate historical novel portraying the Franco-European mindset, as well as a crystal-clear exposition of the many social issues, conventions, and commonly-held fancies that characterized France throughout the post-Napoleonic era. However, for purely literary purposes, and due to constraints of space and time, a brief sketch of Dumas' masterpiece will have to suffice. Ideally, however, you will stop reading right here and get your hands on the book, thus skirting my woefully inadequate attempt to review this masterpiece fairly and coherently.Dumas' narrative follows the story of a virtuous young man struggling to come of age and find his place. However, in the classic battle of good versus evil, he is imprisoned unfairly and robbed of all that was dear to him. Eventually, he comes into great wealth and knowledge, escapes from captivity, and single-mindedly sets about to be the instrument of Divine vengeance on those who had previously denied him life and love. Along the way, he re-learns the value of friendship, and, having seen justice brought upon his enemies, finds unexpected love in an ending that is a triumphant, crescendoing testimony to the indomitable quality of the human spirit - and the mercy of God.Throughout this tale, Dumas teaches us of forgiveness, of love, of anger and hate, and reaches out to the reader with an intensity that can only come from a spirit that itself drank deeply of such emotions. Indeed, the story of Edmond Dantes - from the lowly but principled pauper to the rash, vengeful yet popular prince - smacks at times of Dumas' own rise from obscurity as an unknown mulatto to the powerful and respected literary force that he became.Granted, there are times when Dumas' heroes - like all heroes - take on superhuman qualities. However, they are not the indestructible supermen that mar much of today's literature. Instead, they are all too human - flawed sufficiently that their exploits are believable, and human enough that the reader often finds himself dialoguing with them, arguing for or against their intents and actions. In this way, it is the enduring human quality of the book - the ability for us to reach out across the better part of two centuries and dialogue freely and coherently with them, and to recognize the players and actors as fellow humans above all else - that makes it so compelling. Likewise, it is that essence of humanness that stands as the greatest tribute to Dumas.An insightful, powerful, fast-paced, and moving read, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those books that does not end when the last page is turned and the book closed. Its imaginative power transcends the written page with timeless force, calling us to a greater, more vivid plane of existence and self-expression.Now get the book!- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dantes is a young sailor about to marry the daughter of the shipping company's owner. Two rascals, one for pure envy and the other because he also loves the girl, accuse him falsely of political conspiracy. The judge, a coward named Villefort, sends him to prison, trying to cover up on his father, who really is a conspirator. Edmond stays 14 years at the prison-island of If. During that time, he gets in contact with the Abbe Faria, a wise churchman who converts him into an educated man and, by listening to Edmond's story, discovers the treason and the gulity. Shortly before dying, Faria tells Edmonmd where to find an enormous treasure. When he dies, Edmond substitutes for him in the body-bag. The guards throw the bag to the sea and Edmond rips it open with a knife, goes to Montecristo and yes, the treasure is there. For ten years, he travels the world, becomes an enigmatic and cultivated man, and then sets to his goal in life: take revenge on those who damaged him, and reward the people who were good to him. And he does it in the grandest style you can imagine. The reader is pleased at the revenge and reward Montecristo brings on all the people he knew. The scenes are lush, brilliant, luxurious. Memorable ones are: the Venice carnival, where he meets the children of some of his enemies, and his entrance into the Paris jet-set. Unlike some reviewers, I don't complain about the length; if anything, I would have liked more adventures. It is hard to imagine a more colorful and brilliant novel, with a better plot and characters."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"&quot;Dantes stood up and looked in the direction the boat was moving. Several hundred yards ahead rose the steep black rock on which stood the somber Chateau d'If. The unexpected appearance of this dreaded prison, with its ceturies-old tradition of terror, produced the same effect on Dantes as the sight of the gallows on a man condemned to death&quot; (26). Just imagine the fear and loneliness that Edmond Dantes was experiencing as he looked up and realized that for no reason at all, he was condemned to a notorious prison. What would it feel like to know you may never see the people you love most again? How great would the frustration be of not knowing why you were being punished? The Napoleonic Era, an almost frightening time period to be living in, is the time in which this magnificent novel takes place. At any moment an innocent person could be convicted of a crime they did not commit and be thrown into a prison never to be seen or heard of again. Edmond Dantes, a youthful and happy man whom is soon to be married and live out a wonderful life, suddenly has his dreams of raising a family and being captain of a ship cut short by three selfish men. An oath of vengence is made on these evil men and a story of this vengence is told through such words that it seems almost as if Alexandre Dumas had experienced these events and thoughts in his own life. The Count of Monte Cristo is a novel which is so powerful, heartbreaking, and satisfying all at the same time that anyone who makes the decision to read it will certainly be changed by the time the fulfilling conclusion comes. The characters, especially Edmond Dantes who plays many different roles in the novel, are some that the reader will almost feel they could relate to or else despise in such a way that you wish you could be inside the novel to take your own revenge on them. Many of the characters, although living 200 years earlier than us, are very easy to relate to. Mercedes, who is so in love but is faced with a situation where she could either lay down and die or try and ease her loneliness, chooses the latter. Many people would probably do the same thing in this type of a situation and therefore makes this novel easy and enjoyable to read. Alexandre Dumas, as well as doing many other things, uses a very simple yet very impacting theme throughout his novel. Most everyone who reads this book has probably heard the saying, &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;. This one old sayng can pretty much sum this entire novel. It lets people appreciate the good and helpful things we are able to do for others instead of wasting our life with hatred and selfishness. Many people may object to reading this novel on the basis that it looks too long and would be too time consuming to read. If only everyone would give this book a chance they would see that this book is really a very good length in order to fully enjoy and feel the action and suspense that one should feel when reading a good book. Never in this novel is there a dull or boring moment, instead every word and sentece used is to keep the readers attention and keep them wanting more and more. From beginning to end The Count of Monte Cristo is a non-stop page-turner. If only Alexandre Dumas knew now what an extremely well constructed and entertaining novel he wrote. By the way he speeds up and slows down time he is able to focus his book on the parts that are important for the reader to know. The message that Dumas chose to get across in this novel is very important. Everyone should read this novel if not for the entertainment value then for the underlying themes of the novel. Everyone must take a chance and see what this wonderful novel has to offer."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I must say, after seeing that the length reached nearly 1500 pages, I was a little concerned about the content, however, I found this book to be the best book I have read. I recommend it, unabridged, to everyone and anyone. The story draws up to a great climax, and doesn't bore you at all. At certain points in the book the number of characters made me loose track of some people, but they appeared later and were quite obviously presented to me. The plot is great, story is great, everything about it is great. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Assigned the book as a termpaper project, I dreaded the thought of having to read this 1400 page monster. But as soon as I began read this book I was quite pleased with the plot. I admired Dumas' ability to patiently draw out the story as to build mounds and mounds of suspense. How he played out the revenge of the Count is the most interesting and compelling part of the story. What an amazing book!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is my gold standard for comparing to other books. I grade movies and books by how much I think about them or their characters after the fact. I find myself coming back to certain scenes in this book often even though it has been over a year since I read it. Adventure, suspense, a touch of romance and history all make it a comprehensive event. I found myself looking up locations on Google Earth because they were described in such vivid deatil I wanted to see where they were. Without giving too much away - \\"Revenge is sweet\\"."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This might be my favorite book of all time. One confession I have is that I had to read it a second time to fully appreciate some of the subtle nuances of the story. The first time I listened to the book I sometimes got confused about who was who.John Lee did an amazing job at naaration. In no way did his reading get in the way of the story.For those that have not read classical literature from this time period you are in for a treat. The dialogue is AMAZING. I am convinced that we have forgotten how to fully use spoken words in our everyday communication. Alexandre Dumas is a master of communication and I found myself thinking that I must remember some phrase or other that he uses.The story is no less captivating. The intricate web of diverging and converging plot lines kept me fully engaged as Dantes fortunes rose, fell, and rose again.For those that have not read The Count of Monte Cristo and are not afraid of a longer book you are in for a treat. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a huge book at around 1500 pages. It is about the size of War and Peace but a much faster-paced read. It helps to print out a list of the characters as there are many.Though the term Magic Realism wasn't coined until around 1925, the Count of Monte Cristo easily fits into this genre. Hope, justice, revenge, mercy and forgiveness are themes in this excellent novel.I don't think I can write a meaningful review of a novel this long. It is huge in scope and a real nail-biter.Don't be intimidated by the size. It is well worth the effort. Of the 50 novels that I have read this year, this is the best."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Make sure you understand the number of pages in this book. Huge! A great book that shames the movie adaptions. Excellent translation to English. Funny to find out that Dumas was payed by the line, so it can be a little long winded at times."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books of all time. It is a long book - let's admit that right up front. I mean weight-lifting heavy and need a month to leisurely read long. It is totally worth it.Author Dumas starts with a young, thriving protagonist who is a little wide-eyed innocent for my personal taste. Stay with it, things change big time. The count is well drawn and full of cunning, driven by revenge, grounded in a sense of his place in justice and frankly someone I would love to be...well, I would want only the count part of his life. His fate was forged by the worst of betrayals and self-centered ambition of those who could have helped him.I'll never meet a woman named Mercedes without thinking of young Edmund Dante's love. I am looking forward to meeting someone named Haidee. Curious? Read the book and you'll understand why.Actually you should read the book because you will enjoy it immensely. It is a great way to spend some quality time with a count."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a wonderful book.I second the comments of J. Cooper.As mentioned in Cooper's review, there are two versions, the abridged and the unabridged. I have read both, and I strongly recommend the unabridged. It is long (Dumas was writing a serial for a magazine), but worth it. The time saved in the abridged version is paid for with confusion: People pop up and events happen without explanation. In addition, the secondary characters are fleshed out and made much more interesting/enjoyable in the longer one.The Buss translation is also very nice, particularly in comparison to the old, out-of-copyright, standard version. The notes are good, without being obtrusive, in explaining both current events, e.g., the July Revolution, and current literary allusions.In re-reading the book in this version, what struck me was how religious, in a sense, it is. The characters, and presumably the author, are people who believe in a God who moves in mysterious ways. The book is like a little time machine that takes you back to a way of thinking in mid-19th century France. Although the language is a bit florid (everyone seems to \\"shudder\\"), the book, particularly in this version, is well worth the time.I read the book in the Kindle version, which, given the book's size, is especially convenient. The links to the notes work well, as does the Table of Contents."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"brilliant, this book written by alexandre dumas is a masterpiece.. do not let the length deter you as my only regret is not having read this book sooner. thank you alexandre dumas for these wonderful characters."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time. I first read it about 13 years ago and forgot some of the details. Since I love this book so much and forgot some of the details, I decided to read it again. I have read many classic and modern novels and this is my favorite. The free Kindle version is abridged and a lot of the free and purchased copies out there are. I started reading the free Kindle version and noticed I got to 4% complete pretty fast. This surprised me, as I remembered it being a very long book. I also felt like some intricacies were being left out. I then compared it to my paperback copy of this very edition (Penguin Classics, translated by Robin Buss), that I had read before, and noticed the free Kindle version to be abridged. A lot of the finer details are cut out of the abridged version. The Project Gutenberg version is abridged too.Some people may prefer the abridged version. It is shorter and the main plot is still intact. I am sure it is still entertaining and it will take less time to read. Others, like me, prefer to read the unabridged version for all the details, like the author intended. Some adult themes and subplots are missing in the abridged version. The book is a masterpiece and altering it is destroying a piece of art. At least you have a choice to which version you would rather read. I just want to inform you to be aware that many versions are abridged and not appropriately labeled so. The unabridged version is over 1,000 pages, small print. The Penguin Classics version, translated by Robin Buss, is the unabridged version.The plot involves a young and poor man, Edmond Dantes, who recently gets news of a big career promotion and promptly makes plans to marry a young woman he is infatuated with. She is infatuated with him too. Some jealous acquaintances scheme to ruin his recently found success, because doing so means success for them, instead. The scheming results in Edmond Dantes being imprisoned for many years and his love, thinking him dead, marries one of the scheming acquaintances. The other schemers profit by his misfortune too.Dantes escapes from prison, after many years, and comes upon a great fortune. The fortune makes him extremely wealthy. He is not very happy though and is not willing to just move on and live his live in lavish comfort. He wants revenge! It is the only thing he cares about. He uses his fortune and also a new well-rounded education to plot and execute revenge, methodically. Will vengeance ultimately be worth it or not? Will it finally make him happy? Read this book and find out!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is about patience - not just in the sense of waiting but in the sense of tolerating the most awful life circumstances one could imagine upon oneself, until they ultimately make way for better times that are made sweeter by perspective. Although the book itself may be an exercise in patience (it is very long!) it is very much worth reading, entertaining throughout, and divided into \\"digestibly\\" sized chapters. Indeed, a two-hundred-year-old novel that has stood the test of time must be pretty good, right? It is."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. Despite its length, which may scare some people away, if you read this cover to cover I swear you wll not be disappointed! The only reasn I give this our stars is because ther are a few issues regarding thekindle version. This can be sometimes distracting from the otherwise gripping novel!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is, in itself, a fantastic novel. This edition brings the story to English speakers in easily readable language, and given the brilliant simplicity of the words, I'm sure this translation stays true to Dumas's original French masterpiece. There are a few \\"Frenchisms,\\" such as the use of \\"quit\\" instead of \\"leave,\\" or \\"seek for\\" as an awkward substitute for the French \\"look for,\\" but these tiny inconsistencies don't take away from the text at all. I highly recommend this version of The Count of Monte Cristo to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is an epic tale depicting approximately 25 years in the life of Edmond Dantes. The story introduces Edmond as an enterprising sailor, a young man full of promise, and one who appears to have everything in control. Edmond is a bit naive, but honor-bound, which ultimately leads to unwarranted hardships, grief, and despair followed by an unquenchable desire for revenge.The story includes numerous references to God and providence where blessings come down on those that do good, and punishments come down on those that do evil. I agree with these Christian concepts, but I was constantly thinking of Romans 12:19-21 where the Bible states we are not to avenge ourselves because \\"Vengeance is mine, I will repay says the Lord\\". Edmond feels it is his God-given duty to avenge himself by punishing those who plotted against him.I felt the story was a bit unrealistic at times in that things outside of Edmond's control usually worked out just as he planned; however, there were a few surprises. I held back giving this story five stars primarily due to its length and complexity. I understand Dumas wrote this in 18 installments and was paid by the word. I thought this caused the story to drag at times and to include some unbelievable schemes. On the whole, I found this book to be an entertaining adventure!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The title says it all. Go for the unabridged version. Great subplots and digressions that add to the flavor of the story."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read this in high school and it was the best book I have ever read!

UNABRIDGED. I can't emphasize that enough. The story is genius, inspiring, engrossing, phenomenal, entertaining, beautiful & perfect.

I reread The Count every year or two & I never get sick of it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Normally I shy away from really long books. But I remembered that some years ago my son read this in high school, and he thought it was great. I gave it a try, and found it to be fascinating. The language is not prosaic, but thought-provoking, and is best read when there's enough time to savor the author's choice of words."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"My father, Edmond, was named after the Count of Monte Cristo, which his father was reading when he was born in 1914. And so my dad introduced me to this book when I was 13. Alexandre Dumas' epic is a much-treasured book that has sojourned with me over many, many years: I've read all 1200+ pages at least five times (not including the time I mistakenly checked out an abridged version from the library), and own an unabridged copy published in the 1940s. My hardcover copy is in two volumes, heavy and cumbersome to read. Reading it one more time, now on Kindle, has been a delight.This book has it all: love, fear, betrayal, friendship, greed, passion, hatred, remorse, vengeance, death, heartbreak, intrigue, magic, second chances, and includes the drugs and sex as does my hardcover copy. The story of Edmond Dantes' wrongful imprisonment, his suffering, despair, education, ultimate escape from the dungeon of the Chteau d'If, and re-appearance as both the angel of love and mercy, and that of vengeance and death, is the story of humankind in all its permutations. There's no way anyone can read this book and not come face to face with aspects of their own being, for better or worse. I remain in awe of Dumas' imagination and ability to draw you into a world where the full range of human emotion is laid bare and anything, or almost anything, is possible.Those of you who have enjoyed this book might also want to consider The Prince of Foxes and Captain From Castile, both by Samuel Shellabarger, and of course Dumas' The Three Musketeers. I credit Dumas and Shellabarger with helping me break out of the spell that was cast over me by my traditional education and opening my eyes to the truth that things are not the way we're taught they are. Shellabarger in particular helped launch me into a lifetime of inquiry."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I loved this book!

Then almost a decade later I read the book and think it is even better than one of the best movies of all time! The book is very long, though. It's actually like 2 or 3 books as it is over 1300 pages...but very good. The movie only covered about 1/5 of the book. The book has many different plots going on at once so don't put it down for a couple weeks and then come back to it because you may forget some of what is happening. The language is difficult to understand at times (it was translated from French from 1844-45) along with the cultural humour. But keep on going. These parts don't have to be fully understood to get the idea of where the story is going.

They can stand the test of time from 10 years to 100 years beyond, due to their meaningful story lines which everyone can both relate to and have different interpretations of. The Count of Monte Cristo has all these characteristic of a classic story. It is a story of revenge, love, hatred and the second chances in life one may be lucky enough to receive. Even though this story is almost 200 years old it still appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.Edmond Dantes is wrongly accused and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. After spending 14 years in a horrendous prison he miraculously escapes and uses his new fortune given to him by a prison mate to live out his new life of enormous wealth and his quest for revenge. This seeking of revenge captured me along the ride with Edmond Dates' use of wit and internal hatred towards others to seek revenge on those who destroyed his life. It came to my discovery through the Count of Monte Cristo's experiences and actions that people back in 1800's were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, manipulative and vengeful as people can be today in modern times.Alexandre Dumas builds a captivating and rich plot throughout his story which makes the reader wonder what will happen next and what the consequences may be. The theme of love, hatred, happiness, vengeance and forgiveness is something everyone can relate to since they are feelings we have all felt. My negative critique for this book is the fact that it was a struggle to keep all the 40+ characters in order. The French names I am not familiar with as an English speaker, were confusing at times.I found this book intriguing because this story portrays the evil nature of the human spirit while at the same time teaching a lesson in the possibility of Karma and how eventually people will end up paying for their wrongdoings.

This is simply a great book! In my humblest of opinions this is what literature should be. The story touches the themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. But the story doesn't become excessively self righteous, because the whole time your evaluating what you would do if you were the protagonist. This is what great literature can do; make you consider your morals and ethics, so the story is much larger than just a tale. This book is long so be prepared.

Edmund Dantes, framed for a crime he didn't commit goes to an island prison to rot. There he meets an elderly man who quickly becomes his teacher. The man seems to know everything and his lessons transform Dantes into a sophisticated and wiley-intelligent individual.The two plan Dantes escape (I don't want to give away how but it has to do with the old man's death) and when Dantes, ultimately does escape he reinvents himself as a mysterious Count and starts taking revenge on those who framed him.This book made me appreciate the value of learning and how you can make yourself a better person, no matter your station in life, if you take advantage of books and other sources of information available."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I believe this book is excellent, the movie is mediocre compared to the book.

When I first looked at the book I thought over 1200 pages it has to be long and drawn out. But, I was wrong about drawn out. I found the book interesting all the way through. This is one of those story where once you finish it you want to start it over again.I had a couple of problem through out the book. One problem was that the book assumes that the reader is familiar with French culture in the 1800s. The book would slightly mention some current event like the Hundred Days of Napoleon and assume that the reader know about it. Also, the book would use French words for some items or events and assume that the reader knew that they were without explaining them. This was explainable because it was written in the 1800s in French for French readers who lived in the 1800s. It was hard to keep all the characters and their relationships with each other straight. It really became a large problem half way through the book when they introduced 8 new characters all at once. I would suggest writing down the main characters and their relationships with one another when you find out about them. Another problem was that the book would refer to a person with two different names."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is an excellent novel, filled with a multitude of characters, rich locations, and smothered in history. It is a story of injustice and a quest for revenge that will hold your attention for hours.The story in this novel is darker and far more engrossing than any adaptation. If you have seen the film adaptations of this book then some of the character names and general outline of the story will be familiar to you.A young merchant sailor, Edmond Dant&egrave;s is about to achieve prosperity in his life. Unbeknownst to him; his soon to be wife's cousin and a shipmate accuse Dant&eacute;s of being a supporter of Napol&eacute;on I, because of a package and a letter Dant&eacute;s must deliver. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, assumes the duty of investigating the matter. Upon discovering that the letter was to be delivered to his father, he covers up the matter and exiles Dant&eacute;s to the Chteau d'If. It is here where Dant&eacute;s learns an education and the whereabouts of a fortune, which will help him, exact his revenge once he escapes.I'll save the rest of the story for you to read.Trust me you will not be disappointed, maybe you'll even give a little smirk as Dant&eacute;s confronts the robbers of his life."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This story is a great revenge tale that's interesting enough to get away with being longer than the Great Wall of China.

The intrigue and twists are exceptional. A classic which should be a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I friend of mine recommended this book and told me it was his favorite book of all time. He also said to make sure you get the unabridged version. (It is over 1400 pages long, but after the first 300-400 pages you will be glad it is so long.) Not only does this book have incredible insight into the human condition, it is also a very exciting tale of escape and revenge as well as a great \\"trip\\" to Europe. You will be amoung \\"bandits\\" in the ruins of Rome, high society Europe during Carnival, Parisian society as well as sea faring trips with smugglers through coastal Spain and Italy."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"How does one review a classic? Especially one so noteworthy as to have demanded the creation of 11 or more film variations, numerous adaptations, and even television series? I long avoided reading this novel due mainly to it's daunting size, and the fear that it's translation would cause the reader more work than I was willing to put into it. However my burning desire to know the true tale of Edmond Dantes overruled my hesitation.The story, for those of you who are unfamiliar, follows Edmond Dantes in his wrongful imprisonment at the hands of his friends, his 14 years in the Chateau D'If, his escape and rebirth as a self proclaimed hand of vengeance against those who had wronged him. If you have only seen the movies, the book, particularly the ending, is far different than what Hollywood has created. There are no dramatic duels, no massive swordfights with brigands, and not everyone who we believe should, lives happily ever after. This is instead a slow but genius work of Dantes methodically stripping away all that his enemies held dear to them, at whatever cost. None die by his hand, but are rather destroyed by his influence, and their own evil choices come back to haunt them.The story itself is genius, interesting and very fun. The writing, particularly the translation that I read, is an often difficult and sometimes tedious work that one may need a notebook to keep straight. The cast of characters is very large and they are often referred to by different names, making it a bit more difficult to keep track of who is who without some sort of note taking. I was not smart enough to take notes, and thus had to spend quite a bit of time searching my brain to make sure I was thinking of the correct person as I read, particularly with some of the more minor story lines and the characters that weaved in and out of the story with multiple chapters between their appearances. Also, this book will probably be disappointing to those who are interested in the action that the movies provided. The Count of Monte Cristo, does not come in with guns blazing, but rather plays a very well thought out and disturbing game of mental chess against his opponents. As readers we hope for their downfall, but also wonder how far the Count will go... his years of imprisonment have left him hardened and disturbingly without remorse at the use of innocents to gain his vengeance. As he plays his pieces we wonder just who will be sacrificed, and who will have the chance to live happily ever after in this dark world of Dumas.Readers of more modern novels may have trouble with this book because of the sheer volume of concurrent story lines, all of which are necessary for understanding the strings being pulled by the Count. But to remember the tale of the lovers, the orphan, the bandit, the banker, the ship builder, the assassin, the count, the princess, the steward, the military man, the lawyer, the cheating husband and wife, the lost love, the musician, the buried baby, the dying father, the paralyzed grandfather, the murderess, the thief, the countess, the emperor and all of their relations, can be quite a daunting task for any reader. Still each of these stories could be a book of their own, keeping the reader quite entertained, but Dumas has managed to weave them all together into one, brilliant and shining tale... if you can keep them straight through the end.What surprised me most was the ending of this story. It was not what I wanted, or hoped for. True I loved Haidee, and wanted nothing but her happiness... but many seemed to be left in suffering that did not deserve the fate that they were bound to. I will not elaborate for fear of spoiling the ending... but this does not end on a Hollywood, \\"they all ride off into the sunset\\" ending. Perhaps the meaning of the story is not all about revenge, but rather what damage the hunt for vengeance can bring to not just those who have wronged you, but to all those that surround you. The downfall of selfishness; be it falsely imprisoning someone to gain what you may, to the selfishness of vengeance... there is so much meaning in this book, I can see why it is so often \\"required reading.\\" Though I highly recommend this book, I would advise you attempt to read it with others either in a class or a reading group so that you can discuss all of the rich meaning behind Dumas's words."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Having never read The Count of Monte Cristo and only faintly recalling a movie of some years ago, I was prepared for a swashbuckling epic of swordplay and derring-do. My expectations were entirely inadequate. The Count of Monte Cristo is rather a tale of revenge through the artifice of intrigue and cold calculation. Dumas creates a broken man, betrayed by a trio of duplicitous schemers, and devotes the bulk of the book to the complex machinations employed in retaliation.The phrase \\"intricately detailed\\" does not begin to describe the plots and sub-plots which carry this classic forward. Like all novels of its period, the author relies on what the modern-day reader would consider implausible convenience. This doesn't detract from its worth. To create such a tightly-laced weave, some liberties must be granted. The reader gladly forgives Messr. Dumas.On par with The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, and the works of James Fenimore Cooper, The Count of Monte Cristo is wonderfully thick and magisterially constructed. Set primarily among the preening social elite of post-Napoleanic Paris, yet ranging from Rome to Normandy, it is a 5-star reading experience."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I bought this book for one of my children for a summer reading project.

Utterly fun! Go for the unabridged version!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"i thought this was a great book because i've never read the origanal but it was about 700 pages shorter DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The words \\"bestest\\" and \\"awesomest\\" should be added to the next edition of Webster's since nothing else can describe Dumas's \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" When it comes to plot suspense and valuable moral lessons, Dumas has it all. Imbuing it with a rich and captive plot, Dumas enriches his masterpiece with themes of love, hate, vengeance, and forgiveness--all part of our quotidian lives.Although the original version stretches over 1200 pages, the abridged version with its 600 pages is just as enticing but more complex at few scenes where some characters appear suddenly.A background of the author's era is essential in understanding the setting and beginnings of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" It was during this era that French royalties exiled Napoleon Bonaparte, the hailed French hero, to the Mediterranean island of Elba, where Edmond Dantes, the protagonist, finds him. It is the letter containing Napoleon's secret plans of retaliating against the French nobility that partially causes Dantes's imprisonment. This political reason, however, is not the main reason.Though mostly direct and clear, Dumas's style varies to a more philosophical one when discussing human nature, which he does often towards the end. Edmond Dantes, as mentioned above, is the young and well-off protagonist, ready to become the captain of his ship and get married. With a big heart and somewhat ignorant soul, Dantes falls into the farce those closest to him had set up. In the beginning chapters, the ready already sees themes of love, hatred, and jealousy.Returning after a long time under the name of Count of Monte Cristo, Dantes begins executing his plans of revenge against those who destroyed him and recompense those who helped him. What truly makes this book such a remarkable one is the beauty and perfection with which the Golden Rule (\\"Do unto others what you with done unto you\\") is applied throughout the development of the plot.With abundant characters that differ in personality and beliefs, every reader is sure to find his/her own reflection taking part of the story's advancement.Overall, this book is worthwhile to read. I assure you that you will not be disappointed but you will enjoy every chapter of it. It is no wonder that it is hailed as \\"one of the greatest classics.\\""},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just recently revisited this brilliant novel and recalled all the reasons it's one of my all-time favorites! It's a lengthy book but you hardly even notice with the way it keeps you hooked! Dumas originally wrote this as a serial in a publication over the course of a couple years so he kept his segments packed with plenty of excitement that keeps you wanting more. You don't need to wait for it to pick up like with most longer books-- you know right away that this is a great story!Edmond Dantes, nineteen years old, about to be made captain of the Pharaon, and just ready to celebrate his marriage to a young girl he is very much in love with has his liberty snatched from him and spends the next fourteen years locked in a dark prison cell, falsely accused. When he finally escapes, he finds his father dead, his fiance married to one of the very men responsible for his imprisonment, and the other guilty parties wealthy and respected. But a vast treasure bequeathed to Edmond by the Abbe engenders the Count of Monte Cristo, a man hellbent on being His hand of justice.

Many of the passages are inspiring, and on a whole, it flows beautifully.This took me a very long time to read because of it's length, but I was able continue with ease every time I picked it up.

Yes once you move on further into the book where his revange is already in motion he seems like a very mean person. I was fooled by it also, but he was in the forsaken jail for 14 years. You can't get out the same person you went in. But once he already avanges them he actualy forgives them. He saves valentine for maximilian and he even feels sorry for the revange on vielfort.

Not possessing the knowledge that the unabridged novel is over a thousand pages long, I assumed I had the entire book in my collection. Having finally cleared my schedule so that I could fully concentrate on Alexandre Dumas's classic about vengeance gone wild, I was horrified by what I was reading. Halfway into the book I took the trouble to look at the title page, and then the inherent weaknesses of the book were quickly explained; I was reading the Borders Classics Abridged Edition. Suddenly all the plot inconsistencies, timeline malfunctions, gaping holes in the story--along with all the mundane, trite, and nauseating melodramatic dialogue--made perfect sense. The Borders Abridged is awful, and, although I doubt I will ever try to tackle the unabridged edition, in my opinion does Dumas's classic not one iota of justice.I do hope the original tale is not as myopically presented--with each major character engaging in a monotonous pity party--as the abridged edition I suffered through. Protagonist Edmond Dantes comes across as cruel and reprehensible; the characters that conspired to send an innocent man to prison are demonstrably shallow and superficial. Hosts of other characters such as Haydee, Madame Danglars, Madame de Villefort, Debray, ad nauseum, are never fully vetted or explained. The only benefit from enduring this particular abridged edition is my determination, upon the purchase of another classic, to make darned sure I'm buying the unabridged version. Books, especially good books, are meant to be enjoyed as they originally were written--not hacked to nonsensical pieces for the sake of brevity. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO deserves better.--D.

Needless to say, his enemies have forgotten him, but he has not forgotten them.The way he uses his vast wealth to utterly destroy the lives and families of his enemies is simply amazing. For those interested in Paris, the orient, scandals, murder and all-out adventure, it's hard to beat \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\""},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This was a teriffic book, and well worth the length. It is about a man who is wrongfully accused of a crime based on forged evidence by his enemies. After spending a long time in prison, he meets a strange old man and discovers who has forged the evidencce against him. The many years in prison have changed him, and made him dedicate himself to revenge, which he completes very satisfyingly."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"More than a story of revenge and personal satisfaction, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is a story of loss and achievement. Young Edmont Dantes, of Marseilles, is a good-natured and competent man, and, being so, many of his acquaintances long to have him out of the way. Four people, for different reasons, throw him, using a series of schemes, in a jail where he will pass the rest of his life. But in the ill-famed Chateau d'If he discovers a secret that leads to an incredible wealth, and he is able to escape and work his life on the sole purpose of destroying his ancient enemies.We must understand that Dumas wrote this masterpiece on the apogee of romantism, and that is what Monte Cristo is: the utmost romantic story. And even if the potencial reader should think that, being written in the past century, it's going to be lots of cliches and known plots, think again. I don't want to spoil anything but to Edmont Dantes his revenge is not like what he thought it was going to be.The book is very long and sometimes even boring, with sub-plots seemingly leading to nowhere, just to be all sewn up in the very end. The best part, however is the inicial (the first 200 pages, more or less), when we see Dantes' life fall apart and he looses everything he cares for. This part is so well and pationately written, allowing similarities with Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;, but wherever Kafka is dark and cold, Dumas is colorful and emotive.Dumas is one of the best nineteenth century writers and has left a vast amount of works. This is, in my opinion, his best and should be read by everybody who is interested in good literature.Grade 8.7/10"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is Dumas at his best. An excellent plot with good character development. Parents should use classics like this to get their young children to read instead of playing video games and watching TV."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"If you don't usually read books this long (unabridged version 1000+ pages) because you never seem to finish them, don't worry you will read the entire book quicker than most 300 page books. The reason is that it is just that good. This is the best book I have ever read. I read the unabridged version and finished it inside of a week and I am not a fast reader. The strategy and cunning of the main character Edmund Dantes is unparalleled by any other character in any other book. If you like a well thought out plot, you will find none better. The story line will take you with it and you will become totally engrossed in the book. It is very well written. Once you get used to the dialogue, the book flows so well that you forget you are reading. It is truly an amazing, well written, thought provoking tale."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The novel, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a story of a man who is tempted with utter happiness, only to find himself unjutly ripped away and thrown in the face of absolute despair. The majority of this story, however, is his return from the living dead. . .to seek complete revenge.This is a novel which will have you transfixed to the plot from begining to the very end. It contains all elements to kep you reading, unexpectancies, surprises, suicides, murders, affairs, revenge and undying love. . . anything you could possibly look for in a book. Dumas draws you into a time in history when honor was extremely valuable and fortune, was a must.So when considering reading a book that colors the imagination and reaches into the depths of your soul, this book has to be it. Because unlike many other modern day &quot;soap oper&quot; books, this one has made a name for itself in history and society, or at least in my eyes, as the best book ever written."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"My AP English teacher recommended this book for me to read over the monthly required reading list, and I thought, &quot;Oh great, what a great idea....&lt;yawn&gt;&quot;. But it was for two months because of its length, so I took it.Each chapter includes a specific idea to the plot that keeps you wanting to read more. I would bring this book to work and read a chapter a day during my 15 minute break and would go overboard reading two chapters because it just keeps getting better and better! Each new idea came as a surprise for me, and so much is in it that I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good book.Alexandre Dumas sure knew what he was doing when he read this, so I definitely recommend this."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'm going to start out by saying that this is one of my favorite stories ever and it has had many adaptations and given inspiration to many more in all sorts of media. I've seen the anime, the old 1975 movie and the newer 2002 movies, I've even read the abridged version. I'm just now getting around to reading the full unabridged version and regret not having done so sooner. After a quick glance at a few different reviews I discovered that this was the most faithful translation of the original, though I have no way of truly knowing for myself since I can't read french, but either way this is an absolutely amazing book. Getting the full story is much more fulfilling than getting the watered down unabridged version.To elaborate on the story for those who don't know it, a man named Edmond Dante's has everything he can ask for in life when it is all taken away by a few other men who were jealous of his success. He is then thrown into prison and after being trained in many aspects by his cell mate he manages to escape and that's when the true journey starts of him dedicating his entire life to exact the ultimate revenge on those who had robbed him of all he held dear all those years ago."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is one of the best books ever written, by a great author. Revenge is necessary, but is it sweet?"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Since I was a child, I've heard of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" but as I grew into my teens and became an avid reader, I never gave a thought to reading it. For some reason (perhaps because the name was familiar to me from childhood), I saw it as a young readers book. Now, at the wise? old age of 69, my daughter, who is also an avid reader, suggested that I read it. She claimed it was one of the best books she's read. Normally, we have the same taste in literature. My daughter has read most of the \\"classics\\" and read the majority of them one after the other several years ago.After reading several pages, I gave up on it. While it is a fine work of literature for sure, I found a lot of the descriptive paragraphs to be repetitive and interrupted the flow of the story. Another issue for me personally was the amount of French content which I realize, is no fault of the author but a fault of my own for not knowing how to pronounce the French names, places, references etc.Another reason I gave it up was that while I found it to be a very cleverly written book, to me it was a childish/simplistic storyline.If it had been a smaller book (it's huge), I probably would have persevered."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"They do not write stories like this anymore. It is a complex and long read but worthy of the time. Without any spoilers, after about 150 pages into it, the novel will be hard to put down!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is an enjoyable story...even if you've seen any of the movies based on this book, you should still take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"It is rare to find in modern writing the wonderful complexity that exists in this book. It is a classic for a reason, and i consider it one of the best written stories i have ever read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This review is for this version, not the book itself, which is amazing. You find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination book itself. Only by an in-depth reading of almost the book is it made clear that the translation is quite poor, and considered one of the worst."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a classic for the ages with the unforgettable Edmund Dant&egrave;s. This book was enjoyable as a kid in grade school and still is as an adult. Truly a must read for everyone.I did not note many grammar errors in this Kindle version. Readers should keep in mind that this was written in the 19th century by a French author so the dialogue is a bit different but that shouldn't impede anyone from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Before I started this book, I had planned to only read a few chapters before I prep for bed. A couple of odd hours and and twenty something chapters later, I was HOOKED. Dumas story-telling captivated my imagination and instantaneous I began a personal connection with the main character, Edmond. I grew wiser as he learned, and wept as he lost. This book is powerful and I recommend it to all who seeks knowledge!Aaron Le"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I love this book!I was inspired to re-read it after spending a month in Corsica, where, on a clear day, you can see the island of Monte Cristo from the east coast beaches. When setting eyes on the outline of this large rock, it's not hard to imagine something mysterious associated with it. In fact, these days, you can take a boat near the island to fish, but if you get too close, military boats come along to shoo you off.I won't provide a summary here - the Book Description on the product page does that quite well enough. What I will say is, as a story, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" has everything - everything! Deception! Intrigue! Romance! Ambition! Honor and vengeance, redemption and forgiveness. More than one character sinks to the depths of utter despair. All that's missing is a bit of swashbuckling, which might have appeared, except that the story took a different turn...Towards the beginning, it would probably help to know just a little about French politics around the time of Napolean. You can get by on context, though I did find myself reading up on some Wikipedia entries.As the story progresses, it does get a bit soap opera-y, as all the characters eventually come together, and everyone happens to know everyone else. But, all the connections do make for a great story, so I'm not complaining. If this is your first time reading the book, it might help to write down the characters in order to keep track of them.Some people might call this book a tome, but don't let that discourage you! It's just more of the story to enjoy. I usually only have enough time to read a few pages a day, and it honestly made me happy just to have this book to look forward to, for whenever I might find a spare five minutes to indulge myself."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This enormous book took quite a while to read, but I was certainly happy because I could not put it down. I felt that no part of it dragged along and felt insignificant compared to the genius of the author.The only problem I had was that the Kindle version says the book is about 600 pages, which was certainly not nearly correct. Maybe they will fix in an update."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"No words of mine can properly express the immense poetry and wisdom of this saga. It fully captures all of the human condition and experience but in a way that is gentle and respectable. If only more of today's art would take a similar approach, humankind would benefit and be better for its' influence. Need to read something that can excite you in thought and feel deeply for the characters? This is a must. Truly timeless written art."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is very good and totally a classic. It's really long and very much worth reading.

The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Out of all the many books that I have read, I would have to say that &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is one of the most personally influential books that I have ever read. I had used to have a terrible temper, but here I saw the value of controling ones rage. Edmond endured a trial by fire and with inventiveness and unwavering steadfastness was able to achieve his goals. His revenge in each was a fitting exactment of justice. I personally love the revenge on Danglers. While the ending was predictable, I think that was the whole point. Revenge certainly is a dish better served cold. Anyone looking for an original story, and one that has obviously insipired many writers of our day. Read &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, and feel that certain power that only a classic novel can create."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book has appealed to me since I was in my teens. I'm prompted to read it again after watching a masterful version of in a French movie (with subtiltles.) It was shown in four episodes on Arts &amp; Entertainment - very superior to other movies telling this story. I have ordered a copy to read it again, since I last read it several years ago. I intend to encourage my children and grandchildrem to read it. Since it is so much based on revenge, I have often wondered what this meant about me, but it makes me feel ill to read some of these reviews by those who do not grasp the essence of this book, unless they found it too difficult for them to understand. I cannot in any way see this as a shallow novel. This book is truly a classic, especially for one who is as infatuated with France, as am I. Yes, it takes effort to keep the characters sorted out, but maybe it will become easier for me as I have gained wisdon over the years. This book belongs in my personal library, along with my other great favorite books, accumulated more recently."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In school, one is forced to read many books for english class. Some read Beauwoulf (ewww), some read The Lord of the Flies (yuck) while I was forced to read this book or face a F. I was hesitant to read this at first; judging the book by its cover and thickness. It was discouraging but I started to read it. I couldn't believe someone could have been this creative! I just loved every page of it. I devoured it way ahead of everyone in class. This book was so good I even read The Three Musketeers on my own! This is a great book to read. I have read the abridged version and plan to get the unabridged version so I can find out what happened to certain characters!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I followed Edmond Dantes for 24 years. from a happy young man through many years of suffering till his revenge, which eventually didn't make him happy as he thought it would. What would have his life been like if he didn't have the misfortune to be imprisoned for 14 years. I think he would have made a fortune by himself and be happy at the same time, maybe less educated and brilliant but definitely happy. I couldn't help love and admire him and was sorry to let him go at the last page of the book.Dumas' writing is brilliant and breathtaking. He lets the reader guess and understand sometimes things that are not even written. I wonder how much of Dantes is Dumas.The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most wonderful and exciting books ever written."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Let's see - I didn't read Dumas in English class, nor French class. There was a cartoon version I remember as a kid - 45 minutes, tops. Saw the Jim Caviezel Disney version and liked the story...so we download the free version onto the Kindle, and...wow! What a read. Swordfights. Poison. Beautiful women. No giants, though. Men in capes.Dense, prosy and engaging, with a travelogue into the Mediterranean, and enough silks and divans for the Arabian Nights. I didn't expect to be drawn in to this serialization, let alone turning the pages for \\"what happens next.\\" Definitely worth a week's reading.Now I want to purchase the Penguin unabridged version to be able to flip back and forth - one of the Kindle's limitations. But as a read-forward, and always know where you put it down, this version is a many-splendored, generous gift.Nice to know that the table of contents is clickable, although Dumas' chapter headings aren't very illuminating. The language is also very technical - of sailors and Italians. Having the dictionary handy is helpful. I don't like the Oxford one included, so I purchased the Merriam-Webster Collegiate for Kindle."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have been going through the classics with my new Kindle. I made Monte Cristo one of the first on my list and I am not disappointed. Dumas has a way of telling a story, crafting it to make it weave a fabric of a story where all meshes together psychologically and suspensively. Dumas is a great observer of people and how they live and act and react to different situations and stresses.Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I chanced upon \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" when my daughter needed to read it as part of a summer reading program. I am not a big reader of fiction and the story line of the book didnt inspire a lot of confidence. A story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned who comes back and avenges his enemies -- doesn't sound too interesting.Anyway, I just started reading a few pages just for the heck of it and found that I couldn't put the book down. This was story-telling at its best. It took me a couple of days to finish the book -- I really did nothing else during that period. The book was so well written -- and well translated.There are a whole bunch of characters in the story and their stories weave in and out of each other sustaining the pace of the novel. In some ways, this book seemed to be like a collection of novels (or novellas) that somehow got intertwined into a coherent large novel. Some of the things in the story might seem remarkable and hard to believe -- but that doesnt detract from the craftsmanship of Dumas which is quite unlike anything I have read thus far.There are a lot of abridged editions floating around -- however, after reading the original unabridged translation, I think its not possible to abridge the story without taking away significantly from its greatness."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Yes, that's my only complaint. It was too short. I never wanted it to end. I agree with others when they say you will devour it. You will be amazed how entranced you will be with the characters and the plot. And boy, is there a better thriller plot than this one? When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it...thinking of what may happen next etc. How did Dumas craft such a story, I'll never know.Also, the book is much different and better than the movie (I saw the movie first and liked it so decided to read it). The book definitely does not have the Hollywood ending the movie. So if you saw the movie and liked it, or hated it, read the book anyways because you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I took this book to Europe on vacation and devoured it. One of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a page-turner-no doubt about that. To those who may feel intimidated by reading \\"classic\\" literature (and especially as one as large and ominous as this unabridged version) I would say \\"fear not!\\" This novel is one of the most accessible and enjoyable reads you can find from any literary era.Like others who have already written here, I simply could not put this book down for several days until I had finished it. Dumas's style of writing cliffhanger endings consistently throughout the novel plays well to today's generations (myself included) who have been raised by television and movies. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO reads like a compelling dramatic series (as it once was when published) that you simply never want to end. Woe to those who chose an abridged version of this book!I read all kinds of books for all kinds of reasons. Don't look here for realism, profound philosophy, or exercise for your intellect. One may choose to read \\"the classics\\" for a variety of reasons, but THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, to me, is a purely guilty pleasure that I can engage in without thinking too much.Jeremy W. Forstadt"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"When asked if he feared death, Alexandre Dumas' replied, \\"I will tell Death a story and she will be kind to me.\\" After reading this book, I believe him. This is a very intricate story with a wonderful variety of characters. My paper copy of the book actually has a list of characters and historical events to help the first-time reader keep track of what's going on throughout the story, so it is an involved read the first time around. However, the story is so wonderfully worth the effort that I have since re-read it at least five times. This book is the epitome of timeless classic to me."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Engrossing, captivating, heart-wrenching, thought provoking..... I, too, could not put this book down! It may not be verbatim but I can not imagine that it could be any more wonderful than it is. I read a variety of books and re-read the good ones on occasion. I will definitely re-read this book and encourage all of my children to do the same. I think having it on a kindle will help so they do not know how many pages it is and get discouraged. Warning! It had me so enthralled that I burned a few meals while I was reading."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"It took me 3 months to read this. I read it consistently. There was literally never a dull moment. I must make the bold statement of claiming it The Greatest Book I Have EVER Read!!!

BUT for those of you who like me have seen movies and animation \\"loosely\\" based on the book. Two elements in adaptations: the union of Edmond & Mercedes, and Edmond's transformation from cold-hearted avenger to human being again, are limited to the adaptations!!*SPOILER ALERT*The original story (English version anyway) is a lot more complicated. Edmond or Monte cristo, as the story progresses, is cold, cruel, and blind with revenge as he drives one enemy to the madhouse and the other to commit suicide, and yet another he allows to be beated to death. By the time he realizes he has gone too far and starts to feel remorse, the horrifying damage is done. Edmond never truly forgives the men who framed him or his betrothed (Mercedes) for not waiting for him. However, he does realize he can't play God and is not the hand of providence. He knows he must atone.As for Edmond and Mercedes, they DONOT reconcile and reunite, instead he hangs her out to dry and sails off with some Greek princess, Haydee, who is at least 20 years his junior in the last chapter of the book. Haydee who is a supporting character at best is so ineffectual and child-like, its actually annoying. It's hard to feel sympathy for her sad story while she acts pompous and dim witted. Her main purpose in the story is as a plot device (the revenge on Fernand), she is otherwise a shadow character whose affection towards the count is parasitic, she herself appears so indulgent and kind of a moocher. The count's choice of her as a mate killed the ending for me. Granted, the count is pathetic and all alone in the world at this point, and will take whatever he can get.The orginal story destroyed my cherished idea/memory of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" It was heart breaking! Daggers and thunderbolts :("},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. Since the download was free, I decided to give it a shot. I was very pleased with this Kindle version. It's been a long time since I've read the book, but it doesn't seem to me that there is much, if anything, missing from this version.If this is your first time reading this story, don't be put off by other reviewers who claim that it is too wordy or easy to get lost. It really isn't. And if you've only seen the movie (unless it was the Richard Chamberlain version, which in my opinion is the only good adaptation)be prepared for the ending to be different.Overall a really great, must-read book!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Just got the book today and will be looking forward to reading it.

I read the summary for The Count of Monte Cristo and knew there was a movie version so I figured, why not? It has to be good if hollywood wanted to make a movie out of it. It has this reputation of being a very long book, but with the kindle you can't really tell and because I had a hard time putting it down, it didn't seem long at all. The story is fantastic! A man goes to prison, finds treasure and spends years....YEARS plotting the perfect revenge. Unlike other trite revenge stories of people going out and trying to murder whoever wronged them, Edmond Dantes just tries to make everyone's life miserable without actually appearing to be the cause of it. It's just very clever! You empathize with him and understand how he became the way he is. I liked almost everything about the book except his love story with Haidee because he treated her like she was his daughter and then realized he loved her....gross. Anyway, yes i guess it is a long book but definitely worth the read! It has become one of my favorite books...definitely in the top three!

So far, it is an okay book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a great book. The story is thrilling in its twists and turns from the very beginning to the end. The only downside to this book is that it's a bit heavy to read. However it is absolutely worth it, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Unfortunately, there is also much that is bad to be said about it; on balance, I think the bad slightly exceeds the good.On the plus side, there is a fascinating basic plotline, and some excellent characters. The writing is effective, and draws the reader into the plot; by the end of the book, I actually found myself caring about the characters and what happened to them, in spite of not really liking the book. And if you like complex, involved, convoluted plots, this book is certainly one that you will not want to miss.On the down side, while there is certainly 400+ pages of excellent plot in this novel, it takes the author 875 pages to tell it. (This refers to the unabridged Wordsworth Classics edition, in paperback.) The writing reminds me of a quote I once heard describing Dickens (and which could easily be applied to many 19th century authors): he was paid by the word, and it shows. Further, Dumas uses an odd convention for conversations: he does not change paragraph whenever he changes speakers. I don't know whether this was a standard convention for his time and place, or whether it is strictly his own. This is a minor quibble, but it is distracting, at least at first.Then, there are some truly immense amounts of suspension of disbelief that one must manage if one is to take the book seriously; primary among them is the fact of Dantes' immense competence, especially in the social skills and understanding of people, during his long, drawn-out revenge. Here, after all, is a man, who when he was a 19 year old was so naive that when he was imprisoned, he couldn't even fathom who would have wished him ill or why. He spent 14 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, the rest of it with only his one fellow prisoner as company. Granted, he had a native intelligence and charisma, and his fellow prisoner was well-educated, and spent much time teaching him languages, math, science, and history during their years together. And of course, once he escapes, he becomes fabulously wealthy. But native intelligence, a fine classical education, and a ton of money do NOT equate to a knowledge of people; he could not have picked that up in prison, because it is not the kind of thing that one can learn by studying the abstract; it can only be learned through practice, and he had none of that. Yet as soon as he leaves prison, he immediately is portrayed as a masterful schemer and manipulator. Granted, there is a ten-year gap during which we do not see his adventures, but even so, it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would be able to learn all that he learned in that time. Not to mention that it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would have been able to protect his person and his wealth while learning the people skills necessary.Then we have specific instances of his manipulation being more complete than anyone could reasonably expect to do, no matter how much they know, or how much money they have, at least without better explanations from the author (which we do not get). For instance, at the very beginning of his insinuation of himself into Parisian society, he buys the superior horses of one of his unwitting enemies, and then gives them back to the man's wife as a present, to sow marital dischord. When he does this, he knows that she intends letting a friend of hers (also the wife of one of his enemies) have a ride in the carriage behind the splendid beasts the next day. So he positions himself and his servant at precisely the right place to intercept the carriage the next day when the horses run amok and threaten to overset the carriage, and save the lady, thus insinuating himself into her good graces. It is made very clear that he knows that the horses will run wild by the questions and orders he gives his servant, but it is never explained HOW he knew that. Had he provided the driver for the carriage? It was never stated. Had he bribed the existing driver? Again, it was never stated, and it seems unlikely that such a bribe could be safely made, and kept completely secret. Had he insinuated an irritant into the horses' equippage? That would have assured them running wild, but not at the exact place and time that they did so, with no chance of overturning the carriage before ever they got to that point. All in all, an incident like that one needs to be explained in order to be at all plausible, and it wasn't. And there were others, too, less obvious, but still implausible.And a last negative, which causes me to drop my rating from three stars to two: Dantes is supposed to be a sympathetic character, terrible to his enemies, benificent to his friends, but all I can say is, preserve me from the pain of such benificence. Toward the end of the book, he saves his best friend's lover's life, by simulating her death. Yet he allows his friend to think that she is dead FOR A WHOLE MONTH in order to &quot;test his mettle&quot; to discern if he &quot;merits happiness&quot;. And in fact, years before, in his other act of benificence, to that friend's father, he saves him from financial ruin, but only does so at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute, allowing the man to come within a hairsbreadth of committing suicide in despair. If this were done in order to demonstrate that his ordeals have cost him all compassion, it would be one thing, but as I say, he is portrayed as being a marvellously benificent friend; the friends he has treated in this way not only forgive him, but don't seem to be aware that there is anything to forgive; they act as if his treatment of them has been marvellous.No, I cannot say that I enjoyed this book. I cannot rate it highly. I cannot, even, concede that it is (on balance) well done. But there certainly are things to like about it, and any book that can produce the interesting philosopical arguments that this one is capable of can't be all bad."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Modern television did not invent &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Alexander Dumas did. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; follows the life of Edmond Dantes who is falsely accused of treason against the crown, imprisoned, escapes in true MacGyver fashion, and then spends the remainder of his days wreaking revenge on his enemies. Dumas creates an interesting plot which winds its way through some 400 odd pages (and this is the abridged version). The plot is never boring and it is truly fascinating how Dumas manages to make what seem initially to be the most tangential details essential elements to the Count's plan for revenge. Also of interest are Dumas' explanations of events such as Dantes' tunneling through a stone prison cell using a tool he made from a soup pot, escape from prison by wrapping himself in his friends funeral shroud which he sews from the inside, and the construction of the crypt containing the seed money which transforms him into the count. That Dumas could coordinate all these nitpicky details and meld them into a singleminded plot makes the book worth reading just for that.Unfortunately, that is probably the only reason to read the book. Admittedly the abridged version leaves out significant portions of the story, but 441 pages should leave enough room for explanations without everything being attributed to sheer coincidence or to being brought into action via bribes and million dollar franc pensions. My other criticism of the book is that the singlemindedness of the Count seems fickle and unbelievable. Revenge is the overwhelming thought process of the count. In the abdridged version he spends some 350 pages ruminating about how he's going to have his revenge. Then suddenly towards the end, he has a change of heart - he feels that he just might have gone a bit overboard, after spending millions of francs bribing people and ruining the lives of several innocent people, all to give three persons their comeuppance. The count mopes about for a few days, then remembers that he truly was miserable in prison, and finally decides that he did the right thing and everything is fine and dandy. Bologna! If a man spends the majority of his life planning revenge and assumes the powers of essentially a sovereign entitity in doing so, what seems reasonable is that at the end he is either a hideous fiend who feels utterly no remorse or he is a total wreck of a man filled with unending guilt and remorse - certainly nothing that can be relieved by the joyful sight of the Morels.In summary, &quot;The COunt of MOnte Cristo&quot; is a great tale to quickly read (and that is probably needed since it is so long) but on closer inspection is unconvincing because of its reliance on coincidence, bribery, and superficial emotional turmoil."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I bought this book new thinking I would get a book in perfect condition, wrong.

Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of 19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Required reading before my freshman year of high school, this masterpiece inspired a passion for reading that continues to this day.

Dumas reallly did an excellent job creating a twisting plot and real sympathy for the very much wronged main character.

In this book, a young sailor named Edmond Dant&egrave;s is arrested on false charges of treason. He spends the next fourteen years in prison trying to figure out how to exact complete revenge on his enemies. Once he gets out of prison he begins his quest for vengeance. The author, Alexandre Dumas, portrays this struggle for vengeance by mixing action and serenity together. By using both, Dumas makes the character seem like a real person.

As the reader, I observed a great battle of intellect between the main characters, and this strife makes the book enjoyable to read. You constantly wonder who will get the upper hand.

If you are incredibly curious and are way into the story, reserve the next 24 hrs or so just for reading the story! A good and happy man is imprisoned wrongly....he spends the next---what 14 years of his life in the cell of a prison for a shallow crime he didn't even commit.

It takes him years to set up his revenge and come to terms with it. (We don't dwell on the years, either). The author explicitly states that Edmond has God's approval to carry out his plans on his &quot;backstabbers.&quot; The revenge is great---for he only pushes these evil people's deeds in their faces. They choose what to would do with the realization of their numerous crimes. I hope I'm making sense. But don't except a sweeping tale of love, any romance or swordfighting here.

Dant&egrave;s, ignorant of the political scene, has agreed to take a letter from Napoleon to some Bonapartists in Paris. Using this as fodder, Danglars, Mondego and Caderousse bring him to court to be tried for treason.Dant&egrave;s is convicted, and once in prison meets a man named Abb&eacute; Faria. He is a priest who educated Dantes into a well-rounded, well-informed man. He leaved Dantes with the knowledge of many riches on the Isle of Monte Cristo, and how to get to the place. When Faria dies, Dantes uses his shroud as a means of escape, and is thrown into the sea.He reaches Monte Cristo and is astounded at all the riches. Disguising himself as a priest, he travells to Marseille. Upon arrival he learns that his father has died and that his fiancee Mercedes has married Mondego. He also is told about the plot to frame him.Ten years later, he reinstates himself into French society, giving himself the title Count of Monte Cristo. Nobody recognizes him with the exception of Mercedes. He uses his knowledge of his old aversaries to bring about their ruin in very public and humiliating ways.Not all of his motives are driven by vengance, however. He also sets out to reward everyone who helped him over the years, and does this through his extensive riches and influence.Overall the novcel is very intriguing and exciting. It is full of action filled escapes and duels which add to the excitement. There is an air of mystery around Dantes that gives it the air of a thriller novel. It is full of plot twists and intrigue that make it difficult to put down for a minute. Alexandre Dumas is an excellent storyteller who has crafted a masterpiece that rivals his well-loved Three Muskateers series.In addition to being an excellent storyteller, Dumas is an astounding writer. The plot line is gripping in and of itself, but Dumas' expert control of the English language grips the reader with the words themselves, not just what they represent.It would be wise to read the abridged version of this novel, because for the average person the excruciating detail in the long version detracts from the story a little bit. To keep it more exciting and gripping, the shorter version covers the most important parts without many of the very miniscule details in the original.The original is also an excellent read, and gives much more insight into the characters' lives, but it would be reccomended to read it second to the abridged version, and only by the most patient Dumas fans."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This has to be one of the greatest novels ever written.

Oh my, I feel like I've watched or been through an epic experience and felt the highs and lows of Edmond. I am heartbroken to find that his fiance is unfaithful, and that they can never be together. Yet, what a master writer Alexandre Dumas is not to make me hate him, for I can see now why it had to be so. How do some writers do that? Twist what you would normally hate into something so powerfully moving? Wonderful story, based on fact. However, there is one plot inconsistency, and that is when Mercedes tells Edmond that he is still so handsome. Tell me, do you know of anyone that has been through a major trial in their life? Divorce, death? How does their face look? Do they have more lines around their eyes, or maybe a deep wrinkle or two on their forehead or cheek? Bad habits that destroy their looks? Try 14 years in the worst prison and I cannot imagine it would leave anyone handsome. True, Mercedes might have said such a thing out of her love for him, but throughout the story the hint of his looks are that of a handsome gentleman. Wow, what a great story though. My heart bleeds for Edmond and I wish that he and Mercedes would have made a couple at the end, and even though Edmond says he will find peace, it is not enough to make me think his torture has ended. Revenge is the thread in this story, white hot, unstoppable, self tormenting revenge. The things he confronts is what we all confront when faced with betrayal. Do we become what we despise? Turn the tables and exact revenge? Do we have the right? Can we live with ourselves afterwards? Edmond overcomes his doubts as to his purpose by reminding himself of all the tortures he faced. He becomes the thing created from his experience. Once set on this path, he cannot undo it. Thusly, suicide crops its head as it should. No easy task, to slowly destroy those who ruined you. It seems with each success he destroys some of his self, too. The old Edmond. What amazed me is the author placed such realistic thoughts in Edmond's head about how he felt he'd gone too far, the guilt...it makes you wonder whether you would choose to be wise and forgive in order to move on or follow the same path...which shaped Edmond because he spent so much time in that hellish cell. Recommended reading, but don't expect happy endings, just an amazing rollercoaster!@"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just finished this book, the Modern Library Classic, and I must say it is the best book I've ever read in my life. What a thrilling tale of adventure, revenge, romance, spirituality, and morality. Dumas takes us through the European countryside, cities, and islands, setting the stage for the one of the best-crafted plots ever written.There's not much more I can say about this book that has already been written other than that one should get the long version. Yes, it took me awhile to get through the 1,462-page book, but I really don't see how the abridged versions could eliminate 900 pages of this masterpiece. This is truly a work of spendid prose and story telling. It's a must read for anyone who enjoyes adventure, drama, and history."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The pages come off. Do not purchase this book. I spent the first week of school trying to prevent the pages from coming off."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Two jealous men plot to have Edmond Dantes thrown into a hellhole of a dungeon on false charges, and a third self-serving government man arranges to have Dantes kept there for life in order to protect his own interests. However, after fourteen years Dantes manages to escape and soon finds that his life as he once knew it is over: his promising career as a merchant ship's captain was aborted, his father had long ago starved himself to death out of grief, and his former beloved fiancee had married another. Yeah if I were in Dantes' shoes I'd hold a pretty serious grudge too.Fortunately Dantes' only friend in the dungeon had divulged to him, just before his death, the secret location of a buried treasure on the uninhabited isle of Monte Cristo near the French coast. Dantes soon becomes the fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo and proceeds to gradually but relentlessly exact total retribution on his betrayers, two decades after they'd first hatched their plot.This long tale of revenge satisfies. The basic plot is quite drawn out as Dantes' master plan requires him to befriend and gain the trust of the men who destroyed his prospects in youth. He accomplishes this mainly by becoming somewhat intimate with these mens' families, so there are various sub-plots that comprise the middle third or so of the book. Following this section, the Count has his chess pieces where he wants them and proceeds to rapidly and systematically destroy his enemies. Of course the best parts are their horrified aspects when he finally reveals his identity to them.Though 'Count' is replete with rich renderings of scenes in various parts of Paris, Marseilles and the French Riviera, and Rome and rural Italy, his emphasis is on the dialogue and action more than on the settings. Unlike for example Victor Hugo, who puts much more weight on describing the stage upon which the actors walk, through delightfully sudden tangents on history and philosophy that do in fact relate to the subject at hand. Dumas's style is much more focused and to the point.Though rather simple in plot development and resolution, 'Count' stands among the finest of the classics. An absolute must for teen readers. For adults it's still a great read, though most of the events and the ending are somewhat predictable and almost always go the way of the hero. Also, Dantes' transformation from a poorly educated happy-go-lucky sailor boy to a cultured single-minded demi-god with seemingly infinite knowledge / wisdom and superhuman insight is a bit too much to believe!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"If you're going to read The Count of Monte Cristo you must read the unabridged version (the abridged version cuts out so much it will leave you going, \\"Huh?\\" half way through!)Betrayal, Adventure, Revenge - this is classic literature from which everything exciting we currently are exposed to derived.The translation of this particular version is excellent.It's the single largest novel I ever read (I'm not a big \\"reader\\"), but it went very quickly."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I had seen the movie and thought that the element of surprise would be removed because of that fact. I feared before reading it that I would not feel the tension or shock in the story that makes reading a novel like this so enjoyable, like a kid who peeked at his Christmas presents on the 23rd and then feels little emotion at the unveiling on the 25th. But, the movie had only basic similarities with the book. I was enthralled with every page and amazed with the character and plot development. Dumas was a genius. Do not miss any of this story. I do not see how an abridged version could possibly capture the weight of this story or produce the same kind of effect upon the reader."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I've been a reader of an abridged version of this tale since I was a kid in 7th grade. Probably read it 20 times. Then 2 years ago I got a copy of the Penguin unabridged version - holy cow!!! I had no idea what I was missing - incomparable depth, nuance, and detail so richly rendered you feel as if you're a bystander in the scenes!The story is a classic - a young man full of hope, love, and unlimited potential is falsely accused and imprisoned on the eve of his wedding. A miraculous escape 14 years later, re-birth and transformation into the formidable Count of Monte Cristo begins the painstaking planning of a long awaited revenge. And what a complete revenge it is.Even at 1100 pages, it's never boring (and although at times Dumas stretches out what could be related in a more concise way, I inwardly smile when I recall that he was paid by the word:), and when you reach the end you'll certainaly want for more.

I opted for the Penguin Classics edition trans. by Robin Buss, which I found to be both clear and faithful. This frickin book is well over 1,000 pages, so it may be worth your while to sit down in the bookstore and investigate for a few minutes.p.s. Look out for the sneaky abridged versions, too. I wish I could burn them. Just kidding."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Look, if you've seen the movie, it's a good adaptation, yet, as often with movies, it is diminished when compared to the book. THis is even more so with Monte Cristo, the book is quite long, but filled with intrigue, if you think Dantes could be cruel on the film, just read the book. Also, it has a less corny ending, which I appreciate.Truth, the book is quite long, but it is completely absorbing, I just couldn't put it down, I finished it on 12 hours of straight non stop reading, just couldn't stop until the end.

I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Many would argue against the title I have just given this book. They would say that Crime and Punishment or even such Shakespeare plays such as Hamlet would allow further insight into the main character's soul. But these books only showed the torture, and are not complete. The Count is shown to have a very brooding conscience, and though it is tainted by revenge, the involuntary hurt he gives to the innocent brings out both his tortured soul and his contemplative soul, taking each problem as it comes instead of all at once. This is how most people's trains of thought work, for as bad as a problem may become, we are always working around it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book was a gift to my son.

That may seem incredibly overboard and over-dramatic, but honestly, when a novel is about the intricately plotted revenge of a man who escapes one of the toughest and unforgiving prisons after being falsely accused for thirteen years, then I think I have the right be be a little over-dramatic. To me Dumas never gets old, his writing is always meticulous and sweeping and he never misses a beat when it comes to plot. Everything is so perfect and with all the identities that Dantes takes on throughout the novel, it's so important that the audience understand what is happening and who that English Gentlemen or Sinbad the Sailor really is and Dumas does it with style.If Dumas was alive today and I somehow finagled the chance to meet him, I would probably swoon and faint on the spot.

I just could never put this book down. At night I refused to go to sleep, and when I finally did, I'd dream about the brilliant Count of Monte Cristo and the elegant Paris society that's inwardly so corrupted.Dumas is an author of a rare quality. Through Dante, he depicts the most exciting story of love, friendship, adventure, justice, and drama. From the very beginning to the last page, I was always curious and dying to know what was going to happen on the next page.Edmond Dante is a young man who is a good and innocent son, fiance, and a sailor. He is being envied by his collegues and, on his wedding day, gets arrested and later put in the most infamous prison for no good reason. After many many years Dante escapes the Chateau d'If miraculously and makes perfect plans to get revenge on his enenmies. It's fascinating to find out what a genius he is at fulfilling his heart's desires.It really is a masterpiece and would like to recommend it to everyone because it's impossible not to enjoy this book throughly. Just be careful NOT to read the abridged version since it leaves out too many details."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"All I can say is that I spent many days enthralled with this book and when it was finished I felt like I had lost dear friends. I found myself shirking school duties in favor of falling into the story of Edmond and Mercedes. The plot has everything. Evil villains, traitors, chivalry, romance, intrigue, redemption...I could go on forever. Some of the scenarios Dumas sets up are exquisite and will literally have your heart racing in excitement! There are so many mini-plots, each of them fascinating, to keep your interest. Do yourself a favor and read this book! And while you're at it, check out &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and all the other books available by Dumas. His personal life is very interesting to read about as well (he took part in a duel amonst other things)."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is probably the fastest book I've ever read through.

You'll fall in love with the characters - well most of them. Edmond wants revenge after a crime he was judged on but he didn't do. Now he's out to get revenge and he wants to do it the right way. One of the best books you'll ever read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dantes, a/k/a The Count of Monte Cristo, is just as vibrant and nearly as famous a hero as D'Artagnan. This novel is beautifully written, full of emotion and witty dialogue as well as Dumas' famous adventure, action, and mystery. The story of the wrongfully imprisoned Edmond and his quest for revenge is spellbinding. In fact, this book can be dangerous-- if you are midway through it and your house begins to burn around you, it is entirely possible that you will not pull your nose out of the book and go outside. Also, this book may bring out an ugly side to your personality; almost everyone has someone they would like to treat as the Count treats those who framed him. There's nothing like living vicariously through an almost 200-year-old fictional character.Someone commented in another review that this book is too long. I can't tell you how little I agree. I wish it were twice as long as it is. I don't believe that is has a single dull moment. However, there are abreviated versions available. I think that reading an abreviated version of such a masterpiece is a waste. Still, be careful when chosing an edition to buy."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books ever written, if not the best. It is a great piece of Literature written by the multitalented author, Alexandre Dumas. It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes. He was young honest sailor who had the privilege of directing the ship called the Pharaon after his captain died. He is then betrayed by two people he thought were his fiends, Monsieur Danglars and Fernand. The public prosecutor confiscated Edmond's only proof of innocence. Edmond is sentenced to life in the infamous dungeon, the Chateau d'If. There he makes friends with a priest. They develop a father, son friendship. He spends fourteen long, hard years in jail. He has a daring escape and finally leaves the oppressing dungeon. He then plans his revenge on his enemies. He joins a smuggler ship to protect his identity. He returns to his village, to find his father dead from hunger. He protects himself by changing his name to the Count of Monte Cristo, and travels to find his enemies with his new found fortune. He comes to find his lover Mercedes married to one of his enemies. To figure out if he gets his revenge on his enemies, you will have to read the book. The book is an action packed, never ending and very exciting. You will go on the greatest thrill ride of your life and it will not stop until you close the book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This Alexander Dumas classic vies with his &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; in the genre of French adventure novels set in the eventful 19th century. Whereas &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; featured a quartet of swashbuckling heroes, &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; centers around one mysterious, seemingly omnipotent individual.The book opens in Marseilles, where the reader is introduced to the central characters as young men. A plot is laid and carried out against one of these men by his rival for the love of a woman. After the passage of 14 years, the lives of these characters slowly begin to converge once again as the victim of the conspiracy seeks his vengeance.The setting for his revenge, however, is a far different venue than the Mediterranean fishing community of Marseilles. His old enemies have become wealthy and powerful, and move in the highest circles of Paris society. The skeletons in their closets would now be the ruin of lofty reputations. Their families will become unknowing actors in the drama of vengeance that begins to unfold when the Count of Monte Cristo takes up residence in Paris.The victim of the conspiracy of hotheads in Marseilles was an unsophisticated provincial at the time. Upon his return, he is wealthy, subtle, and implacable. He embarks upon his quest for revenge with a well-planned, methodical campaign, marshalling resources that he has devoted years to organize. He uses a dozen or so people as his allies, some unknowingly, others willingly, but none are aware of his ultimate objectives. Yet, as complex and detailed as his plans are, he encounters complications that force him to choose how far to pursue his revenge.I was captivated by the dark and light contrasts of this story. The glitter and elegance and courtliness of French society of that day are set against the darkness of scandalous family secrets and destructive, coldblooded scheming. It's a combination that can't miss, particularly at the hand of a master writer like Dumas. This is a long book to plow through, but the further one gets, the more the threads of the plot come together to the final triumphs and defeats. As you reach the closing chapters, you may be reminded of a line from the movie &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; -- &quot;no man is rich enough to buy back his past.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"you find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination of the physical book itself. only by an in-depth reading of almost the entire introduction is it made clear that the translation is quite old, and considered one of the worst. surprised eco put his name to this."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The first time I read this book I was a sophmore in high school.

I'll never understand why producers feel so obligated to completely change stories...OK, back to the book. This is one of the best revenge tales you'll ever read. Edmond Dantes is wronged in a huge way by three evil cohorts, and he plots for years to bring them to justice. Anything more and I'd be spoiling a book that shouldn't be spoiled! The elaborate schemes are unequaled in literature, and yet they are quite believable--especially as they almost all require the premise of \\"be sure your sin will find you out.\\" Dantes simply utilizes the evil that resides in his enemies to expedite his own plans for revenge. Quite stunning, and well worth your ample time.One more note--I've fallen in love with the name of one of the characters, Haidee.

Readers will lose count of the subplots, and indeed Dumas even let one of them peter out somewhere in the 1400+ pages of this unabridged version. Some parts of this novel flirt so much with contrivance it gets a bit ridiculous at times, but we're all here to see the well deserved smack downs for which the antagonists are just itchin'. The revenge wrought on each baddie is poetic, but not totally predictable. What's more, Dumas hints ever so subtly that in the end, evil for evil doesn't completely fulfill.This is the sort of novel that can't be well translated into a two-hour movie format. The older version with Chamberlain, Pleasance, and Curtis was kind of fun, but as with all other versions, the complexity of the interwoven subplots was entirely omitted.The full rendering of The Count of Monte Cristo must remain between novelist and reader a wholly telepathic experience."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The book is long, and seems to deviate from the plot a lot, although towards the end you realize that they all served purpose. The writing is ancient and there probably should have been some account regarding Edmond Dantes' transformation into the Count of Monte Christo.Having said that, the book is a fascinating study of the time and it works really hard at describing the characters, their motives, their thoughts and their struggles.I feel like an idiot afterwards for thinking I had already 'read' the Count of Monte Christo in elementary school - the original, unabridged version is much longer, more detailed, and has a different emphasis."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can think of no character in all of literary history who is more obsessed, more driven than Edmond Dantes. Batman comes close.You don't know who Edmond Dantes is?Well, allow to offer up a brief synopsis (very brief) of the novel that is The Count of Monte Cristo.Edmond Dantes, a successful young sailor, returns home to France in the early 19th Century with plans to wed the love of his life. Instead of the expected happiness, several of Edmond's friends have grown jealous of his life and go to the authorities to accuse Edmond of being a spy for Napoleon. Edmond is sent to prison, his life ruined and basically over. But in prison he makes friends with another inmate, an old man who tells Edmond of a secret treasure hidden away on the island of Monte Cristo. After the old inmate dies in prison, through some twists and turns Edmond manages to escape. Then he goes to the island and discovers this treasure, so huge it would make any kings of Europe envious. Soon a mysterious stranger, the Count of Mont Cristo, appears in Paris and begins to make the rounds as to \\"coming out in society.\\" To give away more would be a disservice to the reader, but let's just say poor Edmond is no longer poor and goes to extremes to find his revenge against his old \\"friends.\\"Unlike most of the film versions I've seen of this tale, the novel does not have the happiest of endings. The tale is sort of a tragedy, but one in which the protagonist wins out, though finds that what he has won was perhaps not truly worth everything he went through to achieve it.There are no simple endings here. The good guy doesn't win the girl and everything else. In other words, this is a lengthy, complicated tale that will make you think in the end. All the while giving you a darn fun reading experience. There's action to be found here, sword fights and the like, as well as intrigue and skulduggery. There's also a bit of comedy here and there, but out-and-out murder at times.Most of Dumas' longer novels touch upon many facets of the human existence, and this one is no exception, though it is perhaps the darkest of his longer writings."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This Puffin Classics edition of Alexandre Dumas's classic \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is very readable. If you are looking for an abridged version of this classic tale, look no further. The storyline is well captured and with many delightful descriptions still kept in. Often, however, the story seems to move quite fast and it makes you wonder what details are being left out. The level of English is about equal to the High School senior or early college level. A number of French word's are left untranslated which help add to the flavor of this classic French tale. The price is very low and its a great deal.I would definitely recommend this novel to students studying the French Revolution and Romanticism. There is a lot of historical and stylistic content that make this novel a gem for scholastic study. Also, if you would like a portrait of the comings and goings of aristocratic Europe around 1835, this novel depicts a lot from those societies.[...]"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book this much! I was a little daunted by the size of the audiobook (~47 hours) but once I started it, I could barely tear myself away from it. This is an amazing story that can be equally enjoyed by men, women and even teens. It was performed/read beautifully with a wide variety of accents that added to, rather than detracted from, the depth of the story. I'm pretty finicky about readers of audiobooks, and John Lee was fabulous! (He rivals Jim Dale.) The story itself is a must-read in any form -- beautifully-written, engaging, and intriguing. It presents an insight into the human soul without being preachy or boring, and I felt myself eagerly anticipating what was to come next, even up to the last minutes of the book. Do yourself a favor -- buy this book NOW!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

Thrown into prision and percieved as dead. The hero is buried in a shroud, then returns with power and influence to exact righteous judgement with great riches and a healing balm for those on whom he chooses to show kindness.I'm ashamed to admit it took me 10 years to realize I had read a thinly veiled allegory of the Holy Bible. There are hundreds of ingeniously crafted points of contact that only someone who has studied the Scriptures is likely to spot, after having it pointed out. It even goes so far as to express Dumont's dispensationalism and perhaps a little bit of anglo-israelism.Like all allegory it breaks down, of course, but then that's the nature of the thing.Public schools would have an absolute fit if they had the religious background to see the clever work for what it is.The Count is a must read, and would highly recomend you read the Bible thru to see the full extent of Dumont's ability to tie the works together."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is, without a doubt, the most masterful piece of storytelling to ever have been written.

Why cheat yourself?This is such a wonderful story of love, and revenge."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Perhaps the only work in popularity to rival Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers is The Count of Monte Cristo. As with many of Dumas' works, the story has huge cast of characters and several underlying plot lines dealing with political upheaval and scandals in France during that era. I found that the The Man in the Iron Mask had so many side political story lines that it made the novel confusing and hard to follow. And then I got bored. However, The Count, has just the right amount and ties together very well at the end, which does not subscribe to the generic formulaic predictable plot. In fact, I would deem it the ultimate revenge story.There have been 11 films and 4 television series that have attempted to tell the tale of the wronged Edmund Dantes and his search for his fiance Mercedes and his pursuit of the man that wronged him. The most recent film was in 2002 starring Jim Caviezel and while casted well, paled in comparison to the novel in many ways and the liberal creative license taken with the story almost offending. The latter half of the film no longer resembled the masterpiece of the novel. Yes, most films pale to their written counterparts, but this one in particular deserved a Golden Razzie.The novel has a huge story to go with the cast of characters, but is pretty basic in that a man is wrongly accused and seeks to right the wrongs, along the way, losing those that he cared about, mounting his need for revenge even further. Edmund calculates and plans out the most exquisite plans and is not completely heartless or merciless. In fact, his compassion and loyalty are overriding themes throughout the novel. I guess you could say the richness of the Monte Cristo sandwich rivals that of it's namesake!The Count of Monte Cristo is not a novel to be missed.And if you really need the short version, The Simpsons did a 10min summary in the episode \\"Revenge is a Dish Best Served Three Times.\\""},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am one of those people who never got around to reading the book until after I had seen the new movie. When I finished the book-which I had been glued to and finished in one week- I felt like burning my DVD of the Count of Monte Cristo. The movie screen writers must have been mentally impaired to massacre the book as they did!I loved the way the book was always moving, it was never dull for a second. Many people seem to think that the book was too long and too complex with the many characters, but I thought that made it all the better. When it was over I was disappointed, not by the story, but by the fact that I was finished reading it. I have to admit being a little disappointed that Mercedes and Edmond don't end up together, and that Edmond and his friends end up separated, but really I was not expecting the book to end the way it did (again Hollywood's fault!) and so I was actually pleasantly surprised to be surprised. I don't think the book could have been any better than exactly as it is. The bottom line is that it is an excellent book, and I will no doubt read it several more times before tiring of it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"At first I saw the movie. Then I read the book. It was completely different. I was surprised how different and more exciting, more enjoyable the book is. However the novel has much more details of course, but the details make the book so interesting. This is the book you can't really put it down. When I was reading after chapter and chapter it became just more and more captivating.This is a genius story about revenge and betrayal. (But I have decided to buy the movie and add to my collection because the movie inspired me to read the book).I honestly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I hope the reader will forgive me, but since other reviewers did a fine job of commenting on this wonderful story, I'd like to dwell more on this books author, the great Alexandre Dumas. The man is an incredible writer who, despite the length of some of his novels, is able to entice the reader on and on and when the story ends they put down the book wishing that there was more to read. The reader by the end is won over by the enduring characters, good, bad, and in between, by the intricate and exciting plot, and by the wonderful wit of the author who is almost another character himself because of the flair of his writing.All I can say is that if you are the type of reader who can be scared off by the length of a novel, you should realize that Dumas' books usually move along at a wonderful pace and that everything in them is essential reading, and everything cut out of the abridged editions is a loss to the reader.So that being said I recommend The Count of Monte Cristo very highly, and recommend also that if you choose to read it that you are sure to get an unabridged copy. To cut out parts of this wonderful story is a crime, and a needless one considering how wonderfully told this story is."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a \\"must-have\\" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period. It is as though all of the characters have the distinction of Anthony Hopkins(and this still does not do it justice!). This work is a feast for the mind!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just finished reading this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The emotions I felt while reading it were of varying degrees. There are many lessons to be learned in this book and the most profound is the revelation Dantes had in the end. I never imagined I would feel pity for those who so sorely wronged him, but the reader cannot help but feel that way. In the end, Edmond realized that he too, was not above this passion. That is why I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not to mention the intricate web designed between all the characters. There was hardly a useless character.In short, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story with numerous lessons about human nature and its passions."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I had borrowed my friend's copy of this and I assured her that it's gonna take a long time before I could give it back and what do you know, I finished it 3 days!!!!Because the moment you start reading it you cannot put it down.The things he had been through is so unfair you can almost feel it that you wanted to strangle those people who did him wrong.There are some loopholes though in some of the situation but then it is fiction so Dumas has the liberty to do whatever he thought was best to give the story that edge. The movie is good but the book is better."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book was a summer reading assignment for ninth grade Pre-AP English I, and I expected naught but a monotonous, wordy, dusty &quot;classic.&quot; However, when I finally began to read, I was suddenly entranced by the well-woven plot. A variety of feelings are portrayed through the dialogue. The story was very adventurous, romantic and so highly unbelievable. I did not want it to end, and so I read it again immediately. I highly recommend this book, even to those who usually reject classics."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my all time favorite novels by Alexandra Dumas, who is likewise one of my all time favorite authors.

I found myself guessing about what was going to happen next but each time I tried to guess, I was wrong. I loved the character development. There were so many characters in this novel and each character brought new attributes to &quot;the table&quot; which made the book even more interesting. Also I loved the plot development. There were so many subplots that all ended up tying into the main plot which made the book that much more interesting. Starting out as an honest sailor in Marseilles, he is framed for being a Bonapartist, and is sentenced to life in jail... With little hope for escape he is left to die in his cell, but when he meets Abbe Faria his luck just starts to turn around... With this in mind I would definitely encourage others to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Simply put, I love this book.

It's a dauntingly long novel, though, and at my snail's pace of reading 4-5 pages per night before I start falling asleep I'm about 3/4 the way through after 4 months! But if you're gonna read this story, I believe only the full length version will give you the scope of Dumas' writing. having a little knowledge of French is a help with this as there are many references in his vernacular. This translation comes with an excellent body of endnotes that further helps getting the fine points. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This review is for this version, not the book itself, which is amazing. If you are unfamiliar with the REAL version of Monte Cristo and didn't know that the actual novel is 1300+ pages, don't bother with this version unless it is required for a class. Nowhere on or in the book does it say that it is abridged, so unwitting readers could be duped into thinking this was the full version. False advertising.

The size of the book may dissuade some interests of ever reading the novel, but for those that did you're missing out.I believe that everyone has heard and probably guessed the storyline of \\"The count of Monte Cristo\\" either by watching the movie, or by reading the pathetic abridged version. I had watched the movie that was released in theaters many years ago, and comparing that to the novel it was wasted time and efforts.This book is a true masterpiece that will continue to be read by every generations to come.The plots and characters are intertwined so well in the story that every character has their important role to play, and not one should be left out.Of course there are less important characters in the story, but they serve as development and progress.For those that love to read world literature or love reading an interesting book in general, you should not miss this one out."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas's classic novel The Count of Monte Cristo is an absolutely brilliant book.

Definetly the best book ever!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book kept me up till 4 am many nights. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a good edition in English of a wonderful reading experience, which I looked over in a store. Is there anything new in it? No. But it is inexpensive and fairly well translated, tho nothing compares to Dumas pere's astonishing detail and clarity in the original language. Alas, it is abridged, which is dumbing it down in my opinion.This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and transformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society of the Restoration. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book (unabridged version). At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth and ambition are beyond the simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels if that isyour bag.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it in the original, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible, so why domb it down?Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I LOVE this book, therefore I was sorely dissapointed to discover that this is an abridged version and the amazon page did not indicate this at the time of my purchase (3/07)!! I post this to give you fair warning, buy the unabridged version, this is a FANTASTIC book!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Almost immediately in the story, Edmond Dantes, a poor 19th Century French sailor accused of a crime he did not commit, finds himself imprisoned for life in the infamous Chateau d'If. He might have died there were it not for a piece of good luck. He hears noise in an adjoining cell and digs his way to the sound, finding an old priest who tells him about a great fortune left undiscovered on the island of Monte Cristo in the Mediterranean Sea. The priest spends the next few years teaching the young, inexperienced sailor everything he knows about life and living and then dies. Dantes changes place with the dead priest, sewing himself into the winding sheet used to dispose of the priest's body. Dantes, not the priest, is thrown out of the Chateau into the sea where he is picked up by a passing vessel. He asks to be taken to the island of Monte Cristo where he discovers the fortune described by the priest. Dantes is reborn as the Count of Monte Cristo.All that I have mentioned is just prelude to one of the greatest stories of revenge ever writen. The reader is well advised to get the unabridged version of this novel and not be cheated out of any part of the Count's systematic and single minded pursuit of the men who betrayed him and sent him to prison.Many readers today will shy away from starting to read a book that lasts for over a thousand pages thinking that they might be bored with interminable pages of description and detail that add little to the development of the story. This concern is unjustified. The story always moves forward with a brisk pace and is entertaining on every page. Often we find ourselves astonished to have read so much at a single sitting. Hours pass like minutes as we accompany the Count on his mission of revenge.After years in prison Edmond Dantes has learned to be patient and the priest who taught him all he knows has given him a hope he thought was lost. &quot;Wait and hope&quot; are words which end this great adventure. The reader will not soon forget them."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I purchased the Scholastic version of the book so I could finish reading the novel (I had it on my PDA and lost my PDA). After finishing reading the Scholastic printing of the book, I found the book seemed to leave many unanswered questions, so I thought I would re-read it. It was then that I discovered that the scholastic publication is missing some of the chapters (though the included chapters are sequentially numbered). In fact, a person reading the Scholastic printing would never understand the most important act which caused Edmond Dantes so much grief, as that most important chapter, \\"the Conspiracy\\" is one of the omitted chapters. Thus, this printing is, in my humble opinion, worthless.The book, as a whole, is great, and I recommend the book (in its complete form) to anyone."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I know this seems a little over the top perhaps but Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Christo is just that in my opinion. The scale, the depth, the characterisation, and ultimately the story underpinning it all- a tale of a virtuous young man, wrongly imprisoned, mentally and physically due to the jealousy of others, and his resurrection from the abyss as an avenging angel to exact his revenge on those who inspired it- add up to a breathtaking picture spanning 1200 or so pages. In Edmond Dantes, Dumas has created a character which deep down we can all identify with as our pure inner self. All of us can remember our childhood when everything was a lot more natural and bereft of worry. He is careful to highlight Dantes strengths and flaws early on in the novel, so as we can appreciate this person against who this terrible act has been aimed. His transgression from innocent, naive but virtuous boy into the cold blooded man of the world, is excellently handled, and fits with the gap of years between his escape from the chateau d'if until his re-appearance as the chameleon he has become. The way that the plot comes together shows the time Dumas must have spent creating the jigsaw, and the ending is everything you could want and more. I implore you to read this book- the length of the script will keep you busy for some time admittedly- but the end result and the fact you will be able to look back afterwards and remember its message for a long time, should make this top of your to-read list. And amazingly it was based on a true case."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A piece of something lost. An elegance and order that is no longer available to this generation. That is what the Count of Monte Cristo takes us back to. As you follow Edmond Dant&eacute;s, a young and enterprising French fisherman, through a remarkable journey of long and torturous suffering and carefully wrought revenge you will soon gain a new definition of romance and adventure.The book starts it's story in early 19th century France in a small fishing village called Marseilles, where we first meet youthful Edmond Dant&eacute;s who is engaged to the most beautiful woman of his village and is soon to be the captain of his own vessel. Though ignorant and nave, he is beloved by all who know him and has amassed a great deal of friends, however, one with such good fortune also amasses many enemies. Through a series of events plotted by Fernand, who desperately covets Edmond's betrothed, Mercedes, and Danglars, a fellow sailor jealous of Edmond's new promotion to captain, Dant&eacute;s finds himself in prison for a crime he did not commit. Still ignorant of the scheme that put him in prison, or the plotters who ruined his life, Edmond waits in prison. This changes, however, when he meets his cellmate, Faria, an ancient abb&eacute; who is considered mad. This \\"mad\\" abb&eacute; will reveal an amazing secret to Edmond that will change the course of his fate forever, and hope is finally in his view. Dant&eacute;s emerges out of prison changed and worn cynical by a long and terrible imprisonment of 16 years. Though he assumes many identities, he gradually adopts the identity as the Count of Monte Cristo, an immensely wealthy and indifferent nobleman as he returns to Marseilles to wreck his much-thought over revenge individually on his plotters. His last words as the former Edmond Dant&eacute;s after he rewards one of his loyal friends are:\\"And now,\\" said the unknown (Edmond) \\"farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have been Heaven's substitute to recompense the good -now the God of Vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!\\" At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea.-The Count of Monte CristoHowever, Edmond cannot remain under the cover of the illustrious Count of Monte Cristo forever, and he will soon find that a heart even so indifferent and cold as his own cannot remain lifeless for long. This is an amazing novel of suspense, romance and betrayal. Alexandre Dumas weaves many stories into one enthrallingly suspenseful and complex story of love, hate, betrayal and loyalty. This book has no equal and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates classic and elegant, while exciting and adventurous, literature."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"First off, if your copy of The Count of Monte Cristo is only 350 pages long, throw it out and get this one.

I think that's usually called Cliff Notes.This 800 pound, 1100 page gorilla is a marvel of perpetual storytelling, a spellbinding page-turner despite its length, a plot so complicated one senses even the author had only a tenuous grasp upon it, and Dumas' prose style, the elegance of which might charitably be compared to King or Lovecraft.Doesn't matter -- 150 years on the culture's archetypal revenge drama still kicks like nobody's business. The initial betrayal of Edouard Dantes, his politically expedient persecution at the hands of an unscrupulous prosecutor, and his imprisonment in and escape from the Chateau D'If are the bits we recall from a dozen films, rip-offs, cartoons. But that's just the first 300 pages.Then comes the dazzling if at first puzzling stop-off for Carnival in Rome, where Dumas puts his predilication for stories within stories to spectacular use, and then Paris, where the bulk of the novel turns on The Count of Monte Cristo's mind-bogglingly complex plot to avenge himself against the four principals of his ruin.Does the plot hinge on one unlikely coincidence after another? Does the writing turn ludicrously purple? Can anyone, including Dumas, keep track of all these characters?Again, it just doesn't matter. This locomotive of pure story won't be denied. The pages fly by, leading to a conclusion of suprising power. The Count of Monte Cristo is considered to be one of the first \\"popular\\" novels ever written -- it remains one of the best. If only our current popular novelists could work such magic."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I admit, I was motivated to read the book because I saw the movie first. I don't know how I escaped both high school and college without reading this one, but I regret not having found it sooner. The movie, though enjoyable on its own, shares only one thing in common with the book: its title. Everything else has been inexplicably altered.There is sooo much more to the story. Here is a man, who, unfairly convicted and imprisoned for 14 years, has everything good in his life taken from him. He cunningly escapes prison, finds immense wealth, and spends the next 10 years plotting vengeance on those who took his former life away from him. He studies his enemies and, one by one, brings about their downfall and destruction by exploiting their vices. He also finds cause to reward those who did not betray him, and who lived irreproachable lives of unrewarded nobleness.The writing is enthralling and fast-paced. It is a fascinating story, well-told and impassioned. I wouldn't limit it to any specific audience, like juveniles or only those who know they like adventure stories ~ I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The characters in this book are so Shakespearian. They're all larger than life. We're not dealing with post-modern self-doubting everymen stumbling through life, these are extreme characters in extreme circumstances: it's not too often you're going to pause and say, \\"Hmmm, I know exactly how he feels.\\" Likewise the plot, action, and devices. It's all around a quest for revenge (or is it justice?), there are crucial letters, poisonings, star-crossed lovers' trysts, courtroom performances, disguises, last minute averted bankruptcy, and, for goodness sake, yet another of these meddlesome priests with their cunning plans to fake a death with an ingenious potion. We have dozens of prose soliloquies, characters turning over their plans, doubts and motivations, and wonderful extended dialogue, with people talking with a depth and precision mere mortals could never hope to improvise (even if there aren't as many killer one-liners in there).And while I'm making big comparisons why not throw in Tolkien: Dumas too has pulled off an epic. I can't think of many other books of this size that maintain such coherency. Now they do it in different ways, and Dumas teeters on the edge in a couple of places (while Tolkien is sublimely on track the whole time - he simply needed that many words to tell his story), but they both still manage to bring so much to a basic central story line. Most epics climax in book one, then have weak sequels added on once the publishers realise they have a hit. Most unsuccessfully try to reopen the old story and climb back in to a structure that will not fit them, and only undermine the superior complete original (Card, Jordan, Feist). Some series avoid this mistake by telling a new story within the old world (Pratchett, Leiber, Saberhagen), but this isn't making an epic. In the Mars series, Robinson gave himself freedom to continue because no character is indispensable, the future is open.But Dumas! Like I said, in a couple of places he's on the brink, but doesn't quite fall over. We wonder why we spend quite so much time with Franz - who turns out to be quite incidental - but in Dumas' defence, to meet Edmond reinvented as the Count through Franz' eyes is an intriguing and clever way to introduce him. Indeed, the book could almost have started here (and the second part does feel like an entirely new book for some time), but, like Tolkien, rather than leap in with the \`main' story, Dumas patiently and painstakingly has to paint the whole history before we get there. But while Tolkien splits up the major characters and has us desperately turning pages as he leaves each in cliff-hanger situations, Dumas has the slowest of slow burns running through the whole book. You don't have to read it all in a sitting, and as the protagonist points out, a simple and quick revenge would not be just or satisfying. So he takes his sweet time. Along the way some of the time he spends to flesh out the characters of the sons and daughters of the subjects of the Count's patient and comprehensive revenge seems liberal, but I suppose Dumas could say with his Count, \`What's your hurry?'And to carry you along you have this wonderfully sophisticated French high society. Being cool - or being honourable - is not only about ego and looking good, it has a major effect on your whole family's prospects. Make a fool of yourself in public, and you could lose your credibility - which could also cost you your house or your life. How you're presented, who presents you, and how you carry it off is a game with big stakes. There was an excellent SBS movie that caught something of this - about a relatively low income 19th Century noble who actually cares for the people on his land, and knows the only way to save them is to get them clean water. To afford this he needs the court's patronage - and the favour of the court has nothing to do with the needs of the poor, and everything to do with whether you are seen as having a lively wit. The decent noble has to play the dirtiest games to do good. It's in this sort of Dangerous Liaisons context that much of the drama takes place, and Dumas does it well (indeed he's probably the prototype).Moreover his count is a real triumph. He imagined the pinnacle of 19th Century cool and painted it. Moreover he gives us the whole process of just why this guy has got it so completely together. He's Shaft, James Bond, Miles Davis ... whoever ... you just can't touch him. So when the reader gets to see someone getting a bit close to his self-possession it has a real impact.When we do eventually get to the resolutions of the old wounds, they are powerful and satisfying. I said this is Shakespearian, and there's no pulling punches here - the crimes are terrible, the prices paid apposite, and both are vividly and minutely explored. Hence the massive length of the book - but this epic, unlike so many others, is coherent.And all this without even mentioning the fascinating central philosophical issue of just who the Count thinks he is to take charge of so many lives. Is he, as he contends, merely the agent of providence? But the way he treats those he cares for seems at times more cruel than the way he treats his foes! The torture he puts Morrel through can only be compared to God calling Abraham to sacrifice his son. Monte Cristo is unapologetically taking the role of God, and his justification is that:...There is neither happiness nor grief in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another - nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness...It's a tough one to try to pull off. Did he manage it? Let the discussions commence."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I love the Count of Monte Cristo, but I'm about a quarter of the way through and I feel like little pieces are being left out of the story from what I remember it to be. My memory could be wrong, so can anyone confirm if this is the unabridged version. Guess you can't beat the price though."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"If you're reading Dumas for the prose and the style of writing, the words \\"abridgement\\" tell you everything you need to know: this isn't the edition you want. Unfortunately, even if you're reading Dumas for the story, this /still/ isn't the edition you want. While there have been good abridgements -- the Signet Classic springs to mind as being relatively inoffensive -- this is not one of them; it butchers the story to such an extent that anyone who doesn't already know the tale is likely to come away with the impression that Dumas was a scatterbrained idiot who couldn't be bothered to keep track of what was happening in his own work.There is so much in Dumas that /can/ be sliced out without harming the integrity of the story that it's hard to see why the abridgers resorted to the measures they did. Whole subplots and, worse, parts of subplots are left on the proverbial cutting-room floor in apparent ignorance of the tangled mess this creates. Some of the decisions on what to keep and what to cut seem to have been made by throwing dice or flipping coins -- what possible train of thought could have led to the excising of climactic scenes of Monte Cristo's revenge on his tormentors so as to retain the chapter where Haydee recounts in vivid detail a story that's told later on in the book anyway?This edition is closely associated with the film version starring Antonio Banderas (who appears on the cover), and perhaps the edits to the text are made to keep it in step with the movie -- a bad choice, if so. While there is a (somewhat) coherent story left standing after the abridger has had his say, it hardly does justice to Dumas' original.Overall, a very, very disappointing edition. Even badly edited Dumas is better than no Dumas at all, so I can't in good conscience award it zero stars, but anyone interested in the Count's story -- whether via the movie, Dumas' other works, or recommendation, is strongly urged to consider another printing rather than purchasing this one. It's a fantastic adventure story -- I would rate better versions at four or five stars -- let down by sloppy abridgement."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading one of the greatest novels of all time, and the displeasure of seeing one of the worst movies. Both were The Count of Monte Cristo. If you've never had the pleasure of reading the book, I urge you, read it. But at all costs, stay away from the movie. Don't even watch it on cable for free. If you want to read an enriching tale, read The Count of Monte Cristo. It will not disapoint!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"WARNING: May include \\"spoilers\\".\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is the most extraordinary book I have ever read.The first aspect that makes it so interesting is its variety. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is usually described as an action-adventure novel about revenge. It is that, but it is also much, much more. It is a fantasy novel, a romance novel, a mystery novel, a horror novel, a comedy, and a social satire. There is something in this novel that will please nearly every reader.The second aspect of the novel that causes it to be so wonderful is the characters. There is, of course, first and foremost, Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo. Dantes is an amazingly charismatic character. He is also incredibly complex, being at once a philanthropist and a sadist, a man who is remarkably intuitive about what motivates his enemies but who at the same time is frequently oblivious to the feelings of the people who he cares about. For example, he thinks that Haydee, a beautiful Greek-princess-turned-slave, loves him like a father. He's right about the love part, but not the \\"like a father\\" part. In parts of the novel, he appears God-like, in others, he is compared, not entirely without justification, to the Devil. Edmond Dantes is fascinating.Then there are the secondary characters. The secondary characters in this novel are such that you can't help but wish that many of them had their own novel for which they could act as protagonist. There's Albert de Morcerf, Eugenie Danglars, and Haydee. Of the three, Haydee is my personal favourite. She is, initially, somewhat annoying due to her hyper-sensitive, cloying, and comedically melodramatic nature. Gradually, however, as the reader learns more about her tragic past, it becomes extremely easy to sympathize with her and care for her. She later demonstrates her inner strength when she aids in the ruination of Albert de Morcerf, one of the men who had betrayed Edmond. Both she and the Count have gone through similar experiences and are remarkably alike, which helps makes the novel's conclusion logical and rewarding.An additional aspect of the novel that makes it qualify as a classic are its themes and the way the novel presents those themes. Dumas pokes fun at the aristocracy, mocks the often contradictory social values of his day, and philosophizes about revenge, love, hate, and philosophy itself, among other things.Some readers have complained that the plot is too complex and confusing. I, for one, found that not being certain about what the Count's plans were made the novel all the more interesting. As well, some readers have said that too much of the plot relies on coincidence, luck, etc. True, some portions of the novel stretch believability, however, I did not find that this in any way damaged my enjoyment of the novel. The story is, in many ways, allegorical, as a result, the occasional implausible plot twist makes little difference in whether a reader enjoys the story or not.It's impossible to summerize what makes this novel so wonderful in a simple review. I strongly advise against reading the abridged version, because there's something worthwhile on every page of the full-length novel. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is that rare specimen of a book that manages to be intellectually and emotionally satisfying, and, at the same time, is extremely fun to read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read this book for a high school book report in 1966. And I mean I read every page. When I started reading the book I had the feeling that I had bit off much more than I could chew. The book is over 1400 pages which would be a very large book for a 16 year old. I found that I could not put the book down. The writing and the intrigue of the manuscript was spell binding. I even read on the week ends and late into the night. I have forgotten much about the book but I am in the process of buying the book to read again now that I am 52 years old. If you want a spell binding, can not put it down, book to read - this is a strong candidate."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Never in my life have I read such an outstanding work as \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Alexandre Dumas is brilliant in bringing us an air tight story of a naive young man who is unjustly accused of aiding the Napoleanic uprising. He spends fourteen years in prison until he finally escapes, bent on revenge. Every single chapter was crucial--nothing was thrown in just because. All extra subplots had a reason for being there and were all excellently intertwined, as each furthered the main plot. Nothing is left to chance. That is master storytelling and that is what makes a book not just good, but oustanding! If you want a good, thick novel to curl up with, this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed. Highly readable and bursting with history."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book, The Count of Monte Cristo, is an engrossing tale of loyalty, revenge, and obsession that can still teach lessons today. Edmond Dantes seems set for life: the young man is now the captain of a ship, his best friends are his father and his boss, Morrel, and he is set to be married to a beautiful girl named Mercedes. But two men, Danglars and Fernand, are jealous of him for different reasons (Danglars for his job, Fernand for his fiancee). This jealousy comes in the form of a conspiracy so that both will be benefited: a letter is written saying that Dantes is a Napoleonic agent (he is not). He is further crossed by the ambitious magistrate de Villefort, who destroys the only piece of evidence because it implicates his father and sends him to prison, using the Napoleonic phobia of the time. While there, he meets the brilliant yet enigmatic Abbe Faria, who teaches him several languages and they collaborate on how to escape. The Abbe has an attack, he tells Dantes to leave without him, so he does. But before the Abbe dies, he tells Dantes about the magnificent treasure of Monte Cristo, and then the adventure begins as Dantes gets the treasure and lives extravagantly for a while, then he comes to pay vengeance to his enemies and rewards to his friends. This book is quite long, but I could not imagine it being shorter: it is the perfect size for the story. This is one of the best books of all time for a reason, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in adventure."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In the story, as written by Alexander Dumas, the reader is entraced into a world of peace, war, honor, nobility, piratery, prison, crimes, and most importatly their vengeance.

A MUST read for any literate adult or high school-college student."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Ever since I was in 9th grade I have read The Count of Monte Cristo every summer. I can't seem to start the next school year without reading it one more time. Each time I discover more about the characters and I relate to their struggles. I wish that I could give this book more that 5 stars because it is better than that. I have made all my roommates read this book. Each time they come back to me and thank me for making them read it. It is an excellent story of lost love, despair, and revenge. You will not be disappointed, I promise. You literally wont be able to put it down.

On a more relevant note, the Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best novels I have ever read. Period. I have always been an avid reader, and since high school I have been required to read rather tedious books, some from the same era as Dumas. However, the Count of Monte Cristo stands above the rest from its time; it is an amazing story, and to not read it due to its size is a terrible decision. In fact, the intricate, detailed, and entertaining plot of the book necessitates more pages to explain. This translation is superb. It keeps you awake, and it has a modern feel to it, as it should, all the while retaining the feel of the orginal transcript. One note I should make is as such: do not, and I repeat, DO NOT attempt to read this book over an extended period of time, as there are many characters and plot points you ought to remember throughout the course of the novel."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"If there's one thing I can't stand is when people liberally give out 5 stars on books; epecially when a book doesn't deserve it. I rarely give out 5 stars, so a book really has to \\"wow\\" me and go way over the bar. The Count of Monte Cristo is such a book. Dumas grabs your attention right from the beginning, and never lets go. There's not one boring moment, and I kept wondering: \\"What's going to happen next?!\\" It's incredible. Edmond Dante, a sucessful sailor, is promoted captain and is about to marry a beautiful girl, when two men, jealous of him, devise a way to get him out of the way of their own ambitions. Dante is imprisoned, ecapes, and vows revenge on them. This is only 3 of 200 books I read that deserve 5 stars, so I recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Of all the books I've ever read, this is one of my favorite. But all my good memories of it come from the first third of the book. Up until the end of chapter 30 I'd give the book five stars, but after that it's pretty long-winded and drawn out (And that's 87 more chapters!) . Furthermore I didn't even like any of the characters introduced after the first 30 chapters, except two I'll mention below, who were very minor characters.The first thirty chapters deal with Dantes being unjustly imprisoned and spending a miserable 14 years in the Chateau d'If. The story of his imprisonment, escape, and coming to riches and power culminates in his saving his old boss from financial ruin and suicide. It's a fantastic story but after that it's on to a long, drawn out, extremely wordy, and ultimately not-very-satisfying revenge on those who put him in prison. The main characters during these 87 chapters, aside from Dantes, his woman, and the four men who put him in prison are Haydee (the beautiful, but disturbingly reclusive Greek woman), Albert (the hotheaded son of Monte Cristo's old rival Fernand), Madame Danglars (the shrewish wife of Danglars), H&eacute;lose de Villefort (the one-dimensional murderer whose love for her child is her only emotion), Franz d'Epinay, (a nice guy, but forgettable), and a host of other forgettable characters. Finally, there are Valentine de Villefort and Maximilien Morrel: two annoying and sappy lovers who remind me exactly of Cosette and Marius from Les Miserables. If you liked those two you'll love the latter half of the book. I detested them and the latter half of the book gave them an unfortunately large amount of sappy-time.So that's the principle problem with the last 87 chapters: I don't like any of the characters. I wasn't even all that fond of Dant&egrave;s during this part. The only characters I even remotely liked were Ali, Monte Cristo's slave, and Noitier de Villefort, who talks by blinking. Everyone else is either annoying or forgettable. This means that the almost the entire last 87 chapters are dedicated to conversations among all these annoying or forgettable people, very little of which was interesting.Still, my memories are mostly fond. It's only when I put on my critic's hat that I began to realize how bored I was during the last two-thirds of the book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good long read. The abridged version would probably be better for the non-OCD type, as it'll cut out a lot of the superfluous stuff."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I like reading older books, and I like reading longer books, but this older longer book just seemed to drag on and on. The section describing the \\"drug trip\\" was particularly tedious. I did some reading about the book and apparently this was a popular sort of scene in the time period in which Dumas was writing. I was yawning through it. While there was war, violence, and intrigue, I think a good editor \\"trimming off the fat\\" would have really helped Dumas's writing for most of the last 2/3 of the book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The TOR Edition is full of typos.

I don't usually recommend books so highly, but this novel is more than just a &quot;classic&quot; your high school teacher would have you read simply because it's set in the Napoleonic era, it's a GOOD book. :)"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Do not short change yourself by watching a movie version of this classic,you'll miss too much! I really liked this book about a man wrongly accused and imprisoned. Edmond Dantes is sent to prison and there he meets his benefactor, a man many believe is crazy. This so called crazy man teaches Edmond everything from foreign languages to science, these will come in handy once Edmond is able to put into action his plans for revenge on those who are responsible for his stay in prison. Edmond is finally able to escape from prison after many years (I can't tell you how, read the book!) and is now able to seek revenge on those who have wronged him in the past. Now the fun part starts as Edmond begins to piece by piece ruin the lives of his enemies who have long forgotten that Edmond might still exist. I can't tell you what the Count of Monte Cristo has in store for these people you will have to find out for yourself and you're sure not to be dissappointed!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo was one of the best books I have ever read. It's full of colorful dialect. It has just enough detail to give you a sense of what it would be like there, but not so much that it bores you. It goes through all the stages and emtions of human life and puts the important things of life into perspective. Many classics tend to be a little boring and hard to follow and understand, but Dumas puts excitement and life into his book which makes it easier to follow. The Count of Monte Cristo is not a book that is easily forgotten."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Well, as any person would first notice about this book, it's HUGE! Or, at least it looked that way. I found the random use of French words irritating and i think that if a book is going to be translated they should at least translate it all of the way. I understand that the French is supposed to make an impression on me, but i like to know what i'm reading about. I love the plot. I love being able to constantly have to remember people who have not been mentioned in around 400 pages and have to test my brain to keep the plot straight. The other great thing is to be able to realize what's happening befor eit has been pointed out. READ THIS! pace yourself, and, if you don't like remembering too much at once, make a flow chart!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte CristoThe story of a young sailor, Edmond Dantes who is soon to be betrothed to his love, Mercedes. A love despised by her brother, Fernand, who seeks the beautiful Mercedes for his own bride, and the calculated hate of Danglar's, Edmond's rival for the position of Captain on the Phareon. A treacherous letter written by his enemies denouncing him as a Bonapartist thrusts Edmond into the hands of the law where the deputy pro curei, Villefort, decides to sentence Dantes to the Chat e tif, an island prison for political prisoners, to pursue his own ambitions. Thus begins the tale of love and hate for Edmond Dantes, the sailor, and subsequently, the Count of Monte Cristo's merciless revenge of his Imprisoners. Without out a doubt Alexandre Dumas has written one of the greatest romance stories of all time. Duma develops the most amazing plot that has many twists and turns. He immerses the reader into the anxious world of France, just after Napoleon's demise in 18414 to just before the second revolution of France, blending in the plight of the lower classes mixed feelings hate and acceptance of Louis the XVIII, and the constant fears of the aristocracy, whose every moment brims with the fear that Napoleon, the accursed, shall return from exile on the island of Elba. The reader walks through the winding streets of Marseilles and the dark and smelly dungeons of the Chat e tif, a tribute to the author's on site research. Dumas's writing beautifully blends the language of the rough spoken sailor with the eloquence of the elite with subtle humor and powerful soliloquies. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to blaze through a classic story of love, hate, and revenge from one of France's greatest writers. I promise you will never stop turning the page to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This was one of my favorite books while I was a teenager--an elaborate plot, love, betrayal, wealth, what else can a teenager want.

His unbearable captivity in the Chateau d'If lasts until his ingeniously conceived escape fourteen years later. When he returns to wreak his terrible vengeance on the men who imprisoned him, he is no longer the naive, idealistic Edmond Dantes; he is the cunning, cynical, and fabulously rich Count of Monte Cristo.The complex plot of the book makes it slightly challenging, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate. I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Ok, Ok, ok. I will be honest. The only problem with this book is that I didn't find it on my own and had to rely on the public school system to help me discover it. I couldn't help but tink that it would make the best movie ever, and then I saw the version with Chamberlin...ew...a mistake...but should Hollywood ever decide to try again, they have a Mercedes wannabe in Virginia.

But this is a story that is believed because we the readers want to believe that the injustices in the world will be righted. And couple that with thrilling adventure, cultural flavor, interesting characters with hidden pasts, tapestried rooms with dirty secrets, and a dashing hero who rises from his lowest to become the angel of justice, this is a book that will never lose its charm.

The character of Dantes is developed to perfection as are his enemies. You want him to get them all.

Highly recommended in my opinion - read it you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Counte Of Monte Cristo is my favorite book.

Something i would like to add to the reviews already up there is that the writing is so timeless. The intrigue, the stocks, comments about the police arriving late and the youth going to the dogs.. you could supplant horses with cars and have the setting in the late 20th century!

This novel is a breathtaking, in-your-face story that spans an entire continent in order to get the full picture accross to its readers.Dumas gave so much life to the characters he created, and though it is sometimes hard to figure out what is going on at that very moment, you are always helped out a few pages down--that is the gift that Dumas brings to his readers!

It's not like the three musketeers, with a brawl every two minutes, though I also liked 3 Musketeers. It's more for the type who like to read about manipulation, greed, and intrigue out the wazoo.....and a lot of people dying spasmodically. As for the comments that it's boring, well, Dumas is occasionally long winded, but the story is extremely clever all in all, and pretty much anybody can see a little bit of himself/herself in Edmond Dantes, or vice-versa."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I first read this book only because my mother nodded her head when she saw it, and I enjoyed the Three Muskeeters.

It may take some time to read, and the story may have many characters, but he develops everything so well and brings it all together.Not only is the story itself well developed and fascinating, but Dumas presents many other angles to observe and watch for while reading this book. The entire plot itself is a study of morals, honor, and ontological questions.

I have always enjoyed the Oxford Classics series, they're all really well done, especially for paperbacks, they're the top of the line for softcover books, them and Barnes and Noble :Dhappy reading!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"We all know this book is a classic. The plot is excellent and the character development is unlike almost anything else I have read (if not EVERYTHING else). As this book is a literary classic, I will compare the book mostly to the film version bearing the same name.I saw the movie at least 10 times before reading the book. I have to say, being a cultural elitist, that I enjoyed the plot of the movie better.SPOILER ALERT!!!At first I thought Danglars was completely left out of the movie and the antagonists (Danglars and Fernand) were combined in to a single person (Count Mondego). My wife later corrected me, as Danglars was in the movie. The problem then became that Danglars had such a small role it didn't make much of an impression on me. I actually APPRECIATE this Hollywood approach. Danglars and Fernand in the book are little weasels, but I have to say I didn't really \\"hate\\" them. They were just snivelers. The movie brings out the human emotion and thus the hatred of the single antagonist in a much more astonishing way.REAL SPOILER ALERT!!!The movie version is centered on the love story between Edmond and Mercedes. This is not the case in the book. Hollywood made Albert the son of Edmond...that isn't the case in the book either. It is thus hard to say which I prefer. In the book the Count at the end sails off in to the sunset (literally) with his Grecian Princess Haidee. In the book the family is reunited and finally happy. Either ending suits me. If Albert were truly the son of Edmond, the happy family approach wouldn't much work.The real awesomeness (if I may use that word) of the book is in its character development. I have to say I was wondering if there was a glitch with my Kindle when I was only 33% done with the book and Edmond has already attained the the treasure. I guessed after 2/3 of the book that the last 1/3 would be about Edmond reuniting with Mercedes...boy was I wrong! The character development was incredibly deep. If you have never read the book, but adore the movie...you should read the book.Be warned though....it is just about as long as the Bible, and pulls you in to the richness of Europe in the 1800's."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is, to me at least, Dumas' capstone work. While his other works are, without a doubt, amazing in their own rights, nothing can capture the amount of emotional connection and intrigue present in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" The translation found here is well-done (of course, you always have minor snags when reading a translated work), but it does not detract from the story.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is the tale of a young sailor, well-loved by both family and the wider community. Jealousy, at the hands of a friend, causes this sailor to be imprisoned for a vast portion of his life. When he is able to escape due to an act of God, it would seem, the time has come to right the wrongs that have been afflicted upon him....What is present in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" will no doubt make you become connected to Edmond Dontes, his lost fianc&eacute;e, and will make you wish for revenge on his behalf. Every detail in this plot is crucial, as Dumas writes with a beautifully complex, yet highly readable style. The prose is wonderful. Suspense is in high quantities at all points in this novel, as you are driven along the tragic path of Edmond Dontes' life and witness his attempt to ameliorate those wrongs done against him....is it karma, or is it divine providence, Dumas asks. That is left to you to decide...This is highly recommended, and for a free price, why not?"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Just started this book a week ago.

Accused of treason, he is betrayed by those close. Vivid characters riddle the book with personality and it's suspense and language kept me up 'til my alarm clock rang for work the next morning - I didn't want to leave the world that was made such a comfortable home for me, the world of The Count of Monte Cristo.Truly this book proves that it is not the destination, but rather the journey that makes all worth while.It is pure adventure, a hypnotic and tantalizing tale of romance and revenge and the transformation of a man.Don't settle for the movie, as the book is worth every second spent reading. My only regret is having read the abridged version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In my opinion The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most riveting literary masterpieces of all time. For anyone who is looking for a novel that combines romance with high adventure will find this a highly satisfying book. The story is set in 19th century France. The storyline concerns a young man named Edmond Dantes who has his whole life ahead of him. After being promoted to ship captain, he makes plans to marry the love of his life, Mercedes. He is suddenly betrayed by three jealous rivals and arrested on the eve of his wedding, being unjustly and falsely accused of treason. He is transported to an island fortress prison where he remains in confinement for fourteen years. Dante's dying cellmate reveals to him that there is a vast, hidden treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond promises to escape the dungeon and seek out the treasure. After orchestrating a narrow escape, Dantes finally discovers the vast fortune on Monte Cristo. Edmond Dantes becomes the Count of Monte Cristo and returns to Paris to seek out the one he loves and also to use his new fortune to seek out revenge on his betrayors. A tale of high adventure, romance, and vengeance. Personally, I would highly reccomend taking time to read the complete and unabridged version. What's the point of reading an abridged or condensed classic? The Count of Monte Cristo is a masterful work by Alexandre Dumas."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a hurting, vengeful, magnificently wealthy man who is bent on paying back the people from his past who took away all of life's gifts in one action - love, family, peace, and hope when he was a nineteen year old child still full of vision, love to give, tenderness, and dreams. Throughout this story I am constantly amazed at the insight into human emotion, pain, intricacy and joy that Alexander Dumas had. The story fills your head with another time and place- it takes you there. You hurt for the Count, begin to understand his thinking and are with him as he incredibly takes revenge on the men of his past and their families by becoming one of them, and later begins to see that vengence is, in fact, not his alone. As he begins to desire peace once again, he begins to feel again...and to weep for the love lost. This book is more than amazing - it is an experience that has put into me considerations and dreams that move me still - long after I have finished looking at its pages. The invitation? ...Come and ache and love and hate and hurt and grow and LIVE! Go to another time, another place that will effect and move you, and perhaps change you, here and now. It's worth your time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read the Count of Monte Cristo after the movie had already come out. As a 14 year old I set high standards for it because the storyline in the movie really pulled me in. What I got was a book that completely shattered those high standards and raised the bar still higher! The Penguin Classics version has a great translation and you feel as though Alexandre Dumas' words and lines are living. You feel as though you are living in the Napoleon era and can witness all these heart stopping adventures in the process of exacting revenge. I would highly recommend this book to action, suspense, adventure, and even romance story lovers. This book is on my top 5 list. I'm even re-reading it! I started to read the abridged version but I don't recommend this because comparing it with the unabridged you find it hasty, vague and not as engrossing. Unless you are younger or want an ok book that reads faster then you should try the abridged version. So go out and buy this book but don't be intimidated by the size because by the end you will wish it was three times as thick!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Beloved classic literature for $.99! I had already read the book at least 3 times over the last 55+ years, but I wanted it on my Kindle so that I could read a chapter or 2 between reading through other books in my library (Sort of a change of pace kind of thing). It's not like I don't know how it ends. I started reading it after knocking off 2 of Dean Koontz's \\"Odd Thomas\\" novels. Rather than starting the latest \\"O. T.\\" thing, I started re-reading the \\"Count\\", and became too engrossed in it to go on to something else.What I like most about the Kindle edition is being able to get a dictionary definition of many of the archaic and out of use words that must have been commonly used in the 19th century.The use of the word \\"Illustrated\\" is a little misleading - I've read over hallf of the book and found only 1 small drawing of the publisher's logo at the top of the beginng page. However, this edition includes an excellent foreward with numerous links to Wikipedia, that gives the reader a sense of the times in which the story takes place. I suppose the foreward \\"illustrates\\" the history of France in those times."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I downloaded this book a long while ago because it was free and a well-known classic. The length of it put me off for a while but I am very glad I took the plunge and read it. What I loved most was the Count's inteligence and insight into human nature to the point where he knew exactly how each of his victims would react to his plot against them. It is very long but has become one of my favorites!If you have watched the movie and thought it was just OK you definitely need to read the book because it a whole lot better!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Let me say first that this is NOT the book I read when I was in school. For years I had a vague recollection of The Count of Monte Cristo as some required reading, a tale of a man wronged and his ensuing adventure as he attempted to take his revenge and right the wrongs done to him. As a child, I knew nothing of the foreign origins of some books and the process of translation to make them accessible to me nor of the concept of abridging a document from the original form as written to a presumably more digestible, shrunken version better suited to those with shorter spans of attention or time constraints.The story, to be painfully brief: This is the story of Edmund Dantes, a man of bright prospects and on the verge of wedding the beautiful Mercedes. Betrayed by envious friends, Edmund finds himself spirited away to a prison island. Despondent and having given up all hope of his release and of a reunion with the love of his life, he resigns himself. While in the depths of despair, he meets an eclectic and learned fellow inmate. They immediately bond and Edmund's newfound friend becomes as a father to him and proceeds to teach him all that he knows: languages, culture... and of a mind-boggling buried treasure. Edmund manages to escape the island prison years later and makes his way to the island of the buried treasure, not really expecting to find it. What he finds is treasure so vast as to make a king blush. Newly wealthy, learned, and free, Edmund assumes the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo and sets in motion the machinery of revenge...I returned to this book as an adult to satisfy my own curiosity and to add flesh to my memory of the adventures of Edmund Dantes that were admittedly skeletal. Because of my previous experience, I was expecting the same stilted, simple read I remembered, a children's book. Initially I was shocked, having done some research to lead me to this particular translation, to find over 1,200 pages of text. That rivals the intimidating girth of my copy of War and Peace. I took the plunge, though I also committed myself to dropping the project once it became apparent that I'd never make it to the end. I needn't have worried. To my amazement and pleasure, I found a tale of adventure of epic proportion replete with revenge, murder, love and loss, in the best tradition of operatic drama. For those of you who love to read and shy away from this because you think you've already read it or that it is only for children... trust me: you haven't, and it's not.This review is for the particular version translated by Robin Buss. This is an excellent and modern translation, executed with an academic's eye for accuracy but the flow and readability of a novelist. Anyone who has compared different translations of novels knows how vastly different the two readings can be. It is not just a matter of age, either, where modern readers can stumble over words or stylistic cues that one may consider archaic. It has more to do with the translator's understanding of the intent of the author, of the subtleties of style, of context, both historical and within the story itself. The Buss translation is, in my opinion, THE translation to read. The beauty of it is that the translation does not get in the way, it is invisible. It is the author Dumas one hears, not the translator Buss, and that is the brilliance of this translation. As a bonus, there are fully thirty pages of notes on the text at the back which I found illuminating and useful.But 1,200 pages, you say? Don't have time, you say? I was so thoroughly sucked into this tale of revenge and adventure I completely lost track of time. By the time I finished I felt only that it was far, far too short. I suppose it has to be so that, as a child, I was offered only the abridged version; I would never have put up with a book as long as this one. As an adult who loves to read and appreciate, however, I will be forever grateful to have been let back to this rich, amazing tale at full strength. I recall turning pages by the hundreds, fully engrossed; the lawn mowing would have to wait until next weekend...Make no mistake, while reading this unabridged version will evoke in you a child's excitement and sense of adventure, this is a book for adults to appreciate. Read it, enjoy it, get lost in it. Unequivocally recommended at five stars."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"this book is one of my favorites. once you get to the action, you simply cant put it down. it is filled with something for everyone: betrayal, action, murder, romance, and even a little mystery."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can't tell you the number of times that I have read The Count of Monte Cristo.

The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action.

He did a wonderful job with the different accents of the various characters. It was truly a joy to listen to.I picked this up at a whim on a trip to the local library, not knowing the impact Dantes would have over me for the next two months. I found myself driving slow, taking the long way to my destination in order to listen to more of the book. Don't be alarmed by the largeness of the volume. It is a great story, easy to follow, and full of adventure. This is VERY different from the popular movie from a few years ago, so seeing the movie doesn't mean you know how the story goes or ends!

Unbeknownst to him, there are some who are jealous of his successes in life, and seek to destroy him, namely Fernand Mondego, Caderousse, Baron Danglars, and Gerard de Villefort. Danglars, Caderousse and Fernand write a letter claiming that Edmond is a Bonapartist agent, and should be imprisoned immediately. Edmond is then unjustly imprisoned in Chateau d'If for life by Gerard de Villefort, the judge at his trial. In prison, Edmond meets Abbe Faria, the Mad Priest, and learns of the treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo. Edmond manages to escape prison and uncovers the great wealth hidden on the island. With his newfound wealth and power, he seeks revenge upon those who wronged him.\\"I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.\\"-Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo.The majority of the conflict in the book is Character vs. Character external. There is plenty of internal conflict however, as we note when Edmond no longer can say, \\"God is for and with me\\".This novel is exceptionally well written. The only problem with it is that there are many characters and its sort of hard to keep track of them all. However, I like how Edmond sneaks around and pretends to be so many different people, Lord Wilmore, the Count of Monte Cristo, Abbe Busoni, Sinbad the Sailor. I love how deep this book is also. Makes you think. Is it just to punish those who have wronged you? Is it ok for you to take the place of Providence and carry out your vengeance? The Bible says that vengeance is the LORD's, and that man shouldn't try to take matters into their own hands, like Monsieur Dantes did. Personally, I don't think Edmond should have executed his vengeance like he did, but then we wouldn't really have such an interesting book, now would we? I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I first read this in high school and have since then read it many more times. Dumas is a master plot creator, and this is his best. Nothing is harder to do, and more important, than the creation of an ingenious, original, complex plot. This is what holds all of the threads together, the characterizations, the motives, the scenes. Dumas is one of the world's greatest in this regard.Then, Dumas' simple, direct style impels the reader along from page to page.

Dumas captures the imagination of his readers as he leads them through the life of Edmond Dantes. Through Dantes, Dumas relates to everyone who has ever wanted adventure, romance, and of course revenge. It seems as though Dantes is a real human. Dumas uses true tallent in the way he shows the feelings, thoughts, and actions of every character in his novel. This novel is long but never old. It captures the mind in a truly complex intertwined story of a poor young man accused of a crime he never committed. For this, his wonderful life is destroyed. He spends several years in prison. Upon his release he then uses his acquired knowledge to repay his enemies in a most interesting way. All of this leads to an ending that is as good as the rest of the story. This is truly a masterpiece worth reading. Everyone should read this novel. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Just finished reading this classic novel again for the second time. I read it the first time over fifteen years ago and at that time I considered it to be my favorite novel ever. Since then, I have probably read close to a thousand books (which is about as many as Harriet Klausner reads in a month) in the past decade and a half, and I still have to put this one alone at the top. It's the best! Reading it a second time made me appreciate it even more.I have seen all of the movies that have been made from this incredible book. None of them have even come close to doing the novel justice. It is great to see that most of the Amazon reviewers concur! At the time I am writing this review, there have been 80 reviews of this book and it still is able to retain a five-star rating. That says a lot. Most of the classic novels that have been reviewed on Amazon have 4 and a half stars. However, not this one!A lot of novels (particularly ones that are considered classics) take a while for the reader to really get into them. Not this one folks. From the first chapter on, the novel takes hold of you and just never lets go. Believe me, once you start reading this it's almost impossible to stop. You don't want to sleep, you don't want to eat, you don't want to talk to anyone, etc... all you want to do is continue reading on about the life story of our hero Edmund Dantes. The book may look a bit long, but believe me, you will be wishing that it was a hec of a lot longer once you are finished with it.So order this now and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Just a quick review on one or two technical details that someone might want to know who already knows what a great classic story this is. Why this translation? Why kindle if I have to read it from start to finish every time? I'm glad you asked.Pretend I've already gushed about how wonderful the book is, Dumas is, and all that. Now, let's get down to business. I first read the \\"unabridged\\" version published by Modern Library back in the mid 1990s. I thought it was unabridged because it was so long and nothing seemed to be left out: subplots, dialogue, characters, etc. What I didn't know until the Robin Buss translation came to my attention years later was that I had been reading the Victorian version of the novel. One that ranks right up there with Constance Garnett's translations of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (avoid them if you don't want \\"watered-down\\" versions.) The point is they left out the more \\"adult\\" things that would have put off or shocked Victorian readers back then. They also side-stepped language idioms to avoid confusion.Ten years ago when I was shopping for a replacement translation, I used a little litmus test on evey copy I picked up to see what the translator did in a certain scene. It's the beginning of chapter 49 or 50 (depending on which edition you have) titled \\"HAYDEE\\" or \\"HAIDEE,\\" in which the Count enters the quarters of his slave Haydee and she asks him why did he ask for permission to enter her room rather than just come in. He says something like, \\"Haydee, you know,\\" or \\"Haydee, you well know.\\" To which she responds (in the ML edition), \\"Why do you address me so coldly, so distantly?\\" ...WHAT?!For someone like myself who had never read the original French editon this came off as a bizarre thing to say. It's like: Babe! He's only said three or four words to you since he entered the room- what are you talking about? But then I discovered the Robin Buss translation and he explains that like many romance languages there is a formal and an informal way of saying \\"you\\" to someone. In Spanish it's \\"tu\\" vs. \\"usted.\\" In French it's \\"tu\\" vs. \\"vous.\\" So in the original novel Monte Cristo responds with the formal word \\"vous\\" which causes her to question him. However, since in English there is only one version of \\"you\\" for any situation, it wouldn't make sense for her to ask, \\"Why do you not say 'tu' to me as usual?\\" Robin Buss corrects this and I am thankful for it.Finally, to address the practical problem of this version not having mobi-like chapter navigation or access. This does stink. If you're like me and sometimes enjoy rereading a book out of order because you like to revisit favorite parts, you're out of luck unless you know exactly the digit location of the paragraphs you seek. The solution is simple even though it does take a little time. I found out that by bookmarking every first page of a new chapter, it allows me to create a table of contents that I can navigate through by going to the \\"My notes and marks\\" menu. Like I said, you do have to go through the book at least once to obtain these marks, but it's worth it if you ever want to go back and refer to a chapter somewhere in the middle of this epic without going crazy.Hope this helps with customers who were unsure why they should consider this translation or were thinking of skipping it altogether because it has no automatic chapter navigation.Thank you and happy reading!March 2010 Update: Found out table of contents IS accessible on the kindle. Sorry for the confusion. Either my kindle was updated, or I didn't read the directions onscreen when searching the TOC."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas p&egrave;re. Highly recommended.As translator Robin Buss points out in his introduction, many of those who haven't read The Count of Monte Cristo assume it is a children's adventure story, complete with daring prison escape culminating in a simple tale of revenge. There is very little for children in this very adult tale, however. Instead, the rich plot combines intrigue, betrayal, theft, drugs, adultery, presumed infanticide, torture, suicide, poisoning, murder, lesbianism, and unconventional revenge.Although the plot is roughly linear beginning with Edmond Dant&egrave;s' return to Marseille, prenuptial celebration, and false imprisonment and ending with his somewhat qualified triumphant departure from Marseille and France, Dumas uses the technique of interspersing lengthy anecdotes throughout. The story of Cardinal Spada's treasure, the origins of the Roman bandit Luigi Vampa (the least germane to the novel), Bertuccio's tale of his vendetta, and the account of the betrayal and death of Ali Pasha are few of the more significant stories-within-the-novel. While Dumas devotes an entire chapter to bandit Luigi Vampa's background, he cleverly makes only a few references to what will remain the plot's chief mystery-how the youthful, intelligent, and naive sailor Edmond Dant&egrave;s transforms himself into the worldly, jaded, mysterious Renaissance man and Eastern philosopher, the count of Monte Cristo, presumably sustained by his own advice of \\"wait\\" and \\"hope.\\"This novel is not a simple tale of simple revenge. The count does not kill his enemies; he brilliantly uses their vices and weaknesses against them. Caderousse's basic greed is turned against him, while Danglars loses the only thing that has any meaning for him. Fernand is deprived of the one thing that he had that he had never earned-his honour. In the process, he loses the source of his initial transgression, making his fate that much more poignant. The plot against Villefort is so complicated that even Monte Cristo loses control of it, resulting in doubt foreign to his nature and remorse that he will not outlive.This long but generally fast-paced is set primarily in Marseille, Rome, and Paris. It begins with Dant&egrave;s' arrival in Marseille aboard the commercial vessel Pharaon and ends with his departure from Marseille aboard his private yacht, accompanied by the young, beautiful Greek princess Hayd&eacute;e. What gives The Count of Monte Cristo its life, however, are the times in which it is set-the Revolution, the Napoleonic era, the First and Second Restoration, and the Revolution of 1830. Life-and-death politics motivates many of the characters and keeps the plot moving. Dumas also uses real people in minor roles, such as Countess G- (Byron's mistress) and the Roman hotelier Signor Pastrini, which adds to the novel's sense of historical veracity.The most troubling aspect of The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmond Dant&egrave;s himself. His claim to represent a higher justice seems to justify actions and inactions that are as morally reprehensible as those that sent him to prison, for example, his account of how he acquired Ali and his loyalty. Had he not discovered young Morrel's love for Valentine Villefort, she too might have become an innocent victim. As it is, there are at least two other innocents who die, although one clearly would not have been an innocent for long based on his behaviour in the novel. One wonders of Dant&egrave;s' two father figures, his own flower-loving father and fellow prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, would have approved of the count.The translation appears to be good, with a few slips into contemporary English idioms that sound out of place. In his introduction, Buss states that the later Danglars and Fernand have become unrecognizable and that Fernand in particular has been transformed \\"from the brave and honest Spaniard with a sharp sense of honour . . . to the Parisian aristocrat whose life seems to have been dedicated to a series of betrayals.\\" There is never anything honest or honourable about Fernand; his very betrayal of Edmond is merely the first we know of in his lifelong pattern.What seems extreme and somewhat unrealistic about Fernand is his transformation from an uneducated Catalan fisherman into a \\"Parisian aristocrat,\\" hobnobbing with statesmen, the wealthy, and the noteworthy of society. This, however, is the result of the milieu that the novel inhabits. During these post-Revolution, post-Napoleonic years, Fernand could rise socially through his military and political accomplishments just as Danglars does through his financial acumen. Danglars is careful to note that the difference between them is that Fernand insists upon his title, while Danglars is openly indifferent to and dismissive of his; his viewpoint is the more aristocratic.Countess G- is quick to point out that there is no old family name of Monte Cristo and that the count, like many other contemporaries, has purchased his title. It serves mainly to obscure his identity, nationality, and background and to add to the aura of mystery his persona and Eastern knowledge create. What is most telling is that his entr&eacute;e into Parisian society is based primarily on his great wealth, not his name. Dumas reinforces this point with Andrea Cavalcanti, another mystery man of unknown name and reputed fortune.I have read The Man in the Iron Mask and The Three Musketeers series, both of which surprised me with their dark aspects (the character and fate of Lady de Winter, for example) and which little resembled the adventure stories distilled from them for children and for film. When I overheard a college student who was reading The Count of Monte Cristo on the bus tell a friend that she couldn't put it down, I was inspired to read it. I couldn't put it down, either, with its nearly seamless plot, dark protagonist, human villains, turbulent historical setting, and larger-than-life sense of mystery. At 1,078 pages, it's imposing, but don't cheat yourself by settling for an abridged version. You'll want to pick up every nuance.Diane L. Schirf, 12 September 2004."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"For the past year, I have thought that Austen's Pride and Prejudice would remain my all-time favorite book, but now I see that I am mistaken, as The Count of Monte Cristo has DEFINITELY topped P &amp; P on my list.This book, about the transformation of Edmond Dantes from an unsuspecting, guileless, innocent young man into a vengeful, dark, and clever man, and how the newly born Dantes uses his fortune and wit to avenge his past life, is one book that I shall never forget. I simply could not put this book down, and was even scolded by my family for neglecting my meals, sleep, and work to read this enchanting story. The details, the plot thick with intrigue and secrets...all of this and more were combined by Alexandre Dumas to create a masterful work of literature that one will surely come to appreciate greatly. I urge you, READ THIS BOOK! You shall not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Novels such as these convince me that the larger the story, the more profound will be its ending. There are too many features to this book to do it justice. The basic story line follows Edmund Dantes, a young sailor accused of treason. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, but (as one can guess might happen) he manages an escape. The rest of the novel follows his plan to revenge himself. The whole while, the reader never knows how evil prison has made Dantes, and the possibility that he will spare no one in his mission is quite plausible. What emerges is a suspense in terms of plot and character intertwined.Anyone interested in reading a huge book, but unsure which one to try first, this would be my top recomendation. Dumas' style is suited to suspense, adventure, and action, but is also moving and has penetrating insights into humanity. One will also find a wealth of descriptiveness to let your imagination absorb itself into another world. It is easy to read, and easy to pick up where you left off, in case you need to take a break from it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I had previously kept way from Dumas novels thinking that they were about swashbuckling and helpless maidens. Since I decided that I should read more classics this year, I picked up this book. Since the film should be releases soon, I figured I should read it before seeing the film might ruin it for me.That being said, this book was an exceptional story, and lives up to the acclaim. Rather than recount the plot, I will give a few reasons for my 4-star rating. The action begins immediately. While some books walk into the story, this book has significant plot development in the first few pages. Contrary to my preconception, there was really no fighting in the book. The action comes as the Count's intricate plan of revenge unfolds. Dumas does a great job of combining narration with introspection. While unraveling the plot, he provides insight into the emotions and personalities of his characters. In addition, the book isn't mired by excessive language. All in all this is a great story that should appeal to both men and women. I was able to read all 508 pages in a week of leisurely reading.On a negative point, this specific edition contains numerous typographical errors. Somone favored the letter \\"A\\" over \\"S\\" and many words are misspelled. If that is important to you, I would suggest you try another edition."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"'The Count of Monte Cristo' is part thriller, part love story and part drama. Its got alot in it, but all of it is fantastic. Edmond Dantes is unjustfully set-up and imprisoned early in his young adult life, just as things were beginning to go his way. Thus begins the plot of the transformation from Dantes into the Count of Monte Cristo after he escapes from his prison dungeon at the Chateau D'If.The story unfolds for a thousand pages about his vindication and revenge on those who mercilessly and vilely allowed him to rot in his prison over the course of many years. When he finally escapes with secret knowledge about a treasure, he uses all the means of his disposal to turn his life around as well as infiltrate the lives of those that did him an injustice back when he was Edmond Dantes. The book includes everything from islands, ships, Paris, the country, guns, poisons, chariots, wealth, poverty, and an infinite amount of intrigue. Sometimes Dumas takes a couple hundred pages to set up someone who you haven't seen in awhile in a new identity, but he never leaves you hanging without wrapping up the past, present and future of all of the players in the story. One of Dumas' greatest elements in this book is to set up story well in advance. The astute reader will appreciate his care and concern for knitting a tightly bound story.When I was given this book for Christmas, I saw the 1168 page length and thought to myself, &quot;I may start it, but I will never finish this long book.&quot; Much to my pleasure I finished the book yesterday and just had to write a review about it. I read about 500 pages and then put it down for a couple months. After picking it back up four weeks ago, I found it so interesting and intriguing that I ripped through the final 600+ pages. It really is one of the most wonderful books that I have ever read. I would recommend that you read the unabridged version rather than the abridged to gather the fullness of rich imagery and deeply developed characters in the book. Alexandre Dumas' &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Perhaps one of the best novels ever written, the Count of Monte Cristo is a story of an innocent man that seeks to revenge his wrongful imprisonment. Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly. This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).Truly a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is perhaps one of the best literary works of all time. Riveting, it is the story of a young man, Edmond Dantes, who is falsely accused of treason by three selfish villains who each desire something different from Dantes; The story is set in 19th Century France. Dantes is a young, strikingly handsome, 20-year old newly-apppointed ship captain with his whole life ahead of him. He is about to marry the woman of his dreams, a young, vivacious, awesomely beautiful Catalan girl from France named Mercedes. For reasons unbeknownst to him he is betrayed by three cruel, evil men, accused of treason, and secretly heralded away to the foreboding Chateau de If prison where he serves almost 14 years in solitary confinement. With the help of a wise old abbe, he successfully institutes an escape plan; After a daring, nerve frazzling escape, he sets about to claim a vast, hidden, enormous fortune that is hidden at the Isle of Monte Cristo. After locating riches beyond imagination, Edmond dons the title the Count of Monte Cristo, he is a man of immense wealth, stature, class, and a man of society. But with all the riches and fame bestowed upon the Count, he must complete some unfinished business. That is, he must enact revenge upon the evil men who robbed him of his youth, the love and life of his father, the loss of his betrothed, and his prominence as a ship captain. You will find yourself seated at the edge of your seat, perhaps stopping only to take care of life's necessities because when Monsieur Le Comte de Monte Cristo enacts his revenge, he takes no prisoners. The Count of Monte Cristo captures our very essence as we watch his plan unfold before our very eyes. He carefully and fastidiously orchestrates his plan of revenge to punish the men who acted so predictably and maliciously against him. This book gets five thumbs up because it demonstrates vulnerable life experiences that happen to many of us. That is, to say it is a story about true human courage, emotion, greed, jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. And, the count makes the punishment fit the crime for each man. This book is not for the squeamish or immature at heart. One of the best novels of all time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This review is for those who've already decided they want to read The Count of Monte Cristo (you won't regret it!), and don't know which version to get.Short answer: see review title, duh!The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book, and I've read several translations, both abridged and unabridged.TRANSLATIONThe Buss translation is the most modern, and reads most fluidly. A quick example comparing this translation with the one found on Project Gutenberg:PG - His wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride...BUSS - His wife visited on his behalf; this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business -- when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance...Buss's work reads like the book was written in English. The two or so times that the work is nearly untranslatable, Buss makes a footnote about it (eg, an insinuated insult using the formal \\"vous\\" instead of the familiar \\"tu\\"). Other translations just skip the subtlety. The most common translation out there (uncredited in my version) reads like a swamp. Trust me, get Buss.ABRIDGED V UNABRIDGEDAbridged versions of this book rarely say \\"abridged.\\" You can tell by the size: abridged is 500-700 pages, unabridged is 1200-1400 pages. Go for the unabridged.The abridged version is VERY confusing! Pruning 1200 pages down to 600 leaves a lot of plot on the cutting room floor. Suddenly, arriving at dinner are 4 new characters; it's very tiring to try to keep up with the hole-ridden story of the abridged versions. And you know where the holes are? Publishers \\"clean up\\" the book by omitting the affairs, illegitimate children, homosexuality, hashish trips, etc.As an added bonus in the Penguin Classics edition, there's a wonderful appendix bursting with footnotes to explain all the 19th century references, and a quick guide to the rise and fall of Napoleon (crucial to the politics in the story).Hope this helps. Get the book and start reading!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Warning: Do NOT pick this book up and start it if you have something that you need to do in the next day or three. You won't be able to put the book down, or if you do, you'll move zombielike through your everyday tasks while your mind stays with the adventures of Edmund Dantes.The Count of Monte Cristo is a delicious book, full of intrigue, great fight scenes, love, passion, and witty social satire. Dumas has a wonderful grasp of human nature and a talent for rendering all the follies of man in delightful, snappy prose. I immediately recognized people that I know (yes, even myself) in his vivid characters, which made the book all the more engaging to me.Some people might be put off by the size of the book -- it's a pretty hefty volume -- an tempted to buy the abridged version. Don't! I've heard from people who've read both versions that the abridged version is a pathetic, washed out shadow of the full novel. At any rate, as thick and impossibly long as The Count of Monte Cristo may seem when you open it for the first time, you'll feel as though it's far too short by the time you get to the last page."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is an example of perfect fiction writing. Its length is 5 times the average book and it still was not long enough! The story, the characters, the settings and the emotions enthralled me for days. I could not put it down. I was living the book as it took me to France, the mediterranean, Italy and every home, cave and mode of transportation detailed in exemplary fashion by Dumas. Without giving away the intrigue... This book is the story of a wronged young sailor and follows his life as he is imprisoned due to the actions of 3 jealous men. He lives in prison for an extended period of time, meeting a man who gives him hope and a life beyond his dreams. He escapes the horrid dungeon and seeks revenge on the 3 men who took away everything he ever hoped for. This book is amazing, it will not disappoint anyone. I cannot believe I did not read it before. Thank you Kindle for allowing me the pleasure of reading this book for free, however, it is worth paying for and sharing with anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I agree with the reviewers that this is one of the best books ever written. I read this book as part of a book club and probably never would have read it on my own--having read many of the books of Hugo and Dickens and other writers of that approximate era. I love both of these writers but find them both at times cumbersome and stilted and really wasn't in the mood for another. However, I could not put the Count of Monte Cristo down. This book seems freshly modern in writing style compared to these superb writers. From the beginning it is a page turner--almost Harry Potter like in its ability to have action, adventure and drama on almost every page. If you read the unabridged version you will find some allusions to morality and the wrongness of revenge which I enjoyed. But what makes the book great is the grandeur of the writing, the tightness of a wonderful plot, filled with subplots, the development of the characters, and the constant magic of combining romance and adventure. It is the ultimate romance book. If you watched the most recent version of the movie, you might be disappointed at the lack of sword fights, but there is never a lack of adventure and suspense. It might be 1400 pages long, but it never disappoints."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I first read the Bantam abridged Monte Cristo when I was 13 years old. Then, the next year, I saw the unabridged version and immediately bought a copy. Monte Cristo is an absolutely wonderful and wonderfully written masterpiece that tells the story of a young man that could be any of several people that you and I know. It is a story of injustice, despair, remorse, cruelty, misfortune, and evil. However, at the same time, the book manages to show that in the seemingly rotten world we live in there is hope, charity, love, honor, and purity as well. Edmond is one of the greatest dynamic characters of all time, innocently sent to face punishment that he in no way deserves. While enduring this unjust punishment, he meets a man and they become friends. Edmond learns from this man that everyone acts according to their own standards, and that everyone will eventually receive reward for the actions or crimes that they have committed, whether that reward be payment for honest living or pain in reparation for hardships forced upon others. Edmond then becomes that reparation, rewarding those that were his true friends, and exacting revenge upon those that caused him pain. A wonderful story, with excellent characters and an intricate plot. I would recommend this book for anyone that wants to laugh, cry, and triumph with a single character and his struggles. As the title states, this is one of my favorite books of all time, the only other that really compares with it is Victor Hugo's Les Miserables."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I've reviewed this book before. I'm writing another review of it now so that it will appear on my list of reviews next to my review of the butchered 2002 screen adaptation of this epic work.Alexandre Dumas's _The Count of Monte Cristo_ is one of the greatest novels of all time and in fact stands at the fountainhead of the entire stream of popular adventure-fiction. Dumas himself was one of the founders of the genre; every other such writer -- H. Rider Haggard, C.S. Forrester, Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Mickey Spillane, Ian Fleming, Tom Clancy, John Grisham -- is deeply in his debt.The cold, brooding, vampiric Count (born Edmond Dantes; known also, among other aliases, as \\"Sinbad the Sailor,\\" Lord Wilmore, and a representative of the firm of Thomson and French) is the literary forebear of every dark hero from Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Pimpernel to Zorro, Batman, the Green Hornet, and Darkman. And the intricate plot provides everything any reader could want: adventure, intrigue, romance, and (of course) the elegant machinations of the Count himself as he exacts his terrible revenge on those who have wronged him -- thereby serving, or so he believes, as an agent of divine justice and retribution. Brrrrrrrr.The book is also a good deal _longer_ than many readers may be aware. Ever since the middle of the nineteenth century, the English translations have omitted everything in the novel that might offend the sensibilities of Victorian readers -- including, for example, all the sex and drugs.That's why I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this novel read Robin Buss's full-text translation. Unlike, say, Ayn Rand (whose cardboard hero \\"John Galt\\" also owes his few interesting aspects to Monsieur le Comte), Dumas was entirely capable of holding a reader's undivided attention for over a thousand pages; Buss's translation finally does his work justice, restoring all the bits omitted from the Bowdlerized versions.The heart of the plot, as most readers will already know, is that young sailor Edmond Dantes, just as his life starts to come together, is wrongfully imprisoned for fourteen years in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If as the victim of a monstrously evil plot to frame him as a Bonapartist. While in prison he makes the acquaintance of one Abbe Faria, who serves as his mentor and teaches him the ways of the world (science, philosophy, languages and literature, and so forth), and also makes him a gift of a fabulous treasure straight out of the _Thousand and One Nights_. How Dantes gets out of prison, and what he does after that -- well, that's the story, of course. So that's all I'm going to tell you.However, I'll also tell you that the 2002 screen adaptation doesn't even begin to do it justice. The plot is so far \\"adapted\\" as to be unrecognizable, except in its broad outlines and the names of (some of) the characters. Pretty much everything that makes Dumas's novel so darkly fascinating has been sucked out of it. It's not a bad movie on its own terms, but if you're expecting an adaptation of this novel, you'll be disappointed. And if you've already seen it, don't base your judgment of the novel on it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a great book and I highly recommend it, but don't buy this enriched classic version of the book. It was good, but I felt like something was missing, and not until I finished the book did I discover that this version leaves out significant portions of the actual story. Nowhere in this book does it tell you that it is an abridged version, but it actually is. Buy a different version of this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is more of a note to compare the Oxford unabridged version to abridged versions of this story.Previously, I read an abridgement of The Count of Monte Cristo and enjoyed it thoroughly. The story is a classic Man-Done-Wrong-Wreaks-Revenge tale.Eventually, I decided to read the unabridged version, even though it is over 1,000 pages, and I'm exceedingly glad that I did!There is an incredible amount of tension in this book, which miraculously enough is retained throughout the entire work. In the unabridged version, the reader is inserted into the story in a &quot;you are there&quot; sense, moment by moment, which is, in my opinion, the thing that retains this tension.Not to disparage the abridgement, but - in shortening the story - the reader is sometimes not a participant in the storyline, but merely hears about the events in an off-hand summary. As a result of this, part of the soul of the book is removed.That is a shame - especially with this work - because you are partly robbed of the emotional reward of following Edmond Dantes' journal from hell along his complicated strategy to struggle toward heaven ... which is a long journey from Marseilles!You should set aside the time to read the unabridged version of this work! You will not feel the time a useless sacrifice!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'll admit up front - I'm only 15% of the way through the book. But so far, I love it. It's got plenty of intrigue and suspense to keep me very interested. I have no doubt I'll love the remaining 85%. Also, I'm 90% sure that this is the unabridged version. I took this Kindle version to a bookstore and compared it to an unabridged hard copy of the book, and they line up very similarly. From what I can tell, the unabridged versions have 117 chapters, compared to about 71 chapters in the abridged version. A hard copy unabridged version will have roughly 1200 pages, compared to about 600 pages for the abridged. For what it's worth, this Kindle version has 19,069 \\"locations.\\" All in all, a great read so far."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I first read this book in high school, and it is a great book. Unfortunately, this edition is, as far as I can tell, abridged, so it doesn't have the full story. I just finished reading this edition, and based on what I remember from my earlier reading, as well as conversations with another person who has read the work, this edition leaves things out. While I can find nothing indicating that this edition is abridged, I think it is, so I would suggest finding the full version if you are truly interested in the book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Bought this for my dad to read. He loved how easy it was to order. Good book. He love it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I didn't think I would add another review to the already 8,000 + out there. But, while reading the final pages of this book, I found myself overcome with emotion. When a book can do that, it deserves a little notation.Most everything has been said about this towering classic. I particularly liked Joel's review, complete with pictures. However, when I picture The Count, it is a mix of Edmund Blackadder and Orson Welles.In any case, what I have taken from this book is a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. While everything (sort of) falls into place for the Count's well-planned revenge, one cannot escape the myriad of tendrils that effect so many other people. Edmond realizes that perhaps he had gone too far in his scheme, but yet those guilty parties most likely deserved their comeuppance.Other lessons are learned through these men (Danglars, Villefort, Mondego, and Caderrouse). One cannot escape one's sins forever, greed has no happy ending, and desire for power will rot your soul. Though the style of this book, and of the time, is one of exaggeration and over-the-top emotions, the story is timeless. When we step on the backs of others to reach the top, is it not inconceivable that one of those broken bodies will rise again and pull us from our pedestal?Davis' translation is wonderful and the notes are extremely helpful in understanding the time frame of the story. I can only imagine Dumas' readers, waiting expectantly for the next installment, talking in cafes excitedly over the latest \\"episode.\\"There isn't much more that I can say that will add to the discussion, except that this book should be required reading for everyone.There are very few books I re-read, and this will be one of them."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"While the Three Musketeers is better known, Dumas treatment of The Count of Monte Cristo is exceptional. His character development is excellent and puts one into the scene. An excellent read. One classic to be revisited."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is my third time reading my favorite novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. It was an easier read, I think because of the translation as well as because I paid more attention to the characters in the early part of the book because I knew they'd be playing their roles again later. The first time I read it, sometimes it was a strain to remember later who had done what back in the beginning.What was interesting was to see how my feelings about some of the characters was different with this reading than in the past. I could see how I have evolved as a person and in my philosophy about life as I reacted differently to how the book unfolded. That was unexpected, and it was satisfying.I bought this to read on my Kindle. Was going to get the free version but saw another review that said this translation was better. So I read the first three or four pages of each edition free online, and easily saw the difference in the translation. It's worth paying a few bucks for this translation.The story is as gripping as ever. Whether it's your first time or third time, prepare to be mesmerized!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book has it all. It is set in the early 1800s and involves ambition, humility, envy, love, power, poverty, education, travel, and many other subjects of life.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"When I paid for this book, I ordered the ADULT version of The Count of Monte Cristo.

I'm not sure which version I read, it had a lot of French in it, and it was not an easy read. But worth it. I might get an easier version and read it again.The writing style is like poetry.Edmond Dantes\` is wrongly imprisoned from accusations made by people he trust. When he escapes, he seeks revenge, one of the best revenge stories ever written.I do have one complaint; I read this after seeing and loving the movie (2002, Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce). The movie didn't quite follow the book. I hate to say this, because it does not happen often, I liked the movie better than the book. But definitely a must read. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, I suggest you read the book first, and then see the movie.

This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Again, classic Alexandre Dumas and a great story. Oh, and it's free. What more need be said? It's still good reading, 30 years after I read it the first time.

This tale of adventure, vengence, and romance is one all should read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is such an awesome book with quite an extraordinary plot. It's rare that I've read books this long--even for my classes in school. There's so much drama, so much suspense, so much awe, mystery and sophistication in detail that makes this book a true masterpiece, indeed! I couldn't put the book down and finished it all in a few days.I really don't want to ruin the plot for anyone, so i'm not going to go into any details. It's just amazing how a character can be at a new climax in life, fall to great depths, and then rise again.There will always be parts of the book where you might say or think things should have been different. But that's what happens when you watch almost any drama movie, for sometimes we don't want any sadness directed towards characters we grow to love. But sometimes that makes you appreciate the plot even more.Believe me, you really will love some of the characters in this book. Just give it a chance.I have to admit that I read the ... edition of this book, and I'm not sure if it is a different translator or if it is abridged to a different degree. I looked up the translator, but the book didn't say, and it's not for sale here on Amazon[.com], which is why I'm reviewing this book.Sometimes it's hard to pick out the right edition for a translated book. But I've asked so many people about this book, and all that I've known to read it have unanimously praised it. I don't think you can go wrong, but make sure you do the research before picking one specific book.And finally, I'd say don't pick a book with an ugly picture of the Count on the front. He's supposed to be a relatively good-looking guy, and an ugly picture on the cover can psychologically influence a partial opinion towards him contrary to the descriptions of the text. ;)"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Please don't let the length of this book scare you! I read the Count of Monte Cristo in five days. I could not put it down. There is never a dull moment! Murders, love affairs, bandits, illegitimate children, greed, disguises, insanity. Why this book is chock full of good stuff! A new surprise waits around every corner. And the bast part is that all the villians get their just what's coming to them, making it a most gratifying reading experience.I have friends who refuse to read this book because they already saw the movie and think their is no point. I have seen multiple film adaptations of The Count of Monte Cristo and none come anywhere close to the original story.I urge you to read this book. It is an absolute must for anyone who loves adventure. The only disadvantage, if it is a disadvantage, is you won't be able to accomplish anything until you have finished the book. You simply won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Everything in Edmond Dantes' life is going right-he is about to become the captain of a ship, and about to marry his true love, Mercedes. All the good things in Dantes' life are wrenched from his grasp in an instant, due to the betrayal of men he once considered friends. Dantes is unjustly thrown into prison. In jail, the kind, friendly Dantes the reader is introduced to is transformed into a merciless conspirator, bent on extracting revenge from those who betrayed him.Dantes comes upon a fortune that he would never have even dreamed of, and with its aid, is able to hide behind the mask of the Count of Monte Cristo, a mysterious, brooding man with a huge amount of power. Dantes slowly and subtly begins to ruin the lives of the men who ruined his own life fourteen years ago.Alexandre Dumas' tale is thrilling, full of excitement and surprising twists and turns. His writing style is hardly ever slow. In the middle, it seemed like he was abandoning the main story line, but by the end the author cleverly ties all the loose ends together to weave a fantastic story. This book is sure to please anyone who enjoys reading about love, betrayal, revenge, adventure, action, romance, and most importantly, self-discovery and change. Dumas shows the reader, through Dantes, how pain and anguish can change a person so extremely.I highly recommend this book. Dumas' writing is so good; I was caught up in the story of Dantes instantly. I felt horrible when he was thrown in jail, and triumphant when he finally extracts revenge from his enemies. Though, in the middle of the book, is seems a little slow, the author soon picks up the main plot line again and all the subplots make sense again. The characters are well-developed, and the story, though not quite plausible, is full of exciting and delightful surprising."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"So much has been written about &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; that it is well nigh impossible to add or subtract to the opus of literary criticism (including all that has been written right here on Amazon.com.) So, rather than trying to provide a plot overview, or extolling the virtues of Dumas' story of injustice, obsession and revenge, I would like to take a somewhat contrary stance and point out that this is a literary masterpiece with a few &quot;classic&quot; flaws.The first is the narration. Undoubtedly, it suffers from the fact that Dumas wrote this story in serial form. That's a fair excuse, but what is troublesome is his abrupt shift from the Count's rescue of the Morrel family shipping business, to his 100+ page Italian excursion, including the chapters on, &quot;Roman Bandits&quot;, &quot;The Carnival At Rome&quot;, etc. I suppose one could argue that we are introduced to the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and Baron Franz d'Epinay in Italy, but surely these two secondary characters could have been just as easily place in France where all the action is. I guess I'm left with the gnawing suspicion that Dumas once filled his travel journal with numerous observations and insights about Italy, and decided it was a good time to spill them all out about a quarter of the way through &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot; Unfortunately, his Italian excursion (artfully rendered in its own right) throttles what was a driving, haunting compelling narrative, which reaches a wondrous climax when the Count mysteriously steps in to save the Morrels.My other issue is the sheer improbability of coincidences that pile up on one another. The artist is entitled to ask of the reader to engage in a certain willing suspension of disbelief. But I think Dumas has asked the reader for a bit too much. We know the Count, bent on retribution and revenge, is an outright control freak who obsessively manipulates Caderousse, Danglars, Villefort and Fernand. He's got them on a string. But the circumstances that tie these four together go far beyond the Count's machinations. Dumas has entangled them all in a spider web of relationships that is entirely contrived.With that said, who, today, would like to challenge Dumas to a creative writing contest? Most assuredly, not I. One of the reasons &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is such an enduring classic is that any criticism is overwhelmed by the sheer literary virtuosity of Alexandre Dumas. One reviewer said that, &quot;....you just don't find novels like this anymore.&quot; There's a very good reason for that. No one alive today can right like this!One last observation. I read Sir Walter Scott's &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; shortly before picking up &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot; In some way, I got the feeling that Scott portrayed Medieval Englishmen the way 19th Century Englishmen would have liked to have thought of themselves. Dumas has rendered a national portrait of his countrymen as well, but I don't get the sense he cared whether or not they liked the image."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER. THE STORY IS INCREDIBLY LONG BUT INCREDIBLY INVOLVED AND INTERESTING. THE WRITING IS CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE, AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS REALLY LONG, IT IS REALLY WORTH IT.

In preparation for what I expected to be a long camping trip, I paid a visit to the nearest used book store and purchased some 40 books, as a means of passing the idle time that awaited me in the Middle East. It was my good fortune to come across a small illustrated version of the Dumas' classic tale of revenge and intrigue. One afternoon in Saudi Arabia, at the behest of one of my compatriots, I finally thumbed through the small pocket-sized book, and much to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could not wait to read the original version. When I returned to America several months later, I rushed to the nearest book store and purchased the abridged version. I must have read that engaging novel 10 times! Just a few months ago, my wife purchased the unabridged version (over 800 pages) and I, once again, was privileged to enjoy the company of the eccentric Count.

The revenge is slow, coldly calculated and deliciously deviant. It is both refreshing and encouraging to read a story that is properly developed not just a book-waiting-for-a-movie-deal plot.

At some point a book gains such a critical mass of readers that reading the book is necessary to maintain your level of cultural literacy.Considering only the text, I felt it was very good, but not one of the greatest. I agree with all of the positives cited in the other reviews. Dumas is a master story teller, the tale is coherent and easily visualized. There are however, two drawbacks that ruined the book for me. Firstly, the story is so contrived that it completely destroys any suspension of disbelief.

I myself am a very serious reader, and was considering putting it down because I was having a little trouble getting through some slow parts in the book. If you think you'd have trouble 'getting through it' then I suggest that you don't read this book. It's a classic story about a man done wrong who comes back to wreak havoc on those who wronged him. I am dead serious that you should NOT read this book if you don't want either a challenge or a good read, or don't think you'd be prepared to deal with it. It has a complicated interworking of plots, three or four at a time. So don't read it unless you think you can deal with it.

Bittersweet, sad and touching. You really can relate to the characters and the settings are ever-changing and filled with variety. Great for readers of all ages is the abridged version. The unabridged one may be taxing for some. So if you're an avid adventurer or an aspiring writer looking for ideas, tCoMC is a must-have.I'd even go as far to say this is the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is perhaps one of the best books I've ever read. I cannot say this for certain because of the doubts that arose in my mind whilst reading it; however, I felt that each chapter was better than the one before it, and the book has 117 chapters in all! That is why, even though I have some complaints regarding this book, I think it does deserve four stars, because one quality of richness is able to eliminate any deficiencies one may find.I cannot refrain from being critical of the fact that Edmond Dantes changes so drastically - from a nave young lad to a supreme being who has an \`infallible' scheming mind. Alexandre Dumas doesn't do much to attenuate the effect that such a radical change in the personality of the main protagonist may have on the reader. It is true that Dantes spends fourteen whole years in the Chateau d'If, but it is only in the very first parts of the book that this suffering is portrayed; the revenge takes many, many more pages to be effected than the imprisonment and the madness itself. It should be the task of the author to keep reminding the reader of the real internal suffering of Dantes more, or at par, than emphasising his feelings of revenge. On the other hand, such a well constructed plot is nothing less than admirable - one would think that only God could plan events so ably, making things happen to other people and being ready to see to the consequences as Dantes does. This is, according to me, the marvellous side of The Count of Monte Cristo - a character who, although quite inconsistent with the initial portrayal of his personality, has the opportunity to show his genius through such a strong feeling as vengeance.Another element I don't like in certain classics is the too-frequent mention of suicide, which is shown as something easily done or easily decided upon, just like this being the consequence of someone's whim. Maybe in the past centuries this act was more commonly done to protect one's honour, however, I will still insist that suicide shouldn't be so commonly mentioned, especially not as it is in this book, where more than one character resorts to it. It is on this point, however, that I was mostly struck in the whole load of Dantes' reflections, or more exactly, in his reflections made during the concluding chapters. He realises that life has a meaning and that it is to be preserved, so he eventually becomes a life-giver instead of a life-taker. Dantes finds true value in the words \\"wait\\" and \\"hope\\" - something that, when one reads the whole book, will understand in the same depth as Alexandre Dumas does, the latter being the real mind behind this great work."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Most people you run into say the idea of trying to escape from prison is a bad thing. This isn't the case in Alexandre Dumas' book The Count of Monte Cristo, where our hero Edmond Dantes, is thrown into one of the darkest, dirtiest dungeons in all of France.Edmond Dantes, a carefree young sailor, who it seems will soon be captain of his very own ship, wants nothing more than to be able to marry his fianc&eacute;, Mercedes and settle down.Sadly this will not come to pass, for Edmond becomes the victim of other men's ambition, greed, and envy. His enemies each have a different reason for making him want to disappear, but only when they come together do they decide what they will do.They devise a wicked plot to frame poor Edmond and falsely accuse him of being a traitor. He is sent to the horrible dungeons of Chateau d'If, to spend the rest of his life in a lonely cell.However during his long imprisonment he meets the \\"Mad Priest\\" Abbe Faria, who takes him from the brink of insanity and teaches him geometry, chemistry, history, algebra, and many other skills. He then tells Edmond of a secret treasure on an island known only as Monte Cristo. Soon after that Edmond escapes prepared to take his revenge. He finds that those who wronged him had gained enormous power and now lived in Paris.So backed by his newfound fortune, he decides that it is time for Paris to get a visit from The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"i am a great fan of classics. this book betrays the moral of revenge, an although it is well written it certainly does not come CLOSE to Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux, which is in fact my favorite book. and i forgo to mention i am only12 years old."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The count of monte cristo is not a ordinary book to read.Its a very understanding, basic book to read to me andhopefully for you to. The main things that i like aboutthis book is in the book their is a character called Edmondthat go's to jail for 16 years becasue he was offerd a jobfrom a agent that gave him a letter to deleiver to a friend of his that was not to be told to any one and Edmond's freind over heaird the confersation about the letter and turned Edmond in.After I read that I wanted to find out what happend next in the story and it got better and better as I read. It also has a nice body to the story. It talks you know what will happen next and then it happens and has pictures to explain what is going on in the scene of the story. Another thing that kept me reading this book is their is a part in the story where Edmond and his carrier look for treasure on this island called THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.

It's about a twenty-year old man named Edmond Dantes, whose early fame (as a young, newly assigned ship captain) is short lived. Jealous of his success, a few bad men take actions that, on his wedding day, lead to his arrest and long imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. After leaving the prison, he again gains fame, as well as fortune, learns all that he can about the men whose actions led to his demise, uses the information to concoct acts of revenge, ingratiates himself with the bad guys and their family members, and strikes. Although I'm not a fan of spending the time required to read really long books, in this case, I'm glad I did. An amazingly easy read, The Count of Monte Cristo has a complicated, well-thought out plot (though that involving V near the end is hokey and the ultimate fate of H troublesome) and great characters. Plus, it's always nice to see the good guys gain and the bad guys get their due. Also good: The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins, and An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can say, without a Doubt that this Book is the best that I have read.

I am so glad I did! My husband and I both read and loved this book. It's a great translation and I would definitely recommend the unabridged version. It was interesting in my bookclub to hear all of the different plot lines left out of the various abridged versions. Some of them were pretty pivotal! I'd stick with this great version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I've never been disappointed by a Dumas book, and this one is certainly no exception. With a gripping and intricate plot situated in a turbulent time in French history, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO represents one of the the most widely recognized and important books of all time. More subtle and serious than the swashbuckling THREE MUSKETEERS, this one really speaks to the soul with highly emotional and real ethical dilemmas. Full of adventure, suspense, love, and drama, this book is hard to put down for the entire 1300+ pages. Even though you probably already know the basic jist of the story, don't hesitate to pick this one up. Knowledge of the outcome doesn't take away anything from the enjoyment of reading this top-notch novel. I can't speak to the abridged version, but I can't imagine it could be nearly as good, as the detail of this story is part of what makes it so gratifying.The best thing about this book is certainly the character of Edmond Dantes. Perhaps the best character in all of literature, the Count of Monte Cristo is a real delight. He represents everything you like about a hero to the extreme. Mysterious, powerful, intelligent, and caring, the Count is what drives this book. Watching as his absurdly complex, but brilliant, schemes for vengeance come to fruition represents one of the most enjoyable reading experiences to be had. While many of the characters in the book are great, they are all completely overshadowed by the immense figure of the Count.Alexandre Dumas makes numerous political statements in this book. Very satirical about the nobility, politics, and high society in general, this book represents the cultural tendencies of the time. Published during the reign of King Louis-Philippe, during a time of political unrest, uncertain future, and revolutionist ideas, this book was certainly well-received by some but not by others. Only a couple of years after this book's publication, the Second French Republic was founded under which Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president. So, the conflicts we find in this book between the royalists and the republicans were still in evidence during its writing.I digress. This is a truly excellent book that shouldn't be missed by any fan of good literature. Don't let the length scare you away, as it is not wasted space and creates a wonderfully complex and beautiful story. Give yourself a month and read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I purchased the book for a present for my son.He was very pleased with the book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have read this book in my childhood and got it for my son for Christmas.

When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"We only recently found out that all our copies of The Count of Monte Cristo were abridged.

Having recently read 'Les Miserables' (the book is so much better than a movie or play) I was primed for The Count. The stories are so similar; two men who escape prison and begin a journey towards enlightenment and salvation. The only difference being that Jean Valjean was a true criminal who redeems himself through selfless philanthropy while Edmund Dante (the Count) is a wrongly convicted man who uses his wealth for revenge. Yet both of these stories ultimately have identical moral themes.Classics such as these transcend time, and for good reason. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it; it will give you a profound sense of humanity when you put it down, and will keep you thinking well after you have finished it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is stted in Paris, France and the main actor is Edmond Dantes.

It&#65533;s about a man named Edmond Dantes who&#65533;s wrongly accused being a Bonapartist. He goes to jail and somehow becomes a count. The count he becomes is the ******************. It has a lot of twists and turns. So many, in fact that, an explosion could happen and you wouldn&#65533;t even notice!I really enjoyed this book because it was very exciting, even though there wasn&#65533;t a lot of &#65533;dodging missiles and bullets&#65533; action. There was a lot of excitement and suspense. For example Edmond gets in a duel and Edmond is dragged to the bottom of the ocean. One thing I didn&#65533;t like about the book was that it didn&#65533;t start out that exciting. It is though, a book you can&#65533;t put down.I believe this book has a very good message. The message is: &#65533;help your friends and they will help you&#65533;. I think this because: Edmond helped an abbe\` and the abbe\` helped him, and Edmond saved Morrel&#65533;s and Valentine&#65533;s life and they were his eternal friends.

Whence from there he begins to revenge himself on the ones who did him the great injustice that put him through the suffering of isolation in jail.This is a brilliantly written book that only a few could even think of. Maybe the idea of a man getting revenge is common, but only Dumas could put it into words of such power, showing the cleverness of Dantes as he takes each step towards getting revenge upon all his enemies. Although it might be a bit confusing at first, with all the detail, once you understand everything that goes on in the intelligent mind of the Count of Monte Cristo aka Dantes, you will be captivated by this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great read. I decided to read the book after having seen the movie. Where the movie is an action adventure, the book is drama to its core. As always, I regret having seen the movie first and having it's characterizations impressed on me. In this case, the movie and book are so different that it didn't matter too much.The book is about a young man, Dantes, who is severely wronged. He is imprisoned and vows to get vengeance on those who caused him to suffer. He meets a mentor in prison, escapes, and then finds his mentor's treasure. With this treasure, as a older man, he is able to exact revenge on his enemies. His many twisted schemes form the bulk of the book (practically ignored in the movie). The way these plans weave in and out of each other is magnificent.The Count of Monte Cristo should be on everyone's &quot;Must Read&quot; list. It is truly a masterpiece that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"As a 16 year old girl, I couldn't believe how amazing this book was. I read it after watching the 2002 movie version. The book differs from the movie in the endings and most of the details, but the general plot of prison, money, and revenge remains. I liked them both in their own respect.This is one of those exciting books that you can't put down. I read this version and I am glad I did. At the book store, I compared it to the unabriged versions, and not only did this version contain more, the translator tends to use better word choice and has superior sentence fluency.The plot of the story is intriging and exciting. If you like books that make you twist your head around and think, this is for you! Also this is NOT a boring classic (like many are): it actually keeps your interest for the majority of the time.Therefore, I give the Count of Monte Cristo 5 stars and encourage you to read it.

The book begins that our character is betrayed by his best friend and is sent to prison.

Recommended to me by my mom and as a choice for my World History class, I at first considered it to be overwhelming and incredibly long when I first picked it up. After getting into it, I couldn't put it down. The book, which is about a young man who is betrayed by the people who he considered his friends, is filled with love, revenge, murder and suspense. Yet it is full of European history and facts about the Napoleonic Era, which starts the book off. Alexandre Dumas' style of writing is extraordinary and even though it has a lot of detail, it makes you feel like you are a part of the book as you are reading it. He is constantly adding more and more conflicts through out the book and keeping you entertained. Just as you think everything is not coming together, he ties everything perfectly at the end.

Unjustly placed there upon return to the port of Marseilles; made scapegoat for a Bonapartist action which he had no involvement with, Dantes is torn from his life as sailor, fiance, and son, and tossed into the darkness of solitary confinement, left to rot; untried, unexplained, and forgotten.Many years later, hope comes in the form of an ailing prisoner trying to tunnel his way out. He confides his greatest secret, the hiding place of an immense fortune, to Dantes before he dies. Seeing this as his only chance at freedom, Dantes assumes the place of the corpse, is removed from the prison for 'burial', and escapes.Thus begins his revenge. After collecting the very real wealth in the cavern on Monte Cristo, he assumes the title of Count, and exacts his vengeance on those who stole his life.The Count; benefactor, patron, and friend of the elite, insinuates himself into the lives of those who deprived him of all he loved, and authors their downfalls. All the while rewarding the good and just, he prepares punishment for those who are deserving.The book is entertaining from start to finish and was well worth the read. The Count's revenge is deserved, and well doled out, as he allows all to destroy themselves with their wrongdoing, simply supplying them the means. The ending is not so grand scale as to be Hollywood-esque in scope, but satisfying nonetheless. Dantes realizes that in following his path of revenge he has simply placed himself in another 'prison,' that of hatred, and he tempers his actions with deeds of generosity and gratitude, perhaps as a measure of atonement. But no matter what ills befall those who betrayed him, you constantly root for Dantes to emerge triumphant.The more classic literature I read, such as Count of Monte Cristo, the easier it is to see why good literature survives the test of time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I found the thought of reading this book rather intimidating as it's 1077 pages long. Once reading however, it was compulsive enough to be worth the effort (I'm a slow reader). It holds an extremely clever plot which hooked me and made me admire the author and the book but...never quite managed to make me really believe in the Count as a man; this Godlike being formerly a young sailor, wrongly imprisoned, educated by a fellow-lag into this all-knowing, manipulative and omnipotent (but sentient) creation. I had to will the suspension of disbelief and managed it just enough to enjoy the book. I liked, or rather agreed with, the idealistic themes, the lack of truly good and bad main characters - the four of Dantes targets are all very human. Some of the secondary characters seemed too good to be true though but more depth to them may have resulted in a further few hundred pages!Taken less seriously, if you just want to enjoy a book, it's a compulsive, fun read with not too many frustratingly long-drawn out parts- though there are some."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book was specifically required by my daughter's 8th grade English teacher, in the version obtained from Amazon.

I absolutely could not follow it. Too much is cut out."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I ordered this book 8 days ago, and finished it today, so i read the 1462 pages pretty fast you could say... But i was very taken into the book and enjoyed it until i got near the end.... Where it just collapsed.Dumas built up way too much on the characters, like Albert and Franz to let them have such a poor ending, or NO ending. I found myself getting bored sometimes when it seemed like the story was going nowhere since so many pages were wasted on meaningless parts like the whole \\"italy carnival\\".The Story seems to distant itself from Edmond and get into the sub-plot \\"romances\\". I found my self feeling less sympathetic towards Dantes as the story progessed but more sympathetic towards Albert, Mercedes, Valentine and... Where is jacopo?Dumas leaves out far too much, after spending far too much time building up the story, to let it just die at the end. We all know Valentine is alive, why waste page after page Edmond and Morrel talking about it.. WHEN he could be talking about Haydee more or Franz or albert or Better yet, re-joining mercedes instead of deserting her and finding out if albert is really his son or not. I couldnt understand why Dumas makes you wonder by hints that maybe albert is Edmonds son but does nothing to confirm it. Was this clever in some \\"analyzing way\\"(cant stand analyzing books like this) or was it just a mistake?Ending with Morrel was far too expected(all that build up for what..) and really wasted to much time with the whole \\"wait longer\\" part so it would be clever in someway with his father's waiting. Give me a break. Last chapter made me wonder what made Dumas give up on such a good book. Maybe his publisher was pushing him, or he wanted to just finish it or his reader's were losing interest... Honestly though when i got to the last 2-3 chapters i realized there wasnt another 100 pages and was disappointed after allllll that reading.I wanted to read the unarbridged to know the real story(because i usually prefer the original of books) but when i finished i realized i was better off just reading the abridged because so much of it was meaningless and the ending was horrible to spend so much time on a book to be disappointed.Great Start to a book, not so great halfway in where he is in Italy but it soon picks up to tell of his new fame by doing good acts and becoming friends with his enemies who he is slowly(really slow) making plans to ruin. I thought the Andrea part was pretty smart but it drags on too long. Getting to the end of the book, i thought the ruin of Morcerf, danglars and Villefort's family were genius, but the ruin of Albert and his mother was pathetic and undeserving.Being that Edmond never did trully marry her, i dont think they were in the whole \\"Love till death\\" situation. Would have been better a romance had they fell in love in the end... but I guess the Moral of the French in 1800's regarding \\"Forgiveness\\" is much different than that of our modern time \\"Christianity\\" views, which dumas loves to bring up. I dont see how he could call Edmond a Christian or any the other characters(the bad ones who claim they are) such as it is disgraceful towards the religion.To much Emphases on Edmond being \\"Angel of Revenge\\" and his so called philisohpical views...Book has many Flaws to it, but thats to be expected in such a big book. Cant say its the Best book i ever read but its up there. Have to say \\"Les Meserables\\" was a better french story. Doesnt need 1400 pages to be good... and that story was sad but uplifting as it has good morals to it, while Count of Monte Cristo had very few... unless you think playing God is ok and deciding for yourself the fate of others, who really didnt deserve to suffer but did.... Also thought the \\"wisdom\\" at the end wasnt to smart. ;oOverall i give it 4 stars, since it had a pretty good story and was interesting. Lacked a good conclusion after all those pages.. but makes up for it with the justice right before it. These are all my opinions and im sorry if you dont agree, but i spent too much time reading so carefully in such a short time and so willingly to be disappointed by the lack of another 4-5 chapters to explain the \\"other characters\\" he forgets about, but has so much emphasis early on in, So i cant give it 5 stars. :(IF you had the patience to read Counte of Monte Cristo, read the bible even if you dont believe in it but.. to at least read the interesting stories. IF you Ever hear of Joeseph and Technicolor Raincoat, a play well known, adapted from a bible story) That story is so close in so many ways to this book, i think you get the picture... (and people wonder where such great stories come from... writers have a Sub-conscious too.)Recommend Reading: The Devil's Advocate(not the movie, and has nothing to do with it), By Taylor Caldwell. Les Meserables(unabridged), by Victor hugo. \\"THE BIBLE\\" .... it has sooooo many good stories which Books like THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO originated from. The bible is almost the same size and you get much more from it(story and morality wise)."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The count of Monte Cristo is actually based on a real life character, The Jesuit General.

Alexandre Dumas is an excellent writer but seems to accentuate too many subplots that are unimportant. He also focuses on numerous small and confusing characters.The basic plot, is about human nature, particularly revenge of a young man named Edmond Dant&eacute;s. At the age of nineteen, Dant&eacute;s has a series of important events happen to him. He is convicted of being a Bonapartist by two jealous rivals. He is unable to marry the lovely Mercedes and he is no longer capable become captain of the Pharaon, the merchant ship, on which he used to work on as a first mate. He is thrown into the notorious dungeon, Chateau d'if, for fourteen years. He escapes with a large secret: the map to the famed treasure of Spada. Naturally, he'll use it for his revenge. As they say, the rich can do anything.The book has so many intricate subplots and minor characters that the real plot seems to be lost in a hurricane of court intrigues, treasonous affairs, and numerous social gatherings. There are at least nine chapters concerning meals and balls, ranging from brunches to dinners, suppers to breakfasts, from a mere ball to a summer ball, and everything in-between. If you understand the difference between a baron and a count, then these things would obviously make sense, and may even be interesting to you. If you don't know the difference, prepare to be a little confused.Getting to the action takes a while, but when it comes, Dumas gives you a good read. From being captured by bandits, meeting Dantes's old fianc&eacute; (who is now married to his arch rival and has a child), to getting even with all those evil men who planned his imprisonment. Although, if you're not at the action yet, get ready for a long, not-so interesting read. Dumas, still manages to throw in some unimportant details and small talk in-between the action. You can't just go skipping around the book, because there are too many important details embedded in the small talk. If you don't read every word, I guarantee you'll get lost.This book is jam-packed with murderous action, so if that sounds good to you, you should consider reading this book. If you are looking for a challenge then this is a book for you. We recommend this book to older, more advanced readers."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The unabridged version of this is huge, huge. Like 1200 pages.I actually did read all of it. First time, though, that I would have to count myself sorry that I read the unabridged version of anything.There were exciting elements to the plot, to be sure, but after Dantes makes sure that M. Morrel is taken care of (p. 300 in the Penguin Classics edition: the part where the narrator skips ahead 10 years without telling you), the next 800 pages or so really drag. It's obvious that, at this time, writers were being paid by the word.Could be much stronger as a shorter (er, say, 200 pages) novel."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Very long book and not what I expected. It would have been better to read the book before watching the movie. The movie and the book are completely different."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just finished this book as a summer reading book for school, and it was amazing. Dumas uses an incredible amount of foreshadowing in this book, but it only adds to its intrigue. The plot itself has so many twists and turns as it follows the life of Edmond Dantes and others involved in his life. The evolution of the characters is also amazing. It's almost a psychological analysis of human characteristics, with their qualities and defaults.I read this book in three days. I was hooked from beginning to end. The story simple flows together, and by the end, everything comes to a neat solution; the conclusion isn't completely definite - it gives the reader time to imagine what happens to Edmond after the book ends.I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age. The writing style is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat, eager for more."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dantes was a happy and fortunate young man, blessed with a beautiful fiance, good looks, and an upwardly mobile career. In short he had everything that a man could want. As is always the case, one man's fortune breeds another's envy. Jealous of Edmond's good fortunes three of his friends conspire to remove him from the scene. The plan might not have worked were it not for his bad fortune in chief prosecutors. His fortunes soured, Edmond is sentenced to life imprisonment.What follows along this plotline is one of the greatest novels ever written. Edmond escapes, finds his fortune, and begins a long road of revenge. Not satisfied with killing his enemies, Edmond instead seeks to do unto them as they have done unto him. Ruin their lives by taking away everything that they hold dear.I cannot emphasize enough the quality of this book. The plot is complex and intriguing. The characters are deep and fully fleshed. Always intelligent, often whimsical, occassionally romantic, and interspersed with action, this novel has something for everyone.Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"After watching the movie and then finding myself compelled to read the book, I wrote a review for the DVD version of this great classic by Alexandre Dumas. I did give the adulterated movie 3 stars, even with its deviation from the far superior storyline of the novel (this story does not lend itself to being told in a 2-hour movie). But rather than 3 stars, the book is well deserving of 5, and then some.The tale of the Count is one of heavy, dark intrigue. This is not light reading, and the story will tax your patience and demand of you significant time and concentration if you are to mine its riches. Those with an attention span of a six-year-old need not apply, although any person, young or old, who yields to the lessons being lived out will come away from this book with impressive knowledge regarding the pitfalls of willful ignorance, deceit, and pride; and hopefully a better appreciation for justice, compassion, and love.As for the story itself, Edmond Dantes, a young man of considerable good character, finds himself wrongly imprisoned under dreadful circumstances. He eventually is tutored in prison by a man with extraordinary wisdom-just as the reader is tutored without realizing it as he reads the unfolding chapters. Edmond loses all, gains eternal wisdom and insight, and then begins his true journey into lands where friends and foes experience his heavy influence. The story is one of desperation and deliverance, defeat and despair, and ultimately of triumph at an awful cost. Spiritual applications abound throughout as learned from within dungeons to palaces, and our notions of justice and mercy are sorely tested as a wronged man loses all and then begins to execute what he considers to be, and may well be, God's judgment.If you dedicate the time and attention that this book deserves, you will not be disappointed. If you want to speed-read and add another title to your library card, you will miss the worthwhile messages that this book can bring to the soul. I say soul, but for those with spiritual understanding, the better term is spirit, for this is above all a spiritual book. The movie alludes to it; the book embodies it. Having now read the book and carefully endured the more tedious portions to ensure that I missed little, I can only say that we do ourselves much disservice by not committing the time to study works such as this. Love, hate, revenge, mercy, justice, and forgiveness are explored in detail in the lives of Edmond Dantes (the Count) and his friends and foes. This complicated novel is unbelievably rich in its timeless spiritual lessons."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one the greatest book ever written.I read the abridged version because it was shorter and cheaper. Big mistake.Upon reading the cliff notes I noticed all sorts of thing I missed out on and some of them were pretty important (such as what happens to Danglars)I have gone back and bought the Oxford Classics version and you should do the same."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, some people did not know it was a book until the movie came out, some people still don't even know it is a book. I thought it was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your chair, hafta turn the page, cliff hanger. That is, until you get past the first five pages of boring mush (literally only 5 pages). It is a classic story about a man who has everything going for him; until, on his wedding day his supposed friends frame him and send him to the legendary Chateau d'If for the rest of his life. But when he escapes from prison and finds a gigantic treasure, he sets out to reclaim his lost love and exact a slow, fitting punishment on his betrayers. Will he find his beloved Mercedes and get his revenge against his enemies, or will his whole plot go ka-put?"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The author is one of the most imaginative writers I have ever come across. With one unpredictable plot twist after another, this was an addictive page-turner that had me reading for hours on end, days at a time. Despite its formidable length, you will not want this novel to end.The novel centers around Edward Dantes, who we first glimpse as a young innocent sailor about to be married. The treachery of three men results in his being sent to waste away in prison. He manages to escape after 14 years, and the remainder of the novel entails his painstaking and elaborate revenge on the villains.The author taps on every human emotion in weaving this tale - love, hate, greed, fear, empathy, pride. It reminds me of a Russian novel: it has a large cast of characters about whom the reader knows everything, an intricate soap-operaesque plot, and is impossible to put down.In my view, this is great escapist entertainment and very imaginative. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I am not usually the type that likes to read books as long as this but The Count of Monte Cristo was worth all the pages. I have never been more excited to read a book before. Each time I picked it up I would tell myself I only had time to read one chapter but I always read about ten chapters before finally and reluctantly putting the book down. If I was to recommend any book to anyone, this would be the book.

This is an excellent story of jealousy, exile, fortune, and vengeance. A young sailor, Edmond Dantes, is wronged by friends and enemies alike. To cover up a conspiracy, Dantes is imprisoned to protect the guilty. While in prison Dantes is educated and hardened with hatred for those who betrayed him. He has sworn revenge on those who wronged him and is ready to escape when he learns of an immense fortune hidden on the isle of Monte Cristo. After his escape he unveals the vast treasure and disguises himself as the Count of Monte Cristo. Educated, free, and now wealthy; he has only to find those who wronged him and recover those who he loves."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Without exaggeration, 'The Count of Monte Cristo' is one of the greatest stories on earth. I\`m not saying it\`s the greatest book on earth--there are flaws sometimes in character development, and the overuse of coincidences--but the story itself is a gem unrivalled anywhere. When it comes to weaving a complex plot rife with fascinating characters, Dumas is a master; and each scene is instilled with just the necessary amount of dramatic tension and foreshadowing. Never once does the story slow its pace, yet without once detracting from its depth and power. The characters are often thrown into situations that are literally a matter of life and death, and suspense becomes the reader\`s constant companion. But the most compelling element in the story is Edmond Dantes himself, aka the Count of Monte Cristo, looming like a spectral shadow over the bright spectacle of French wealth portrayed here--a shadow with a broken heart and needs of which he is hardly aware, so intent is he on becoming a pitiless agent of revenge. The book\`s main flaw, I thought, was the abrupt resolution of his relationship with Haydee--she seemed more like a plot device than a real person. Other flaws consist of contrived plot scenarios which would be unacceptable today, but which to me at least, with their exuberant spontaneity, make this book even more of a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is my favorite book of all times - and to get it free from Amazon - amazing!

This modern English translation is probably one the best."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the long, long old school tales where the author was paid by the word, but the Count of Monte Cristo is a brilliant story about love, revenge and forgiveness. Yet for its time it's amazing how modern the novel still feels and one can see how it influenced other stories such as The Shawshank Redemption and Midnight Cowboy. Through these different themes are different narratives. There is the story of wronged imprisonment, a hunt for hidden treasure and a cunning and perfectly executed revenge scheme. All masterfully intertwined. The scenes in prison with Dantes and Abbe Faria are well paced and captivating. They do much to reveal the strong character and will of Dantes. It is after his escape from prison when he assumes the identity the count of Monte Cristo do we see just how resilient and capable Dantes is."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I haven't read a book in years.

Thanks"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I was familiar with the Count of Monte Cristo from the movie by the same name starring Jim Caviezel, and it used to be one of my favorite movies.... that is until I read the book. Now, not to say that the movie is not entertaining, but the breath and scope of this amazing book cannot be contained in a 90 minute movie. As a result of enjoying this book so immensely, I no longer enjoy watching the movie that much, but it is well worth it.I don't think I've ever read a book with so many different faces. The story has action, romance, friendships, enemies, betrayal, vengeance, redemption, comedy... everything you can think of is masterfully done in this book. Do not be daunted by its length, and definitely do not buy an abridged copy. This is the kind of book that will have you hooked in no time and before you know it you're closing the back cover; it's just that damn good."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Quite simply, one of the best novels of our time and one of my most favorites, hands down.From the moment that Dumas introduces us to the 18 year old tall slim and honest Edmond Dantes with his dark hair and black eyes sailing into Marseille, I entered his world not to quit a second before the very end was reached. In this complex plot with no less than 27 major characters and a dozen other minor ones, the author tests the strength of your memory and depth of your focus and you will still not stop reading the novel.For a while, my life was put on hold while the life of Edmond took over, occupying every fabric of my imagination. The beginning, the betrayal, the cursed fate, the shattered dreams, the agony and anguish of that innocent sweet soul in that dark dungeon for 14 harrowing years. How did Dumas have the heart to not only make up but also tell us such a cruel bitter tale? How could he make one single man endure so much agony?They say good writing entertains and great writing transforms. Ironically, the greatest sections of this book to me, difficult as they were to read, are during Edmond's captivity in Chateau d'If dungeon and during his relationship with Abbe Faria. Those passages are the most exquisite writing even if they recount the most agonizing period of Edmond's life. They were painfully difficult to read yet the unease lessened in knowing and anticipating the imminent revenge of Edmond.Today, I draw strength from the memory of Edmond's undying yet swaying hope in my most ordinary tasks and my humble difficulties. Perhaps, this is the definition of transformation on some level.I would read The Count of Monte Cristo again, if there weren't so many other amazing classics on my list. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Monsieur Dumas, for this gift to the world."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"What a character was Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870). The half Creole native of France wrote hundreds of books. Among the immense number are several classics such as \\"The Three Musketeer: tales and The Count of Monte Cristo. Both of these epic workswere penned in 1844!The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmund Dantes a young sailor from Marseilles. The callow sailor is in love with the fetching Mercedes but tragedy strikes1 He is betrayed by three jealous friends who send him to a dark prison cell. Edmund becomes friendly with an old Italian abbe prisoner who educates him in literature, language and history. After 14 years in a cell Dantes escaps from prison. He becomes involved with a group of smugglers. Dantes becomes a millionare many times over when he locates the buried treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo. His deceased friend the abbe had told him where to find it.Monte Cristo then begins a long series of adventures helping his friends and wrecking exquiste revenge on his enemies. He somewhat fades from view.The action focuses on the lives and loves of several Parisian families who have either helped or hindered Monte Cristo in career. Monte Cristo has Christ like qualities and is a wonderful hero beloved by the heroic age in which the novel first saw light. Everyone who clams to be educated should read this tremendous classic which is very readable.Dumas is able to portray a world through the use of his powerful pen.The Modern Library edition contain 1462 pages of print large enough not to cause eye strain! It is a feat of strength to lug the behemoth around! There are no footnotes or illustrations. Dspite its great length The Count of Monte Cristo keeps your interes. It is one of the world's classics which demands reading and rereading throughout a lifetime!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, or The Count of Monte Cristo, has often been refered to as the greates adventure novel of all time. The novel begins with a great betrayal of the lead--Edmond Dante, the count of Monte Cristo, etc -- by four associates--Fernand, Caderousse, Villefort and Danglars--which results in a lengthy imprisonment for Dante in the dreaded Castle d'If. During this imprisonment, Dante becomes highly educated under the tutelage of a fellow prisoner, Abbe Faria, and undergoes a spritual awaking; Dante henceforth wishes \\"...to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.'\\"What follows is a daring escape, the discovery of great treasure and an elaborate plan, taking place over more than a decade, to bring all to justice. There are approximately 45 different characters (of which 5 or 6 are aliases of the lead), and a complex, interwoven relationship among them. (I suggest creating a 'character map' as you go along to keep things straight.) Additionally, and unlike 'modern' novels, there is purpose in each carefully crafted scene; each element serving to drive the plot forward to the unforgettable climax. This is undoubtly a classic that is as relevant and exciting today as it was 170 years ago. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have read The Count of Monte Cristo a few times. The Unabridged Oxford Edition is the best. The explanatory notes are a great bonus as they deepen the experience of reading this Masterpiece. The introduction gives us very interesting supplementary information that allows for a greater appreciation of the story as well as for Alexander Dumas himself. This is a book everyone should read at least once in their lifetime, and I highly recommend reading the actual book, not Kindle. This is a book that you will develop a relationship to and it becomes your friend. There's something very nostalgic and comforting about holding a real book in your hands. I may be very old fashioned, but sometimes books don't feel right when electronics are involved. I love the cover of this edition as well (revised edition 2008) . I feel that it captures the essence of Edmund Dantes: A young, beautiful man with sadness and revenge in his eyes. The painting (Leon Cogniet's self portrait) evokes an ability to penetrate the Soul of Dantes, the greatest protagonist of all time. It may sound a bit silly, but reading this book makes me pause. And when I pause, I find myself studying this image while contemplating life. Life as I experience it through this incredibly complex adventure called The Count of Monte Cristo. The story is epic!! As the back page states: 'A novel of enormous tension and excitement'. I buy this particular copy in bulk and gift it to anyone I meet who is even just slightly interested in reading it. Most people, myself included, are absorbed within minutes of reading this book and we all finish it. As a good friend said to me while she was reading 'The Count': \\"You know when you are reading a great piece of literature; Classics are Classics for a Reason."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Reading classic fiction entails a fascinating insight into human nature. So often, we're intimidated by the \\"classic\\" status of a book, assuming it's going to be long, dry and inaccessible. With some exceptions, what you typically find is the opposite; a book that is just as engaging today as the day it was written, something that strikes you as a piece of pop culture that has endured because it was done so well. It's a real testament to the idea that some elements of human nature transcend time and place, staying fresh across generations.So it is with the Count of Monte Cristo. Add its massive length to its classic status and you have a book that a lot of people might be hesitant to pick up. I implore you to abandon any hesitancy you may feel and read this book immediately. It is nothing more and nothing less than the ultimate tale of love, betrayal, revenge and redemption. You will find yourself wrapped up with the characters, shocked by revelations and uplifted by the care lavished on the tale by Dumas. It's really that good.This book is obviously the inspiration for many popular stories that have followed in its footsteps. The one I couldn't get out of my head was The Princess Bride, which boils the story down to some of its most critical plot points and then plays them for laughs quite well.Now, stop reading reviews, order the book and start reading it.

It is now appropriate for ages 13-15, I would say, or for advanced ESL learners.The abridgment reads naturally and flows well. Extraneous plot elements that Robin Waterfield decided to leave out have been completely left out, meaning that, at least as far as I was able to detect, no vestigial traces of the original plot lingering about to confuse you.All the much-ballyhooed references to lesbianism and drugs in Dumas's original have, it need hardly be said, been deleted. Also, Dantes doesn't curse God so much in this one (in the dungeon scene, I mean)."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a simply wonderful story that will easily keep you engaged through the entire 1,000+ pages. The setting is Europe, mostly France, in the early 1800s, and in addition to everything else, the book provides a little window into that time and place. The characters, especially the Count, are fascinating, if not realistic. I'm no literary critic, but the mixture of reality and fantasy reminded me a bit of magical realism. Finally, the writing style is both engaging and easy to read. There is a reason why this book has pleased readers of all ages for so long."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"When I first purchased The Count of Monte Cristo, I laughed to myself how long it was. Weighing in at a hefty 1200+ pages, the thickness was pretty intimidating. I thought it'd take me at least a month to finish.I ended up finishing the book in only a week and a half. What the other reviews say about this novel is true - you really won't want to put this down. Dumas may have written this book in the 19th century, but don't let time gone by deceive you - it reads like a modern day page turning thriller. Don't be surprised if you are emotionally invested in the characters and the story after only reading the first 4 or 5 Chapters. The plot is compelling, and it will keep you interested the entire time - not an easy task for a book this long.On the surface, this book is just plain entertaining. You'll have fun as you are reading. At its core, though, The Count of Monte Cristo presents insightful philosophies on human nature, revenge, and justice. It tackles intriguing questions and themes as it goes on. I think some of the more apparent ones are 'the limits of human justice' ... 'the saving power of forgiveness' ... and 'will those who are evil and selfish in the world be judged in the next life by some higher authority?'Dumas attempts to answer each of these questions with brooding, elegant passages and descriptions. Along the way, you'll meet interesting characters that you'll either really care about or genuinely despise. It was a bit tricky to keep track of all the characters and the relationships between them all, but eventually, things will lock in and you'll feel like you're a part of the story.It's a classic for a reason. Don't you want to find out why? Put this one on your list! The sprawling epic of Edmond Dantes is a spiritual journey, and it's one that is worth experiencing. It may change the way you feel about the tempting impulse to avenge, and push you towards the liberating power of mercy and forgiveness."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dantes shows the true meaning of a superhero! Though he has no super powers, it is much more realistic than the comic MARVEL heroes such as \\"Spider Man\\" or \\"Hulk\\". He is taken away from his fiance\` to be thrown in prison for fourteen years after being falsely accused of Bonapartism during a time when Bonapart was exiled to the island of Elba.After fourteen years, however, Dantes escapes, with the help and wisdom of a supposed mad priest, and desires revenge on those who accused him of the crime. Over time, through love and wisdom, Dantes eventually finds that he not only needed to help his friends but he also needed to ask God to forgive him for possibly being vengeful.The characters are written with such emotion, the scenes with such detail, that one feels he is taking part in this cunningly written intense book. Alexandre Dumas has really done what others have not accomplished when writing such a carefully laid-out plot."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"It all begins at Marseilles on February 24, 1815. Nineteen-year-old Edmond Dant&eacute;s is a promising sailor. So promising, in fact, that he is about to be promoted to captain. He has saved up a fair amount of money and is about to make more with this promotion, enough to marry Mercedes, the love of his life. Young, vibrant, trusting and full of life, Dant&eacute;s couldn't be happier. And that is what causes his ultimate downfall. Envy, contempt and cowardice drive three men to wrongly accuse Dant&eacute;s of being a Bonapartist. For many years, Dant&eacute;s' only companions are a dungeon and a priest (fellow inmate). Dant&eacute;s has sworn revenge. The old priest and a small island called Monte Cristo will be the tools that help Dant&eacute;s become the Count of Monte Cristo, an avenging angel with a one-track mind. There are many twists throughout the novel.I read this book for the first time when I was sixteen. It had been a class assignment, and so I read it in automaton, not caring either way about the story. All I cared about was getting a decent grade on the quiz. Sixteen years later, I read it for the second time and... well, to say that I couldn't put this book down would be an understatement. The Count of Monte Cristo is a riveting tale full of history, suspense, romance and adventure. The backdrop of the Napoleonic era makes this book all the more palatable. Alexandre Dumas knew Napoleon and all of the political intrigue that went on during that era quite well. Even though I loved this book, there are some areas that threw me. Characters and storylines are thrown in without so much as an explanation at first. At times these occurrences felt like riddles or missing pieces to a puzzle I couldn't wait to complete. It all makes sense as the story progresses, of course, but it was nevertheless frustrating on some occasions. I don't know if the fault lies in Dumas' writing or in Lowell Bair's translation, or if the story had been intended to be narrated that way. In either case, it wasn't enough to keep me from enjoying the story. If you're new to Dumas, then this is the book to seek. It's one of the most popular classics for a good reason, after all!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo stirs the passions of everyone who reads it - so much so that it has been made and remade a half-dozen times in English, a fairly astonishing fact since the Dumas classic is originally en Francais. It is one of the most popular and best-selling novels of history and it is difficult to say whether this book or \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is the most popular novel by Alexandre Dumas, p&egrave;re.The story is set up perfectly by Dumas: Merchant ship \\"Phaeron\\" pulls into Marseilles in 1815. First mate Edmond Dant&egrave;s leaps onto the pier to report to owner Monsieur Morrel that although the ship has returned as planned with goods, Captain Lecl&egrave;re passed away on the journey, leaving Edmund as acting Captain.Morrel immediately promotes Dant&egrave;s to Phaeron's Captain, just before Edmund runs to reunite with his beautiful fianc&eacute;e Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s. Dant&egrave;s, the hard-working son of a commoner, can hardly believe his fortune. He has been promoted to ship's Captain at a young age and is about to marry the most beautiful young lady in town.But something is rotten in Marseilles...Jealousy prompts rivals Danglars (the Phaeron's purser) and Lieutenant Fernand Mondego (also desiring Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s) to conspire to write a secret note to the authorities accusing Edmund of being a Bonapartist traitor.Soldiers come to arrest Edmund at his engagement party. He is hauled before Villefort, an apparently sympathetic prosecutor. Villefort seems kindly until he realizes there actually IS a Bonapartist traitor around... the prosecutor's father. To protect the family name (and his career ambitions), Villefort has our hero put away.Edmond Dant&egrave;s goes from the heights of happiness to the depths of despair - without explanation he is thrown into the darkest, dampest dungeon of France's Alcatraz - the Chateau d'If.For those unfamiliar with the story, it may appear that I have given it all away, but you will find that this is only the setup for the most thrilling tale of hope and despair, vengeance and mercy, nobility and justice and revenge. The story comes complete with exciting sword fights, poisonings, secrets identities, kidnappings, last-second escapes, underground catacombs and formal balls. Especially for a character of two hundred years ago, Dant&egrave;s makes James Bond seem a dullard by comparison.If you have only seen \\"the movie\\" you have not at all had the pleasure of the layers and textures of this sublime story. The 1975 Richard Chamberlain is okay, if truncated, but the 2002 version with James Caviezel is practically an abomination.Are you a \\"book person\\"? Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this treasure, and perhaps no other book more deserves a reading of the unabridged version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This was the first book by Dumas that I've read and I enjoyed it very much. I did familiarize myself with the characters by reading the excellent Wikipedia article first. The style and lenght and plot and names were all reminiscent of something by Charles Dickens. I'm looking forward to checking out The Three Musketeers next. The chapters are very numerous (and short) like Moby Dick, but the characters and the plot are much more engaging."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"NOTE: I really hate that Amazon includes reviews from several editions of the same book under one heading. Some editions are abridged for this novel, and that truly is an injustice and the reviews show that. The Oxford Classics version - which I read - is an UNABRIDGED version, and my review is based on that.This story revolves around Edmond Dantes, a young man who seemingly has everything going for him. His employer has much regard for him and is about to put him as captain of his own ship, he is about to marry the woman he loves, all is right in Dantes world. Unfortunately, this type of happiness and success breeds jealousy and envy, and Dantes finds himselft falsely accused and imprisoned. He does escape, and therein the true tale begins.The story weaves back and forth and entangles lives - but central is the thirst for revenge. Dumas certainly has a way of telling a story, even a long one, and keeping it interesting a fresh. There are twists and turns and an entire host of interesting characters. One moment I found myself cheering for Dantes and the next I was hoping he wouldn't do what I thought he would. However, one can never be too sure of what might happen next or where the story might go.I had put off reading this novel because of the length for so long, and I now regret having done that. Although the tale of revenge is an old one, Dumas has managed to weave a story filled with mystery, adventure, and excitement with just a touch of romance - what more could a reader possibly want?"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those classics that not enough people know about.

Like the whole General Hospital Luke and Laura except slightly diffferent.This is a big story and you will find it hard to put it down once you get all the pieces in motion.So, read it.

The bulk of the plot follows Dant&eacute;s' life after his miraculous escape from prison, as he ruins the lives of each of those responsible for his torment.The story begins with a teenage Dant&eacute;s receiving the position of captain upon the Pharaon, a trading vessel stationed in Marseilles, France. This position allows him enough money to finally marry the love of his life, Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, which enrages Fernand Mondego, a fisherman who is also after Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s' heart. Mondego, with the help of Monsieur Danglars, a sailor jealous of Dant&eacute;s' position as captain, decides to write a letter to Monsieur de Villefort, chief magistrate, denouncing Dant&eacute;s as a man guilty of treason, as he supposedly still supports Napoleon Bonaparte's regime as evidenced by a letter he was supposed to hand to Villefort's father. Dant&eacute;s is then sentenced to life in prison, where he meets the Abb&eacute; Faria who teaches him everything he needs to know to become an aristocratic Count, enabling him to execute his revenge. What follows is an adventurous tail of one man's story as he wreaks havoc on those responsible for his imprisonment.After seeing the movie based on this story and hearing from others how influential the novel is, I decided to give the seemingly enormous 400-page book a shot. Unfortunately for me, I accidentally chose the abridged version (the normal book is over 1000 pages) and could only enjoy the book for short time, as I finished it within a week. Dumas' unique writing style and uncanny ability to tell a story make The Count of Monte Cristo an easy and suspenseful read. Dumas excellently develops each character so the reader can truly understand the motives for their actions and combines each individual story line in a way that is, albeit confusing and at times hard to follow, amazingly interesting. Every character is somehow intertwined and each plays a unique role in contributing to the downfall of others within the story. More importantly, after finishing the novel, readers come away having learned a lot about human nature and life in general.Those thinking they will find the book similar to the movie be warned: it is much, much better. Whereas the Hollywood version of the story focuses on the love between Mercedes and Dant&eacute;s, the novel incorporates no such story line after Dant&eacute;s' escape. Furthermore, the novel is much more intricate in plot, as more central characters are incorporated into the story and tons of seemingly small details and side stories come together to play a crucial part in The Count's quest for destruction. The central story line, writing style, and themes of the novel all come together to make The Count of Monte Cristo a great read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have no words to describe this extremely well written book. After finishing this book, you will hopefully have the same feeling. That's how good this book is.It's not a brain teaser but none the less keeps the reader engrossed until the very end with it's well narrated story. If you are thinking about reading this book, go no further on reading anymore reviews. Simply pick up a copy of your own and start enjoying this great read. You will have difficult time putting it down....this much is guaranteed!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Edmond Dant&egrave;s, framed of treason by some people he thought he trusted, seeks revenge. After becoming promoted to captain at the early age of nineteen, Edmond is envied by many, Mondego is in love with Edmond's fianc&eacute;e, Danglars wants the position of Edmond, and Cauderousse despises Edmond and his fortune. The men plot to have Edmond thrown in jail, and so he is. There he meets Faria, a priest who teaches him the secret to a treasure, hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. When Edmond breaks free, he finds the treasure, and with it he develops elaborate plans from what he finds out about those who betrayed him, and takes away everything from them, one by one. This is an excellent book, recommended to readers who enjoy examining complicated plots.This book did indeed have a very interesting plot. Edmond first finds Cauderousse and receives important information about the other two people who framed him. He becomes a great friend of Mondego who is very powerful and wealthy by saving his son from bandits. He learns that Mondego received his wealth by betraying a friend. His deceitfulness wrecks his reputation, his wife (Edmond's former fianc&eacute;e) and son abandon him and commits suicide.The characters are also very interesting, being very unique and realistic. Edmond at first is a young man having great honesty and friendship, one you would not expect to take revenge so severely. He almost develops a complete different personality as the Count of Monte Cristo, a grudge-bearing and angry man hidden under a mask of kindness. One of Edmond's targets, Danglars, may be described as greedy and selfish. It is through this trait that Edmond punishes him and makes him bankrupt.Aside from having an interesting plot, this book also is suspenseful in many ways. When Edmond attempts to escape from jail, he is thrown unexpectedly into the sea. Another suspenseful scene is when Edmond watches as a ship is torn apart in the storm. This story may also be suspenseful in other ways beside intense action. When Edmond follows through with his plots of revenge, it is exciting to see what will happen next.This book is an excellent and challenging work, good for almost any reader who enjoys classic novels taking place in the past. This particular classic is one which challenges the work of Edgar Allen PoeI.

This masterpiece of a novel is next-to-impossible to put down. I became so involved in the book that, when I finished, I felt sort of deprived. I wished the book would continue for another 1,000 pages. By the way, if you're going to read this book, don't read the abridged version. It is NOTHING like the unabridged, original copy."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Among adventure novels I've read, CoMC stands head and shoulders above the rest. A long book, I wish it was double its length. There is romance and jealousy here, yet not a mere meringue that takes up space without offering substance, but psychologically complex relations that contribute to, and are in turn enriched by, the plot. The character who seems too good to be true is changed by the injustice that befalls him into someone more complex and real. No character is a mere set piece or caricature. The swashbuckling needs to be there, and is wittily and strategically placed to serve the plot. Here are moral lessons and character studies that could keep a book group talking for a year, but Dumas never preaches, never resorts to being pedantic. Every character is precisely etched, memorable, and as necessary to the story's integrity as any in a Greek drama. I felt toward this book like one feels toward a new love: devouring the time together, resentful of the time apart. Time was measured by how long I could read, and when, and how long it would last. I can't think of a novel I've enjoyed more, on more levels."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Some time back, a friend recommended that I read this book. I am very glad that I have that friend. This book is perhaps the best I have ever read, and I have read A LOT of books.While an extraordinarily long book, I never found myself putting it down unless I had to. It is classic example of a book with every good literary element without unrealistic plots, characters, and events. Everything that happens is plausible (except maybe the Count's money).However, the book can be difficult to understand. I would advise rereading over what you have already covered, or just skimming over the pages you already read. Also, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take notes on who is who and what is happening, because it can get very confusing.Overall, if you want to read a really good novel, this is your best bet. It has something to satisfy everyone, from action to romance to revenge. Not only that, but all of these elements are cleverly woven together in such a way that everything from earlier on comes back to be of vast significance in the later parts of the book, etc. This work is nothing short of spectacular, so get reading!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it at least 15 times. This book has something to offer to absolutely anyone that can read -- revenge, romance, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, political intrigue, history, etc. The cast of characters is unforgettable and well developed. The depth and breadth of the revenge plot in this book is unprecedented and unmatched. I wrote a paper on this book for my Revenge Literature class in college. Whenever I have been dissatisfied with recent books and need something really great to fall back on, I pick this book up again and love it just as much."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is my favorite all time book so I was excited to see a Kindle version. After reading it I'm very pleased as I only saw one typo (that I noticed anyway). You will enjoy reading this book thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am incredibly picky about which version of a book I buy. When I went to the bookstore to buy The Count of Monte Cristo, I poured through the text to see if I could find any trace of the word \\"abridged.\\" Since I did not, I purchased the book (Publisher--Enriched Classic--AVOID!!!!). This quickly became my favorite work of fiction, right up there with Les Miserables, the Three Musketeers, and The Phantom of the Opera (I find it interesting that all of my favorite books are 19th/20th Century French Literature...hm.) In any case, after seeing another version of the book and reading the various reviews, I find that my world has been turned upside down because apparently, my edition of this book IS abridged (It's sneaky about it--instead of \\"abridged\\" it says \\"series edited by...\\"). I am both appalled and furious. Having said that, I am quickly going to purchase a TRUE unabridged edition of the book and reread it. Why is this? Well, now to get to my point. This is one of the most amazing stories in the history of literature (behind Les Mis, of course). Mystery, adventure, suspense, betrayal, revenge, the battle and balance between vigilantism and justice, intrigue, romance, wit... what more is there to say about this novel? You truly will not be able to put it down. Now, having said all this, I would also like to say that I, personally, think it would be worthwhile to read it in the original French text--after all, if it is this amazing after it's been sorted through and hashed and translated (which is an imperfect process, I assure you), how mind-blowingly phenomenal must it be in its original languge, with Dumas' true intention and literary style? It is for this exact question that I am going for a Bachelor's Degree in Romance Languages. My life goal is to read Dumas, Hugo, and Leroux in all of their original glory.My point? READ THE BOOK! I also recommend the Three Musketeers and Les Miserables, which you might have guessed if you actually read this whole review."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have spent hundreds of dollars on this site and have never been provoked to write a review...until now.

Awesome, and John Lee was the BEST reader ever."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Reading an abridged book is like eating cake without frosting. You don't really need the frosting, but the frosting is what gives a cake it's delicious flavor. The Count of Monte Cristo is a book which ought to be read unabridged, if only for the richness and flavor of the text. The evolution of Edmond Dantes from sailor to prisoner to Count of Monte Cristo is enthralling. Alexander Dumas's book is captivating. It is hard to set aside CoMC, as the characters are extremely interesting and well-developed. It's not like the antagonists are straight-up bad guys with no redeeming qualities, they are just people who make bad choices and act out of self-interest.Essentially, the moral provided in this HUGE tome is that revenge is a dish best served cold. In order to understand why I say this, I shall provide some backstory. Three men known to Edmond Dantes, all jealous of him in some way, one wants his job, the other wants his girlfriend, plot a way to put Edmond Dantes in prison. Their plan works and Dantes is arrested. He's thrown in prison without a trial. Dantes spends awhile in jail and thinks of nothing but his revenge. Eventually, Dantes escapes and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Luckily, for the reader we get to see the entire evolution of Dantes, we see him in his darkest moments as well as in his crowning glory. His revenge is most apt.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to be transported into another time as well as for someone who is looking to fall in love with well-developed characters. There are many editions out there, I recommend the Robin Buss unabridged translation published by Penguin Classics. Buss's translation is fantastic and readable, the phrasing is not awkward at all, as in other translations. Also, Buss's translation includes all of the naughty bits - i.e. one sex scene, some drug use, and a dash of homosexuality."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition ASIN: B002RI9KL8.

Like i said I rarely ever read books but this one I actually read twice, maybe like a year later, and if I can find it again I will definatley read it now cause its been about 10 years or so. Oh and I was so excited when the movie came out but it disappointed because it left so much out and it was not as action and suspensed-packed like the book, which is usually the case I guess but it really left huge chunks out.

A god-like creature, master of disguise, wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, extremely handsome, expert marksman, expert swordsman, philosopher, apothecary, highly moral, (carrying out God's work of vengeance, not his own) unimpeachable manners, speaks many languages, can quote both Roman and Greek mythology and philosophers from Cicero to Plato, in fact is an expert on every subject under the sun, never lies and is never wrong. (p.1027) A perfect human being who loves young girls in a fatherly way, kisses his slave on her forehead, acted as guardian angel to 17 year old Valentine and go-between for her and her fianc&eacute;.I would not want to see the film of this book, no earthly creature could match up to the mysterious, romantic, mythical figure of The Count of Monte Cristo. Imagination is far far better. This wonderful man takes on all the various shapes and forms of his different disguises, he is so clever it takes your breath away. Oh, if only we could get away with that! Oh, if only we had half his skill to get back at our enemies the way he did. It makes one's mouth water to think of it. Delicious!Men are turned on by this book because it is full of adventure, the ultimate \\"Boy's Own\\" story. Women are turned on by it not only because it is thrilling but because it speaks to the fairy tale longing, (Cinderella) of finding the perfect man..... He doesn't exist girls and boys, sad to say, it is just a fantasy.In the beginning, even though far fetched, (the escape from jail, the treasure) one goes along for the ride, but towards the end of the book Dumas gets a bit carried away. The fantasy good as it is becomes a bit hard to sustain, the magic cure-all drops, the murderous step-mother nobody suspects, the crippled grandfather blinking in Morse code, and then of course the almost Shakespearean ending of the star crossed lovers. All stretching the imagination to the limit, but loving it being stretched, and rejoicing in the thrilling ride.I enjoyed the book enormously and found it almost impossible to put down for all the same reasons everyone else did. It is so well written and the pace never stops. I particularly enjoyed the scene described when Albert and Franz came to watch the carnival with Monte Cristo and Franz asked The Count if he could obtain a window overlooking the Piazza del Popolo where there were to be two executions at the start of the festivities. The coolness with which Monte Cristo explains that the program has been changed, in a \\"tone of voice\\" Dumas says, \\"as though he were reading the personal column.\\" (p.383).\\"Hum! The first will be mazzolato, the second decapitato. Yes, this is what was originally intended, but I think that since yesterday there has been a change in the order and conduct of the ceremony. .......they were speaking of some kind of stay of execution to one of the two men...... That means you will be denied a guillotining but you still have the mazzolata, which is a very curious form of torture when you see it for the first time - or even the second; while the other, which in any case you know, is too simple, too unvaried. There is nothing unexpected in it. ..... Ah come now, don't talk to me about Europeans where torture is concerned. They understand nothing about it. With them, cruelty is in its infancy - or perhaps its old age.\\"You can imagine this man with a sword in his hand, never flinching, nerves of steel!Read it to escape, it's a ticket to a magic carpet ride. Be a little like Monsieur le Comte himself when he said \\"....chaque fois que je souhait je peux me s&eacute;parer du reste du monde\\" \\" ....whenever I wish I can separate myself from the rest of the world.\\" (p.314).Worth every one of its five stars.

Have you heard the saying don't judge a book by its cover? Well I learned that by reading this book. After picking it up I didn't really expect to like it but stranger things have happened. From the first page to the last the book is full of excitement and drama. It starts out with the main character Edmond Dantes sailing on the boat whose captain has died so he takes control till they get back back to the island of Marseilles. Dantes is betrayed by his fellow shipmate and friend and is sent to jail. After escaping he is rescued by a ship that hires him to work from them until he gets back to the island of Marseilles, where he changes his identity to the Count of Monte Cristo after unearthing his hidden family treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Upon arriving there he finds out his farther has died his friend have left and his wife has moved on and left not to be seen again. He moves to Paris to become one of the richest men there. No longer the poor sailor he use to be leaving his last life behind him to go and do great things. Follow along as the Count lives his rich and wonderful life doing as he wishes living as he does. Learn about how rich people lived back then. Well after reading this book I was pretty impressed by it and would probably read it again some day.

Five stars are too few."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is and will probably continue to be my favorite boook of all time. It has got everything you could possibly want in a book. It's got betrayal, love, imprisonment, vengance, action, drama, and comedy. But you can read the synopsis for yourself.More important than the plot of the story is that the reader will learn to love Edmond Dantes, the main character. They will admire his strength, his wits, his arrogance, and the way he learnes from his mistakes.The reader will also learn to completely hate Danglars, Villefort, and Fernand. Every single horrible thing that happens to them, the reader will truly believe is justly deserved, even when Edmond believes it's too much.The writing is also wonderful. The reader will practically be transported to France as they read this novel. The word choice is so magnificent and the sentences flow so well that the reader will feel every emotion that the characters do, and will probably even taste the sweet Parisian air in their mouths.I first read the Signet Classic abridged version, and I thought this novel was great, but then I picked up the unabridged Modern Library version and enjoyed it even more.

The storyline was very exciting and the characters are so real. It's amazing how a man goes from sitting in a prison cell for years with no money at all, to becoming one of the richest people in France. I would definately recommend this book to readers of all ages. If you're looking for a good, exciting book then this is the one for you.

And so the stage is set for the greatest revenge novel ever written.Swashbuckling novels are a sub-genre of historical fiction. Too easily, the whole genre is dismissed as juvenile reading. The Count of Monte Cristo features two cases of infanticide, a serial poisoner, a stabbing, three suicides, torture, execution, drug-induced sexual fantasies, illegitimacy, transvestism, lesbianism, dramatic soliloquies, references to classical history, the effects of hashish, all in about 1300 pages.

It is truly engrossing. As many previous readers have warned it WILL keep you up nights when you should really put it down and go to bed to wake up for the morning meeting next day.This story is wonderfully imaginative and intricate. One third of the way into the book (and I'm talking about the Modern Library version with all chapters intact), you wonder why there are so many chapters that ostensibly have little to do with our hero Edmond Dante aka Count of Monte Cristo. The details of where Caderousse end up with La Carconte, the chapters on Luigi Vampa, the chapter on Franz d'Epinay's first encounter with the Count of Monte Cristo? I was slightly baffled as to why Dumas would include them? But I soon understood that every character, no matter how minor, plays some role in the story -- either because they become an important instrument later on in the Count's revenge or they serve to tell us something about the Count (as in Franz d'Epinay's case).From the beginning of the book until Edmond's escape and discovery of the treasure, the reader is well-involved in his story and his life. After he finds fabulous wealth, the reader knows nothing more about this character's inner life. Everything we know about Edmond (and the Count) from then on, is through others. There is a switch in perspective that should have been effective but I found it detracted from the story. Dumas does this of course to convey a sense of mystery surrounding the Count, mystery that is absolutely crucial to his success in gaining revenge. But this sudden break from a mostly single perspective (Edmond's) to many, many perspectives about the Count is distracting, and really breaks the story into two stories rather than one cohesive long tale.The other criticism I have for this book is the amount of repetitive descriptions. I was at times irritated in the beginning at the numerous \\"tremblings\\" and \\"pale with tremblings\\" written about Fernand. Later on, Dumas drums into our heads how \\"mysterious\\" and \\"cryptic\\" and \\"indecphirable\\" the Count is. OK, we get it!!Overall, though I can't criticize much a book that kept me up till 2am for 10 solid days. He certainly did something right! The story is well-thought out, intricate as the plot and subplots can be they tie in (sometimes TOO perfectly), and the characters are well-drawn. And just when I catch myself writing the story off as an action-adventure novel, I run across some of the most exquisite and beautifully noted observations on human behavior I've ever read.So suspend your disbelief (some of the hyperbole on the superiority of the Count and the heroism of certain characters made me roll my eyes), believe in love (for Mercedes more than Haydee (????)), forgive some of the incredulous moments (agree about others' questioning of Edmond's readiness to throw away his revenge plans when he was so close to suceeding and his sudden remorse at the end is also a stretch). Put all those little criticisms aside, do NOT see the movie that just came out, read this book! It is worth the time investment and sleepless nights."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers.

Within five minutes of reading it, I was hooked. The next 1,000 pages simply flew by and I literally could not put the book down. For someone who's never read it before, it's an enthralling tale of treachery, despair, hope, and ultimately a quest for vengeance. After finishing &quot;The Count&quot;, I immediately sought out every book by Dumas I could get my hands on (The Three Musketeers, Ten Years After, and The Man in the Iron Mask). They were all exceptional reads, but none of them matched the brilliance of &quot;The Count .&quot;Any reader who enjoys tales of adventure and has a taste for historical novels will love this book. I thought the recent movie version was excellent too, but I highly recommend reading the book first."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Superb, what a tale, I was riveted by the fascinating story, so deep so full of the deepest human feelings. The language is sophisticated and typical of the 19th century when it was written. It is an intelligent book and far more enjoyable than Victor Hugo's masterpiece \\"Les Miserables\\". I read it quickly, it was nearly 900 pages but how fast paced it was and how well the characters were outlined. Dumas is a master storyteller and apart from the authentic retelling of the story in the TV series with Gerard Depardieu there are few stories which compare. It is remarkable by how well they stuck to the storyline in the TV series and how well the characters such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Danglers, Villefort, Mercedes etc were portrayed.The story of a simple sailor who is soon to become a captain and his love for the beautiful Mercedes who he is just about to marry and the terrible circumstances which follow with the framing of the sailor by his supposed friends Fernand and Danglers and the hellish times to follow, he spent 14 years in a dungeon. The suffering which is portrayed so well, its almost as if Dumas himself had suffered so, somehow the book actually gives an inkling of what it would be like to be trapped within a tiny dingy, dark and stinking room for 14 years with no recreation no entertainment noone to talk to and simple the inability to leave the room, madness seems inevitable. The Abbe Faria saved him this, so much love to give to Edmond Dantes, he restores his life. His subsequent enriching and terrible revenge and the need for him to free himself of the suffering of others only to find it hidden in his own depths. It just doesn't get any better than this. Its not often I give 5 stars. Its a miracle, ... To say the least worth every cent and I would have paid four times as much for it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read this novel a couple years ago, and was absolutely enthralled by it; Dumas' writing style is so clear and concise, and yet it still maintains the beauty of story, which is truly amazing. While poring over these fond memories, I decided I would purchase it, simply so I could keep around at my leisure; I will have to admit to you, this book only gets better the second time around (also an excellent trick any time you're reading a difficult text you can't quite get the hang of), and could truly appreciate the depth of this book. Alexander has definitely crafted one of the true classics of his time, and in my opinion it rivals any its cookie-cutter brethren that are churned out now, and I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is just starting out in classic novels, or who has yet to read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is the finest piece of literature I have ever read without question. Dumas has a tremendous writing style that is also evident in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; as it is in this offering. This is an epic story of love, betrayal, revenge and perserverence. I could not put this book down at times, it kept me riveted and wondering what would happen next like nothing else I have read. You will not regret reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"If you've ever thought life was unfair, you need to read this book. Revenge has never been so complete, and the avenger even has a spiritual awakening at the end. There's sword fights for guys and fancy clothes and romances for the girls. I first read the abridged version in the 8th grade, I read the full version a year later, and I'm reading it again right now. It's really that good. Any crime-ring or revenge themed book you will ever read draws references from this Dumas classic. And hey, there's a movie now too!(p.s. this is coming from a now 18-year-old actress with a very short attention span)"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Dumas' classic paints an engrossing tale of love, treachery, and revenge. This superb book begins quickly, drawing you in to the world of Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a world sacrificed for another's ambition. While he spent years in a forgotten cell, his lust for vengeance grew. When he finally escaped, he carefully and patiently exacted his perfect revenge.This book has many good qualities, some almost too good. Dumas created a fascinating, enthralling plot, complete in every detail. However, there were times when the plot became too detailed, and forced me to slow down and think about what went on. Also, the pace of the book is perfect: as the action unfolds, the book reads quickly, but then slows down again to give importance to the time Dant&egrave;s takes in his quest. For all this, Dumas' masterpiece ranks as one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A few years ago I saw the movie Sleepers with Brad Pitt, Jason Patric and Kevin Bacon. It was about a gang of pre-teens who are abused in a reform school, read Count of Monte Cristo in school and vow to take revenge on their persecutors, even if it takes years and years to put their plan into action. This led me to believe that Count of Monte Cristo glorified the concept of revenge. Dumas did so much more than that. He portrayed a life that was completely consumed by the need for revenge and in the end the true message was of regret, not revenge. For me that message transformed this book from an entertaining thriller to a powerful classic. As I have said in other reviews, I have young children and this will be a must read when they are teens. I can tell my children that I believe in turning the other cheek, but this classic illustrates why forgiveness should beat revenge on any given day."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"'The Count of Monte Cristo' is, in my opinion, the greatest book ever written. The first time I read it, I was 13. I was at summer camp and read the book in 3 days. I'm 19 now and I have read it around 15 times. I never get tired of the story. I love how Dumas writes subplots that all get entwined all through the book. I've read the abridged version, too. It's not even close to being as good as the original. If you only read the abridged one, you'll miss a lot of the plot that is very important. Anyways, I love this book so much and I want everyone else to too!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Think of the best movie you ever watched, multiply it by 100 and then you might be able to understand how great of a book this is. I have favorites in literature, but to be honest, this surpasses them all. This book is...perfect in every sense. It is something all people should read. BUT, be warned, you must read the UNabridged version. I just read it and cannot fathom reading it any other way. My advice: read The Count of Monte Cristo, read it ALL."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book has been one of my favorites since freshman year of high school. A few years later when I found that the version I read was incomplete, I looked on Amazon and found the complete version and I am very pleased. I finally got to enjoy the uninterrupted magnificence of this complete novel. Get the complete experience now!!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have loved this book since I read it as an assigned book in high school. I managed to keep my Scholastic abridged version, but when it started to come apart, I searched for a replacement. I bought another copy from a local bookstore, and found that many of the important plot lines had been changed in the different abridgment (and possibly translation too).I found this copy, purchased it, and found out how much rich detail I was missing. Both of the editions I had read prior were missing much of the fantastic storytelling that makes Dumas such a great author.If you love to lose yourself in books, don't miss the opportunity to read the UNABRIDGED version sold here. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Hello again, friends,Having just completed reading \\"War & Peace\\" (translated by R. Pevear and L. Volonkhonsky )and \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\",( The Penguin Classic edition) in less than 2 1/2 months. I have to say that these two novels are the greatest ever written. The 2,400 pages, combined, were read so swiftly,( for me !) I scarcely had time for anything else. I am going to read \\"The Three Musketeers\\"( Modern Library), next. I bought this edition before I knew about the recently published, Penguin Classic Deluxe Edition. I dont know, but I think the Modern Library edition is an abridgement. Let me know if I am wrong.The character Edmond Dantes is one of the greatest ever penned. He rises off the pages and dwells in your mind and you become \\"one\\" with him as he leads us on the journey from star-crossed young sailor in love with Mercedes to the fabulously wealthy title character. Most of the people you meet along the way are so well conceived and drawn you\\"d think you know them. As others have written, I wish this book didn't end. Amazon shows a sequel to this book published in 1849, but it is currently unavailable. Maybe someday it will be re-published.Robin Buss did an excellant job translating this huge book.JUst buy it. You will never finish it in the time allotted by a library.Cest Magnifique!!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Fifteen hundred pages, what a whopper of a story, but I've read far shorter books that bored me to tears. Not this one. Sometimes I felt Dumas could have been a Russian novelist, intertwining the lives of noble families to the point where I needed a scorecard. The Count could have gone around with his rapier and pistol and gotten revenge in just a few pages but instead allows his enemies to hoist themselves on their own petards. In the end, their undoing is not just the fine planning and work of the Count but French society itself in the post-Bonaparte years. I didn't want the Count to sail away just like I didn't want the story to close, but his work was done, the virtuous rewarded, and the selfish and greedy punished."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I purchased the Tor Edition Count of Monte Cristo for the Kindle. I have always enjoyed this novel because of it's wonderfully involved plot and characters. I was disappointed in Tor Edition. This is an abridged version with much of the flavor of the original edited out. I read several chapters and found myself missing much of the writing that connects the story's plot lines and makes the story coherent. Rather than continuing with this edition, I found a more complete, possibly unabridged, edition also for the Kindle.I would not recommend the Tor Edition of the Count of Monte Cristo but recommend to anyone wanting an excellent winter read to find an unabridged version and settle in for a great time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Simply put, I love this book. What a great book to introduce to students interested in historical adventures, and this one is spot on. It's one of the great adventure novels, with lots of action, well-written characters, important issues, and can be read quickly because of its compelling storyline. Also, there is the deception factor, which makes for great storytelling, but in this case the deception is of good in the eternal struggle that is good versus evil. Scott A. Reighard, author:Jamestown: Journey Back in Time"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The book is great. I can hardly put it down. It is 1400 pages and I will be sorry when the end comes."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a modern translation of Dumas' greatest book in my opinion. The translator gives good background on the translation, life of Dumas and great footnotes explaining both history of the period and cultural aspects not common knowledge today. This adds greatly to the enjoyment and understanding of the story.I recommend that anyone interested in reading The Count of Monte Cristo not be scared away by the length of the book and purchase an abridged version. The amount deleted results in a disconnected and not nearly as interesting story. I read an abridged version mistakingly bought before purchasing this one and knowing the story from a previous reading was dismayed at the amount which was eliminated. Buy the unabridged and enjoy Dumas' tale of betrayal and vengeance in all its brilliance."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Excellent version of this book. The Count of Monte Cristo has never had a better translation."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'd never read it so I decided to tackle the unabridged version - all 1200+ pages. It was worth it. There was a lot going on in this book. I got tired of the revenge angle after awhile. While I could understand it, it seemed a shame that such a rich and talented character couldn't have done more with his life than getting back at those who'd hurt him. It was kind of sick after awhile."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is not the first time I have read this book. To me, it is fascinating and ones started it is hard to stop reading. It's all about a man's revenge on people who harmed him with a political flair."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I \\"count\\" The Count of Monte Cristo among my favorite books. It is one that I reread every year. I finally realized that I had been missing a great deal of the storyline by reading only the abridged version, and so I began a search for an unabridged copy. The Penguin Classics edition is perfect. The only caution is that the complete story is a lot to handle in paperback form. The spine is subject to breaking with too much handling."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I love this book. This is the best book I have ever read. I love the translation. Haven't read another version but compared them in the store and this had the best prose, hands down. Awesome, you will love this."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I sought out the Bantam Classic version of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo as I feel it is presented in an easy to read format. The book allows many areas for note taking and highlighting. I would recommend this version of the classic to any High School or College Student who is studying this work. I also recommend Dumas' story as it is a great tale."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a book that will live forever, because its themes of vengeance, forgiveness, power, humility, etc. are universal themes that will always be relevant in society, even if the setting changes. I read this as a young teen and have revisited it many times since. Each reading rewards me with some new insights, for this is a multi-layered, complex tale that grips the reader from the first few sentences and never lets go.I have several editions of this novel and recently purchased the Barnes and Noble Leatherbound Classic edition because I loved the cover art with the blue, gold, and red colors and motifs. It is a worthy addition to any collector's library."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just finished reading this book for school, and I absolutely loved it!! Dumas' captivating writing style combined with the intriguing tale of Edmond Dantes make this novel a must read for all lovers of classics and quality literature."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Buss' translation makes The Count of Monte Cristo a beautiful, smooth and understandable read. I highly recommend it. Dumas would be pleased."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"It is one of a must have classic stories of all time.

I loved the plot, the writing style (Dumas is very witty), and the characters. This has become one of my favorite books of all time.I will give a warning though to be prepared to spend time thinking as you read, this isn't a book where you can thoughtlessly read. There are a lot of characters and they are all intertwined.This is NOT a kids book!But get this book, it deserves to be read and enjoyed!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books I've ever read - and I'm not much of a \\"classic lit\\" person. The unabridged version looks intimidating but it's an \\"easy read.\\" Every word was so gripping that I flew through this in days. The story evoked emotions similar to watching a thriller movie. There were numerous \\"edge of your seat\\" moments for me.The Robin Buss translation is wonderful and very easy to read. However, the only thing I don't like about this is the binding. The cardstock paper for the cover is very stiff and it seems impossible to not permanently bend it out of shape once you open the book. It also seems impossible to not get ugly white cracks down the spine. I'm disappointed that Penguin didn't publish the paperback out of sturdier material like the Modern Library books.Other than that, I think this is one of the greatest novels I've ever read. My hope is that Penguin will republish this as part of their clothbound series."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I think that The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is one of the greatest works of all time. Edmond Dantes, its protagonist, experiences character change to a degree that few other characters in literature ever achieve. Set in France, near the year of 1815, Dumas sees Edmond quickly betrayed and imprisoned in the Chateau D'if. The story wastes no time. His love is married to another man and he is forgotten to all but the least few of the world. Upon escape, he finds himself the unlikely recipient of a host of wealth. A grand treasure. But Edmond seeks revenge with it.And so the story follows one of the wealthiest men in Europe, bent on gripping the last drop of revenge out of his enemies. Edmond is pleasant, affable, and wise. But his motives are dark. He feels like he is the hand of justice. He even says it: \\"Please believe I've put my task above the mean level of personal vengeance. I am exposing criminals, not for their sins against myself but for their black injustices to others... not only for what they have done but for what they continue to do. They are the ones devoid of all humanity, the ones that profited by the sufferings of others.\\"For anyone not willing to become accustomed to a book written mostly of dialogue, this book will wash over the eyes in overwhelming waves. Not a bad thing, but for those who are willing to push through the learning curve, the book is a masterpiece; it can deepen your life. The dialogue is elegant and flows out of the page and into the reader like courses in a $400 meal. Word after word, delicious.Few other novels in literature stand equal with Dumas' masterwork. This is a classic so far beyond what you will find in the Harlequinn section of your local bookstore that it is almost a must for cultured humanity. Even if the book is not to one's taste, it should be seen and admired in the same fashion that the starry night sky should not be ignored. Mankind has very rarely topped this work."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Favorite book of all time in my library. The other views pretty much sums it up. All I can add is you should read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book of all time and this was the first time I have read a modern translation that is unabridged. Buss does a wonderful job capturing the essence of this novel. The added scenes in this unabridged edition also adds a lot of background and clarifies many ambiguous events. This edition reads much more smoothly and coherently than the original 1850s translation and I'd recommend this translation to all of my friends and family."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],S={key:0},G={key:1};function P(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",G,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",S,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const j=u(H,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-ea897695"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/37.md","filePath":"library/37.md"}'),q={name:"library/37.md"},B=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{N as __pageData,B as default};
