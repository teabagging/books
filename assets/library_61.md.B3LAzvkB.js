Up to the point of publication, web usability and general usability were closely equated, and not just the test methodology. But Spool's studies find unpredictable users surprising our preconceptions at every turn.Some may say that the book contains too many questions, but when Spool admits \\"we don't really know what makes a site usable\\" he is reflecting the number of surprises his studies unearthed.As for the causes of those surprises... the studies were performed as 'comparison tests' between sites that fulfilled wholly different purposes.... between (for example) Disney and Edmunds (car facts)... it may be invalid to compare usability between sites even if they are in the same domain, however, let alone when they are so diverse. For it may be a usability test can only identify weaknesses, not strengths. Perhaps that's why Spool says we don't know how to design for usability.One possible weakness of the tests was that they were designed as 'scavenger hunts.' This is still very common, however, and only by studying the results of this book is one led to suspect that this approach generates an overly-directed browsing behaviour, and thereore measures only a subset of real web visitors utilising only a subset of possible tasks, which are not a proxy for general usability.If you only read three books on web usability, this should be one of them.... Essential."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This book is useful if:1. You are involved in designing a site that is solely information-oriented.2. You want a counter-point to Jakob Nielsen, who really has some helpful information.3. You have a boss who doesn't know anything about the web and you want back-up documentation for your decisions.Otherwise, this book has the following weaknesses:1. Too many questions are asked with the answer being &quot;we do not know why&quot; and too many sentences beginning: &quot;we believe, but do not know&quot;2. The goal was too specific: how well do users find information. This leaves out any websites designed for casual use, 'browsing', or entertainment.3. The authors keep comparing apples to oranges. They do not usually take into account that some sites might have done better due to the type of content rather than the architecture or design.4. There is no credence given to learned behavior (which, admittedly, Nielsen also gives short shrift).5. It's just a TAD obvious. For example, &quot;The better users could predict where a link would lead, the more successful they were in finding information.&quot; Well, uh, duh.6. I don't agree with the model of testing. Users were given 4 questions they were to answer on each of 10 existing sites. Hypotheses were created from the results. However, none of the sites were amended to specifically address these hypotheses (unless, through some coincidence, the sites were updated during the process, and even then there was little before/after comparison).7. The authors keep stressing throughout the entire book that web site usability differs from software usability. However, not once did they step back and think &quot;maybe web site usability TESTING differs from software usability testing.&quot;While Jared Spool is a great speaker (having seen him in person, I was very impressed with his humor and intelligence), this book leaves a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I can appreciate that often an author becomes experienced enough that he/she can accurately state opinions. These authors are certainly qualified to do so, yet skip the ego boost and simply present their findings, making this a valuable reference tool.I have both this book and Jakob Neilsen's book of an almost exactly similar title. I use this book far more often. In fact, I've purchased several copies for others on my team.Plus, you can easily read it on a flight. Some complain that it lacks directives. Jared accurately states that the immaturity of web interfaces relative to OS specific interfaces creates an environment where the experts are without all the answers.In which case, we as creative people must leverage all facts and make choices we feel most productive. This book will help the person who approaches problems creatively. It will not help those looking for cookie cutter solutions for difficult problems."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Basically, the value of this book is that it is one of the only empirical studies of web site usability. It challenges the opinions of designers and pundits without offering any reasons why conventional wisdom may be right ot wrong.However, the book suffers from serious flaws. Granted, the $40 price reflects the number of people and hours involved in creating this book, it does not seem to offer the answers to justify it. Questions that should have been followed up on were left unanswered. Site designers were not consulted. Grammatical errors abound.However, the details of the tests ARE clearly delineated, although one would assume that would be covered in the beginning."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"The characters are the good guy and bad guy but in a spce setting. If you like adventure with a touch of sci-fi you'll enjoy this book. Not real heavy reading and the ending is a bit different from what I expected."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"OK, the story itself is now a little dated (among other things, the Soviet Union is still around), but aside from that this is a nice little brain-dead novel. Don't expect the kind of hard-SF extrapolation you'll find in most of Bova's other novels; rather, this one is more or less a James Bond movie in space, complete with over-the-top villians, femme fatales, and enough plot holes to fit an asteroid or two in. It's popcorn of the printed variety, not meant to make you think but just to have a good time. Read it on the beach."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"Privateers, written originally in 1985 stands a bit apart from the rest of the \\"Grand Tour\\" novels (now at about 17 total). While it works as a stand alone book, some knowledge of the Grand Tour universe makes this book a little easier to digest. From a chronology only standpoint, Privateers would be the 2nd book in the timeline of the Grand Tour, but because it was written in an era when the Cold War still loomed large in the hearts and minds of many Americans, it reads as basically an alternative ending to the first book in the chronology, PowerSat.Privateers takes place in the relativly near future. The Russians have won the cold war and now through force of arms and political dominance, control the body that governs space exploration and its associated resource and economic use. The US is a shadow of it's former self, simply trying to hang on in a world dominated by Marxist communism. Only a rough alliance of Asian nations (China and Japan) and half a dozen other space-faring nations have any real power to resist total Russian dominance.Dan Randolph, protagonist in PowerSat appears again, now as a expat running his company, Astro Corp, from Venezuala. The Russian (naturally) antagonist is a meglomaniacle baddy, bent on crushing the last vestigages of Capitalism from space. In typical 80's fashion, the Russian antagonist preaches the glories of Communism while hypocritically living a lavish lifestyle. With the Russian's firmly in contol of price setting for lunar ores, which they mine, Dan Randolph will risk it all to take his mining operation to near Earth orbit asteroids.If you know Bova, you'll find plenty of his normal writing here. Randolph as protagonist bears near super human abilities. He's ultra wealthy, sleeps with a new model every week, and seems to always be one step ahead of his enemies. While I can't put my finger on why, I'm more sypmathetic to the Dan Randolph of Privateers vs the Dan Randolph of PowerSat. Still, at times he's hard to take - essentially an independently wealthy James Bond in space.There's the usual love entanglement - perhaps even above the usual Bova style - in Privateers. Randolph lusts after Lucinda, the daughter of the Venezualan minister of space, who is to be married off to the Russian antagonist to further the minister's political career. In addition, one of Randolphs allies is also smitten with the beautiful-beyond-words Lucinda. The romantic sections of the book may induce more than a little eye rolling but ultimatly are more successful than in PowerSat as they do have a role in the overall plot of the book.While Privateers may be somewhat dated (keep in mind it was written 25 years ago), it fits in with the \\"hard\\" Sci-Fi of the time and the ending is fast-paced, fun and fulfulling. Unlike some of Bova's other work, I found Privateers to be a very complete novel - that is to say that everything introduced in the book was tied up and there were few pages wasted on fluff that was not related to the core plot. If you don't mind a novel that in 2011 is somewhat dated and Bova's clunky work around the book's romantic sections, I think you'll enjoy Privateers."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"It's not romping, wide-flung space battles or huge space-going battle ships. It takes place in the near future, on the Earth, Moon and inbetween. Sure there's politics. The \`hero\` is a playboy self-made millionaire. The nasty is a Russian meglomaniac. Toss in the hero's affair with the first lady, piracy in near space, and a great plot, and we have a pretty good book!"},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"This is a wonderful book with great character development. I found an old copy of it in my hotel on my vacation to Mexico. I didn't put it down the entire vacation. Read this book."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"For somebody looking for realism in Science Fiction this book is not for you (despite the &#8220;Riveting Account of the Future&#8221; accolade claimed to be by the Wall Street Journal on the front cover). My main problem was the central character, who must have been a Ben Bova wannabe at the time this was written. Try this: He&#8217;s young. He&#8217;s already a billionaire. He has a &#8220;hard&#8221; well-toned body. His sexual success puts 007 to shame: He sleeps with a new secretary every other week (all are physical goddesses as it so happens), top Hollywood actresses (two at the same time even), and even the United States woman President who just so happened to be the wife of his now deceased best friend. He seduces a young, innocent and of course beautiful woman who so happens to be the daughter of the soon to be Venezuelan president. He&#8217;s a brilliant military tactician, and can somehow transform his corporations&#8217; technical employees into becoming a spacefaring SWOT squad able to covertly rescue comrades from a heavily armed Russian prison facility. He&#8217;s also a tactful politician, influential and connected at the highest levels. He has time to run a huge business empire by himself, as well as frolic with women and attend lavish cocktail parties. Achievement to say the least, but lets get a bit real Ben.There is a common theme in his other books (again the Moon, Mars and Venus sagas); all seem to have a central character with loads of money and incredible sexual success. This seems to be the main vehicle by which the author can get the things done he wants to use in his plots, and it gets a bit boring after a while."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"The negative stuff in the other reviews is right on target. I think they are more kind than I am. This book has 200 pages of drivel before any type of story begins. It reads more like a really bad romance novel. I had to keep checking the author's name. Then more drivel is peppered among the thin story line. I continued reading because I thought this was the lead up to the next book in the astroid war series of Ben Bova's. So I trudged thru, setting it aside to read other more interesting stuff but picked it up again because I didn't want to start Precipice without the earlier info (I'm just like that!).So when I finally got to the end which is the only part worth reading, and yes it's like a cheap James Bond movie, and I pick up Precipice, I discover that when that book starts it is totally disconnected from Privateers. It does not pick up where the earlier one left off but doesn't seem to be connected at all. Privateers ends with our hero and his prize beauty planning a life in space. Precipice backs way up to when our \\"hero\\" Dan still loves the former president, Jane. What the heck.So I don't know why they aren't in sync. Most of Bova's books are great about continuity. I could have totally skipped this crappy, weak book and skipped right to Privateers."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"The story works with technology that is nearly possible today and may be reality in the not so distant future, it not a far fetched space opera nor a silly fantasy story. The story also deals with private enterprise challenging governments for domination of space which is a theme I enjoy. There is enough tech. adventure and intrigue to make for a good Ben Bova story."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"To put it bluntly, I was totally unable to &quot;suspend my disbelief&quot; in order to get past the first 3 chapters. This is a 15 year old SF book that just got published, in which the Soviet Empire has taken over. This book will only appeal to people that can tolerate alternate universe stories. The writing is so terribly formula that you can see the writers checklist, i.e. violence for attention grab, wet dream scene backup, dull filler, etc. I've read hundreds of SF novels good and bad. This is the first one I've quit reading and actually tossed in the trash. It's not good enough for the Walmart discount bin. It's no wonder it took 15 years to publish. EOS must have just wanted a big name."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"This is one of the most misogynistic pieces of tripe I've read in a good long while. Mediocre plot, very fun premise, but it's woven together like an afghan somebody let the dog chew on."},{"Title":"Privateers","review":"Having just finished Mars, Return to Mars, Moonrise, and Moonwar, I was really looking forward to another excellent Bova tale. Unfortunately, this book left me very unsatisfied.I would like to say reading Privateers was like diving into a Clive Cussler novel, with Dan Randolph as Dirk Pitt, but that would not be entirely fair to Mr. Cussler. The action was nowhere near as intense, and the story was unbelievably predictable. This book was a VERY quick read.The only thing that preventing my giving it a 1-star rating was the fact that out of 5 books I've read or Mr. Bova's, this was the only dud."},{"Title":"Color of Wealth","review":"Eye-opening doesn't even begin to describe this enlightening volume about the socioeconomic divide among whites and non-whites in this country and the role the government plays in reinforcing the separation. Organized by five key members of the nonpartisan United for a Fair Economy organization based in Atlanta, the book handily dismantles the Horatio Alger myth, especially for minority members, by detailing how economic predation has persisted even as significant strides have been made in the far more discernible civil rights arena. The co-authors - Executive Director Meizhu Lui, Communications Director Betsy Leondar-Wright, current board member B&aacute;rbara Robles, past board member (until 2005) Rose Brewer, and Rebecca Adamson of the First Peoples Worldwide - have assembled not only a comprehensive history but also a fulsome, current picture of the economic discrimination that has festered pointedly against four different groups - African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos and Native Americans.Not coincidentally, the five women come from five different ethnic groups (including white), which allow them to compare their individual experiences and provide personal validation (and sometimes challenges) of their findings. Perhaps the most compelling fact unearthed is the substantial divide in net worth between blacks and whites. Previously, focus has been mostly on income disparity, which while significant, has been almost passively accepted. Specifically, median household income for whites in 2003 was about $48K, while for black households it was about $30K. However, looking on the balance sheet, the co-authors uncovered the revelatory fact that whites had a median net worth of $121K in 2001 versus just $19K for blacks.This and the book's other equally invaluable findings clearly illustrate how public policy has hindered asset accumulation among non-whites, and there is also an itemized list of special advantages afforded exclusively to whites. On a more personal level, the co-authors show how such exclusionary tactics have affected the self-esteem of their families, especially among their fathers who feel they have failed them somehow. In a hopeful effort to clarify the decisive influence of government on Americans' net worth, the book is not a socialist tract but rather a realistic how-to guide on how to affect policy changes that will help future generations in their wealth-building strategies. I think this is must-read information well worth studying by those looking for a constructive means of addressing the economic inequity in wealth, not just income. This is essential reading."},{"Title":"Color of Wealth","review":"Heavily researched, but written in a very accessible way. You will learn volumes about wealth disparities and how they got that way, and you will learn something about yourself too. Highly recommended for anyone with interests in social and economic justice, racism, and just getting ahead in America."},{"Title":"Color of Wealth","review":"This book is a solid piece of scholarship for the most part. The last quarter, however, dissipates into more reformism. It is interesting to see statistics on the wealth differential between Whites and other Ethnic Groups and the causal factors concomitantly, e.g. racism, Ethnocentricism, greed etc. The historical analysis as to what created the divide is thorough. That said, the prescription in the end makes one wonder if the scholars' really grasped the Historical antecedents that they presented to begin with. What occured in the past to create the disparity was not accidental. On the contrary. Whites today have the same mindset as their ancestors did in regards to wealth and securing it. How can they not? It's the same continuum. The society reinforces it. Just ask Tim Wise. Whites need only be on auto pilot to maintain this unjust system. The only solution is a complete social revolution, this - in the long run - will move people of color into equality while simultaneously changing the psyches' of Whites. Anything short of that can be consigned to phantasmic thinking."},{"Title":"Color of Wealth","review":"The information you will find in this book, you will not find in history books used in our public schools. It reveals the truth of the systemic injustices of the United States. I have always known theoretically these truths, but this book communicates them very pratically and is articulated in language that is easy to read, grasp, and follow. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"Color of Wealth","review":"Great book to learn the other side of American History! Needs to be taught in school."},{"Title":"Color of Wealth","review":"This book is very biased against the US economy and is basically advocating a socialist or semi-socalist state. The book becomes very repetitive at times and the long chapters are filled with facts that do not seem related to thier arguments. Furthermore they state that the goal of the Color of Wealth is meant to provide solutions for the current state of the economy. They spend an enormous amount of time pointing out \\"issues\\" with the US economy but only spend a short paragraph at the end of each chapter explaining thier \\"solutions\\" and \\"conclusions\\" which seem very basic and at times do not flow with thier evidence. The book is filled with logic gaps in thier arguments. The main problem I have with this book is that it seems to me that they are implying that the United States is an economic aparthide system similar to that of old South Africa on page 29. Although I do give the authors some credit because the book is well researched. The authors of this book clearly seem more interested in bashing the United States from a ultra-left liberal point of view rather than providing solutions to the so called \\"racial problems\\" in the US economy. I would not recomend this book to anyone looking to understand any sort of racial economic problems in the US."},{"Title":"Petretti's Coca-Cola Collectibles Price Guide (Warman's Coca-Cola Collectibles: Identification & Price Guide)","review":"This book has excellent pictures and wide range of coverage - more than in any of the prior editions.I did find some inconsistancies in item pricing (Litchfield bottle pg 398 - $70 and same item pg 400 - $55, pg 152 item pcs108.000 - $1300 and same item pcs108.000 pg 87 - $1000). Given that this book has become the \\"bible\\" for Coca-Cola collecting - these inconsistancies can cause some problems...I could overlook some of the pricing errors - heck there's thousands and thousands of items and no one is perfect. But the real problem I have is how high the prices are for all of the items.Let me get on my soapbox for a minute and conclude by saying that I've been collecting 1890's - 1930's Coca Cola items for the past 20 years and have acquired a pretty extensive collection. I have to say that in my humble opinion the prices that are in this book are dangerously overstated - perhaps in an attempt to help us older guys as we approach retirement. Afterall, we are the one's that acquired the vintage, quality items inexpensively in the early days... In the end I'm not sure its working -- in fact I think the prices have begun to fall!!! One only has to look at the prices being realized on auction sites like ebay to see what I mean - even the \\"near mint\\" items don't even come close to the prices in the 10th edition, let alone those in the 11th. Many desirable items have no activity because of greedy sellers that set minimum prices that are out of sync with demand.I think the high pricing in guides like this actually harms the market, since most collectors can no longer afford the older, quality items. As the old-timers have seen, in the end - the winners are the manufacturers of the recent garbage made in CHINA as it becomes desireable since it's the only thing that's affordable. Vintage-item collectors die-out or begin to get frustrated since they can't find quality merchandise at affordable prices and move on to other hobbies, and there are no replacement collectors coming in.At this stage, as an old-time collector, I shouldn't complain I guess. Because of Allan's books my items have appreciated substantially. But I still enjoy the hobby - yet I can hardly afford to stay with it. I'm fearful that the number of vintage-item collectors is wanning, and the interest in the hobby is really falling off. If that happens - we will soon find ourselves using Shelly and Helen's old 1970's four volume price guides to buy and sell.Maybe that wouldn't be so bad afterall..."},{"Title":"Petretti's Coca-Cola Collectibles Price Guide (Warman's Coca-Cola Collectibles: Identification & Price Guide)","review":"Right off the bat: I agree that the omission of blotters and assorted other collectibles from this guide is a gaping omission as big as a barn.

Be prepared to bounce from one end of the book to the other looking for what you need. There is no apparent logic to the way this guide is arranged. I'm sure the author felt it was completely logical, but his logic escapes me.3) The front index is just painful to figure out. There is a usability book out there called &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot;. The author of this Coke guide should study it.4) Too much rhetoric and opinion about &quot;fantasy&quot; items. I find this section of the guide painful to sift through. Just the facts, please. And then there's the illogical order of everything &lt;heavy sigh&gt;.The best that can be said about this guide is that it's big.

I don't see how everything can continually increase in price from one edition to another, especially when you consider internet sales activity (a very large part of Coca Cola memorabilia sales nowadays). As a collector, I never pay at price-levels shown in this edition, and I certainly do not obtain these prices when I occasionally sell an item off on an internet auction site. I just feel that the prices are a bit inflated. No one could keep track of the huge amounts of Coca Cola memorabilia sales in all venues around the country.

There are several different places to find clocks for example. If you go by the table of contents you might miss what you are looking for. When you go by the index you have to sift through different sections of the book looking for it. However, the back of the book was very helpful with the section on slogans for different years.

While the wait for the new edition seemed excruciating, the latest edition was well worth the wait. The new edition provides a significant upgrade over previous editions. The tremendous amount of color photos sets this book apart from previous editions and is far more visually pleasing for the reader. The commentary is extremely helpful for both novice and experienced collectors. Also, the pricing of the collectibles reflects the softness of the market which has occured in most types of Coke collectibles since Petretti's previous edition. Finally, the layout of the book represents a significant improvement over prior editions. The only negative is that the publisher needs to take the time to develop a more logical and detailed index.

This book continues to be the ONLY book on the subject, and Allan continues with his pattern of putting out the best collectors guide on any subject around. Pictures are high quality and the coverage (though a bit less than prior editions) is still incredible. For a reference guide - this is THE book you want. As a price guide - it is another story.Unfortunately - Allan's prices continue to be out of sink with the market - so first and foremost don't rely on them at all. If you have a piece to sell - you'll be a bit disappointed if you think you can get anywhere near the prices in the guide. As always the mint and near mint items continue to maintain their value and in some instance can approach Allan's prices but in general even those items tend to be available at 50% - 60% of the prices in the guide. As for the items below near-mint - those can typically be obtained at 20% - 30% of the guide prices. As of January, 2010 - perhaps more than anything the tray market has really suffered. High quality signs seem to have retained their value the most - perhaps since they also have commercial value for restaurants and bars. Some of the best quality and most affordable merchandise can be purchased at Coca Cola collectors auctions where collectors understand the \\"real\\" pricing and are in it more for the thrill of the hunt and the history of the item - then trying to turn a fast buck.As a collector with a lot of early pieces - it is a bit disheartening that the value of my collection has really taken a hit - but the thrill of the hobby has returned as the ability to purchase at prices not seen for 25+ years makes me search even harder for that once-in a lifetime piece and that is what collecting is really about. There are great pieces still out there - so congratulations to those of you that love the hobby for the sake of the hobby - our time has returned! For those who were in it for the investment - rest assured prices will continue to rise again but understand that they probably will never realize those prices of the late-90's. Perhaps the best thing that has happened is that everyone has come to realize that the \\"new\\" collector pieces are junk and they've become so plentiful that no one wants them. As for the \\"quality\\" reproduction sign garbage available on eBay that is meant to \\"fool\\" people into thinking they have vintage pieces - why purchase a knock-off when you get the real thing at the lowest prices seen in years and have a real piece that has value not only for its imagery but for its age and collectablity. Remember there is nothing like the \\"Real Thing\\"....Comments are always welcome so feel free to email me at conapt@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Petretti's Coca-Cola Collectibles Price Guide (Warman's Coca-Cola Collectibles: Identification & Price Guide)","review":"THIS COCA-COLA PRICE GUIDE IS THE BEST I THE WORLD BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU SOME SIZES OF THE ITEMS AND THE PRICE.

It does give a number of very good examples of problems that can be tackled by Monte Carlo Methods. If you want a few pages on what Monte Carlo Methods can do,along with a little of bit decent theory, you may want to try this book. However, I am not sure that a person serious enough to spend the money on this book will be enlightened."},{"Title":"A Primer for the Monte Carlo Method","review":"Prof. Sobol's neatly presented treatment of the principles underlying static, or Monte Carlo, simulations is an excellent introduction to the topic and will be appreciated by two distinct audiences. First, students early in their study of simulation can approach the topic aided by Sobol's clarity and frequent use of simple, concrete examples. Second, engineers (and other mathematically adept readers) who generally do not rely on probabilistic techniques for analysis can grasp the basics quickly and be reassured of the mathematical rigor which drives the technique.The most valuable part of the book is the concise development of the generation of pseudorandom numbers.Additionally, Sobol's little book gives some interesting insights into Russian practice, contributions and implementations of the Monte Carlo technique."},{"Title":"A Primer for the Monte Carlo Method","review":"I enjoyed (and enjoying) this book.

The individual jokes are arranged by topic underneath dictionary-style headings.

I thought I would find jokes that I would want to write down or retell to my friends but these jokes are mostly appropriate for the clean late night talk show audience. Most of the jokes are from Steven Wright, Jay Leno, Letterman, Conan, Bill Maher and the like. I imagine the author sat in front off her TV and wrote down as many jokes as she could to fill this 282 page book with 1,473 jokes. The jokes are categorized by topics such as \\"Age\\", \\"Marriage\\", \\"Military\\" but I would rather have broader categories such as one \\"Illness\\" instead of separate categories like \\"Disease\\" and \\"Humidifiers\\" (only one joke found here).I give this book 1 star because most of the jokes are not usable among your friends, most are not funny and they don't express witty banter and how the jokes can be used in certain situations.Some of my favorites:\\"On my 16th birthday my parents tried to surprise me with a car, but they missed.\\" - Tom Cotter\\"I have a body of an 18 year old.

This book is intelligent, witty and provocative. His characters act heroically in extraordinary conditions, in ways both believable and sympathetic.

It is simply, an excellent read."},{"Title":"The peace negotiations, a personal narrative","review":"Robert Lansing was President Wilson's Secretary of State and at one point the lead US negotiator in the World War I peace negotiations. He did not agree with many of Wilson's proposals and tactics and was eventually marginalized by Wilson in the negotiations team. Lansing resigned as Secretary of State in 1920.This book is a fascinating account of what happened from Lansing's perspective. Many of the differences he had with Wilson can be argued to have been right, in light of the generally accepted belief today that the negotiations were a failure on many levels. Lansing's book reads in part a bit petty and defensive because he didn't get his way on many points. But he also had strong expertise in international negotiations and that comes through in many of his observations. Many of his ideas would be validated by today's thinking on smart negotiation tactics -- but Wilson didn't agree at the time and we'll never know whether Lansing's approaches would have led to a more successful negotiation result. This book is an interesting glimpse into the ego and brilliance of the negotiator who was left behind. Lansing is a reasonably good writer and his account is entertaining especially if you are a fan of case studies in negotiations. His discussion of the micro-tactics of negotiation seem especially perceptive.The book is widely available in e-format on the Internet, at Project Gutenberg and other places, but the Kindle format makes it convenient for annotating and highlighting. Regrettably, however, the Kindle format does not yet have an interlinked table of contents. There are also some illustrations in the original book that are not included in the Kindle version, but this is also true of the other e-book formats that I've come across.Here is the table of contents of the book so you can have some idea of how it is organized:1.

There is a lot we can add, this is a wonderful beginning."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"It has been a few years since I read Sheila's book, so I don't remember a lot of specific details about it as much as the feelings I had about it. I got the book after attending a Women of Faith conference where I heard Sheila speak. Part of what Sheila shared with us was about her struggle with depression. I was deeply touched by Sheila's story, as I could relate to many aspects of it. I began struggling with depression while I was in high school. My life seemed to be going well as I was an honor student apparently headed for a good college and career. But inside, I felt like I was falling apart. It was hard for me to share what I was feeling as I was also dealing with denial and shame. While I was never hospitalized as Sheila was, I always had the feeling that I was just barely hanging on. Fortunately, I was able to find some answers in books I read, but as I tried to share what I was experiencing with other people, I encountered as much misunderstanding and condemnation as compassion and understanding. So I could relate to Sheila's feelings of isolation, and her need to hide her true self from the world.As for Sheila's book Honestly, it was like a light in the dark for me, to hear from someone who had experienced something similar to what I went through. It helped me know I was not alone, and played a role in my healing process as I read it and reread parts that were most significant to me. It was also encouraging to see how God was using Sheila's painful experiences to enable her to minister to others, a concrete example of how God can take the bad in our lives and transform it into good.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with depression, shame, and feeling like they have to hide their true self from other people. It is helpful to hear from others who have shared these feelings, and we can learn from their experiences. For those who may not be going through these things, I would recommend this book as a tool to gain some understanding of those who are, and to better know how to respond to others' pain with compassion.Just as an added note, for those who may think depression is just something to be &quot;fixed&quot;, I went into it as an atheist, and came out with a rock solid faith in God. The pain of depression can be helpful in that it may cause us to question our perception of reality, to be seeking something more, and to see our need for and be more receptive to God's love and compassion. In this respect, depression can be a catalyst for spiritual, emotional and mental growth."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"I have struggled with, at times winning and at times losseing, depression since I was a small child. I am a strong full-faith Christian. Believe it or not, and a lot of people don't -- you can be both. Sheila breaks that ground and opens her heart and her soul for the good of us reading. She has hurt sooooo much; and come soooo close to the edge of darkness. This book speaks to the heart and damaged maind of every depressed reader; I have cried on each page; for her and for me. It is a great read for the non-depressed to illustrate that a real and active Christan can still be attacked. The support the book offers for fellow depression suffers is excellent. It is not a total explanation of depression, nor of &quot;seeking help&quot; but it is a personal journy that empowers other to walk the path. It is not all you need to read; but it is a read support."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"A few years ago I found a new copy of this book at a used book store for a decent price. I gave it to my dad for Christmas because he's an avid reader of non-fiction, especially biographies & autobiographies. I wish I'd read it first before I gave it away. I eventually bought a copy from Amazon & read it recently (4/04). I'm glad I finally read it myself.Sheila Walsh got saved when she was 11 years old. On the outside, she was a successful Christian talk show host, singer, & author. But she had ghosts from her childhood that she had never dealt with properly. At what seemed like th peak of her success(age 35), she stepped down from her spot as the co-host of the 700 Club & checked herself into a Christian Psychiatric Ward in Washington, D.C. That was probably the best thing that she did for herself. From there on out, God began to work on the the things that had tormented her for so many years. Today she is happy, healthy, whole, & restored. her life is truly a testimony to what God can do if we surrender totally to him.Thank you, Sheila, for writing this book. My prayer is that your books, sermons, & music will continue to touch many people as they already have. God bless you, Sheila Walsh!"},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"I have struggled with severe depression for about 15 year now. But it's something I felt I couldn't talk about until fairly recently. I have read a couple of Sheila's other books and wanted to read \\"Honestly\\" for a long time. I decided to see if the local library had it and they did. I have to admit, I was both nervous and excited to read this book. I was blown away by Sheila's vulnerablity and honesty. I could relate to much of what she wrote. It is a shame that a lot of people in evangelical churches don't know how to handle people with depression. Sheila also describes some of the hurtful things she experienced at the hands of Christians. The church should be a place of healing and restoration, but unfortunately, it is often a place of condemnation and judgement. I too have been wounded by hurtful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has personally struggled with depression or desires to help someone with depression. Sheila's story is solidly rooted in Scripture and she gives some practical advice. She also offers encouragement to people who struggle with depression. I was especially convicted by the chapter on shame. Sheila also affirms that depression is an actual medical condition (something a lot of Christians just don't understand) and that its okay to seek help and take medication if necessary. This is a book of hope and will help you see that there is a way out of depression. Sheila emphasizes that the way out isn't quick, painless or easy. But it is worth it. I have just started on my own journey, and Sheila made me realize once again, that I am not alone.I also highly recommend \\"Why I Jumped\\" By Tina Zahn."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"Sheila has given a gift of hope and encouragement to a hurting heart who needs a touch of compassion. I thought this book, next to the Psalms, was as comforting and uplifting as any I've read. Her poetry is nourishment for a hungry soul. Anyone who has been depressed or is experiencing the loneliness of depression now should get a copy and be shown a way to the Light. There is hope for everyone and she also helps us see that though it may look like someone elses's life is at a pinnacle, it may not be. Even those &quot;on top of it all&quot; can really be at the bottom. We all need help now and then and should never be embarrassed of afraid of seeking it. Buy it and find a path to healing."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"Sheila Walsh, is just one of the women, of the Women of Faith tour I saw in Eat Rutherford, NJ in 1998, and really touch my soul. Her simple way and her friendly approach stirred at my soul, and made me motivated to do the Lord's work. I was very impressed with this book, and she really let us into her life with her personal troubles, and how she dealt with them. She taught me from this book never judge a book by the cover. Sometimes, it's on the inside that could be troubling you, and how to bring everything to the Lord. 5 star book!"},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"I just want to thank Sheila for writing this book. For exposing her inner life to the world. The stuff which plagues us as christians, all of the facades, masks and \\"Shoulds\\" of christians.Reaching out to those in pain and suffering, not turning our backs, loving one another and none of us are exempt from this.Until many of us reach our dark valleys we dont seem to get it I think in some regards. As a Christian I have walked some painful valleys of my own and God does not promise a life without trials, pain and sorrow. I have learned so much about compassion and loving my brother as myself through my own trials."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"I knew Sheila Walsh as a really great rock musician. I remembered the work she did with Steve Taylor, and to this day treasure her song \\"Under the Gun\\". She wrote and sang with real edge, something all to rare these days in CCM.\\"We were born under the gun,And just like every mother's son,we are hostage to the megaton,and the world could end tonight!There's a finger on the button,But if it's pressed we're not forgotten.Millions speak,Feel no fear,The road to change is in ascendance here.\\"In a world that was convinced that the world could (would?) end tonight because of globalthermonuclear war, where the political beliefs of many Christians were based on this universe of fear, Sheila offered a very different understanding.But my understanding of her was as a kid. And mysteriously, she disappeared one day.I wasn't in those Christian circles that supported the 700 Club, and so wasn't aware of her joining up with them and being a regular anchor. While most might know her from these years, I knew her as a rock star, and then never heard anything of her afterward.Thank you Wikipedia. On a whim, I wikied her, and learned some about her amazing history- and a book she wrote. I was surprised to discover that she attended the very same grad school that I did, graduating only months before I began.There is some real depth here, just as I once read in her lyrics. This isn't just a book for those struggling with depression, although it can help there. It is also a book that will encourage you in the midst of the more humdrum sadness that we all experience in the normal course of human events. And the title breaths true- there is some real honesty here. Sheila has helped to open the door on the Scarlet D, so much a topic of shame in Evangelical circles.But for me there is another challenge. While not being in the circles that supported the 700 Club, I also have never found anything to like from that TV show and network. Hearing how many people were touched and helped and healed by Sheila's work, both before and after her depression, was a challenge to me. I have made my God too small. And he has done some good work through Sheila- and the 700 Club- as well."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"Amazing book....I could do relate to shelia and all she went through.

I have been reading \\"Honestly\\", and find it hard to put down. I've known about Sheila Walsh for many years, have enjoyed her music, but had never read any of her books. This one is definitely a jewell, especially for folks who may be struggling with depression or other challenges of life, relationally or otherwise. She talks about how she lived her life mostly behind a \\"mask\\", fearing to let others know what was really going on inside her. Sheila is very open and straight forward in the description of the difficulties she faced, and yet she brings along with that a wonderful sense of hope for healing and restoration. This is a great book, and worth the money and the time to read it."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"Sheila is highly adept at putting heartfelt feelings into words, with grace and dignity, as I have never seen when it comes to clinical depression and things that send us reeling into anxiety, fear, and depression; and she does it with such a concentration on God's Word and personal experiences that you can \\"get it\\"... and they aren't just \\"pat\\" answers because she's quick to say that sometimes there just aren't words or answers for some, just hugs and tears. She is so humanly real yet so godly wonderful at the task God has set her on -- to encourage and help women who are struggling. I have read 5 of her books so far (and passed them on) and they are all well worth reading. I highly recommend them to anyone (woman, especially) who need encouragement from someone who experientially knows how they feel in that dark valley...and feel as if no one understands. She definitely does! and, these are some of her other writings that have blessed me:The Heartache No One Sees: Real Healing for a Woman's Wounded HeartLiving FearlesslyLife Is Tough, But God Is Faithful: How To See God's Love In Difficult Times"},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"A friend recommended this book and I borrowed it from her.

Arrived quickly. Written by a woman with deep faith, simple honest journey through her depression to health."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"I have just completed reading Honestly by Sheila Walsh. After hearing her CD Hope, it was my hope that this book would be anointed by God to bring healing to those who had gone through something similar to what she had gone through. It was my hope that it would give direction and maybe even some answers to God's silence during times like this. I was able to relate to many notations in her book, because I have spent time looking for help and have read many of the old classics. Especially Dark Night of the Soul. Many phrases in her book spoke to my heart and let me know that she had been where I am and have been for a long time. Though her writing was honest and she bared her life to her readers, I do not want anyone to be misled that this book offers THE ANSWER. She gave some wonderful recommendations for getting help -- find a Christian counselor, talk to Christian friends, don't shut people out. Sheila Walsh was very fortunate in that she did not feel foresaken or deserted by God. She is very lucky in that she continued to experience God's presence in her life during her time of recovery."},{"Title":"Honestly","review":"I would like to retract the review that I made earlier this evening. My review was honest and true, but I fear much too hard after thinking about it. If one person is helped by this book, then it will be THE ANSWER for them."},{"Title":"Worm & the Toffee Nosed Princess (Story Books)","review":"This is aimed at younger kids, it has 5 short stories about different monsters. The title story is about a giant worm that teaches a very snooty princess a lesson. Next, the giant sea creature the Kraken from \\"The Island of the Aunts\\" is also here. He just decides to stop traveling one day, and turns into an island. Three other funny stories await in this 96 page book."},{"Title":"La metamorfosis","review":"A mi punto de vista, el personaje principal, era el que mantenia su casa en un trabajo en el cual lo explotaban todos, pero un dia,al sufrir un cambio y convertirse en un tipo de insecto, su familia y &quot;amigos&quot; lo empiezan a despreciar, por su apariencia y porque ya no era util para ellos...al grado de que lo evitan la mayor parte del tiempo, dicha aberracion que sienten sobre el llega tambien a que el sea insultado y golpeado.Creo que es una manera de ver, que no importa quien seas, si no pueden sacarte algun provecho, dejaran de apreciarte."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"Nostalgia runs deep. The cover art has changed since I read this (multiple times) growing up in the 70's. The stories are well-written and the illustrations held my attention well as a child. The reproduction of the artwork is very blurry. I can't remember if it was the case back in the 70's but it probably was. Would be nice if the production standards were higher. But all in all, this is a nice bible for youngsters who are able to read this. It is not watered down, like some children's bibles I've seen."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I gave this as a gift and the child loved it and so did his parents. I gave the same one years ago to my nephews and I was hoping to find it again. So glad you had it. I like this pictures in this book and more that the modern ones in books today."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"The pictures that accompany with the bible verses are amazing. It helped guide me through the chapter easily. My students also like it because it's easy to understand and has a lot of color pictures."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"This was a beautiful rendition of the Bible for Children. It was comprehensive, yet at a level that all children can enjoy. This was also an excellent deal, as opposed to other sites."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"The bible is lovely but is quite cumbersome. I should've read the specifics regarding weight and dimensions. My grandson, however, is quite pleased with it."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"My Husband and I teaches the 7-12 age group at our church. The Children Bible book is a great aid and the children respond to it well. It is easy to read, the stories are easy to follow and makes it simple for the kids to understand, unlike reading the bible it is much more easier."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"easy to read, large print and easy to understand books of the bible. Highly recommend this one for your little one."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I purchased this book beleiving it would be a WONDERFUL First book for a New Christian. When I received it I was Happy with the Illustrations and it being a hard copy. Then I begam to go through it. This was where I SAW that the Book of Revelations is ONLY 1 1/2 pages. This is the ONE Book in the Bible where we are WARNED Not to ADD OR DELETE, YET Most of the Book is TOTALLY REMOVED. Because this is a person WHO Needs a Bible to get started, I kept it and have it to him, but I will be BYING the Full Version of the King James Version down the road so he can get the ENTIRE Book to read as well to his children."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"This Children's Bible came fast and it was new as described. I recommend this for any child. The price is right and it was as described on amazon.com. A wonderful Children's Bible from Golden Books for Children. I am very pleased and so will you be."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I got this as a gift at age 6. I read it so often the binding is started to fall apart. Now that I have kids I wanted to find a copy that they could have without the sentimental risk to my now very old copy. The stories are broken up nicely to hold the attention of my pre-school and grade school children. This is perfect for bedtime, story time, or just any time. I think every church preschool room should have a copy as I find most other \\"children's\\" bibles either way to simple, or just a full bible. The author did an excellent job of striking the right balance between accuracy of concept and a story book. I can't believe I didn't go out to find this earlier.If you still aren't convinced, let the age of the copyright convince you. It is practically identical to my 1965 copy."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I received this bible from my mother when I was 8 years old and I loved it. I passed it down to my son. He loved it. We're african american and we were not offended by the racial inaccuracies before we were learning the Word of God. God created all races and loves all races. The pictures are a reference to help children to visualize and get a better understanding of the bible. I am 36 years old now and still love it. This book helped broaden my son's and my biblical knowledge. I've purchased one for my godson, because of all the children's bibles available I still think that this one is the best. The print is an excellent size, so that you don't have to strain your eyes to read it. Best of all, the author doesn't change the wording much so that it reads closely like my KJV bible - not like a story made up from someone's vivid imagination."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"This is the only Children's Bible I have seen that uses a style of language worthy to be associated with Holy Scripture. Combine this with outstanding artwork that truly captures the imagination of children and you have an excellent medium to help children grow in their appreciation for God's Church. It will also help Children to become accustomed to the language of great literature at an early age. The reading level is suitable for ages 7 or 8+, but younger children will certainly enjoy having these stories read to them, although the themes in some of these stories are clearly oriented to children of greater maturity. Simply use your discretion when deciding which of the many stories to read to your young children."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"A few people have blasted this book for being inaccurate and racist. Granted, it IS visually biased for Northern Europeans. It was first written in the 1960s when multi-culturalism didn't exist. That's why Jesus and other important characters are blonde when of course in reality they couldn't have been. Children of color will have a harder time appreciating this Bible, but the stories really are excellent if they give them a try. If you can explain to your child why the pictures aren't quite right, the rest of this Children's Bible is a wonderful way to introduce the entire Bible to younger readers.My grandmother explained to me that God appears as we expect Him to appear, and that's why some drawings of Jesus show Him blonde and others show Him dark. That explanation was enough to satisfy me and I loved this Bible when I was a child.This Bible is so complete that I was able to blow my Pastor's own children away when it came to knowing what was in the Bible. The text is easy to understand for most 7 y/o or older kids and almost every important Bible story is in here.Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. The stories in this book are good enough to that you should try to overlook its one major flaw."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"This children's bible overviews the Holy Bible with dignity and respect so often absent in &quot;cartoonized&quot; children's bibles.There are many quotes, but at the same time, it's written so that not only children, but also adults, will enjoy reading it. Anyone who is unfamiliar with the bible would do well to read this to familiarize themselves with bible stories.It helps the reader to put stories in chronological order. For instance,the story of David begins with his anointing and ends with his death.While one may view the drawings as 'old fashioned', I chose this book originally because of the pictures. They show the people as more 'real people' instead of the familiar cartoon and, otherwise, unreal characters.My children and grandchildren have all enjoyed this bible. And friends and relatives have looked forward to my baby shower gift knowing that they would recieve this particular children's bible."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I can't believe we've become so PC that we've taken something as simple and endearing as a Children's Bible out of context. This book's critics are missing the point. Children are color-blind, and God sees our hearts - perhaps we can learn something from them both. It's the message that's important, and this version carries it well.My parents read this Bible to me when I was a child - I'm 38 now. It left a lasting impression on me, and I still remember some of the lesser-known Bible stories thanks to this book. The fact that it has been in publication for over 30 years should give you an idea as to how well written and accurate it is. So times have changed - these Bible stories have not.If the color of one's skin is more important than the lesson being taught, than by all means do not buy this Children's Bible. If you want well-written stories that your children will understand and keep with them for the rest of their lives, you won't find a better book.If you think my views naive, please consider Paul's words:\\"You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\" - Galatians 3:26-29"},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I had this bible when I was a child and I LOVED it. I am elated to find that it is still in print and available for purchase! With that said, I am a Black American. I always found the artwork that accompanied the scriptures in this bible to be beautiful and I STILL do! Granted, by today's standards the illustrations are not cullturally diverse, but then neither are paintings from the Renaissance period. Does that mean that Michaelangelo's paintings are less beautiful because they don't depict diversity? Think about it.The message of the scripture is what truly counts. God made us all and loves us all, no matter our ethnicity. No one living today can say that the illustrations are acurate in their telling of the scripture. If this bible has 1 slight, that would be it. Regardless, it's still God's word no matter how the characters are painted."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"First, let me say that it is a great book for kids, especially if they are visual learners like I was and am. They can infer much of the story without even knowing how to read.Second, the language IS rather similar to the King James, if slightly simplified. I wouldn't quite call it \\"modern\\" English. It still has some archaic phraseology: \\"He was a goodly child\\" or \\"And lo, the star which they saw...\\" So it isn't quite how I'd write it, but it's still reasonably clear and simple.Third, I'm confused. Did anyone read any part besides the New Testament? I'm flipping through at random and found \\"colored\\" people in many places. (pp. 74, 99, 354, etc.) This is pretty generous for the book's vintage. The artist who rendered the life of Christ did choose to portray him with blonde hair and blue eyes, which are a little Scandinavian-hero-looking for my taste, yes. But on the other hand, I am personally acquainted with Jews who have blonde hair and blue eyes. They do exist. My best friend's husband is a full-blooded Iraqi (Babylonian, in Bible times) whose coloring is not too far off from our seemingly odd Christ. So don't knock it.I can't think of any reason at all to pick a fight over a book that contains the original \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" and tells us not to discriminate. I really don't think kids notice what color people are unless we point it out to them, any more than they might realize that one tulip is yellow and another is red. It's just skin. We're the same on the inside."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"Of all the books I read as a child, few stand out in my mind as much as this wonderful edition of the Bible. The illustrations are realistic and fascinating to young minds. This Bible is a must have for families with young children who are just beginning to learn about Christianity. All in all, this book is worthy of family treasure status, to be loved by many generations to come."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I had this book as a child and enjoyed the pictures and stories. It helped me as a child understand the Bible. I have searched for this book for years for my son and finally found it. If he enjoys it half as much as I did, it will be a great investment."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"Wow. This Bible made a huge impact on me as a little kid. I still remember the pictures and stories from my childhood. I just came across this book again yesterday at a second hand store. I had not seen it for many years (I am in my early thirties now).I am from a non-Bible-believing, exceptionally broken home, and I wound up in various foster homes over a number of years. In addition, I am half white and half black living in northern Minnesota. ( I throw this in due to the previous racial commentary).Because of my exposure to this children's Bible in kindergarten, I begged my mom, and later my various foster parents, to allow me to go to Sunday School. I became a Christian at age 12. By God's grace, I avoided drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and premarital sex. Later, I went on to Bible college with scholarships.Tears came to my eyes when I saw this book yesterday, and I just had to buy it. I was looking on amazon to purchase even more copies. I had no idea it was still in print. This particular Bible made all the difference in my life!"},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"A note on the back of this book reads that it \\"has been approved by an editorial board consisting of leaders from the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths\\". Although this is meant as a selling point, it appears to be a precise description of what ails this otherwise promising book.- Overall coverage of the Bible is good, but I have not read each and every chapter to assess the accuracy of the translation. I assume compromises have been made to satisfy \\"the board\\". However, the language is clear and easy to understand.- Illustrations are good. I find the presence of maps a nice addition.- There are introductions to each chapter, and this would be okay, except for the obvious problem of interjecting doctrinal ideas that may not be compatible with your faith.This is easily a book that could be read and shown to children, but because of the syncretistic nature of the content, I would not recommend turning the book over to unattended youngsters."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"Ok, there is an African American Bible for kids that show all black characters, yet this Bible is racist because everyone looks European? Let the black children read their Bible, let my blond blue eyed kids read this Bible, and you reviewers actually try reading the Bible instead of constantly looking for excuses to \\"cry racist.\\""},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"The Golden Children's Bible is recommended by some Catholic homeschooling curriculum providers. This children's book is supposedly a collaborative effort between Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant scholars. However, I did not see any evidence of input from the Catholic scholars. In skimming over the text, this seems to be a distinctly Protestant Bible. I noted a number of areas that would be problematic for Catholics:The first red flag is the translation of Genesis 3:15. My Catholic (Douay-Rheims) Bible says:\\"I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.\\"The reference is to Mary, the new Eve, and the symbolism is a rich and important part of our faith. Think of Our Lady of Grace crushing the snake with her heel. I love that image! Now in the Golden Children' Bible it says:\\"I shall make the woman your enemy and her children the enemies of your children. They shall wound you in the head and you shall wound them in the heel.\\"It just doesn't have the force (or fidelity) of Mary crushing the head of the snake. It loses all of the symbolism of Mary as the new Eve. Eve brought sin into our lives by yielding to the snake, whereas Mary carried our Salvation in her womb and hence through her yielding to God's will she metaphorically stomped on the head of the snake (which symbolizes evil).Another red flag is the beginning of St. Luke, where the Archangel Gabriel appears to Mary. In the Golden Children's Bible the angel says, not \\"Hail, full of grace,\\" but rather, \\"Hail, most favored one.\\" Again, a seemingly small change, but it makes a big difference as to whether children can discern that the opening words to the Hail Mary came from this passage. It also diminishes the teaching that Mary was not just most favored among women, but literally full of God's grace.Next, in Matthew 6 where Our Lord teaches us to pray, the Golden Children's Bible tacks on a doxology to the end of the Our Father, so that their version of the prayer ends with \\"For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\\" This is putting words into Our Lord's mouth that He did not say. Catholics do not add these words to the Our Father. This is not how we pray.So, two of our most important prayers, taken right out of the Bible, are distorted in this text. What message does this give our children?These errors were enough for me to rule out this text. There might be more errors contained within; I did not feel I needed to read more. There are lots of pretty pictures and it's a huge book, but it's not worth exposing children to the errors. Children should be able to trust that their \\"Bible stories\\" should contain only truth. I don't know why anybody would recommend this book for Catholic children. There are better choices."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"After reading the reviews and impressed with the front of the book cover, I decided to get this book as a gift for one of the children at the church.The cover depicts people of ethnicity, however the pictures inside tell a different story. For example, Jesus, a Jew, is characterized by blond hair and blue eyes; the Queen of Sheba, a white woman, only to name a few. NOT SO!If a writer is going to tell history, the words as well as the pictures should depict the truth!I give this book a rating of 1 star based on the pictures, not the contents. I returned the book for that reason!"},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"I bought this because it was recommended in a Catholic homeschooling book. I was initially impressed by the beautiful art in the Old Testament section. Imagine my shock when I discovered Jesus, a middle Eastern man, depicted with blond hair and blue eyes! Of course, no one of us has actually seen Jesus, but since he was born a Jew, it is highly unlikely that he had this coloring. The text is nothing remarkable. It is not particularly friendly to very young children. I found Today's English version of the Bible (American Bible Society) to be much more suitable for a child without unnecessarily \\"dumbing down\\" the message. I have a feeling that I will be selling this book to a second hand store pretty soon."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"My mother bought this Bible for me when I was about 5 years old. I loved it and wore it out after many years. To this day when I hear sermons that draw upon various events from the Bible, it is the illustrations from this Golden Book version that immediately come to mind. The great flood and the plagues on Egypt are probably the most vivid to me. I read some of the reviews that raise concerns that their younger age children can not read this version as it is a little too challenging for them. They are right. It was the same for me when I was young, but my mom would read the stories to me at night before bedtime. I would look at the pictures during the day and find a section that interested me. I would ask her to read that section to me at night. It was something that I looked forward to, and in the process I learned a lot of really great stuff about the Bible. With my mom reading to me (until I was old enough to do it myself), and with the illustrations being \\"cemented\\" into my memory, the stories of the Bible stuck with me. It must have worked - because I'm now 47 and the illustrations and stories are still with me. I'm not getting this for my nephews and niece to begin the learning process with them.A picture is worth a thousand words. If your child is still too young to read all of the words yet, don't despair. The illustrations will carry them through until the understanding and reading skills catch up. If they are like me, the memorized illustrations will make them want to read the stories time and time again."},{"Title":"The Children's Bible","review":"One of my first memorable exposures to the stories of the Bible was from an older edition of this one in my pediatrician's office.

Parts of the Old Testament literally read like law books. . . and I literally mean literally!

I used an earlier edition of this book to teach my children the Bible, and read them the entire book, cover to cover. As a former missionary and lay minister, I know the Bible very well and could not find any place where this book differed in any significant way from my King James Version.I have now purchased this newer edition for my grandchildren, which is identical in text but some of the illustrations have been updated.

Well the words need to be changed in order to get the needed message accross to the small child reading the book. As for the platinum blonde jesus I think it is so he is easy to destinguish from all other characters in the bible. A young child is not always going to recognize what most people consider today to be jesus's standard colors for his robes. I really liked the fact that the book, chapter, and verse from an adult bible are listed at the top of the page so you can look between the bibles and check the difference or to reference for your childs information.

This is NOT appropriate for small children. I mean, God telling Eve that from now on she'll have to endure the pain of bearing children because she's a sinner is not something I want my small child to be learning until he's older. He doesn't even know where children come from yet! Right now, what I want him to learn is that God is a loving God. I think these stories could be told a little more gently and kid-friendly. And the illustrations, while quite detailed, are dull and drab and actually a bit too graphic for small children. I would think this would be more appropriate for an 8 year old or older.And this has nothing to do with the review of this book, but I have a problem with Amazon's age groupings. There's a HUGE difference between a 0 year old and a 3 year old (Ages 0-3 group), and a 4 year old and an 8 year old (Ages 4-8 group).

Aaron hires Kate and the story starts to progress in predictable ways. A subplot deals with Kate's real mother who is looking for her three children who were taken away from her years ago.This book doesn't offer anything new to the good old romance formula. Characters and conflicts between them are rather realistic - there are no tropical islands and mysterious millionaires here. However, this also makes plot twists somewhat unimaginative and one-dimensional. I also felt that the subplot about the reunion of Kate's family was mostly an unnecessary appendage. There are neither rewarding challenges nor anything dangerous here. I would only recommend this to someone who is willing to waste a couple of hours reading insignificant, mildly pleasing and harmless entertainment."},{"Title":"Dodge Pickups Color History (Color History Series)","review":"Like most books from Motorsport International this one has an abundance of professionally executed color photos that are reproduced well.

Children today are under an enormous amount of pressure to act, dress and assume adult roles and responsibilities. This hurrying causes stress in very young children as well as adolescents. I think the book addresses a lot of issues that have negative impact on all children. I learned a great deal about what constitutes hurrying in young children. The author brings forth the fact that hurrying takes place in both the home and school settings. Children are pushed to read earlier than they are developmentally ready; do math and behave in ways that most theorists like Erikson and Piaget have shown to be in direct conflict with children's cognitive and emotional development. The book was excellent in demonstrating the impact of outside influences such as T.V, movies,records and the media on children's development. The achievements and limitations of the major stages of development were long recognised by Piaget on cognitive development and by Erikson on emotional development. The book emphasized that when children's needs become subordinate to parental needs their emotional as well as cognitive growth is affected. I recommend that anyone who gets a chance to read this book does so, especially parents and educators of young children.Agnes."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"In The Hurried Child, Dr. Elkind does a competent job of describing a seriously problematic trend- the increasing inability and even unwillingness to appropriately \\"cushion\\" children from the modern world. The message is simple and eloquent: millions of children are simply not experiencing a proper childhood for a multitude of reasons. For some, it may be overcompetitive sports; for others, early sexuality or economic exploitation (children wielding more money and being strongly pursued as a consumer group). But regardless of form, hurrying leaves children trying to deal with adult concerns. While such kids may seem sophisticated, the deeper reality is that they are still children. This false maturation interferes with real maturation, and leads to problems in adolescence and adulthood.Dr. Elkind gives this book more popular appeal by making his case gently- there are no \\"Dr. Laura\\" type challenges here. But if the reader will think through the implications of this book, it is clear that children are being \\"hurried\\" because parents aren't making the kinds of choices necessary for a fulfilling and protective family life. Instead, they pursue personal, material and status-oriented goods, very often to the detriment of the family. This is not because they don't care for their kids, but because our culture is so steeped in radical individualism and materialism that the very idea of what a family is supposed to be is lost. It is no surprise that the children suffer as a result, in terms of both emotional and character development.I would propose a more profound solution than the \\"moderation\\" one to be found in this book. The cult of the individual needs to be overthrown. Parents should never make family-altering choices based solely on personal desires; the good of the children and the family unit as a whole should strongly influence what each member does. In addition, the excessive emphasis on \\"achieving independence\\" in childhood should be balanced with a recognition that all children need to be nurtured according to their stage of development. Children are not ready to be \\"individuals\\" in the adult sense of the term, which is why they are so easily influenced by peers, advertisers and celebrities. A strong, loving and non-hurrying family is a far more healthy source of influence than such factors. The more parents recognize and act upon these realities, the less kids will be \\"hurried\\", and the more they will be \\"trained up in the way they should go.\\""},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"I confess that I read this book because I already agreed with its conclusions and was looking for more rigorous support of what I have seen so extensively in an anecdotal manner. Case and point: this weekend, I overheard someone talk about how the school they attended as a child had the motto \`College starts at two'. (This person and most of their friends got into elite universities. . . and then dropped out and spent several years figuring out what they wanted to do with their lives before returning to school.)So when Elkind writes, \\"Hurrying children into adulthood violates the sanctity of life by giving one period priority over another. But if we really value human life, we will value each period equally give unto each stage of life what is appropriate to that stage.\\" --- I can only agree with that.By the end of this book, however, I was reminded of the quote by Daniel Dennett: \\"There's nothing I like less than bad arguments for a view that I hold dear.\\" There are two major problems with this book.First, it's been inconsistently updated. Reagan's surgeon general is quoted in present tense and then there are references to Harry Potter. This really undermines the book, which is a broad category of nonfiction that could be called \`alarming trends'. Like many of these books, this one grabs at anything recent that seems to support its main argument. But when time has passed since some spike in a statistic, it loses its ability to incite alarm. It does nothing for the book that it sees as evidence in its favor the spike in violence toward teachers in the late 1970s. I'm sure that the rate of violence toward teachers has gone up and down since then --- crime rates on the whole have dropped dramatically since then --- so tying the main argument to such things only diminishes the credibility. And it's not even clear where all this information is coming from, so a reference to a trend over \`the last decade' leaves you wondering what decade Elkind had in mind.Actually, Elkind is just plain dated. His theoretical basis --- Freud, Piaget, Hans Selye --- were big in academia in the 1950s and 1960s. Only Piaget has really retained his standing. Selye seems more forgotten than rejected, though I think that most people, if they were informed of his views, would recognize that his conception of stress was very one-sided because it seems to imply that not moving at all is the key to a long happy life. And Freud has largely been reduced to a novelty over the last quarter century as it becomes increasingly clear that therapy based on his ideas has poor success rates and his cultural impact is seen in a more negative light (the way we now think of all touch as sexual, the moral panic over child abuse in the 1980s based on suddenly remembered memories, etc.).Second, Elkind is talking about sociological topics but thinks like a therapist. The logical way to structure this book is to talk about what children are capable of doing at particular ages and then compare that to what is expected of them and then explain the forces that push us toward demanding so much of children so early. Instead, this book feels like someone with a romanticized view of childhood clutching at their hair and moaning, \\"Too soon! Too soon!\\" The book is very anecdote based and seems driven more by a generalized anxiety about what's happening to children than levelheaded analysis. It also leads to some rather arbitrary conclusions, like disagreeing with a girl who thinks she's being hurried because she has four hours of homework each night and claiming that Brittney Spears is more developmentally appropriate for girls than Madonna.So when it comes time to explain why children are hurried, Elkind explains it in terms of Freudian family dynamics with only a vague awareness of how much of this has to do with economics --- the economics of corporations creating new markets and new desire on one hand and people's anxieties about falling behind economically on the other. Likewise, his \`what to do' section starts off by saying that you can't change culture and suggesting semi-therapeutic responses.So honestly, I don't see much reason for reading this. It would have been great to read in the 1980s, but today it's not going to persuade the skeptical and it doesn't offer much advice to those trying to figure out what is the appropriate age for children to be doing things and how to combat unreasonable pressures. If someone can suggest a recent book that does do things like that, please drop me a line in the comment section."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"I read this book a few months back and I'm still not decided on whether I 'loved' this book or not. I did like the book. It provided a lot of information I wasn't aware of, but I'm not sure I really liked the set-up of the book or some of the content. The main focus of this book is basically what hidden aspects of growing up stress a child out, and how that stress affects a childs development. He touches on some of the basic aspects like divorce, and death, but most of the book focus's on things that force a child to grow up too quickly. The main conclusion of every single argument in the book is anything that forces a child to grow up too quickly or puts pressure on a child beyond their natural capabilites is stressful for a child.The first half of the book is kind of a summary of the second half of the book, which almost makes the first half pointless. The whole time I was reading it I was getting a lot of interesting information/opinions with very little proof of the points he was making. But the authors points and the information he was providing was interesting. The best chapter of the first half of the book is the chapter on Lapware (computerized learning devices). He provided great arguments, and very valid proof to back up his claims. His information would be great to base future lapware studies on. I don't want to blow this chapter for you, but his basic point is that lapware doesn't teach a child anything that he/she doesn't already know.The second half of this book is extremely well organized, and perfect for parents, or anyone with basic knowledge of child-development. I study child development and I don't know that I've read a better book or text-book that puts Piagets development periods or Erikksons theories into better context than this book does. The way he was able to use those theories in connection with his own research, and other research was excellent. It almost makes me wish this book had a broader range of topic. I could apply the information in this book to pretty much every child I know. If you have a child that shows any self-confidence problems this book will be very helpful to you. There's nothing mentioned in the title or the description about self-confidence, but after reading the book it's easy to see how the demands put on your child affect their confidence.There is a lot of basic information on various topics from the basic biological reactions of stress, to how schools operate. He makes very compelling arguments against the idea of \\"early is better\\" in education. He also provides good evidence in favor of keeping the arts in schools by showing that activities like gym, music, and art help children relieve stress which helps them focus more on academics (in addition to their artistic values).At times I found some of the information in the book repetitive. He touches on certain subjects like divorce, drugs, and education numerous times. It's all good information, but I would have liked to have read more on media effects and social aspects with other peers than was offered.Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it provides a good balance between statistical data based research without being so dense it's not readable by an average parent. The writing style is very basic, and his research is based on stats just as much as his own experiences as a therapist. So he backs up any technical data with a personal example to explain it and back it up. It's somewhat of a perfect book for parents looking to understand more about their children, and people looking for an easy book to read with solid research."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"The author cautions against rushing life for young peopleand placing too many artificial pressures on them.

A must read for parents concerned about the progress of their child."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"Enough denialDr. Elkind is a veteran of decades in child psychology. As such, he&#8217;s surely seen the harsh realities modern adults perpetrate on their kids: the explosions in divorce, drug abuse, criminal behavior, imprisonment, and instability among older grownups once thought immune to these problems. Consider these shocking changes: in 1970, a 40 year-old parent was only one-sixth as likely to be arrested for a felony as his/her 14 year-old teen; today, the teen is more likely to be visiting dad or mom in jail. No generation of teens has ever suffered the kind of hard-drug addiction, family chaos, and adult disarray that modern youth routinely face.Yet, Dr. Elkind has remained steadfastly oblivious. Adults are fine, he insists; just a bit overworked and too trusting. The big problem, he soothes, is that we tragically misjudged how &#8220;incompetent&#8221; children and teenagers are and &#8220;hurried&#8221; them into premature adulthood while neglecting the evil influences of pop culture, the media, and peers.Well, someone should call an end to this charade, which is not Dr. Elkind&#8217;s alone, but a general American delusion. I only wish the kids I worked with in their families for 15 years, and the statistics I studied upon returning to graduate school, confirmed that the problem is as simple as Dr. Elkind depicts. But it isn&#8217;t.First, the kids are fine; it&#8217;s the adults who have gotten worse. Teens (despite their bad publicity) have proven admirably competent in assuming responsibilities at younger ages, which modern family instability (not pop culture) forced on them. Dr. Elkind (quoting secondhand sources he apparently never checked) claims in his 1998 and 2001 books that teenage suicide and murder have tripled in 20 years, that &#8220;more than 5,000 teens adolescents take their own lives every year,&#8221; that &#8220;substance abuse has become epidemic,&#8221; rising numbers of children commit &#8220;adult crimes (theft, robbery, murder),&#8221; that U.S. teens suffer the highest pregnancy rates of any industrial nation, and that &#8220;children in contemporary America, including advantaged children, are less well off than they were a couple of decades ago.&#8221;All of these statements are demonstrably false except the teen pregnancy claim, and that was more true in the 1950s than today. In fact:- The latest FBI statistics have shown for several years that teenage felony, violence, murder, and other crime have fallen to their lowest levels in 25 to 30 years. In states that keep detailed records, it is clear that the temporary surge in teenage murder in the early 1990s affected only poorer youth, nearly all connected to gang conflict over supplying hard drugs to aging Baby-Boom addicts. Meanwhile, suburban and other &#8220;advantaged&#8221; youth are safer from violence and murder than at any time in decades.- Teenage murder is a factor of poverty, not culture (and not race). Black youth suffer murder rates 20 times higher than white youth, and poorer white youth (ie, in Oklahoma) have murder rates seven times higher than more affluent white youth (ie, in Minnesota).- Teenage property crime (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) levels are at their lowest level in 30 years, as are felony rates in general. - Particularly among younger kids (12 and younger), FBI statistics show murder arrests are at their lowest level in 1999 than at any time since data were first collected nearly 40 years ago.- Never, in nearly 100 years of U.S. mortality reports, have younger teenagers been safer from violent death than they are today.- The latest National Center for Health Statistics show 1,900 adolescents (under age 20) committed suicide in the most recent year, far below the &#8220;more than 5,000&#8221; Dr. Elkind quotes. Why on earth would he exaggerate teen suicide 250% and make it appear more normative?- Teen pregnancy rates are at their lowest level in 30 years (and birth rates at their lowest level since the 1940s). The U.S. rate is not due to teenage incompetence or pop culture, but poverty. U.S. teens who enjoy poverty rates as low as Western Europe&#8217;s (i.e., suburban teens) have birth and abortion rates as low as Europe&#8217;s; U.S. teens who suffer high rates of poverty have birth and abortion rates five to 20 times higher. How much longer are American authorities going to deny this?But false claims that today&#8217;s kids are uniquely messed up apparently are what modern adults want to hear. The unpalatable facts are that among adults ages 30-60 (the ones parenting teenagers) in the past 30 years, divorce rates doubled, drug abuse rose 400%, felony arrests doubled, imprisonments rose 300%, and an unquantifiable selfishness relegated childraising and children&#8217;s welfare far below adult needs. Anyone who doubts these trends is encouraged to consult your state crime, drug abuse, and prison agency reports.Instead of facing these troubling adult trends, a massive denial prevails, one insisting our kids and their &#8220;acting out&#8221; is what plagues the nation. In reality, we don&#8217;t know why kids got better as adults got worse, but surely that&#8217;s an intriguing question for psychologists and other experts to put aside their popular cliches and ponder. Dr. Elkind could do a tremendous favor by abandoning his specious claims that teenagers are incompetent and rushed into precocity by cultural influences. Youthsthemselves don&#8217;t have the luxury to evade adult-imposed poverty, domestic violence, and parental addiction and disarray, so why should we let Ph.D.s get away with denial?..."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"The Hurried Child by David Elkin is a great resources and a must read for parents and teachers. This book outlines many of the causes associated with the hurrying of children in today's society. Some of the causes, such as media, are apparent to most adults; however, there are other causes, such as specific types of parent and child relationships, which are not so apparent. This book explains what the role of the parent should be and the detrimental effects of a parent not fulfilling this roles. Elkin explains that many children welcome the hurrying at younger ages, because it gives them the illusion that they are maturing. In contrast, by the time these children reach adolescence they resent their previous hurrying and place the blame on their parents. It is this early hurrying which leads many of today's adolescence to engage in less than honorable activities.While many causes are explained, Elkin does not list many solutions. Of course, a solution would be to stop implementing the causes, but how does one go about correcting the hurrying once it has begun or once the hurried child has reached adolescence? These questions could be addressed in more depth.Despite the lack of listed solutions, I would recommend this book to any parent or teacher. It is helpful to understand what hurries our children and how the hurrying affects them. This knowledge will help us understand the grief of our youth thus, helping us to become better teachers and parents."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"Dr Elkind has done significant research in the field of child psychology. While some of his research has been the subject of criticism, \\"The Hurried Child\\" makes some vary valid points. With his insite, it is difficult to pin-point when childhood is carefree.In a society the is influenced by the whims of the business world, the working class is easily influenced. Business wants better works that produce at a higher, more profitable rate. Their solution is to put pressure of the educational system. This brings issues of accountability into school. Rather than teacher kids how to think, schools have to focus their curriculum around pass a standardized test to continue to receive funding. In some cases, the standardized tests start before first grade. This is just a sample of te pressure children have to perform. It is no wonder so many kids are seeing terapists who perscribe medicine to keep them from going crazy.Elkind presents various other forms of stressors on children and discusses why the stress is unnecessary. If something is not done to reverse the trend toward increased stress in our children, it will only get worse. One must realize that generations have turned out ok before the trends toward accountability. Without this movement, we are likely to continue to be ok."},{"Title":"The hurried child: Growing up too fast too soon","review":"Always can't wait to be something we aren't now.

Dr. Elkind takes an extremist position on his point of view throughout the book.

Telling others the truth about our wretched condition before God, and His gracious provision in Christ is not optional. The problem with much of today's evangelism is that it is aimed at appealing to the hearer--the so-called &quot;seeker sensitive&quot; movement being a prime example. But if you have any experience with such methods, you know that they are ineffective at best, and harmful at worst. Kuiper gives evangelism the emphasis it deserves: a God centered presentation of the gospel. Yes, if you haven't figured it out yet, Kuiper is a Calvinist, and this book is simply a Calvinistic understanding of depravity, grace, and sovereignty. And yet, unlike many Calvinistic documents, this one gives asimple but effective instruction in the presentaion of the good news found in Jesus Christ. Tired of man-centered preaching that does no one any good? Let Kuiper show you the glory of God as you preach the gospel of God!"},{"Title":"God-Centered Evangelism: A Presentation of the Scriptural Theology of Evangelism","review":"R.B. Kuiper's God-Centred Evangelism, written in the mid-20th century, is as relevant now as it was when first printed by Banner of Truth in 1966. The book is Bible-saturated, clearly written and very helful. Each chapter begins with the word \\"God\\", focusing the reader's attention on the intent of the book. Much of the book is just an excellent review of the biblical truths regarding the love of God, the sovereignty of God, and God's work in salvation. In addressing these subjects, Kuiper deals thoroughly with their application to evangelism and what acceptance of these truths forces us to reject (universalism, moralism, fatalism, etc.). This book is intensely practical because it lays the biblical foundation necessary for faithful evangelism.My favorite illustration from the book is on page 155 and is a good example of Kuiper's writing style and content throughout the book . . .\\"A criminal finds himself in prison, locked in his cell. A visiting friend calls out to him: 'I have good news for you.' With eager expectation the prisoner demands: 'What is it? Out with it! The answer comes: 'Be good.' Well that might drive the prisoner mad. Yet, precisely that is the only message which some who call themselves evangelists have for the sinner. It is not good news. It is not news at all. Good news for the sinner is that provision has been made for his release from sin and hell.\\""},{"Title":"God-Centered Evangelism: A Presentation of the Scriptural Theology of Evangelism","review":"This is a solid review of evangelism, especially in relation to God and His sovereignty.

So often modern day evangelistic efforts lack depth, and the ideas being presented in this book are a great antidote to that! Not all parts of this book interested me, but I found it to generally cut right to the heart with a simple writing style that powerfully exhorts the reader with both emotion and reason! Kuiper definately has a great writing style, not spectacular but very Biblical and digestable."},{"Title":"God-Centered Evangelism: A Presentation of the Scriptural Theology of Evangelism","review":"In \\"God-Centered Evangelism\\" R.B. Kuiper (student of B.B. Warfield and later a professor of Westminster Theological Seminary from 1933-1952) delivers a volume aimed at the advancement evangelism utilizing the biblical method and message.Kuiper's stated his purpose as a \\"plea for a God-centred, in contradistinction to man-centred, evangelism. In other words it presents a theology of evangelism\\" (p. 8).First addition was published in 1966 and the edition I am reviewing in 1998.Chapters include:- God the Author of Evangelism- God's Infinite Love and Evangelsim- God and the Scope of Evangelism- God and the Urgency of Evangelism- God and the Means of Evangelism- God and the Triumph of Evangelism- And many more theology based essays on evangelismBible-minded believers need to witness more often. The great English Puritan, John Rogers, one time stirred up his congregation for the lost by imitating the screams of the souls in hell. Hell should prompt your mouth to open and trumpet the truth of God. Your love for Jesus should enkindle your heart to urge Christ upon the pagan; your glorious union with Christ should prompt you to yearn for the salvation of those God has providentially set in your path. It is no longer you who live, but Christ lives in you, the one who loved you and died for you. As a Christian, Jesus lives in your heart by faith. Jesus said, \\"I came to seek and save that which was lost\\" (Luke 19:10). Since that was one of His goals, and He dwells in our hearts; we must follow Him as a seeker of the lost. To arouse your heart for the unsaved: ponder the cross, consider the love and excellencies of Jesus, look to the glories of heaven, and the eternal pangs of hell. As one old preacher said, \\"I want the stench of hell in my nostrils and the splendor of heaven in my eyes.\\"God Centered Evangelism is a wonderful book (247 pages) on witnessing. Kuiper exhorts the church with the following: \\"God commands sovereignly and for that very reason must be obeyed... To apply the foregoing to evangelism, the sovereignty of God comes to vigorous expression in the many missionary commands of the Bible, and in the measure in which one recognizes the divine sovereignty, in that very measure must one be zealous in carrying out those commands.\\"Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are witnesses of these things (Luke 24:46-48).for more essays on biblical evangelism and apologetics see my book:Truth, Knowledge and the Reason sfor God: The Defense of the Rational Assurance of Christianityor\\"God Does Exist!: Defending the faith using Presuppositional Apologetics, Evidence, and the Impossibility of the Contrary\\""},{"Title":"The call of the minaret (Galaxy book, GB 122)","review":"This book by Kenneth Cragg is superb. Cragg has a heart for people, all people, and at the same time, a deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ, King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is an articulate and scholarly Mother Theresa.The first half of the book describes Islam and its beliefs. He apparently has the approval of Muslims, who say that his descriptions are accurate. He does not shrink from spelling out the problems and issues within Islam, nor its radical differences from Christianity.The second half of the book describes how Christians can helpfully relate to Islam. It ought to be required reading for missionaries and all Christians for its powerful perspective on how to reach out to persons of other beliefs.Cragg wrote the book in 1955, when Islamic peoples were just coming into modernity and finding their own national identities, largely because of WWII and the collapse of the colonial empires. Charges of terrorism were even then being leveled. The book is a superb introduction to the Islamic world leading up to the present confrontation with terrorism from within their ranks.Cragg does not deal with the issues of terrorism as we see it half a century later, but he does help the reader understand how Islam must inevitably drift in that direction. Allah is a distant deity, whom one never gets to know personally, never as &quot;Father&quot;. One gets to know only the law of Allah. That kind of distant, almost deist, deity is guaranteed to inspire deep feelings of resentment and anger in its worshippers. Just as with a human father of like character. It is a religion without grace in the Christian understanding of the word.Cragg describes the plight and yearnings of the Muslims with great sensitivity, and with clarity on how Christians can maintain their worship of the Triune God and at the same time reach out with social and political as well as religious integrity.It would be hard to imagine a better introduction to Islam, especially in light of the current spiritual warfare developing (yet once again) between Islam and Christianity. Christians are very ill equipped to deal with spiritual warfare on almost any front. They would do well to learn about Islam from someone who sees their need for Christ, and at the same time loves them deeply.Blessings,Earle Fox"},{"Title":"The call of the minaret (Galaxy book, GB 122)","review":"This title was recommended through a Viewpoints on VirtueOnline.

From this central image/keystone of the Fourth Gospel, Jesus is revealed as one-and-the-same with the Spirit/Wind that swept over the dark waters of the abyss in Genesis' 1st Creation Story. From this central image of Jesus standing upon the waters, Christ's light radiates - shining forth as through an infinitely faceted gem, illuminating all of the other gospel scenes.Though the theological premises may not necessarily become our wholesale conclusions, there is a great deal of food for thought.

The first 150 pages of the novel read like Tim Zahn's previous book Icarus Hunt, lined with diversions, deceit and counter-plots that make the story intriguing but dry. It gives the reader the \\"who did it\\" feeling to read on, but somehow that just didn't work here.However there are certain highlights of Survivor's Qyest. How Tim Zahn manages to detail every move of his characters in battle is a feat not many storytellers can achieve with such impact. How Jedis have been unable to defeat droidekas but using some wit and cunning Luke and Mara manage to. He further develops his characters Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker and how they are bonded as husband and wife. And the best part, he makes his characters human, meaning they can get injured, they don't dodge laser beams and grenades forever, they make mistakes and pay for them.I personally think that these are the highlights of the novel, although it would have been nice if he wrote a New Jedi Order novel before that series ended. His space battle tactics and descriptions could have done justice to the boring and stale storytelling of the novelist from that series.I do look forward to his prequel novel Outbound Flight, and pray that it takes a better turn that this book."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"From start to end Zahn keeps you in mystery. Out of all the characters in the book the most innocent party in the book is actually the one enemy that could end the Chiss empire. Zahn knows Star Wars and he is the only person I will read when it comes to those books."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"The book had great potential but, as other reviewers have stated, Zahn left too many loose ends. With a few changes of names and places, the final 100 pages could have occurred in any Star Wars book. The story of what occurred on Outbound flight remains to be told."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers around the loose ends side of things. There was so much build up about the 18 Jedi on board and what Luke could learn about them. Once the action got going, there was almost no discussion about learning what really happened after they got shot down. Why did the people on board fear them etc. Really surprised an author of Zahn's caliber let thing finish the way they did. What did Luke do with the Jedi adept (i.e. take them to Jedi Academy etc)? Way too many unfinished concepts."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Good overall but a little disappointing considering the 5 prior Star Wars novels by Zahn. The plot was a bit contrived and some of the more interesting sub-plots were not followed up or developed. A question which constantly popped into my mind was, \\"why are two of the heavy hitters (Luke and Mara Jade) in the universe going on this little rinky dink mission?\\" If you are a Star Wars fan you will enjoy the book, just don't expect it to be on par with Zahn's other work."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Tim Zahn returns of the Star Wars universe with a bang. Survivor's Quest follows the adventures of Luke &amp; Mara Jade Skywalker several months after their marriage. This books is vagualy along the lines of Tatooine Ghost by Troy Denning which took place a few months after Han &amp; Leia were married. In many ways, it is the completion of Zahn's Hand of Thrawn series. The Chiss major players in the recently concluded New Jedi Order series, and the native race of the greatest tactician in Star Wars history, Grand Admiral Thrawn, take center stage as does the Outbound Flight project brought up in Zahn's very first Star Wars series. Luke &amp; Mara are contacted by the Chiss who discovered the remains of the OUtbound Flight project, a fleet of 6 massive ships supposedly destroyed by Thrawn 50+ years ago. Along for the ride are Chiss with hidden agenda's, con men, alien worshippers, intrigue &amp; deception. The book is a taut thriller, full of twists and turns and focuses on Luke &amp; Mara, none of the other mainline Star Wars characters make an appearance except for Talon Karrde &amp; Booster Terrik. This works to the books advantage, because many times with so many characters, storylines get too conflicted. Overall this is a great and fun look at the Skywalkers as a couple and helps to answer many questions posed by revelations from the prequal movies. Just as Tatooine Ghost did, Survivor's Quest incorporates information found in both The Phantom Menace &amp; Attack of the Clones to form a more complete Star Wars novel. Is it better than Zahn's other work? Not better than his original Thrawn trilogy, but certainly equal to his Hand of Thrawn series. And that ladies &amp; gent's is not too bad!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Timothy Zahn is probably the man we should all thank for bringing the star wars saga back to life with his bestselling \\"Heir to the Empire\\" Trilogy, but he certainly lost some of his ability in the Force between his last Duolody (\\"The Hand of Thrawn\\" books) and this latest adventure with the cast of his creation we have all come to like.On this opportunity, there are several things that set the book apart from the rest:1) all the main characters except Luke were totally erased from the story, even the very necessary and plot enriching droids, not even Luke's faithful Artoo made it in this time, which is quite odd.2) Zahn's \\"Band of Brother's\\" approach to the gruop of Imperial Stormtroopers, which he said were part of the Five-O-First (501st...), was pretty lame and even though he wanted to give them this intriguing side to them they were just a couple of grunts with A LOT of equipment on them and quite invinsible, which doesn't go right with the image of Princess Leia dropping them like flies on the original trilogy movies.3) the bad guys are as plain and uninteresting as you would get them to be; and when they finally reveal themselves it seems that the whole time almost all of the other characters knew about them but didn't do anything. To what purpose they didn't do anything is still to be defined.4) The main reason I thought the book might be interesting was because finally we got to see the very talked about and quite interesting Outbound Flight and what it actually happened to it, but TOO BAD because the book merely talks about the layout of the ships that made out the whole thing, and also talked a little about the people that survived and how they hated Jedi, BUT IT DOESN'T SAY WHY THEY HATE THE JEDI, DUH!!!So it leaves you with a feeling that the whole book was for nothing.5) Even though Luke or any of the original characters didn't really know anything about what had actually happened during the Clone Wars, all of a sudden he and Mara Jade seemed to know a lot about Battledroids and Droid Armies and Destroyer Droids, as if they had been briefed on them by watching Episode I and II (????) and they also seemed to know a lot about Jedi Knights and what they used to do, which is totally wrong compared to what the rest of the expanded universe stories have let on. You also have to consider Luke's fascination with ancient Jedi lore, BECAUSE HE'S NOT REALLY SUPPOSED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT TIME TO BEGIN WITH!!6)and last but not least, the character Card'as (or something like that) is this omnipresent know-it-all that nobody has seen but all the other characters seem to recognize instantly, and all have to do with him in some way or another, which makes me wonder if it's a way for Zahn to put himself in the story and in a very amateur kind of way play out all the characters like puppets, which is quite bad because you get the feeling that the characters have a quite unavoidable purpose, and this in turn takes away their ability to have the kind of freedom we can all appreciate and relate to.So, those are my views, take them into consideration and find out for yourself what to think about it. If you're a Star Wars fan you should buy the book just so you know what I'm talking about, but if your new to Star Wars I would suggest you start with something better, like \\"Star Wars: Splinter of the Minds Eye\\"Peace"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I really enjoyed this book. But It was'nt as good as The original thrawn trilogy which was the high water mark for star wars fiction. It seems like with each star wars installment he does the quality is starting to ebb. Specter of the past and vision of the future for instance were not as gripping as his original trilogy. i.e.(Heir to the empire, dark force rising, the last command). Don't get me wrong tim zahn is probalbly the single greatest writer of military science fiction today, but he creativity seems to be hampered having to stay within the star wars canon. As he said once in an interview, it's like playing in some other kids sandbox. It's more satifying to be able to create wondefully original human stories for science fiction, your own chracters your own worlds. My favorite tim zahn chracter owned by lucasfilm is Mara Jade, because it provided luke skywalker with a love interest. He had'nt had one since he found out Leia was his sister. I can't wait for his next book which he was particularly excited about, the outbound flight project in the prequel era, which involves one then Liutenant thrawn in the service of the emperor. And his rise to admiral and destroying the jedi of outbound flight. I wish Del Rey would do a book series set in the future about ben skywalker luke's son, and another book like tatooine ghost instead Luke and Leia visit Naboo to find out about their mother kinda a sequel to tatooine ghost, or leia visits the site of the remnants of alderaan and remembers about her life on alderaan and her mother, and bail organa. Would vader have tortured her on the death star if he knew she was his daughter? If Padme had told him about the twins would he have turned to the dark side?"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"The product was in excellent shape. My husband highly enjoys the author Timothy Zahn. This book was no exception. He was very happy with this purchase. Marcia"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Going into this review, I have to be honest: I'd put reading this book off for quite a while due to the fact that it had several things stacked against it and just generally didn't sound interesting to me as far as Star Wars books go. I ended up enjoying it slightly more than I expected, but it also had all of the problems I foresaw it having. Spoilers follow.\\"Survivor's Quest\\" takes place three years after Luke and Mara are married. The couple receives a previously intercepted message informing them to come to a specific place in Chiss-controlled space by a certain date. They do so, and are told by the Chiss that the remains of the Outbound Flight have been discovered, and since members from the Old Republic and Jedi Order perished in the crash, the Chiss decided that Luke and Mara should have the opportunity to see the wreckage.The Jedi couple are immediately put on edge when introduced to the other members of the party. The various Chiss participants (Aristocra Formbi, Drask, and Feesa), the Imperial Remnant (Chak Fel and four stormtroopers of the 501st), the shady Ambassador Jinzler (an impersonator who joined at the last minute), and the overly grateful Geroons (who were supposedly released from slavery to the vicious Vagaari when Thrawn attacked Outbound Flight) all seem to be hiding something. They find the remains and are surprised to discover that there is a colony of survivors living within the wreckage...and they don't like Jedi.A lot of pages are devoted to the various groups trying to deal with the colonists and the traps they've set. The ultimate surprise, however, comes when the Geroons are revealed to be the Vagaari, intent on taking Outbound Flight for their own use. Luke and Mara save the day and peace is restored (more or less).If you enjoyed the Bantam-era books where the characters go on adventures and return without really changing anything in the grand scale of things, you'll probably enjoy this story. If you preferred the galaxy-changing events in series like the \\"New Jedi Order\\" and \\"Legacy of the Force,\\" then this might not be for you. I'm rather neutral on the issue, personally, so the lack of greatly impacting events wasn't particularly bothersome.The plot is built a lot on being suspicious of all of the other characters. As I summed up above, everyone is hiding something from everyone else, so a good deal of the novel is devoted to figuring out who is hiding what exactly. I feel like the book could have been condensed a bit, but there were some interesting twists here and there. Zahn is a competent writer and can pull off a fairly intriguing plot. That being said, this was hardly his best work.The concept of there being survivors living in the wreckage of Outbound Flight was very interesting. The tragedy of the crash is so built up within the novel that the discovery of a surviving colony is quite a welcome, unexpected surprise. I would have liked to know more about how they survived and what happened to them before they were found, but the exclusion of such information isn't that unsatisfying.The twist of the Geroon being the Vagaari was also a big surprise. Zahn managed to keep their identities and motives very well hidden without giving anything away early on. I also appreciated that they were rather formidable, clever (to an extent) enemies instead of merely being unintelligent, violent aliens.Zahn has put together a rather interesting cast of diverse characters (and there are a lot) that are all interesting to read about. They all have their own motives and backgrounds and, considering how many there are, are characterized pretty well. I initially found it difficult to keep track of all of the characters, but as I continued through the book, it stopped being an issue as the characters became more fleshed out.Now onto the things I didn't care for in \\"Survivor's Quest.\\" Many of the things that I found to be less than satisfying or, in some cases, aggravating are things that are common in all of Zahn's \\"Star Wars\\" books.There are a lot of Zahn-isms used. Characters always seem to be wincing, grimacing, quirking eyebrows, or commenting on things wryly. It wouldn't be distracting if such phrases only popped up once or twice, but they occur so frequently that it begins to detract from the story. Also, conversing characters have the tendency to say \\"Point\\" or \\"Agreed,\\" which comes off as sounding stilted and artificial (especially when multiple characters do it).Also, for whatever reason, Zahn seems to have ignored everything that has happened in the Galaxy Far Far Away until this point. I get that this is supposed to be a stand-alone novel, but I personally enjoy seeing references to other events (aside from those written by the same author) to tie the novel into the rest of the Star Wars series. Here, Zahn only writes about his characters and only refers to events that he wrote about or alluded to in earlier novels. This would have been acceptable if there weren't many other books out when he wrote \\"Survivor's Quest,\\" but that isn't the case. If you enjoy all of Zahn's characters and events, this may not bug you, but I don't particularly care for all of Zahn's characters (particularly Mara) and would enjoy seeing his events connected to others. To me, it felt like the whole novel was Zahn's own characters and world with a conflict that revolves around his characters and events (specifically Thrawn and Outbound Flight) with Luke, Jedi, and a few references to the New/Old Republic. To some, this may be fine, but I found it to be a bit aggravating.Moving back to the plot for a moment, a lot of time is spent trying to uncover everyone's secrets, but very few of them are actually important or even particularly interesting or surprising. While I enjoyed Jinzler's character, for example, I didn't quite see why he was keeping his big secret from everyone when it ended up not really being that important. In addition, everyone revealing their secrets tends to lose its impact when everyone has something to reveal.Regarding the Outbound Flight's survivor's, it was never mentioned why they hated Jedi so much. Their hatred of Force users is a big part of the story and their colony's culture, but no reason for that hate is given. It's very distracting to read about these peoples' paranoia without having any sort of understanding about it. I'm rather surprised that Zahn didn't include something about this since it plays such a large role in the book.As I mentioned above, I don't like Mara very much and never have. I won't harp on about that (as it's expected she'll play a big role in Zahn's books, regardless of how much I dislike the character); I will, however, complain about the development of her relationship with Luke. I've never felt like their relationship was believable, and I'm still not convinced of it. \\"Survivor's Quest\\" was supposed to develop it more, and it failed to do that. Instead of showing us how much they love one another or how deep their bond is, Zahn tells us (usually through Luke thinking about Mara's red gold hair or green eyes). While I appreciated not having to read too much romance (as I'm not a fan of it in general), I would have liked to see why these two are so compatible and how their bond has grown; I was disappointed.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that, despite the events that happen, no one gets anywhere. As I mentioned above, books that don't have galaxy-impacting events don't bother me in the slightest. However, the characters didn't seem to accomplish anything in the long run, either. Luke, for example, hopes that Outbound Flight will give him some insights on the Old Jedi Order. This motivation seems to be forgotten by the author once they get to the wreckage. It seems like the events are to supposed to be big to the characters involved, but they rarely are. Luke and Mara effortlessly save the day and everyone seems to be largely unaffected by anything in the long run. It almost feels like a wasted effort (especially having read the books that come after this and knowing that nothing big is done with the events here).All in all, \\"Survivor's Quest\\" was ultimately disappointing. It has its strong points, such as a couple of the twists and the Outbound Flight's survivors. The characters are diverse and, for the most part, well developed. However, Zahn's writing tendencies greatly detract from the book's enjoyment (in terms of his phrases and the fact that he only uses his characters and events and ignores everything else), and the relationship between Luke and Mara doesn't feel any more developed than it was before the novel. Ultimately, the characters get nowhere. The good things are simply overshadowed by the bad. The story itself gets three stars, but the distracting writing, loose ends, and other unsatisfying developments (or lack thereof) knock the score to two stars."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest occupies an interesting place in the Expanded Universe, set between the brilliant Hand of Thrawn duology which wraps up many loose ends from the prior novels and the start of the dark and sprawling New Jedi Order series. It is a lighter tale than the adjoining novels in the timeline and for the most part tightly focuses on Luke Skywalker and his wife Mara Jade Skywalker. The book ties heavily to Zahn's Outbound Flight, which he wrote later but which is set decades earlier. Reading Outbound Flight first is not required (I didn't myself the first time around) but it certainly helps flesh out this story.The strongest aspects of Survivor's Quest are Zahn's exploration of Luke and Mara's new marriage and the mysterious plot he weaves around the semi-legendary Outbound Flight project. Luke has had numerous ups and downs throughout the various Star Wars novels but he ended Vision of the Future on a high: ready to push forward with the continued rebirth of the Jedi and also madly in love with Mara. Mara also came out of that story in a good place, finally putting many of her demons from her youth as an assassin for the Empire to rest and moving on to a brighter future. Zahn picks up where he left off and portrays a balanced, happy couple. Realistically for a newly married couple, they are still finding their roles and adjusting to life together, but it is nice to have a book that goes light on the Skywalker angst and lets the characters breathe and even relax a bit.The other high point of this book is the carefully constructed plot centering on the disappearance of the Outbound Flight project and the thousands of people onboard decades earlier. Zahn excels at parcelling out enough information to keep the book moving briskly along. A mysterious message leads Luke and Mara to the Chiss, Grand Admiral Thrawn's people. They link up with a mix of Chiss diplomatic and military leaders, a group of Imperials (including the stormtrooper squad featured in Zahn's Fool's Bargain), a puzzling alien race apparently wronged by Thrawn decades earlier, and Dean Jinzler, brother to Jedi Lorana Jinzler featured in the Outbound Flight novel. Zahn deftly juggles his large cast while keeping the limelight squarely on Luke and Mara.One particular action scene I thoroughly enjoyed came near the end and featured a destroyer droid (or \\"droideka\\") from the prequel films squaring off against Luke and Mara. These droids are quite a threat in the prequels and this combat does not disappoint. Luke and Mara are forced to carefully strategize to deal with the droid and even with a solid plan, the risk factor is high. It's a tense sequence and also a nifty echo of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon fighting the droids above Naboo on the Trade Federation ship in The Phantom Menace.Zahn picks up a few other threads from his Hand of Thrawn duology, such as the Empire of the Hand, and weaves them with the elements detailed above into a quite entertaining little tale. The book stands well on its own, but also serves as a nice lighter break between the larger stories that bookend it in the Star Wars chronology."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"What would it be like if Luke hooked up with a lady who was NOT his sister? What if she were a jedi too (a real, trained, kick-your-butt Jedi)?What would it be like for two Jedi Masters to marry and to bond to a new degree in the force? And how could such a pair use the force? What if she had just enough attitude to make life interesting? What if they were put in several life-threatening, no-way-out situations, how could they Houdini their way out?All these questions are answered artfully by Timothy Zahn, the writing Master of the continued Star Wars universe. Over the years, the publishers have hired dozens of writers to carry on the Star Wars cash cow. Some of the stuff is downright cringy, but take it from this avid reader and collector--no one can spin a Star Wars yarn like Timothy Zahn: Well-crafted villains, an intelligent and adventurous plot with an ever-quickening pace, true-to-character reactions and dialogue. If you haven't read his Thrawn Trilogy, you MUST. You will read the Thrawn Trilogy as soon as possible (it's an old Jedi mind trick).I advise you to take a trip with Mr. & Mrs. Luke Skywalker--you'll enjoy the romp. And may the force be with you! =)"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest has Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker as its two main characters, and the action takes place after all of the adventures described in Mr. Zahn's two-volume series The Hand of Thrawn. The author is one of the best in the Star Wars genre, and he has turned out another good book with Survivor's Quest. The plot is focused primarily on the remains of Outbound Flight that have been found on the planet Nirauan fifty years after the flight took place. Outbound Flight was a pioneering Jedi expedition that was destroyed by the alien warlord Thrawn. Up until this point, the reasons for the destruction of the flight have been a mystery. Now the beings who discovered the remains of the flight have contacted the New Republic and Luke in particular with an offer to turn over what is left of the flight to the New Republic. Luke finds the offer irresistible, so he heads off with wife Mara Jade on a long and perilous voyage to see what they can learn from the wreckage of Outbound Flight. Many surprises await.Luke and Mara run into unexpected enemies and have to rely heavily on their Jedi skills to get out of one tough spot after another. Mr. Zahn does his usual good job with the plot, although I did feel that the action bogged down once in a while, especially when compared to the Hand of Thrawn books. It was great fun to see Luke and Mara fighting together, and a number of intriguing new characters were introduced. All in all, I thought Survivor's Quest was a worthy addition to the Star Wars world.Included with Survivor's Quest is Fool's Bargain, previously available only as an eBook. Fool's Bargain tells the story of the legendary Empire of the Hand's 501st Legion as they go on a mission on the planet Kariek. Their objective is to capture a Warlord alive. The planet was traditionally the scene of endless violence due to disagreements among the many tribes of the native Eickarie race. However, since the Warlord arrived with his troops fifty years earlier, he had held all the power. As the 501st arrives, the Eickaries have forged an alliance, and the Warlord appears to be trapped in his fortress.A unit of the 501st is captured by the Eickaries and presented with an offer to join forces, release a number of political prisoners, and then grab the Warlord. The question is can the Eickaries be trusted or will the 501st be making a fool's bargain.It's a good story with lots of twist and turns. Mr. Zahn comes through once again. I enjoyed reading about stormtroopers named Twister, Shadow, Cloud, and Watchmen as the 501st tried to fulfill its mission."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I recommend you read all of Zahn's Star Wars books up to this point before picking this book up. As well as Outbound Flight answered several lingering question left over from the Heir to the Empire series, Survivor's Quest does a better job of tying everything together and possibly a solid lead up to the New Jedi Order series, which I haven't read yet and Zahn, as well as several others, disapprove of. But the line 'This was the New Jedi Order...' at the end has me hopeful as I'm about to start reading Vector Prime. Either way, if you are a fan of the Chiss, Mara or even just Luke this is an excellent read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I have yet to be disappointed by any of his books. Although some are not as spectacular as The Hand Of Thrawn series, overall he is an incredible author. I did not realize how much so, until I read some recommended books by some other Star Wars universe authors. Interesting book that follows Mara and Luke, two characters that are always entertaining."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Others have commented on the story, so I will simply state that this is a great book that further develops the characters introduced in the prior Zahn Star Wars stories. I loved it. And some of the questions this leaves unanswered are addressed in Outbound Flight. Read both, but read this first as this was written first and you will appreciate Luke and Mara's mindset better in Survivor's Quest if you are also learning as they are."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This book is more than amazing. As can always be expected from Timothy Zahn, this is an wonderful Expanded Universe novel. If you don't own this book get it now! I have read 50+ Star Wars novels and this one remains my very favorite! It acts as a sequel to Outbound Flight although the two happen over thirty years apart. It follows Luke Skywalker and his wife Mara Jade Skywalker on their search for the remains of the lost Outbound Flight project. The book takes many unexpected turns and will keep you guessing. I would recommend reading Outbound Flight (Timothy Zahn) before this to make for a great duo."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"but not for every fan it seems. If you're expecting a Star Wars story to focus on the original characters from the movies, you might be disappointed. Luke is the only one in this book. But since I like the way Zahn writes Luke & Mara, I didn't really miss Han, Leia, Chewie, Lando, or the droids that much.The story starts off a little slow at first, but that's ok: it is a mystery after all (that happens to take place in the Star Wars universe). It's hard to gather clues at a 108 mph.At least one of the jedi solutions was kind of silly, but not enough to kill the story. It does bug me that he doesn't seem to want a certain character of his to stay dead. Either bring him back or forget him.So overall, a very enjoyable read. I would recommend it to Luke & Mara fans."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest is my favorite Star Wars book. Mara Jade Skywalker is my favorite SW character, so a book that focuses largely on her was an incredible read. This book adds a depth to her character, since it begins to deal with her history with the Empire. Since Zahn created her character, she is well written in this book, with the hard edge and somewhat sarcastic nature that is often lost in other books.The other thing I liked about this book is that it's the only time we get to see Luke and Mara working together in the early part of their marriage before the Vong invasion. The book isn't outright romantic, but Luke's devotion to Mara as she works through her issues shows a side of their relationship that isn't seen in the New Jedi Order (especially since the focus on Mara throughout the first few books centers on her disease).The book takes place between Zahn's Hand of Thrawn Dulogy and the New Jedi Order. This put some limits on the book that Zahn handled very well in my opinion. A few things to note about the book:1.) If you don't like Luke and Mara, you probably won't like this book. They are the stars of the story; Han, Leia, Lando, and many of the other characters are not involved in this story.2.) Read Vision of the Future before Survivor's Quest. This will indroduce you to Luke and Mara's previous experiences with the Chiss, as well as some of the characters that are mentioned but not fully featured in the book.3.) This book does read like a \\"who done it?\\" mystery novel set in the Star Wars universe. This slightly annoyed me, as it might annoy anyone who isn't a mystery novel fan. Luke, Mara, and others spend pages analyzing who was responsible for what, only to be surprised at the end of the book. In my opinion, this is the major weakness of the book. In all that analysis and inaction, it gets monotonous and slow.4.) This book is not a prequel to the New Jedi Order, it is a sequel to Vision of the Future.I loved this book. I hope you enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I consider Tim Zahn's work to be of the highest caliber yet seen in Star Wars outside of the Original Trilogy. Yoda: Dark Rendezvous might be the only thing to come really close, though Allston's work and Republic Commando: Hard Contact were also superb. The Chiss characters were excellent, the secret of the Vagaari came as a total surprise to me, the new alien creatures and the Vagaari managed to pose a threat to our heroes without being made into the clich&eacute; that they would \\"threaten the fate of the galaxy\\" or anything so grand (maybe damage the Chiss Ascendancy, but not the kriffin galaxy).Unfortunately, Zahn seems to have developed a tendency to want to write his own story without being hampered or having his character development be reversed (first seen in Mara's lecture of Luke's off-kilter, high-and-mighty behavior in the stories set between The Last Command and Specter of the Past in Zahn's Vision of the Future). This is highly evident in his invention of Chak Fel, who is one of the trickiest retcon jobs in recent EU because of the fact that the makeup of the Fel family has already been established, and also in Zahn's Nine Families format of the Chiss Ascendancy, which is really nothing like how the Chiss government was established in the Force Heretic trilogy. Again, it's a very tricky retcon.The droideka scene was entertaining, but the statement that no Jedi had been able to kill a droideka during the Clone Wars in a one-on-one engagement is obviously ludicrous. They're Jedi, fighting against dumb preprogrammed droids. Energy shields and rolling abilities or no, if a clone trooper can kill one, so can a Jedi. I still don't understand why they couldn't have dropped the ceiling down on it, or used the Force to throw it into a wall, or jam its cannons (like Luke did a few times in Dark Empire and its kin), or hold it in place and come from behind to slash it.Outbound Flight's format was unexpected. I had been under the impression that it was a small colony ship similar to the Chu'unthor crewed only by a handful of Jedi, but it was actually six Dreadnaughts and a central core chassis that functioned as a miniature city led by the Jedi Masters originally mentioned as being aboard. I'm anxious to sink my teeth into Outbound Flight (the book), which is coming out this year.On another note, Zahn's tendency to really pretty much refuse to use any character in his books that he didn't come up with originally (aside from the movie characters, obviously) and to use his characters way more than is necessary is annoying, especially when one of his characters is consistently portrayed as being superior to a film character. Aside from Corran Horn and Baron Fel, who his friend Mike Stackpole created, Zahn really hasn't used other characters a whole lot at all.This was an enjoyable book, but the aforementioned problems and a difficulty picturing the environments where the characters were brought it down to 4 stars, which puts it at about even with Republic Commando: Hard Contact."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Proving once again why Del Rey is winning the war for pulp fiction litter, Survivor's Quest is a stunning performance of outstanding mediocrity.Commencing with the clich&eacute; Impstar opening for no reason other than to mimic decades-old movies, did seeing Karrde or Terrik's only appearance splash nostalgia on your face?Matters degrade further with yet another hundredth cantina scene, showcasing nothing more than Mara's personality and combat skills we already know. Mature readers starved for proper stories will ask what point it was. Seasoned readers will spot the pattern of the droideka; events in the beginning full circle back at the end. Dark Tide did this too. Predictable. It therefore came as no surprise the droideka came back in the end.By midbook you're realising two frogs in the ointment: pure boredom, and not interesting. 2/3rds is actionless chapter after another, heavily conjectural and conversational. You persevere because money was spent, and Exchange work is a one-way deal, hoping the goods pay before Davik Kang comes collecting.But it just doesn't, as Sauron's Mouth would accent better. Suddenly you have a third left, and intrigue is forgotten in a sudden blaze of silly action scenes as Zahn suddenly unleashes the feeble wizards on aliens whose written format perfectly matches the Conquerors' trilogy Mrachani.Now, this works two ways. Ugnaught cubs who delight in Jedi sabering the pizza without that irritating pacifist philosophy, dig in boys. The Skywalkers ram-bam brute over brawn. On a Worrt's other leg, they're gunning for you but you need some moralist reflection if violence returned is the only way. Those frustrated with all the Clone War / NJO dithering philosophy, this is a rare exception.Oh, Zahn tries to intrigue, but after the action fades you never get the explanations owed. Only why the Chiss withheld the feeble wizards' Force performance, and what Chak and the boys were doing with that piece of equipment, and if those revelations dazzled you then I'm Revan's mum.What exactly were you expecting Outbound Flight was, magical fantasyland of exotic maiden-infested castles? It's a spaceship. They have limited rooms and passageways. Seeing Dreadnought corridors and cargo bays was awesome, wasn't it?You saw no Outbound habitation levels, or the colonists' harsh environment they had to adapt to. What you saw was ship corridors, fellas, yay!Known for enticing excitement out of simple events (Thrawn/Conquerors/Icarus Hunt), Zahn failed to excite at all. In the first half, when excitement was sparser than genuine Dalek fear, you have these ridiculous action \\"moments\\" he tries to make exciting. The rush of a cable swinging at Luke, Mara monkey-climbing. Pah, might as well kiss Gregor Clegane.How does seeing an Imperial dominion invoke a sudden rush of career options? You know Mara won't side with the Empire of the Hand. Del Rey knows it. Humphrey B bear knows it, but he's mum on the subject. Her sudden Nostalgic Attack that was barely touched on is as empty of sincerity as Errant Venture's \\"blushing.\\"Del Rey's strict formatting demands Luke formally address Threepio as C-3PO each time. Empire of the Hand is a bit long to say each time. If I didn't want a serious read, I'd read Terry Brooks' blatant LOTR plagiarism. Standard Zahnism prose means there's fixed format to speak, think, reflect, and express emotions. It's rigid.Zahn's subtle anti-female sentiments all but screamed in this book. 3 times Mara is told \\"Silence, female!\\" A third, Luke is asked if his female always does his fighting for him. And don't tell me it's the alien's way of talking. Who types the books? The Conquerors' trilogy was rife with this bias. Even his special stormtrooper unit has a male alien, instead of a female.Since when are Impy stormtrooper composite armour near-blaster-proof? Why did Chak Fel exhibit little page charisma, and is Bullyak the new sow on the block?You have 4 key parties: Jedi, Imps, Bluey and Geroon. You know the Jedi aren't villains; the Chiss cheeks were written too well, the Chak chaps too bland. Which leaves the hapless Geroons. If the shoulder shot scene didn't give it away, you could see this group just HAPPENED to join the ride, with NO major role in the expedition.Experienced Zahn readers (Icarus Hunt) will pick up his trick of revealing the truth amidst endless pages of tedious speculation and conjecture. Was it nostalgic to see Luke briefly flying a civilian Delta-12? It could've been a Holden Commodore sedan for all you cared. Whether Car'das's sole mention gets back-developed in the Outbound Flight book, it was boasting with irrelevance here. Feeble Jedi fighting made the wolvkils overrated.Ragnos' holy breath, how could you say clawcraft, when that was Jaina's slang for it in Ruin, a fighter they only see 3yrs later? A chance to show one \\"serious threat\\" from the Unknown Regions is wasted on the Vagaarians, whose scheming is offset by their Medieval weaponry. This is a bridge book suddenly filled with Trade Federation references and battle droids.His Blueness Thrawn III's possibly being alive is fouled by two gastronomic winds: it's only Mara's speculation; and her opinion it was all a \\"masterplan.\\" Gathering those parties wasn't a work of geinus in any Clawdite shape, and what forthcoming book will we see this potential Thrawn?It took two fully armed \\"Jedi\\" a full dozen pages to eliminate a single droideka, for the sake of showing drama, not to kill it too quickly.This was Survivor's Quest. A generic bridge book of wasted potential, transparent intrigue and feeble emotional characterisation."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"For those of you who actually know what good writing is, this is the book for you. But if you're an arrogant, pompouse and impatient (not to mention ignorant) reader, then I guess you can start with the Harry Potter series, a fifth grade read. Timothy Zahn, or TZ as some say, must have thought that his readers could handle a plot more complicated then the Clifford the Big Red Dog.So if you like to be intrigued, and if you enjoy suspense and mystery, then you'll love this book.P.S. To answer the questions of some reviewers, \\"TZ\\" is leading into a sequel. Its not difficult to catch"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Intrigueing one off star wars book. Its great to read this one and then go read outbound flight, a prequel of sorts. Zahn is rarely better in these books."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I never thought I would see a Star Wars book with him as an author that was not absolutly wonderful. This book is not his best. Not really his fault he still writes well and can still tell a good story but the serise in general is trying to make sense of itself.There will never never be a single Star Wars book ever agian that can touch the anticipation with which I awaited every installment of the New Jedi Order and that is what kills this book.You cannot succesfully have a book that follows on the heels of Galactic Civil War not Zahn's fault it just can't be done.Overall-Not bad, its just that I never thought I would see a star wars book that resorted to the old &quot;A bunch of crazy suvivors trapped on a spaceship ploy. It just doesn't work anymore and no self repecting Star Wars author should have to settle for it. It was however refreashing to watch Luke and Mara get together for some old fashion butt kicking. If that is why you buy a Star Wars book, go for it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I'm glad that &quot;Survivor's Quest&quot; was a library read. I was a big fan of Zahn's earlier Star Wars works, and was excited to see his name on the cover. Overall, it was an entertaining read but nothing to get excited about. Luke and Mara go on a cookie-cutter romp: A-&gt;B (fight, escape, solve puzzle); B-&gt;C (repeat). There are some cool elements, and a few revelations, but it's not up to the level of his earlier trilogy (hence my stingy 3 stars). It's definitely worth a rental, and is still superior to the latest movies (like that's saying much). I'm sure the die hard fans will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"As I stated in my subject header, &quot;Survivor's Quest&quot; is another success for Tim Zahn, giving him a total of six fantastic Star Wars books.Th story concerns only two major Star Wars characters, Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade, now enjoying married life. After a diplomatic request from a mysterious race, the two set off to aid an expedition to recover the Outbound Flight project, which was a mission launched during the time of the Old Republic. The importance of this is that the ship would contain a plethora of records from that period, particularly records concerning the Old Jedi Order that Luke knows so little about.I won't go into any more plot details, but suffice to say, it is a very intruiging and exciting story, with plenty of action, and it ties into the prequel series very well, with some nice touches (the Jedi starfighter, and the droideka) to relate it back to that era.That being said, I was disappointed by some parts of the book.While Luke and Mara are interesitng characters (always have been) many of the others are not. The other major character is a man called Jinzler, a man with a family connection to one of the Jedi who left with Outbound Flight. Jinzler came from nowhere (in terms of the overall series) and I didn't really find him all that interesting. I think that this story may have worked better if it involved one of the other major characters from Star Wars.I was also disappointed not to read anything more about Jorus C'Boath, who was one of the principal antagonists in the original Zahn trilogy.The outcome of the mission doesn't reveal anything startling to Luke about the old Jedi, but the door has been left open for him to learn about it later on. I suspect that, after EpIII comes out and all the major plot points are tied up, Zahn may write a follow story to this one, perhaps revealing a little more to Luke about the old Jedi. But that's all speculation.In my opinion, this is one of the best Star Wars books to come out in recent years, much better than that awful, bloodthirsty NJO series.I recommend this book to all Star Wars fans, whether casual or serious."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"... thats what I thought for the first 2/3 of it. An interesting new take - a mystery to be solved, a whodunnit. Once the whodunnit is revealed and the serious action kicks in, it does make for the normal exciting tale. However, I'm dissappointed in the finish. To many loose ends that didn't get resolved but should have. Needless to say... spoiler follows....... so why did that final robot have to be destroyed in such a destructive way to obliterate the artifact that was of such value? Was it necessary? What about the data on Outbound that the Skywalkers were so much after... why did they not try and get anything out of the ships systems at all? Just picked up a couple of artifacts and thats it... and speaking of artifacts... why no further work on the Chiss weapon found with the lightsabre? And why not speak to the original passengers and find out what did happen and why they are so against anything Jedi? What is the point of developing all such elements in a story if you discard them once the story focuses on the singleminded action thread after the enemy is revealed. Too many books end that way - with a great buildup but a too fast and too simple and incomplete finish. But for the originality of the plot, I can give it some points back. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This has to be one of the worst books ever written for the Star Wars Expanded Universe.

Well-contructed plot and well-planned storyline although there are some minor typo errors here and there.Mr. Zahn is undoubtly the best Star Wars novelist in the new millennium. His stories are extremely engaging and when it comes to suspense and conspiracy theories within the Star Wars universe, you can never go wrong with a Timothy Zahn Star Wars novel.Mara Jade is one of the most colourful characters ever created in the Star Wars universe, and I'm glad Mr. Zahn created her.Can't wait to get my hands on 'Outbound Flight', the prequel to Survivor's Quest. Mr. Zahn, please don't stop writing Star Wars, your fans can't get enough of your works. Hope to read more of your Star Wars novels in the near future."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Fifty years have passed since 'Outbound Flight', dreadnoughts extraordinaire, were destroyed by warlord Thrawn. Luke and Mara are assigned to travel with the Chiss, Geroons, representative Dean Jinzler, and a cast of others, to the remains of the Outbound, which the Chiss have offered to return to the New Republic. There are hairy happenings on the arrival of the Skywalker duo at point destination one... a cable falls towards Luke... accident or not? There are suspicious explosions, disappearance of valuable documents, and the appearance of stormtroopers, believed to be extinct.... 'Outbound' findings on the planet Nirauan are not an empty vessel, there are survivors... some are Jedi Knights, who have been kept in seclusion. One alien group is in disguise... the ruthless Vagaari! In SURVIVORS QUEST, there are magnificent action sequences, including Mara and Luke battling a droideka, brought to you by Timothy Zahn, one of the best in STAR WARS' writings. Zahn expertly and seamlessly blends dialog, character representation, and definite action sequences. And Zahn is not short on humor --\\"How come it's so dark\\" asks Luke. \\"Probably because there aren't any lights,\\" Mara replies!I highly recommend SURVIVORS QUEST as a not-to-be-missed read."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"So maybe this wasn't Zahn's best effort. I'd still say it is far better than any other author's Star Wars books out there.Zahn has, since the dulogy, been trying to explain the history of Thrawn. This book reveals some parts of the story, those dealing with the ancient Outbount Flight mission, which Thrawn destroyed. His people, the Chiss, have found its remains, and to help apologise for the attack (which Chiss society deplores), they invite Luke and Mara to join the expedition to recover it. Of course, not all goes well...The biggest problem in this book is that not enough is revealed. You get a reasonably good idea as to what happened to the mission, but a few critical points are missing. At the end, we don't know one CRITICAL fact, that plays a major part in the novel. To reveal what it is would spoil the novel.However, this should be rectified in Zahn's upcoming Outbound Flight book, so I'm not too worried. Knowing that, I'm willing to take the suspense.Other than that, however, the novel is awesome. The intrigue and suspense are great, and the storytelling is fantastic. The action sequences are up to Zahn's normal standard. They're very exciting and intelligent, with plenty of clever moments and surprises. There are some great \\"escape\\" sequences. It may take a little too long to get started, but once it does, you can't put it down.People hold Zahn to a high standard (for good reason), and therefore, they may be disappointed at the few holes that pop up in the book. Some may also dislike how none of the lead characters other than Mara and Luke appear. However, despite these shortcomings, I think this is easily one of the best novels in the entire Star Wars bookseries (far better than the New Jedi Order novels). Any Star Wars fan should read it. If nothing else, it's a refreshing taste of Zahn's style, after all that New Jedi Order stuff."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"3.5 stars.The first third of the book drags badly, it was a chore to read and reads as if it was a chore to write. We then get to the point and Zahn cranks the pace up to the frenetic level of the original movie.We get to see a dysfunctial survivor civilization, which is interesting enough. However we find out next to nothing about them. They hate Jedis, and feel that Jedis betrayed them, why? Why are a Jedi and a Chiss on the bridge of a dreadnought, if they were working together against the Vagaari why do the survivors, and the Chiss, feel that Thrawn destroyed them. Is Zahn just setting us up for another book? That isn't quite proper.The bright points are very well written action scenes where the Jedi go after the Vagaari and Luke gets to really shine. Also the electronics tech/Ambassador character was fairly well done and developed. In a nod to Heinlein's Double Star for a time he finds himself actually being a real ambassador despite being a fake.Work your way through the first third of the book quickly and you'll probably enjoy this one once you reach the meat of the story."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's quest takes place about 3 years after the Thrawn duology, which unfortunately was Zahn's worst work to date. Still, knowing the excellent Thrawn trilogy (which started ALL the flow of new Star Wars books), I decided to give this novel a chance.I'm no native English speaker, but I read this book in just 2 days, because it was extremely thrilling, high-paced and action packed. The fact that Mara + Luke joined forces with Stormtroopers of the \\"Empire of the Hand\\" and the blue skinned Chiss made it even more interesting to me, as these are organizations you want to learn more of.Another plus in Survivors Quest is that it focusses mostly on Mara+Luke and the Stormtrooper squad - so you're not constantly switching between 8 different side stories (as in the Thrawn duology), but always stay in the center of the plot.There are some minor flaws (like Luke n Mara allowing an imposter to join them or the troopers seeming a bit too unvulnerable; or who are the trapped Jedi?), but that doesn't really change the overall quality of this book.In short - a great, entertaining read, not only for die-hard SW fans.Hint: read the short story \\"Fools bargain\\" at the end of the book first to get a better look on the stormtrooper squad.I seriously hope Zahn will let us know more about The Empire Of The Hand and the Chiss soon. And please - no return of a cloned Thrawn, as indicated slightly on the end of the book. \\"Dark Empire\\" was bad enough ;)"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest, by long-time Star Wars author Timothy Zahn, was an intriguing - if quick - read. This story, like Zahn's other Star Wars novels, has a mystery plot line and focuses on several groups of characters.Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker receive an invitation from the alien Chiss official Aristocra Formbi, asking if they would like to come and see the remains of the Outbound Flight - a group of six connected ships that had been on an outer-galactic space mission fifty years ago. Grand Admiral Thrawn had supposedly destroyed the ships before they left the galaxy. Before their supposed demise they had housed several Jedi as well as many scientists and their families. Luke is excited to discover that the ships have been found partially intact, and so he and Mara accept the Chiss' proposal and head to the Chiss ship that will take them to the wreck. There they discover that three other groups are planning to accompany them: Commander Fel - Baron Fel's son - and four stormtroopers from the Empire of the Hand; New Republic ambassador Jinzler, whom Luke and Mara know to be a imposter; and also a group of aliens know as the Geroons, whose purpose there is not certain. Mysteries quickly appear as a Geroon is shot and someone sabotages the Chiss' and Geroon's ships - leading Luke and Mara to discuss in great length whom they think is the culprit. When finally all groups arrive at Outbound Flight, they discover that people have survived there for fifty years, and are bringing up children and grandchildren aboard the remains. All the characters now get separated and we follow the adventures of a different party each chapter. The mystery deepens, and we get to see how each group unravels the riddle, which has a surprising twist near the end.This book is primarily a mystery story, and in being so deviates from the \\"traditional\\" Star Wars action/adventure book. Zahn's other Star Wars books certainly have an element of mystery to them, but in this book it is the principal genre. Although it is fun to watch as Luke and Mara try to solve the puzzle, their dialogue does gets boring and somewhat \\"speechy\\" at times.Old-time Zahn fans, who have followed Luke and Mara from Heir to the Empire to Vision of the Future, probably won't have a problem coping with the new array of characters that Zahn invents; however, newcomers reading this book on its own might have a more difficult time. Luke is the only character from the movies who appears, and he is much older and more mature than he was at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" Although he recently married Mara Jade, she has been well known in previous Star Wars books. The rest of the characters, though, are new and completely different. Although Zahn does a nice job at developing these new characters, I think even old Star Wars fans would like to see a little of Han, Leia, C-3PO, and other old characters. Even Luke's constant companion R2-D2 is not there, which I found very surprising.One inconsistency that I found was that one of the stormtroopers of the Empire of the Hand was an alien. I know that the Empire of the Hand was much different from the empire under Palpatine, but I still don't think that an alien would be allowed in Vader's former legion. Also, the stormtroopers seemed to be almost invincible. Maybe it was just because they were of the famed 501st legion, but in the movies the troopers were getting mowed down right and left. I thought that only four of them winning every battle against innumerable enemies seemed like a stretch.There were also a couple of things left unresolved at the end of the book. One of the crucial points of the plot line was that the survivors of Outbound Flight have a strange animosity toward Jedi - but throughout the whole book the reason for this was never explained. I am hoping that Zahn's latest novel, Outbound Flight, will elucidate this further. Also, it is hinted several times that Aristocra Formbi is a relation to Grand Admiral Thrawn, but this point is also never followed up, leaving you slightly mystified.Survivor's Quest was overall a fast, exciting, enjoyable read. Because it is a newer book Zahn does a good job tying the newly revealed events of the Clone Wars to later events, especially through talk of the Old Republic Jedi and Luke and Mara's humorous attempts to sneak past the old droideka. This story lacks the powerful depth that many of the other new Star Wars books (especially most of the ones in the New Jedi Order series) have. However, this lack of intensity does not change the fact that this is a gripping mystery/adventure tale written by a skilled writer. This novel is not Zahn's best, but he still delivers his own unique style that many Star Wars fans have come to love. I give this book four out of five stars - anyone looking for a good, well-written mystery story that does not require much deep thought would like this. Even though some Star Wars enthusiasts might be disappointed, I think most will be pleased with this new addition the to Star Wars universe."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read the Hand of Thrawn duology right before this and with those events still fresh in mind it made this book that much better. It seems that when Zahn writes a Star Wars novel he is used to foreshadow coming novels. This one looks to be no different. I've yet to read The Joiner King, but it seems to be hinting toward it. The one thing is that I wish Zahn would not write a book that has to do with Thrawn however cool a character he is. Ofcourse his next book is Outbound Flight which deals with him also. Maybe someday. Any way this is a very good book that any fan should read."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Hi,Unlike Zahn's previous books, which were were trilogies or duologies, this is a standalone book and the pacing of the book reflects that. It moves along from point to point much faster than I expected. This helped to keep my interest up and I read the book in less than a week. The most interesting parts of the book were Mara/Luke and the stormtrooper group that was heavily featured in the book.However, it appears Zahn used the Outbound Flight project as simply a tool to advance a story rather than explaining what the project was about. There was some small insight into the Outbound Flight project, but no big revelations. We never hear from the survivors talk about what happened during the attack on the project. We find out a little bit on the survivor's feelings about the Jedi but all in all, very little was revealed about the history and the background of the project.However, the book is still rather good and worth a read for any Star Wars fan. I'm sure some are not sure if the book is worth the price, you can get it from the library or perhaps wait until they put into paperback format. :)"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Even though this came out before Outbound Flight I did not read it until after reading Outbound Flight. Outbound Flight was such a good book, full of back story and insight, that I felt a let down when reading Survivor's Quest. It did not have the same feel to it. I still liked it as a story, it just did not grab me in like Outboud Flight did."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"\\"Survivor's Quest\\" is a little different from other Star Wars books I've read by Timothy Zahn. Whereas the Thrawn Trilogy and The Hand of Thrawn duology occur on many different battle fronts, this story focuses almost exclusively on Luke and Mara. Han, Leia and Lando are nowhere to be seen. For Luke and Mara fans, there is as much of them in the story as is possible for any author to cram in. They're married now and their relationship is maturing. We get to see now why they are the perfect match. Amidst all the battle scenes, the love and care they have for one another shine through. No mush. This is love, Star Wars style. I hope Zahn writes more books like these. Only he can write them so well -- beautiful."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"After waiting two months since its release, I finally had a chance to read this book. This is one of the most intriguing Star wars novels I've ever read. The suspicious troublemaker was not at all who I thought it was. originally, I though it might be Dean Jinzler (a very cool new character) or, later on in the book, Chak Fel (representative of what the Empire might have been had Palpatine not been in charge). Loved the fight scene with the droideka-an excellent display of Luke &amp; Mara teamwork. The Vagaari have a lot of potential as future bad-guys for Denning's upcoming post-NJO trilogy. I found it interesting that some of their weapons, like the conduit worms, are living things like those of the Yuuzhan Vong. My one complaint: although it is billed as a stand-alone, SQ feels more like the first half of a duology (the other half being his upcoming Outbound flight Project novel). Keep up the good work, Tim!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This book is a great book. If you ever read the Thrawn trilogy you know about something called the outbound flight. This is three years after Luke and Mara'a wedding so it's been 50 years! Luke and Mara are accepting the chiss's invitation and with stormtrooper squad 501 they find survivors aboard outbound flight."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This book was an amazing read. For any Mara Jade fans out there I would definately recommend you picking this book up. Being she is Timothy Zahn's character no one else writes her better. He stays true to her sarcastic nature but shows us into her core as a new and loving wife. The ocassional \\"Skywalker\\" still slips out of her mouth as she gets irritated at Luke. Gotta love it! Some parts of the book drag a little bit but the second half of the novel runs rapid in that \\"I just have to read one more-no two more-chapters\\" kind of pace. It is a very character motivated novel and insightful into the love and marriage between the Skywalkers. It is a must read to bridge the loooong gap between The Hand of Thrawn and the NJO. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"If you're a fan of the Star Wars novels that took place before the New Jedi Order series, particularly those stand-alone novels where Luke, Han, Leia and the gang would split up, face mortal peril, reunite, triumph resoundingly over the forces of evil, and never ever disturb the status quo, then you're going to love Survivor's Quest. If, however, you preferred series like the Jedi Academy Trilogy, the New Jedi Order, and yes Timothy Zahn's original Thrawn trilogy, where major events had actual repercussions in the Star Wars Universe, you may want to skip this inconsequential tale of...well, not much really.Basically, the Chiss (Grand Admiral Thrawn's people) discover the remains of Outbound Flight, a Jedi-led expedition into the Unknown Regions, and ask Luke Skywalker and his new bride Mara Jade to come take it off their hands. A band of Stormtroopers (no wait, they're good guys!) and some kindly aliens come along for various reasons, but the aliens turn out to be not so kindly after all, causing a conflict that is resolved (of course) by Luke and Mara. At the end, everyone goes their separate ways like the whole thing never happened.Of course I'm oversimplifying, but not much. This novel didn't serve any purpose at all in the greater scheme of things, much like all of those throwaway Star Wars books from the mid 1990's. I took a chance on it based solely on the fact that it was a Timothy Zahn book, but this is far from his best work. It was a struggle to read this one through to its predictable conclusion.If you loved those self-contained Star Wars novels from the 90's and are still fuming that they took out Chewbacca in the New Jedi Order's first book (you know who you are), then by all means pick up Survivor's Quest. If you prefer saga's like the New Jedi Order where things actually happen and the good guys don't always ride off into the sunset, you'll want to skip this one."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This is a review of the 5 CD, 6 hour Audio Book. The story takes place after Vision of the Future, after the comic where they marry, UNION and before the New Jedi Order NJO period.This book is such a joy that I have already listened to it twice. It stars Luke and Mara as a wise cracking team in search of the Outbound Flight which disappeared 50 years ago with 50,000 people. I was reminded of Nick and Nora of the old Thin Man movies from the 40's, except with light sabers because of the way the characters confronted their mystery with humor and brilliant dialog.Outbound flight was a Jedi lead group of Dreadnaughts that were to explore another galaxy, but disappeared. The story was originally told in the first Zahn trilogy, with Grand Admiral Thrawn finding and using the workable remnants of that fleet to attack the New Republic.In this story the Chiss have located what was left of the expedition and want to return those remnants to the new republic. An expedition is put together that includes the Chiss, another race who is apparently grateful to the Jedi and Outbound Flight, a New Republic ambassador Luke and Mara.This is Luke and Mara the way they should have been portrayed in the NJO. In NJO they were often included in stories, but written in a manner to keep them out of the way of the main plot. I suspect together, they are too formidable a team, and in NJO the writers were told to minimize them to keep them from solving the problems too easily. In NJO Luke was often written as if he was the half idiot son of a crazed monster, and Mara was given a disease to keep her half incapacitated. But here, they are the devastatingly powerful team we would imagine them to be.As good as the story is, it has a flaws and unanswered questions. Why would the remnants of a Jedi recruited and lead expedition revolt kill and imprison Jedi? Why would the Chiss permit inclusion of enemies into their expedition? Luke's final solution was confusing; I had to go over it a few times to understand it.Those minor questions aside this is a most welcome addition to my SW library. The CD production is superior. I am very pleased with the longer audio book versions now being made. The older SW audio books were usually 2.5 to 3 hours max.Some have criticized this book as targeting teen audiences. I would saw NJO targeted young teens. This book is a throwback to what got me hooked on the expanded universe. Lets hope we get more of these types of books and less of the type that make Luke a fumbling lost fool. Lets have more of L&amp;M together."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This Book is very easy to Read even for those casual readers, like myself, who dont even like reading all that much. I read this 368 Page book in less than 2 Days i just simply Couldnt put it down and i really felt a connection with the Characters especially Jinzler (later on in the book anyway), Mara (who is my favorite Character), and Luke. Couple scenes even had me laugh which i was surprised about for a book.

The couple is soon asked to accompany former enemies on a mission to salvage a piece of Jedi history. Along the way they will meet a self-appointed ambassador (for the New Republic), a peaceful race of aliens that worship the Jedi, and a race of aliens into which Thawn (Empire's greatest taction) was born. Along the way the two Jedi will meet deception, sabotage, and secrecy. Luke and Mara are soon fighting for their lives against an alien race that are legendary for their brutality and ruthlessness. To survive the two Jedi must team up with old enemies, stormtroopers.ResponseOver all I think STAR WARS, Survivors Quest is an excellent book, its right up there with the original series. It immediately grabs your attention and holds it till the end of the book. It leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter. If I could rate this book on a scale from one to ten (ten being the highest) I would rate it a ten. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the original STAR WARS series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"A awesome book by Zahn. Best writer of star wars ever. Umm I made it a 5 because its with only Luke and Mare, my two favorite characters, and its a mystery too. 10th grade reading level"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"A lot of Star Wars novels have become extremely formulaic to me over the past few years, and I've missed terribly the days when there are really GOOD stories out there, not just spacefaring jargon.Survivor's Quest is one of those! It keeps truly to the spirit of Star Wars and the characters are all given distinct personalities. At the end of the story, you just can't help but wish that all these great new characters will continue to appear in the \\"new\\" storylines, which are sadly lacking in charismatic characters."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest is a fine Star Wars adventure and makes a fine addition to the Star Wars expanded universe, which is now much improved since Del Rey have been given the contract for producing the Star Wars novels.Survivor's Quest has a mystery filled plot starring the newly married Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker. It contains a number of good and interesting twists aswell as plenty of Jedi action. Star Wars books are best when the writer and the reader approach it for what it is good entertainment. So if you want a Star Wars adventure that will keep you entertained over a couple of evenings then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Ok, I'll start with the good. Overall, I really enjoyed the book due to the action, intrigue, and the fact I'm a Star Wars fan. I thought the characters were done really well (although I did miss Han, Leia, and the droids), the action was great, the appearances of the droidekas were pretty cool (even though I don't remember the Jedi unable to beat them in the past), and the story did flow reasonably well in my opinion.However, there were 2 things that bothered me. The first was just simply the reason for the bad dudes to pull this off, really, for that reason only??? This whole extravagant plot into this dangerous area only for this (and how did they know about it)? NOW the big problem!!! Why even bother having this be about Outbound Flight(OF)??? Why not just go meet the Chiss somewhere else in the galaxy? The whole concept of OF was wasted in this book. You learn nothing about it!!! So, all the questions that you already had and all the questions that are raised in this book are all left unanswered!!SO, what does that tell me?? Especially now since I see that Outbound Flight the book was written just 3 yrs later. Survivor's Quest was written basically for one reason, to get you to spend more money to buy Outbound Flight by making you want to know the answers. I understand this is sort of how things are done in the world or business, except, in SW, I would think people are interested mostly in one era of the timeline, either Pre-Quels, Luke, Han, and Leia era, or the NJO series. So, since OF is in the Pre-Quel era, most of those of us who read the New Republic Era with Luke and the others don't care much about the other eras. I don't want to read one book from that era just so I can know about something in this era, and that just annoys me, sorry. So, even though the book was good overall, it left a bad taste in my mouth at the end for that reason which just sort of sucks."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Timothy Zahn hooked me with his original Thrawn Trilogy, but I was ultimatly dissapointed with this outing. I give it 3 instead of 2 stars only because there are some interesting action sequences, and in the end, it is a moderatly fun book.My dissapointment arises because the mystery aspect of the book is so implausible. I enjoyed seeing the mystery set up, and was interested to see a SW novel written with that genre in mind, but either the Jedi have super-human deductive capabilities, or Timothy Zahn doesn't get the idea of drawing logical conclusions. There are several moments when Luke and Mara see a set of clues and draw some wildly implausible conclusion, which then turns out to be correct. There is, therefore, no sense of discovery for the mystery, as the Jedi are drawing conclusions and making deductions that would be impossible for the reader.Zahn's dialogue is also quite bad, as I had difficulty imagining the character actually speaking as they do in this novel. Also, much of the 'married couple' banter was kind of trite and smug. Next, Zahn has this annoying habit of giving names to even the most periphary characters, such that they seem like they'll be important, even though they more times than naught dissappear never to be seen again. And while I like the 501st Stormtroopers squad, I would have preferred more menacing monichers than &quot;Cloud&quot; and &quot;Grappler&quot; and &quot;Watchman&quot;. Finally, the villians' reason for engineering the entire affair is kind of lame. When they're first suspected of trying to discover a route into the Chiss' stronghold, I was sold; but to have them just seeking droid technology was a bit anti-climactic.In the end, I personally prefer the far superior Thrawn Trilogy, or the recent mega-epic New Jedi Order series. I guess I'd rather my Star Wars be more serious and epic instead of just quick popcorn-type fun."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Definitely the 3rd or 4th best SW storyline I have read (#1 - Hand Of Thrawn, #2 - Original Thrawn Trilogy, #3 or 4 - this or Shadow Of The Empire, 5th - Darksaber (Yes, I liked Dark Saber).Zahn (that would make a cool SW character name) does a fantastic job of creating mystery after mystery which is what keeps me in suspense and makes me read more and more even when my eyes scream for sleep.But the revelations to those mysteries were ultimately unfulfilling. Skip to next paragraph to avoid this spoiler: The reason for the aliens who were interested in the Outbound Flight wreckage seemed very uninteresting; who cares about some droids? I wanted something really really cool. That was one of the biggest disappointments. Also, the Imperials' role in all of it was also disappointing; I was hoping for some real twists. And the Chiss themselves, I was hoping for something a little more behind the mystery of their behavior.I did love the fact that the usual cast of characters were not there. Frankly, I am bored by the books that feel the need to include the entire cast of characters from not only the movies but all of the books as well; it is just too much. better to include one or two of the regular cast and a whole slew of new folks.Sometimes the action Zahn is trying to convey does not translate well to the written word.Also, I wish he had set things up for even more books. I do not see that anything was set up for another tale; then again, Zahn is the genius writer, not me. I am sure he has something else up his sleeve.Ultimately it is a good read, a great SW book, I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I have enjoyed several of the Star Wars novels, particularly Tim Zahn's, though I found Thrawn annoyingly uber, a Fu Manchu in space. This is the first time I have gone through the whole thing without irritable jottings in the margins, if not out loud comments that make my family think I am going mad. Characterizations were spot on, the continuing dialogue about whether Jedi should love and marry fully examined and dealt with, and the story had logical progression, being more a space mystery, with maps, characters with unknown agendas, and suspenseful passages when you didn't just think you were being jerked around. Plus, Mara Jade has matured into a great, sexy heroine in her own right without all that overhanging \\"Emperor's Hand\\" schtick. Not that she has forgotten the past. It was also cool to see a squad of Imperial Stormtroopers treated like individuals with capabilities, not just a bunch of cannon fodder. I reordered this one in hardback, it is a real keeper. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This is probably one of the worst Star Wars books printed yet. The story is centered around the vessel \\"Outbound Flight\\", which has been mentioned in several other Star Wars books. In this book, Luke Skywalker finally gets to board the legendary ship. Instead of using this tale to explain more about the ship and unlock Jedi mysteries for Luke, Zahn has used the tale to tell of the growing bonds between Luke and his new bride, Mara Jade.Luke,Mara, and the rest of the all-new character cast get caught up in a highjacking. All of the main characters are duped into allowing themselves to be highjacked. Luke and Mara (when not bonding) come out looking especially inept. Their Jedi abilities are portrayed weakly and they are put in the role of detective which is really weird. Mara's character development really made me not like the character. The other characters, especially the Imperial commander, are also pretty inept fools.I really wanted to see Luke learn more of the secrets of the Jedi that were destroyed by Palpatine. What better way for Luke to find old Jedi artifacts and knowledge? Luke comes away from this adventure no wiser about the Jedi than when the book began.If you want to read a good mystery, find one written about a detective. Don't go into this one thinking that Luke and Mara even have the chops to find their way out of a marked exit door. You'll be bored the whole time you read about each character's next blunder."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Zahn is back! I had to go to 4 bookstores on February 3rd to find a copy of this book, and the reward more than justified the efforts. Zahn writes with his usual clarity and intelligence, creating a book that is saturated with action, mystery, political intrigue, and the eerie elements of a ghost story. Zahn is the master of writing Jedi who are extraordinarily powerful, but whose superhuman abilities have limits and therefore do not overshadow their more impressive minds and characters. This also makes him one of the rare Star Wars writers who can create non-Force-sensitive characters who are as worthwhile and interesting as his Jedi. This sense of balance is also apparent in Zahn's handling of the usually very black-and-white politics of the Star Wars universe--that is to say, as fans already know from his earlier books, his Imperials can be at least as fascinating and sympathetic as the more stock Rebels. In this book, through the intelligent, young Commander Chak Fel (son of the Baron Soontir Fel and older brother to Jaina Solo's later love interest, Jag Fel) and an elite cadre of stormtroopers who are interesting and individualized, Zahn gives his readers a sympathetic view of what the Empire could have been in the hands of a man like Thrawn. But Survivor's Quest isn't just a smart, multifaceted book--it's also a complete page-turner. I read the last 300 pages without any breaks longer than about two minutes, and that's not my normal style. The last book I can remember being this impossible to put down was Matthew Stover's Shatterpoint. In summary, Zahn is back, and Zahn is still God. Survivor's Quest was well worth the large, hardcover price tag, and I'll gladly pay that much again when the sequel comes out. Because there's going to be a sequel, right Lucas Books?"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This was a complete disappointment. I really looked forward to reading another Timothy Zahn Star Wars novel but this was boring, predictable, and had poor character development throughout. The relationship between Luke and Mara was barely explored except with some \\"mystical Jedi nonsense\\". Mr.Zahn's previous efforts for the series were outstanding---what a shame this did not meet his own standard of excellence."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"SQ is Tim Zahns return to the Star Wars Universe left off from his \\"Hand of Thrawn\\" series. I will admit I never could get interested in the NJO series therefore I am completely unaware of events, politics, technology etc therein. However, TZ attempts to pass over those events, some might argue that he deliberately left them out, but he goes on with a Luke/Mara standalone story about Outbound Flight (OF)! An event TZ created during his original Thrawn series and alluded to briefly again in the 2nd Thrawn series.What begins as a promising suspense filled revelation about Clone Wars-era politics tied together with SW supervillian Thrawn, a story of immensity was awaited. Instead, the book falters from too much promise. Key conditions surrounding OF were just dropped or forgotten, such as Thrawn's involvement? This novel presented Thrawn's legacy only as a passive vehicle reference to create a story surrounding what was otherwise a footnote event in SW literature. What was it about OF that made it so nasty? What happened to its JEDI aboard?Unfortunately, either TZ got bored with this idea and instead went with a L/M save-the-day direction, or else the editors got cold feet, perhaps thinking it would spoil all the surprises that Prequel III will reveal.On a few occassions, TZ mentions some events from Prequels 1 & 2.Various plotlines that I really cared about but left me hanging were:-Why did Outbound Flight survive the way it did, if Thrawn, the great tactical genius he was, supposedly destroyed it?-How did OF get to its current location if that location was deep within heavily defended Chiss territory? Further, this novel presented OF's final resting place as being one quite difficult to reach even under the best of circumstances. Somehow I can't imagine very well, how a derelict half destroyed ship drifting into a starcluster planet, and not pulverize itself to nothing when it \\"landed\\".-Why didn't Zahn tell us more about OF itself? This event, although small in the grand scheme of things, was obviously a pivotal event in Old Republic politics. How come we didn't learn more about its mission? Its crew? or its Jedi?-Why did the suriviors hate Jedi? What motivations did they have for banshing those they suspected of beind Jedi? Why did they not want Evlyn to be a Jedi? Furthermore, why did they hate the Republic so much? Surely, politics of the day weren't so terrible that these \\"exiles\\" would never want to return even that The Old Republic is long gone. Did it have to do with OF original mission parameters or something?-Why were the Vaagari so intent on getting hold OF ships themselves? surely there are more modern ships avaialble?-Thrawn still might be alive? Not again.-What about this whole idea Mara had about going back to the Empire's deathbed remains?-Nirauan, this planet was so full of mystery the first time, why couldn't we see more of it?-Formbi? Why do I sense their was more to him, and his subordinates such as Feesa, were let us to believe?-Car'das, why bring him into this story? In the last series, TZ opened this character as one who doesn't just conviently show up. He knows how to hide. Why use him only as a way to tie the poorly used Dean Jinzler with Formbi and the Chiss? Whats his motivation? Where did he go? OF struck me as quite a treasure trove even for the likes of him?-Why is this novel called Survivor's Quest? what 'quest' were the OF crew really trying to acheive. A better title would have been Survivor's Dilemma or something along those lines.All and all, i was dissappointed in this novel, it is better than many I have read, but it just leaves too many more questions than answers/resolutions? Many of these questions were central to the plot early on, but are quickly forgotten. For people who seek the truth, this novel doesn't have it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest is a whodunit full of talking heads. I got so bored halfway through I skipped one hundred pages and still managed to pick up the plot. A judicious editor could have improved things greatly, but probably not well enough to make a great novel. And that is for three reasons.The first is the ridiculous plot contrivances. The novel is built around people keeping secrets from one another, secrets that are supposed to build intrigue and interest but which are often so incredulous that you can't help wonder if you're being insulted. Case in point from very early on in the story: Luke and Mara are heading off to investigate the wreckage of Outbound Flight, the exploratory vessel commissioned by the old Republic to probe the outer reaches of the galaxy. The ship and all 50,000 of its occupants disappeared decades ago, but has been recently discovered by the Chis, who make arrangements to transport representatives of the Empire of the Hand, the New Republic and the Jedi to the crash sight. Along the way, Mara and Luke discover that the New Republic Ambassador is an imposter, but when the pair finally has a chance to question this man alone, they back off when he shows signs of stress at being asked to explain his purpose. It's as if the Luke and Mara don't want to be accused of having bad manners for being insistent. That might be understandable under certain circumstances, but not when dealing with a man engaged in criminal activity against the government you've spent so much of your energy to protect. Instead of exposing this fraud, Luke and Mara allow him to continue the charade of playing Ambassador, a conceit necessitated by Zahn's contrived plot.The second is that there is almost no story to speak of. Once the Chis arrive at Outbound Flight, the Hand, the Jedi and the Chis get split up into three parties that then have to find their way through the ship. You keep waiting for something to happen, but it's just a bunch of talking heads discussing options ad nauseum before deciding to take an elevator, crawl through an access way or otherwise move on to the next section of the ship.The third is that we learn almost nothing about Outbound Flight, about the Jedi that were aboard, about why the survivors now despise the Jedi, or what kind of information was stored in Outbound's computers.In the end, we learn very little about anything and care even less about the rest. About the only entertaining bit was Mara and Luke using the Force to animate two corpses in order to walk them through an ambush. If only those two hand been on hand to animate Timothy Zahn when he wrote this cadaverous novel."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"As a huge Star Wars fan who has read the majority of all the 'adult' novels written by various authors that covered the different time frames within the Star Wars universe, I was somewhat disappointed with Survivor's Quest.What makes it even harder for me to be critical is the fact I think Timothy Zahn has produced some fine material for the Star Wars universe. However, Survivor's Quest felt like it was rushed together just to produce another SW novel, and many of the plot lines were generic Sci-Fi scenarios just cobbled together once again only this time starring Luke and Mara.There were few original thoughts that carried this story through to the end which a reader hasn't seen in various other popular Sci-Fi movies. The main characters come across a convenient and coincidental invitation to help locate a once lost roving colony that may hold secrets and history of the Old Republic. Of course the ship was lost near Chiss territory, so enter the obligatory 'distrustful but need as an ally' alien race to help retrieve the long lost derelict ship. But someone tried to sabotage the flight towards their mission. Now introduce yet another distrustful ally in the form of an elite Stormtrooper squad and you have a triangle of trust/distrust.Upon reaching the colony of 'Outbound Flight', the ship is quiet, almost too quiet so of course there are survivors living aboard who harbor their own secret....a fear of Jedi...and other things they are hiding...clich&eacute;.As one ally reveals their true colors, it's up to Mara and Luke to save the day all by themselves in a very McGyver/James Bond sort of way. And when the main villian escapes, only Luke and Mara who have had no rest and escaped doom a dozen times end up in such a predictable and linear climax you can see it three chapters away.While indeed the story was pretty predictable, the dialogue and retrospective thoughts of both Luke and Mara, their past, and their over-dependence on the Force made my eyes roll. For some reason I just felt that author Zahn just couldn't capture the essence of Luke or Mara in this novel. I couldn't see them doing or saying the things they did, and the ending was so anti-climatic I had this last lingering thought:The book was total filler material. Even if the main plot was pulled off by the villain, what impact would it have on the SW universe overall? Probably none. The way it was explained, or maybe the way I interpreted it, I thought \\"So what? What does any of this do to the New Republic, the Imperial Remnant, the New Jedi Order?\\" I couldn't think of anything."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Luke Skywalker has a wife, also a Jedi Knight, and other alien characters are thrown into this timeless and highly successful space opera series.

Another Great. How was my dissapointment after I read it. Not up to Zahn's usual high standards. What does this novel tell you. Nothing much except contardict a lot of established expanded universe information. The fact that nothing much is revealed is the big killer. All it is, is an excuse to forfill a contract.

As the title of this review states, OUTBOUND FLIGHT DID NOT CRASH ON NIRAUAN.It's just that the text material in the book jacket says that it did. No big deal... I guess some so-called \\"editor\\" has some problems with reading comprehension.From reading one review, it's like the reviewer only read the book jacket, while being compelled to put out a 5-star review. I don't see why anyone who actually read the book would think that Nirauan was the crash site.

Knowing the diplomatic value of accepting this \\"gift\\" and the internal appreciation of leaving no one behind, leaders of the New Republic send the Skywalkers to Niraua, graveyard to over fifty-thousand.Master Jedi Luke Skywalker and Jedi Knight wife Mara Jade discuss technology on the journey as the duo still struggle to adjust to married life with missions seemingly always happening.

Though the simple trip turns dangerous as foes seek the annihilation of the Skywalkers and the destruction of their allies, the biggest mystery resides inside the massive hulk.Aimed at teenage Star war fans, this stand alone thriller is a superb action and adventure tale that spins somewhat like an out in space epic sword and sorcery story. Luke and Mara is a delightful pair though many old-timers will need to adapt to the young Jedi master having a wife (can Jedi kiddies be far behind\\").

I don't care what the cover says, this was scribbled out by an amateur hack in a week. It was unpolished, unbelievable, and a travesty to Zahn's earlier masterpieces. If he really did write this book, it takes Zahn from being the best writer in the Star Wars library, to the absolute worst, surpassing even that team of two guys who wrote that abysmal duology in the middle of the New Jedi Order series.A few unforgivable weird things:-Not once does it mention anything that ocurred during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Not a single mention of a ravaged Coruscant, a Republic in utter administrative chaos, or razed worlds. Admittedly, the entire book takes place far from any of the events of the NJO, but still; this is just very strange.-Although this is supposed to be the first of a new series, the only part that might lead into this is mentioned in the last 5 pages of the book, in a bout of wildly unsubstantiated guesswork by Mara. Several pieces integral to the book's specific plot are left unanswered, but instead of making me want to rush to Amazon to see when the next book will be released, I'm just annoyed.At least he doesn't have any technical errors about technology, etc. He does bring in a reference or two to the prequels, which is slightly annoying, since the vast majority of the Expanded Universe was written before the films were released. For some reason, the sudden mention of Naboo, droidekas, etc. tend to just stick out.Chances are, people will buy this book because of what it is and whose name is on the cover, without reading any of these reviews. I certainly did. But if anyone does bother to dig this deeply, here's my advice: skip this one. If it turns out you absolutely must have the backstory, hunt it down at a library. Certainly don't waste your money on the hardcover edition.Bottom line: poorly written, huge letdown."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"\\"Survivor's Quest\\" marks Zahn's return to familiar territory, that of the relationship between Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker. Zahn does a magnificient job of explaining innuendo that has been building since Outbound Flight was mentioned in \\"Heir to the Empire,\\" and this effort does not disappoint. For those that have shied away from the Star Wars novels the past four years due to the New Jedi Order, this is a wonderful \\"welcome back\\" gift. There are no Vong, just 340 pages of Luke and Mara and a gallery of the usual rogues.While this is a traditional page turner from Zahn, \\"Survivor's Quest\\" is not exactly a brain-twister; assuming you know the formula, it will be quite simple to plot the strategy Zahn employs. The majority of the action occurs towards the latter half, with the beginning doing a significant amount of character and suspense building. Those expecting a novel with the cadre of familiar heroes will be disappointed; this is entirely a Skywalker affair. There is no Chewie, no Leia, no Jedi twins, no Ackbar. In short, this is the ultimate successor to the Thrawn Trilogy and Duology.The plot is straightforward: Outbound flight has been found in Chiss space and the Nine Families have decided to make a gift to the New Republic by allowing the Jedi to reclaim the old husk. The invitation comes from Voss Parck and General Fel and the so-called \\"Empire of the Hand,\\" but is intercepted. And thus begins a chase for answers and hidden saboteurs. A lot happnens on different levels--another Zahn trademark--and it would do to read this in one sitting, possibly with a notebook. No one is who they seem to be, from the Chiss to Commander Fel to Bearsh to Jinzler, but all is revealed in due course by an author skilled in the craft of fiction.While one may know what to expect, the trip is half the fun. This is a most welcome return to grace by the master of Star Wars fiction, and it certainly serves as a welcome precursor to the NJO saga. Yet there are a few flaws; Pressor's casual comment that records of the battle that crippled Outbound Flight were destroyed and the unexplained corpses serve as warning signs, but these will undoubtedly feed into Zahn's upcoming Clone Wars-era novel detailing the exit of Outbound Flight. Similarly, I felt the casual mention of another Thrawn clone (mere supposition tossed out by Luke and Mara at the end) to be somewhat of a stretch, but it is eminently possible given the ever-changing face of the Star Wars literary universe. And the occasional references to droidekas, the Clone Wars, and the Trade Federation seem forced as well, but this does serve to bridge the two eras.\\"Survivor's Quest\\" is for the loyal fan, as it details the politics and internal structure of the Chiss and is centered around a casual reference to an extragalactic ship whose goal was to seek out life beyond the galaxy proper. And I'm certain we can expect a sequel to this as well, possibly tying up some of the NJO loose ends--after all, there's something a little too Vong-esque about the Vaagari.Pick this up. You will not be disappointed. Indeed, it is nothing short of a gift to those of us who appreciate a good story set in the galaxy far, far away."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I love star wars movies and book i really like when they got mara and luke together it is very good!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I love the original Thrawn trilogy and the Hand of Thrawn Duology.

Save yourself the trouble and dont even bother getting it from the library.Even after this I still love the Heir to the Empire 3. If you have not read them yet you really should."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Timothy Zahn has an occasionally irritating Star Wars writing MO in that his novels always tend to focus on the actions of the same characters without really going for a setup which at least one has little connection. Regardless of how an issue might get under some's skin, you've got to admit that he writes extremely well and doesn't stretch his limits(by inserting romantic cheese in the Luke/Mara scenes when he clearly lacks the ability)This particular story is centered on the discovery of \\"Outbound Flight\\", an expedition originally sent during the Clone Wars era to explore and settle the unknown areas of the galaxy before its wreckage by Thrawn(yep,Timmy just can't leave him out), and the subsequent journey to retrieve the remains.Survivor's Quest is a very well-written story. Action's rather limited, with few intense gun battles and the like but the plot proceeds very intelligently, in that there are no odd coincidences or stupid actions by characters that weaken far too many novels I've read. Yet, there's one major twist you're unlikely to spot because the reader is kept in the dark about certain details that one of the main characters suddenly realize later.The cast of characters is wide and varied from the blue-skinned and proud race of Thrawn, the Chiss(anyone who read that one YA series with the \\"Andalites?\\") the pathetic and groveling Geroon, a small group from the Empire of the Hand, and of course, Zahn's ever-popular heroes Luke and Mara, among others. Anyone who enjoys the vast wide world of Star Wars will greatly enjoy reading of the interactions between characters and how they relate to each other. They truly make Star Wars a living, breathing world as opposed to some collection of human/alien cutouts making random flights to discover some pointless artifact...you get the picture, I think.As other reviewers have pointed out, the story's a little short on the hows and whys of Outbound Flight. But I'm sure that all gets resolved in the titualr book, which I plan to read sometime as well."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Survivor's Quest (Star Wars)doesn't quite feel like a Timothy Zahn Star Wars novel. His better books, like the Heir to the Empire series, focused on intricate plots and character development. By contrast,Survivor's Quest (Star Wars)takes a while to build up, and then has a lot of action featuring the Skywalkers. Given that we know Luke and Mara won't die, there's not a whole lot of suspense. By the end, everything seems almost too easy for the Jedi, with Luke and Mara cutting down enemies left and right. Also, the ending leaves a lot of open questions, especially for a sequel.That being saidSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars)does have some bright spots. Some of the secondary characters are great. Dean Jinzler and Evelyn. Also, I like how it hints at the events in the past, but never really reveals the full story. In retrospect, the plot only really makes sense after having readOutbound Flight (Star Wars), even though it was published nearly 3 years earlier. Fans of Zahn should probably read it to see what happens to Outward Bound, but it's not a fully satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"One of the nice things about Del Ray's series of Star Wars books is that they are not just concentrating on their New Jedi Order books. They are also producing some books that take place further back in the Star Wars novel history, when Bantam was running the show. Thus, they can refer to events that took place in earlier books (such as Tatooine Ghost), and they can even supply sequels. Timothy Zahn's Survivor's Ghost is one of those, and it's quite thrilling.Luke Skywalker and Mara Jada Skywalker, married for three years now, are helping Mara's old boss, Talon Karrde, go straight by informing some of his old friends that he will no longer be doing business with them. After rebuking one irate customer, Karrde catches up with them and gives them a message to go to Nirauan (the planet where they faced down the Hand of Thrawn in Vision of the Future). There, they are told that Outbound Flight, an exploratory mission sent out by the Old Republic 50 years ago, has been found by the Chiss (who happen to be the species of their old enemy, Admiral Thrawn). Outbound Flight was a ring of six massive dreadnaught battleships bound to an inner core, resulting in a huge ship, but the Chiss reportedly destroyed it years ago. The Chiss have asked Luke and Mara to come and inspect it, representing the New Republic. They have to keep their eyes and ears open, however, as old enemies show up as well as new. Who will be their allies and who will betray them? Mara also has to come to terms with her former life as the Emperor's Hand during the time of the Empire, making a decision that could change her life forever. Luke and Mara have to stretch their Jedi skills to the maximum to make it out of the bowels of Outbound Flight alive, as well as preventing a galactic war.I love the fact that the recent Star Wars non-NJO books have focused on only a few of our favourite characters. This gives the book an opportunity to really expand on their characterization, as well as explain certain changes between the old series and the New Jedi Order books. Survivor's Quest focuses exclusively on Luke and Mara, their relationship, and Mara's past. I've always enjoyed Mara, as she's one of the most dynamic new Star Wars (i.e. non-movie) character around. She's gone through massive changes since Zahn's first novel, where she wanted nothing more then to kill Luke Skywalker. Now they're married, sharing a bond that goes beyond love, a bond through the Force. When they first meet up with Commander Fel (the son of one of their old enemies) and his stormtrooper squad, memories flood her, memories of her time with the Empire. She begins to fall into old habits of command. She has a case of \\"survivor's guilt,\\" as she realizes that while the Emperor was horrible, some of the Imperial policies may have actually been good. She and Luke have seen the New Republic struggle with petty wars and other conflicts among member planets, and the Imperials were efficient. Watching her thoughts is very intriguing.The best thing about this is that Zahn doesn't push this in the reader's face by trying to explain it. Instead, the reader gets to see some of her thought processes as she handles the situations that come up during the events of the novel. Luke occasionally presses her to talk, but he's usually unsuccessful. Instead, he just has to be supportive as well as being a good teammate. Watching them work together was a real treat. We've seen it in the New Jedi Order books, but this is when it was still fresh, and it was a wonder to see.Mara is Zahn's creation, so it's not surprising that he handles her well. The good thing is that he handles pretty much everybody else reasonably well too. This is especially true of Fel and, to a lesser extent, the stormtroopers. The troopers are individualized as far as having names goes, though they aren't given a great deal of character. One negative is that a big deal is made of one of the troopers being an alien, which would have been unheard of in the Empire's time where anti-alien prejudice was prominent. However, nothing much is made of it other then the odd mention or two. Still, the book does a good job (along with Tatooine Ghost) of making the troopers much more competent then they were in the movies. Fel is an interesting character to watch as he leads his squad in action. He's thoroughly competent and intelligent, and the best thing you can say about him is that you're not wishing for the book to go back to someone else when he's on screen.There are some unanswered questions that bring the book down, however. There is a scene in the middle of the book where Fel and one of his troopers talk about hiding something on the Chiss ship, but it's never referred to again. After this scene, you keep expecting the Imperials to eventually do something that they never do. It was jarring. Secondly, the animosity that the Outbound Flight survivors have toward Jedi is never explained. These feelings have a major impact on the story and the result, but we are given no reason why it exists. Is it just because the Jedi failed to successfully fight off the Chiss when they attacked? If so, it seems rather harsh to be feeling that way 50 years later.All in all, Survivor's Quest is an effective tale, full of action and great characterization of the main characters. While there are some plotting difficulties as mentioned above, it's an enjoyable read, especially for those who are getting a bit tired of The New Jedi Order. Give it a shot.David Roy"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"For those of us who are either casual or even serious Star Wars readers, the name Timothy Zahn usually means one thing in particular: a REALLY GOOD BOOK. Zahn's original Trilogy still remains the absolute BEST Star Wars novels in print, and I am happy to say that for the die-hard Admiral Thrawn fans out there, we finally get to see a glimpse into where he came from. The Chiss, as they are called contact the New Republic -- specifically Luke Skywalker -- to offer a gesture of good will by informing them they have located the remains of the original Outbound Flight where the original Jedi Master C'Baoth disappeared some 50 years before on a quest to map out the Unknown Regions of Space. Thrawn intercepted this flight under orders from Emperor Palpatine and utterly decimated all within -- or so we were told.From the very beginning, this story absolutely ROCKS. I would describe it as a finely tuned mystery that, like an onion, is peeled away slowly but surely as the chapters fly by at Lightspeed. Someone has intercepted the message meant for Luke and as they travel deep into Chiss space, they discover abruptly who it is who made that interception, and along the way Luke &amp; his wife, Mara find more than they bargain for. Mysterious problems happen on the Chiss spaceship, seemingly to be nothing more than choreographed diversions for other more interesting crimes to take place. Along the way we meet another race of aliens who wish to pay tribute to the Jedi who fought to save them from enslavement by a mysterious unknown race of ruthless conquerers and very nearly slaughtered them all. When Outbound Flight is finally reached, Luke, Mara &amp; the Chiss are rather surprised to find out that not only are the 6-Dreadnaughts in remarkable shape considering their crash-landing, but they also find the last thing they ever expected: survivors -- survivors who apparently wish to have nothing to do with Jedi. A chance to discover what really happened to Outbound Flight and what role the Chiss really had in their destruction is quite a mystery indeed -- a journey that is very much worth taking.For those of you who ONLY enjoy Star Wars tales that include all of the major CORE characters (Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, R2D2 &amp; C3PO etc) you just may be slightly let down. For the rest of us who read ANYTHING written by Timothy Zahn, you will NOT be disappointed in the slightest. As this story unfolded I found myself absolutely wrapped in the mystery and I had a very difficult time putting it down to do mundane things like eat and sleep. I was also VERY thrilled to hear that Zahn is also planning an additional novel based upon the actual mission OF Outbound Flight scheduled for release sometime next year. Fans of Timothy Zahn Rejoice! This is just an additional adventure in that Galaxy Far, Far Away that truly lives up to the Grand Adventure that began with Episode IV back in 1977. Great Stuff!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"'Survivor's Quest,' by Timothy Zahn, features Luke Skywalker and his wife, Mara Jade-Skywalker (often referred to as Mara or Jade). In the last two novels by Zahn ('Specter of the Past' and 'Vision of the Future), Luke and Mara had travelled into Chiss space and encountered the Empire of the Hand. This Empire was what remained of Grand Admiral's Thrawn's efforts in the 'Heir to the Empire' trilogy. In those novels, the destruction of the Outbound Flight project at Thrawn's hands was used as the back drop as to why Thrawn had been exiled from the Chiss Ascendency and had gone to work with the Empire.It is now three years later. Luke and Mara receive word from Talon Karrde that the Empire of the Hand is trying to contact them. Responding to the message, the Skywalkers travel to Chiss space to discover the Chiss have found the remains of the Outbound Flight project. This project was established during the Old Republic. Its mission was to travel out of known space, and possibly out of the known galaxy, to colonize other worlds. Thrawn's attack ruined those plans. Aristocra Formbi, from one of the nine ruling families of the Chiss Ascendency, invites the Skywalkers and representatives of a race calling themselves the Geroons to investigate the ruins....There are several features that make this novel a worth while read. First, there are storm troopers in the novel. With the New Jedi Order (NJO) and many prequel novels in recent years, storm troopers have been missing from Star Wars literature for the most part. Its good to have a recognizable face from the Empire back. Second, the Skywalkers are featured. Mara gets a fair amount of face time in the NJO, but most of the time Luke was left out so the story could feature Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin Solo and their Jedi friends. Third, more details of the legendary Outbound Flight project come to life in this novel. Its a nice supplement to some of Zahn's earlier work.The novel has its not so good points as well. First, in my opinion, the Skywalkers were frequently misused in action sequences. They seldom got a chance to have a good old fashion stand up fight. Instead, they are frequently using overly complicated Jedi force tricks to get themselves out of yet another seemingly imminent death. A little guile is one thing, but Luke and Mara are supposed to be some of the most reknowned Jedi in the galaxy. Let's see them take it to the enemy.Second, everyone is hiding something from someone else. The Geroons, \\"Ambassador\\" Jinzler from the Republic, Aristocra Formbi, the survivors of the Outbound Flight, the Imperials, and even the Skywalkers are hiding things from everyone else. Frequently, Zahn hints at a secret someone is hiding to build up the mystery, only to let down the reader when the revelation proves not to be a big deal. The intrigue, in the end, is just artificially inflated.Third, the plot frequently plods along at a snail's pace. The best section of the book is the opening few chapters and the ending few chapters. The Jedi and storm troopers are in action, and Zahn succeeds in revealing crucial plot points to the reader. The middle, however, bogs down with bickering between the characters and a very slow exploration of the ruins of the Outbound Flight.Overall, this novel is a good read. It builds on both prequel era material and points towards events revealed in the NJO. Zahn has another novel, 'The Outbound Flight,' that will soon be published that should reveal the rest of the mystery of exactly what happened with the Outbound flight. I'd recommend this novel to Star Wars fans, but if you really want to know the story of Mara and Luke, start with Zahn's original trilogy and then read his duology that precede this novel first.Overall Grade: 3.25 stars."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Okay, so this is not exactly a masterpiece, but it is a great read.

But, I know that Zahn is also coming out with a book that takes place during Outbound Flight next year, so that is probably why he didn't get all that detailed about the Outbound Flight Project.So, with that said I'd also like to thank Zahn for making this about Luke and Mara because their relationship was way too corny in the New Jedi Order series and Mara hardly even acted like Mara. Now Zahn, who already had to do this once, has corrected some errors in other SW books. Like making Luke and Mara an interesting couple that doesn't drip with cheesiness."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"Timothy Zahn is one of the most original Science Fiction writers writing today. His contributions to the \\"Star Wars\\" Universe, especially Grand Admiral Thrawn, are some of his best work.\\"Survivor's Quest\\" is set 22 years after the first \\"Star Wars\\" Film (Episode IV - A New Hope). Luke Skywalker is now a Jedi Master, and is married to Mara Jade, who was formerly the Emperor's Hand, but is now a Jedi Knight.Luke is sent a message by a race called the Chiss: they have discovered the ships of a Jedi-led exploration mission called \\"Outbound Flight\\" which had left the Old Republic on a voyage to another galaxy some 50 years before.Outbound flight had never made it out of the home Galaxy. A Chiss commander called Mitth'raw'nuruodo - who later served Emperor Palpatine as a Grand Admiral and was known by his core name, Thrawn, which humans can pronounce - intercepted Outbound Flight and apparently destroyed it.The Chiss government had not been pleased by Thrawn's actions, and he had narrowly escaped being cashiered and exiled. Having found what is left of the ships of Outbound Flight, the Chiss want to give them back and hold a commemoration ceremony to formally apologise for their destruction. Luke and Mara are invited as representatives of the Jedi and the New Republic to take part in the ceremony and explore the remains.But what starts out as the investigation of an old tragedy turns into a deadly pattern of intrigue and plots. Several of those who turn up to take part in the ceremony commemorating Outbound Flight are not what they seem, and it soon becomes apparent that a number of hidden agendas are in play.Furthermore, it turns out that there are survivors from the original crew of Outbound Flight. Their experiences fifty years ago have made the survivors, and their descendants, paranoid about anyone entering the remains of the expedition. This presents some difficult challenges, but is far from being the worst danger which Luke, Mara, and their companions face.Subsequent to writing this book, Zahn went back fifty years and published the novel \\"Outbound Flight\\" which tells the story of the original expedition. If you're minded to read both stories, I recommend that you tackle \\"Outbound Flight\\" first.Knowing too much about what is going to happen may somewhat dampen your pleasure at reading \\"Outbound Flight\\" if you read the books in the order they were written. I also found a number of details in \\"Survivor's Quest\\" more powerful when I re-read that story after tackling the book about the earlier events.It's difficult to illustrate this point without giving away either story, but let me give one example: two important characters in \\"Outbound flight\\" are faced with a choice between two options, one of which will mean their own deaths, the other those of the other remaining survivors of the expedition. They choose the former, and a communications failure means that nobody knows about their sacrifice.Fifty years later, Luke and Mara find the bones of those two people in the wrecked bridge of Outbound Flight, with an item which enables one of them to be identified. Luke and Mara draw the right conclusion, that the individual concerned had died to save the people of Outbound Flight, and convey this to the next of kin of that person, on the basis of a wholly wrong assumption about what had been going on. It's very poignant if you read the two books close together, but this is one of a number of details which make more sense if you read \\"Outbound Flight\\" first.Other good things about this book: the partnership of Luke and Mara is well described and highly enjoyable to read about. The plot and action setting are first rate.If you enjoy Zahn's Star Wars fiction but were disappointed in most of the other books set in the Star Wars Universe, there is one other writer whose Star Wars books I can strongly recommend, and that is Roger MacBride Allen. His Corellian trilogy is nearly as good as Zahn's \\"Heir to the Empire\\" trilogy, and that is saying a lot.Overall both \\"Outbound Flight\\" and \\"Survivor's Quest\\" are worthy additions to the Star Wars canon and I recommend them."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"It was a sad, sad day for the Star Wars Extended Universe when Lucasfilm turned over the book publishing license to Del Rey. Bantam, the publisher previously holding the license, ended its admittedly sometime shaky run on terrific high note: The X-Wing Rogue Squadron series; I, Jedi by Michael Stackpole; and especially The Hand of Thrawn duology by Timothy Zahn. In the latter two titles, Stackpole and Zahn smoothed over the more rocky moments of the Bantam continuity, reset Luke Skywalker from comic book Jedi god to a much more likable, relatable and human character, and set up new horizons and new relationships to be explored. The future of the Star Wars Extended Universe looked bright.But alas. Del Rey, for reasons unfathomable other than to cater to a certain sect of whiny fanboy, proceeded to hire authors more suited for video games than for literature. The resulting drek, under the New Jedi Order, Legacy of the Force, and Fate of the Jedi labels, have turned the once beloved universe into an unrecognizable, highly stinky morass. The Del Rey run can be summed as follows: battles, battles, characters forget everything they've previously known, can't win yet because the series isn't over, someone BIG! dies, let's create a new Force power, cardboard characters have a cardboard conversation, battles, battles, someone BIG! dies, characters act stupidly out of character, battles, battles, can't win yet because the series isn't over, let's change the concept of the Force as it exists in the movies, cardboard, cardboard, more character stupidity, battle, battle, Phew! Pyrrhic victory. Oh, and someone BIG! dies. Rinse and repeat. Ad nauseum. Emphasis on nauseum.(In fact, the writers literally turned the galaxy unrecognizable in the New Jedi Order by terraforming most of the known planets. Way to be subtle.)So what does this have to do with Survivor's Quest?FINALLY.A book that finally remembers it is set in the Star Wars universe, not Alien or Predator or Halo.A book that finally has FUN. Remember fun? The feeling that swept over you when you sat in the movie theater watching Luke, Leia and Han run around the Death Star? Fun. Something left out of the other Del Rey books featuring Original Trilogy movie characters.A book that finally treats its characters as capable, quick-witted, resourceful, intelligent adults. Luke and Mara make a fantastic team as they investigate the mystery surrounding the sudden discovery of Outbound Flight. And it takes both their strengths (Mara's hard-nosed pragmatism, Luke's optimism and calm) to save the day.A book that finally treats Luke and Mara as true Jedi. Forget the conflicted, indecisive, omniscient and all-powerful when it serves the author, clueless and passive otherwise Luke of the NJO Del Rey books. Luke is still seeking to learn more about the Force, as is Mara, but here the use of their powers is appropriate, in character and consistent. Ah, Force bond, so nice to see you used properly. And Mara's danger sense. And Luke's superior lightsaber skills and strength. And Luke's respect for life.A book that finally remembers that it is, after all, a book. And not a video game spin off. Survivor's Quest actually has...themes. Yes, themes, in a Del Rey Star Wars book. The last I felt them was in the presence of...The Hand of Thrawn duology.The title of the book refers not only to Outbound Flight and the fate of its survivors, but also to Luke and Mara. As the last survivor of the Old Republic Jedi (the last to be trained by them, in any case) Luke struggles with the legacy he is leaving his order of the Jedi. In specific, did he do the right thing in marrying Mara, as attachment was supposedly forbidden previously? Mara struggles with her guilt as one of the few high ranking Imperial operatives to survive Palpatine's fall. Why did she live when so many others fell? And is the New Republic really the right place for her? The characters' internal struggles are informed and shaped by their external struggle to learn more about Outbound Flight, the Vaagari and the Chiss. It's a terrific piece of writing, and shows a grasp of storytelling concepts sorely, egregiously missing from other Del Rey Star Wars books.In short, SURVIVOR'S QUEST is a long, sweet, tall drink of much needed water compared to the cesspool that is the New Jedi Order timeline. Read it. Then throw the future timeline books away. Far away.The only negative to the book is that, by contrast, it only makes the missed opportunities that much more visible. And it is all the more bittersweet for being an all too brief glimpse of what the Star Wars Extended Universe could have been, if only left to Timothy Zahn and other equally talented authors who share his respect for the characters and their world."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I'll have to admit that before I bought this book I read some bad reviews people had given it. I think I had a bit of thier criticism when I started reading, so the book seemed to start slowly. As a read deeper into this adventure, I found myself getting hooked and couldn't put the book down. I'm sorry I ever listened to other people's opinions, and I should have trusted more in my favorite Star Wars author Timothy Zahn. I give this book four stars because it was a wonderful, captivating adventure, yet doesn't deserve five stars because I reserve five stars only for my very favorite."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"In response to Page7's review on January 10th - This story takes place before the New Jedi Order, that's why no mention of the Yuuzhan Vong, ravaged Coruscant, etc. It's also not the first of a new series, but an extention on an old one (Hand of Thrawn duology: Vision of the Past and Specter of the Future). Anyone reading the reviews should know this so they don't get confused.All in all, Zhan has continued the saga of characters he created well. The question of why Thrawn destroyed Outbound Flight is even more murky by the end of this book, something that should be wrapped up neatly by the Outbound Flight book coming out in 2006. The book is paced much slower than his previous outings, but for me it kept the eerieness of the situation more alive.When it comes to the Star Wars Expanded Universe, Zhan is still king. We can only hope that his forthcoming offerings maintain the past expectations."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"I have to admit that I was disappointed. After suffering through the last half of the New Jedi Order series, I was hopeful when I saw that Zahn had written another Star Wars book. While the story itself is not bad, I just found myself not caring much for any of the new characters and felt that many of the questions raised early in the story were simply left unanswered.First, the fact that any part of Outbound Flight survived for 50 years half-buried on a planetoid in the middle of a star cluster didn't seem to make much sense. If Thrawn was supposed to have attacked Outbound Flight, I never got the impression that it would have survived at all. But six Dreadnaughts have survived, and they are found by the Chiss, who promptly ask Mara and Luke to help visit the site to pay their last respects. Luke once again goes in a quest to find any information about the Jedi of the Old Republic.I was hoping for more information on the original Jedi Jorus C'Baoth, but there is only a passing mention of him. There is essentially nothing about the Jedi in this whole book, and it turns out to be yet another story of how Luke goes to find one thing but instead discovers another. This time the new discovery is a group of survivors of Outbound Flight.One question that is brought up, but never really answered, is how the remains of Outbound Flight and its survivors got to where they are. It is suggested that Thrawn, or someone else, may have carried or left it there, although why remains a mystery. It is more strongly suggested that Outbound Flight crash-landed, but that seems like an easy answer and doesn't make sense that Thrawn, continually put up as the most thorough and cunning villain since the Emperor, would not have checked for survivors. Everything just seemed half-hearted.One other glaring thread that was left untied was why the survivors of Outbound Flight despised and hated Jedi. We never find out what the Jedi of Outbound Flight did to garner such hatred, to the point where Force-sensitive survivors are banished from the rest of the community because of the fear and hatred of all things Jedi. I still have no idea where this came from, and the fate of the Jedi aboard Outbound Flight, except for one, is never ever touched upon.I just thought this whole story was an excuse to have Mara and Luke get a story of their own, after taking a backseat for most of the NJO. It was good to see Luke and Mara in action, and Zahn writes their personal interaction as well as ever. The dialogue in Zahn's books is always much better than in other Star Wars novels, although lately that is not saying much. But this story, which wraps up a little too nicely, did not have the punch to it that I had hoped for.Overall, I loved Zahn's Heir to the Empire trilogy and thought those books read like something I would love to see as films. The Hand of Thrawn duology was okay, but to be honest I didn't get too into it. And now this book is not even as engaging as those prior attempts. It is worth reading, but only in paperback.One final note for those reviewers who explain away a story's shortcoming because it is \\"setting up a sequel,\\" that is exactly the problem with the Star Wars series. Nothing can be told in one book and readers are required to buy volume after volume to fully read a story that could stand in one book, and unlike Zahn's other outings, which were billed from the beginning as a trilogy (Heir to the Empire) and a duology (Hand of Thrawn), nothing suggests that Zahn is revisiting this story any time soon. So if any of the glaring plot holes are purposely left open so another substandard writer can fill them in later (Dix and Williams, anyone), then I doubt I'll keep shelling out money for stories that fall flat."},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","review":"This book certainly deserves a 5 Star rating! Timothy Zahn is by far the best of the Star Wars novel writers. This book takes place just prior to New Jedi Order and prepares you for the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong. This book also serves to close out the project known as \\"Outbound Flight\\"Timothy Zahn was the author to establish the relationship between Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade (now Mara Jade Skywalker). You get to see the unique bond between 2 married Jedi and Luke questions why Jedi were forbidden from marrying in the past.This book will also provide you some insight into the lives of the Chiss people. This is the first time we see much about the Chiss since the fall of Thrawn.There are some good battle scenes in this book between the Skywalker's and the Vagaari. The Vagaari were valiant warriors, however they of course were not powerful enough to defeat Luke and Mara. Unfortunatley the Vagaari are never heard from again after this book.Timothy Zahn did a great job of tying the older Star Wars era to the age of Star Wars past the movies. Luke and Mara have about a 9 page battle with a Droideka (last heard from prior to the rise of Vader). Also covered are the Storm Troopers from the 501st, who where Darth Vader's special force of Storm Troopers.If you read the book \\"Outbound Flight\\" you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you are new to reading Star Wars novels, this book is a great place to start! Timothy Zahn you get 2 thumbs up from me!"},{"Title":"Let Every Soul Be Jesus' Guest: A Theology of the Open Table","review":"Mark Stamm has provided an excellent writing that brings forth a sound theology of the Eucharist.

In fact the whole series are incredible horse books. Mary O'Hara knew more about horse behaviour than Monty Roberts and 99% of the so-called horse whisperers out there today do. The book I purchased from Amazon is actually the third copy of &quot;Green Grass of Wyoming&quot; I have owned because I have literally worn my other copies out re-reading them and I wanted to make sure I had a copy for posterity. I can't recommend the books highly enough, especially to any horse-lovers out there."},{"Title":"Green grass of Wyoming","review":"\\"Green Grass of Wyoming\\" is the heartwarming and satisfying conclusion to Mary O'Hara's Flicka trilogy.As the book opens, much has changed in the McLaughlin household. There is a baby daughter, Penelope, the apple of everyone's eye. The Goose Bar ranch is finally doing well, thanks in no small part to Ken and his wonderhorse, the racing champion Thunderhead. And Ken? Now a fine and handsome young man, he is head over heels in love with a headstrong young blueblood named Carey, whose aristocratic grandmother looks down on Ken and his entire family. And therein lies the plot. Will Ken win Carey the way he stubbornly won his first love, his horse Flicka? Will Carey break free from her domineering grandmother? Will they live happily ever after?Juxtaposed to this wonderful romance is the story of Nell, who has changed dramatically from the previous books. She is now subject to sudden and debilitating anxiety attacks, and is convinced that she is going to die. Her enduring marriage and her love for her family cannot break her anxiety, and all who know and love her are worried--but unable to help.This is a strong and wonderful book, and most definitely should be saved for the teenaged years, no younger than 12, to my mind. But why save it for the kids? This is a romance complete with horses, handsome heroes, and strong, heroic women. A perfect read for any time you want a good escape into a better time."},{"Title":"Green grass of Wyoming","review":"&quot;Green Grass of Wyoming&quot; is the necessary culmination of &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot; and &quot;Thunderhead.&quot; Like those others, it is by no means a childrens' book.

How I loved the MacLaughlins when I was a child and wished they were my family! I love them still, and Mary O'Hara's trilogy has an honored place on my bookshelf.

What is the logic of keeping the first two parts of a trilogy in print and not the third?It's been years since I read this one, but if memory serves the book is more for adults than children. It focuses a great deal on Nell and her relationship with her husband now that her children are grown.

Mary O'Hara takes us to more mature ground in this book, as she philosophizes more about the relation of man to God and lets Ken fall in love with Carey.Mary O'Hara writes very well: she knows what she is talking about, she tells a gripping story with lovable and very real characters and her descriptions of nature in its fierce and gentle aspects show that she deeply loves it. I think that it's a shame that her books are so much linked to all those inferior \\"girls with horses\\" books (I bought a paperback version of 'My friend Flicka' and to my horror the package included some kind of charm or necklace).Written some 60 years ago, this book is still very, very readable and it is a fitting conclusion to a great trilogy."},{"Title":"Green grass of Wyoming","review":"I grew up in the country with horses and a pony named Flicka.

Prior to reading \\"My Friend Flicka\\", I loved reading \\"horse\\" books aimed at pre-teen girls. It as a wonderful day when my mother gave me \\"My Friend Flicka\\", which she and my father had received for Christmas years before, along with the other two Mary O'Hara books, \\"Thunderhead\\" and \\"Green Grass of Wyoming\\". From the beginning page of the \\"Flicka\\" book, I was captivated--by the horses, the people, the area of Wyoming where the book is set, the time. The McLaughlin family seemed real to me,and still does, some 52 years after first meeting them!! I have re-read this series many, many times over the years, and each time there is something new to notice. When I was very young,I dentified totally with Ken, and sort of \\"ignored\\" the other family members as \\"background noise\\"--Howard was sort of a brat, Nell was \\"just a mother\\", and Rob was a scary, controlling father. Over the years, however, I came to see each of these individuals differently. Nell became my friend and myself, and Rob--believe it or not--became sort of a hero to me, for holding firm, caring for his family against hard odds. The horses, of course, remained a constant. I have never had a horse, but have always loved them. I came to fully appreciate Nell's meanderings about God and have incorporated her beliefs and ideas into my own spiritual life...I hope that when I eventually get to Heaven, I will meet the McLaughlins, and will be 'at home' with them,on the Goose Bar!!"},{"Title":"Green grass of Wyoming","review":"I discovered this book in middle school, after reading and crying over \\"My Friend Flicka.\\" I got this book at the public library and wound up reading and re-reading it over again, through my high school years.

Though I was a kid in the rural South in the late 70's, reading that book made me desperately want to move to Wyoming! Many years later, when I was working in a bookstore in Atlanta, I came across a first edition of this very book, and I paid dearly to get it.

The Amazonians themselves include a sub-section which I consult daily and greatly appreciate: &quot;Customers who bought this also bought...&quot; I mention all this at the outset because I think it is a serious mistake (or at least silly) to characterize any one book on a given subject as THE book to buy. This is especially true of the subject of change agency. Without any effort, I can immediately think of at least 10-12 which are brilliantly developed, eloquently written, and of enduring value. I include this book among them. Does it ask most of the right questions? Yes. Are all of its answers definitive? No. The subtitle is precise and accurate: This book offers a thoughtful and cohesive guide to &quot;developing high-performance people and organizations.&quot;After an introductory chapter (&quot;Becoming a Change Agent&quot;), the authors organize their excellent material within three Parts: Beyond the Smoke and Mirrors; then Philosophy, Practice, and Responsibilities of a Change Agent; and finally, Integrating Resources, Roles, and Competencies. By the time I reached the end of this book, I realized that one of the greatest benefits to be derived from it is especially relevant to owners/CEOs of smaller companies. A majority of those I have worked closely with are the only change agent in their respective organizations. This book will help them to develop change agency competence among many of those whom they supervise. Of course, the book will also be of great value to senior-level executives in large organizations, including non-profits.For me, one of the most entertaining as well as informative chapters in the book is Chapter 4 (&quot;Beware of Flying Monkeys and Poison Poppies&quot;) in which the authors suggest correlations between the adventures encountered by Dorothy and her companions en route to the Emerald City and what all managers encounter in today's business world. &quot;Flying monkeys are those unexpected characters, events, and situations that jump up and attack you at the most untimely moments.....Flying monkeys come in all shapes, sorts, and sizes. They can be people, events, activities, and attitudes....Perhaps the most important potential monkey for you to be aware of is the cultural flying monkey. [As the authors have explained earlier in the book], culture is defined as the underlying beliefs, values, and assumptions held by members of an organization and the practices and behaviors that exemplify and reinforce them. In other words, 'the way we do things around here.'&quot; In Figure 4.1, detailed information about &quot;Miscellaneous Flying Monkeys&quot; is provided within an ingenious grid. With regard to &quot;poison poppies&quot;, the authors suggest that so many change initiatives fail because managers are &quot;seduced by the promise of a quick fix&quot;, a short-cut, etc. Time and again when retained by a corporate client to help solve problems, I find that the client's managers are preoccupied with the symptoms of problems rather than focused on determining the causes of those problems. Stated another way, many managers seem to think that wet highways cause rain.The authors begin Chapter 11 with a quote from John Kotter (&quot;A good rule of thumb in a major change effort is: Never underestimate the magnitude of the forces that reinforce complacency and that help maintain the status quo&quot;) and then use Figure 11.01 to illustrate what they call a &quot;Holistic Model for Change Agent Excellence&quot; featuring the brain, the heart, courage, and vision. All are necessary to overcome the aforementioned &quot;forces.&quot; More specifically:1. Provide strong, highly visible, and personal leadership2. Institute employee involvement early and often, at all levels3. Build a clearly articulated, shared vision4. Provide frequent, consistent, and open communication5. Leverage talented, and trusted employees as co-change agents6. Set measurable operational and behavioral goals7. Celebrate successes and re-address shortcomingsThe authors carefully explain each of these &quot;Seven Keys to Successful Organizational Change&quot; in detail and then shift their attention to what they characterize as a &quot;list of absolutes in the quest to develop gained wisdom&quot;: Tap into the wisdom of the &quot;elders&quot; in the organization, build a wisdom war chest&quot;, patiently and progressively wield your wisdom-based influence on an organizational level, and finally, share wisdom with others on an organizational level. The authors no only explain how; they also explain why.Appropriately, the authors conclude their brilliant book as follows: &quot;As in [italics] The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's vision was to somehow return to her beloved Kansas. By casting her eyes on that goal, she was able to energize and solicit support for friends and foes alike along her journey. In the end, she achieved her goal, as you will in your effort to [italics] becoming a change agent.&quot; Through their book, the authors can accompany you on your own journey. The Yellow Brick Road to high-performance people and organizations awaits. Let the journey begin!"},{"Title":"The Manager as Change Agent: A Practical Guide to Developing High-Performance People and Organizations","review":"I will not be as lengthy as the other review (to date) because it is outlined and described well. What I will add is that I have read many, many books about change (throughout career and in Masters program at BYU for Organizational Behavior) and this one is hands down the most practical and applicable to real life I have found. You will NOT go wrong buying this book, even at full price!"},{"Title":"Scotswoman","review":"If you've ever bought a tin of shortbread from Scotland, you may see a picture of a man kissing the hand of a woman. The man, fully arrayed in Royal Stewart tartan is Bonnie Prince Charlie, the last hope for a Scot to sit upon the English throne. Who's that woman? In order to read this book, you must know your Jacobite history, or you'll be just as mystified at who she is in this book. Read a wee bit of 18th century Scottish history first, then enjoy this book's plot, filled to the brim with storms! pirates! spies! loyalists! and traitors. Read past the writing, however, for it is sadly stilted and filled with dialogue that informs you of past and present events, as opposed to people simply talking in the here and now. Ms. Fletcher knows her history and expects you to know it as well. She adores Scotland, where Flora and her kin live before they decide to come to America and find a stable life. Little did they realize the Revolutionary fervor that was gripping t! ! he land, and many of the Scots were compelled to now support the British Hanoverian King in his cause against the rebellious American colonists. This, of course, is mortifying to Flora, for she helped to rescue the Stuart &quot;Young Pretender&quot; Charles and now is being asked to support King George as she resettles in America. Ms. Fletcher does a nice job showing how the Old World didn't always fit in the New. Flora's husband wants to support the British, believing that it will bring peace to the land, and allow him to florish. Ms. Fletcher handles the tension between Flora and her husband nicely, but the writing's insipid quality made me cringe. It is an historical novel, but it is refreshing how well Ms. Fletcher did her historical homework. This book has led me to delve deeper into exactly who Flora MacDonald was--rescuing her from being just a picture on a tin or a character in a rather mediocre novel."},{"Title":"Scotswoman","review":"I always love reading stories set in Scotland, Ireland and England, especially historical novels and this one did not fail my expectation. Flora McDonald was depicted as a very loyal and strong character in the book. I was always intrigue of Prince Charles as I am not very familiar with Scottish history but this book moved me and I did some research to make more sense of the story. This book can make you laugh, smile, feel sad, and sympathize for those early settlers in America that are thorn between the Whigs and the Tories. Flora was one of them, she wanted peace just like her husband Allan but they were seeking it in two different ways. Fighting for the Hanoverian crown in England or joining the rebels who are tired of \\"taxation without representation.\\" Just pick up a copy of this book because it is worthy of your time.

It is one of two books published by the Modern Language Association, and of the two, this one provides the complete guide to the MLA style. This book serves graduate students and scholarly writers best. It discusses publishing and legality as well as basics of writing and source citations. Many examples accompany the explanations clearly exhibiting the proper usage; however, this book is not necessary for the average research writer or undergraduate. If you are looking for a quick reference guide to proper MLA style, this is not the book for you. I would recommend the MLA HANDBOOK. The MLA HANDBOOK provides an easier, condensed version of the MLA STYLE MANUAL.

This fine reference book is designed for academics in the humanities who must adhere to the MLA style when writing papers, both for publication and advanced coursework. Not an introduction to MLA style, this book aims to guide the reader through the finer intricacies of scholarly writing by covering topics such as the proper use of punctuation, including slashes, square brackets, and semi-colons; using proper names from non-English speaking countries; questions of capitalization; abbreviations; and language and style. The author devotes an entire section to the legal issues of publishing academic papers, and another to thesis and dissertation formats. Perhaps the most detailed and helpful section concerns documentation and the format for citations, from corporate papers to electronic sources to books without page numbers. For those preparing for publication, the author offers practical guidelines for formatting manuscripts. Gibaldi's explanations are always clear and precise.I highly recommend this manual for upper-level undergraduates, graduate students, and professors in the humanities.

Young readers are probably familiar with how the Native Americans relied on certain animals for food and clothing, but in this story author-illustrator C. J. Taylor shows how they also used to provide medicine for both the body and the spirit. It also reflects the tradition of only taking what was needed and always giving thanks to the animals that provided such gifts.Little Water is a young hunter of the Seneca, who were the westernmost and largest tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy (a.k.a. The Five Nations), inhabiting parts of what is now northwestern New York state. However, Little Water does not always hunt when he goes into the forest because he had the special gift of being able to talk to the animals. In doing so his special friend was Wolf, who sometimes seemed to know what Little Water was thinking without them speaking at all. One day Little Water's grandfather, Stone Owl, tells him that a terrible sickness has come over the village that his medicine cannot cure. It is up to Little Water to go into the forest and ask for the help of the animals.Taylor tells the story of what happened when Little Water was injured during his search and how the animals of the forest came to his rescue because he had always shown them kindness and respect. As Taylor points out at the end of her book, the Little Water Society still exists among the tribes of the Confederacy, which shows the relevancy of the legend in today's world. In fact, &quot;Little Water and the Gift of the Animals&quot; is a retelling of &quot;The Grateful Animals, a legend of the Little Water Society.&quot; This is a rather simple tale, but young readers will appreciate how each of the gifts bestowed by the animals gets used by Little Water's tribe, even though the book only touches briefly on those specifics. Consequently, this book would make a nice story for teachers to use to reinforce such practices amongst the Native Americans in a unit studying their cultures."},{"Title":"Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior: A Casebook (Casebooks in Contemporary Fiction)","review":"An haunting book that details the life of a Chinese American woman who struggles to find herself.

Baxter offers a well-researched look at Lucas' life that doesn't shy away from the aspects which cannot be shied away from--the merchandising empire, the self-contradictory nature of the man, his scandolous divorce and his inflated status by the time his new Star Wars films were coming out in 1999. Perhaps Baxter focuses more attention on pointing out the subject's foibles than fans would like (naturally), but for all its flak for being \\"biased\\", this is a candid and refreshingly honest account of Lucas' life. Most books are either commissioned by Lucasfilm itself and thus carefully omitt anything even approaching criticism, and most journalists seem to spend all their time gushing over how great everything Lucas did was.While there is the counter-effect of those who want to expose Lucas as a corrupt, money-driven recluse with a boner for technology, I would not lump Baxter with these people; he obviously has admiration for some of Lucas' accomplishments, and often reveals a much more humanised side of Lucas through his inclusion of the man's many faults.In the end, its not a great book, but its a good one. True, the negative slant is sometimes unnecessary, however, the book is detailed and well-researched, and also gives decent respresentation to the life of Lucas AFTER 1983, a period that is often ignored or glossed over. While Dale Pollock's Skywalking is much better than this, that book only covers up to 1983, and in all honesty--this is the best alternative. Unless you like self-promotional tripe like The Creative Impulse--I think the more balanced (read: acknowledging the negative) view offered here is in many ways a reaction against superficial pat-on-the-back stuff like that."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"This book full of mistakes with facts (i.e. Jim Hanson played Yoda) and he was more interested in writing about the negative things about Lucas."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"I started reading this book today and I've only made it through two chapters and the only reason I read two is because I thought I should give the book another chance after reading the first chapter. I'm really not sure where the author is going with this book, it just doesn't seem to make sense to me. I felt he was not writing this book to tell the story of Lucas's life but in stead writing in literary confusion. It did not grab me at all. So I came here to see what other people thought of this book and I'm glad it wasn't just me. This book is a mess. Glad I got it from the library and didn't spend the $27 for it. There are other books that tell of the creative work and business of George Lucas."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"Pop culture biographies depend on a few key factors. One, how much gossip is there? Two, do they shed new light on old stories? And if the biography is based on a filmmaker, as John Baxter's Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas is, we can add a third: what new critical re-examination do they provide?As I read Mythmaker, I kept thinking, \\"Where have I read this before?\\" Baxter dutifully retells all the uphill battles in making Star Wars: the struggle to sell the idea, the agony of production -- and its much more difficult post-production, an early screening evisceration at the hands of Brian De Palma which was later defended by Steven Spielberg, and finally, Lucas' discovery of just how big a phenomenon he'd created when he went to the Hamburger Hamlet across the street from Mann's Chinese and saw the lines queued around the block. These are great stories, to be sure. But Baxter takes almost all of them at face value, never digging deeper under the surface to find the real story. The book lifts liberally from other works on Lucas, notably Dale Pollock's Skywalking, Peter Biskind's Easy Riders, Raging Bulls and Empire Building. And since Lucas argues, correctly, that Biskind is basically taking everything from Skywalking anyway, that pretty much leaves two sources.Matters aren't helped any by a number a factual errors. At first, it's simply distracting when he makes the casual claim that Spielberg lost the Best Picture Oscar for Jaws to Fellini's Amarcord. The point of fact was that Spielberg wasn't even nominated while Fellini was (and later lost). And perhaps a reader can shrug off Baxter's repeated flubs of Episode One - The Phantom Menace, calling it Part One and, later, The Phantom Empire, while only a student of Star Wars minutiae would know that Ian McDirmid, not Terence Stamp, plays Darth Sidious. But after about a hundred pages, the mistakes become more glaring, culminating in a monumental mistake as Baxter describes Lucas' efforts with Willow. He writes that Lucas took Willow to the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, hoping that audiences would embrace it the same way they did Spielberg's E.T. in 1992. Even if we forgive Baxter for what is basically a copy editing mistake, I had to stop and wonder, \\"Was anyone at the publishing house actually reading this book, much less proofing it?\\"All of this would perhaps be forgivable if the book were well-written. And Mythmaker gets off to a good start detailing Lucas' early life, particularly his chafing childhood under a strict father who values business over imagination -- who can't understand his son's constant dreaming and desire to leave the desert suburb of Modesto, California. Baxter shows numerous influences on Lucas' life and how they would show up in his films. Lucas' feelings for Modesto show up in Luke Skywalker's dismissal of Tatooine. Lucas' father issues get dramatized in Luke's redemption of Darth Vader. Baxter even describes in great detail, Lucas' early student films at USC, showcasing his early obsession with cars, as well as one about a local radio deejay called \\"The Emperor.\\"Most impressively, Baxter lands an interview with Lawrence Kasdan, who sheds new light on the writing process of Raiders of the Lost Ark, as well as the struggles to finish Empire Strikes Back after initial screenwriter Leigh Brackett died of cancer. Kasdan talks about the frantic rush to finish Empire (re-written after he turned in Raiders) before photography began, and how Brackett's own fight with cancer imbued the film with its dark tone. For students of Lucas and Spielberg, as well as the writing process in general, these anecdotes alone are almost worth buying the book.Almost.Because even if one dismisses Easy Riders, Raging Bulls as the \\"revenge of the ex-wives,\\" (as Peter Bogdanovich did), it's still an incredibly written and researched book. Baxter's narrative is stilted and incomplete. His notes section is woefully anemic. Where's the documentation that biographies like this stand upon?But easily the biggest travesty of the book is Baxter's final chapter, which details The Phantom Menace and tries, in vain, to wrap up Lucas' life and work. I was hoping for the same detail to attention with Phantom Menace that Kasdan had supplied with Empire and Return of the Jedi. Instead, Baxter -- possibly running head on into the Lucasfilm wall of silence -- essentially re-processes the press machine. Though he does accurately describe the critical ravaging the film received, he barely delves into the digital process of filmmaking, its toll on the actors or its potential impact on the world of cinema.Most depressingly, Baxter fumbles the ball when it comes to tying it all together. From the opening pages forward, Baxter describes friends and co-workers who get on Lucas' bad side and never work with him again. And the last five pages feel like Baxter himself fears reprisals from his subject. Rather than provide a coherent thesis, he gives Lucas the easy way out, forgiving him for Howard the Duck and Phantom Menace, with the excuse that Lucas is a man who loves stories.So after 350 pages, that's all we're left with. Lucas loves to tell stories. Even Biskind went deeper than that to show us a frustrated Lucas caught at the bottom of the Star Wars pyramid, unable to create a movie that doesn't have a strange creature or aerial space battle in it. This is all the more annoying when one realizes Baxter has laid the groundwork for the real story in his early chapters with Lucas and his father. The real inversion of Star Wars' impact on Lucas' life is thematic: rather than redeem his father as Luke did with Darth Vader, Lucas has become his father. He has shown a keen and ruthless business mind, efficiently running Industrial Light and Magic and managing his deals from Star Wars and Indiana Jones to become a multi-millionaire several times over. Lucas' genius is in foreseeing the future of cameras, computers and merchandising, not in Jar Jar Binks or movies about trade federations.Just as Lucas Sr. shook his head at his son's desires to explore a new medium, one can almost feel George Jr. being pulled dragging and screaming into the new means and medium of film. It took years before Lucas jumped on the computer graphics bandwagon, but Lucas' intransigence runs deeper -- to the core of the love of story Baxter claims Lucas has. In a year that brought us The Matrix, Being John Malkovich and many other groundbreaking films, the story Lucas created for Phantom Menace seems almost quaint by comparison. That Baxter can't, or refuses, to draw this conclusion -- particularly after so laboriously pointing us in that direction -- is the book's biggest failure of all."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"How well you like this book is probably going to depend a lot on your motivation for reading it in the first place. The recent *60-Minutes* segment did more in 40 minutes to show the personal side of George Lucas, than this book did in 400+ pages. Much of the personal information seems cursory and under-developed. However, the book does provide a fasinating look at the film industry. The chapters dealing with Star Wars are by far the most interesting and the strongest. They alone make the book worth reading.I found the author's writing style detached, remote and unengaging, but readable. At points in the book I found myself asking &quot;So what?&quot;, &quot;Who care's&quot; or &quot;Why do I need to know this&quot;. If you aren't a Star Wars or Indiana Jones fan, the book may become tedious and boring.At best this book pulls together a lot of scattered information about George Lucas, his life and his filmography into one readable volume. At worst it paints an unflattering picture of a reclusive, immature eccentric who is a victim of his own delusions and self-importance. Reality probably lies somewhere in between. If you are a fan of George Lucas and/or his movies, you will probably want to read this book, but it doesn't cover any ground that hasn't already been covered."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"I finally finished this book - it took me weeks! I had to keep putting it down due to nausea. I should have quit while I was ahead. It was slow, boring and torturous. Shame on me for buying the book - shame on me for reading it. I equate it with a tabloid cover story, maybe worse. It lacked in content and was full of recounted heresay by &quot; a friend of a friend&quot;. I was looking for to learn more about George Lucas whom I have admired since I was a teen ager watching Star Wars. George Lucas has brought UNTOLD happiness into the world with his visions and all John Baxter likes to point out is that he is a short nerd whose wife left him. Who cares. John Baxter's writing in this book is full of bias and overt envy. It rambles off on tangents that make you put the book down and say &quot;what does that have to do with anything? &quot; I kept reading because I had read a review that stated that Baxter was won over in the end. Well I missed something. I don't agree with John Baxter at all and his inference that George Lucas sort of stumbled through his life and kept getting breaks because he was surrounded by competent people. John Baxter was quick to point out every failure (Howard the Duck)- and lose focus on the successes (ILM, Skywalker sound). It seems to me that George Lucas earned his &quot;incomprehensible wealth&quot; through hard work and sacrifice. That's the one thing I gleened from the book throught the heavy envy. This book was ridiculous. If you are a fan of Star Wars or Raiders please don't bother reading it. You will just be annoyed by the heresay.

Baxter has nothing positive to say either about Lucas the man or any of his films. While the narrative is generally factual, he seems to take every opportunity to attack the subject as a misanthrope, a poor businessman, an exploiter of others, and generally a maker of worthless films. Furthermore, there is practically nothing in this volume that can't be found in a work that doesn't tear Lucas down.I don't know why John Baxter decided to write this book. Why does a self-proclaimed world-class writer invest the years of research, then proceed to write 400 pages on a subject that clearly means nothing to him?"},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"This was the first real biography I read of George Lucas; since it I have read Dave Pollock's Skywalking, which is a far better and balanced look at the creator of Star Wars, George Lucas.John Baxter's bio on Lucas is really mean toward its subject. In his narrative of the filmmaker's life he routinely slams Lucas, pointing out all the mistakes George made in his life and never really focusing on the happiness Lucas has brought to millions of moviegoers with the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films. In the end, it seems Lucas wins over Baxter with The Phantom Menace, but considering how much Baxter seems to hate George Lucas, I think I'm reaching a little bit.Not only does Baxter hate Lucas, his book is littered with typos and errors. He never once gets the name of Steven Spielberg's college--Long Beach State--right (he calls it the University of California, Long Beach at one point and California State College, Long Beach in another). He mangles some of the details of The Phantom Menace as well (says that Valorum was played by Ian McDiarmid, when it was Terence Stamp who really played him). Some of the more gossipy parts in the book are backed up with shoddy references, too.Another problem is that Baxter goes off on a lot of other tangents that are only vaguely related to Lucas. For instance, he discusses what Francis Coppola was doing while Star Wars was being produced, and the problems Star Wars' director of photography--Gil Taylor--had with Stanley Kubrick. Better editing would have eliminated these parts.If you want a better and more balanced account of George Lucas' life, read Skywalking by Dave Pollock. Pollock doesn't take a critical machete to Lucas' life or films and there aren't any editorial mistakes."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"I've always been a Lucasfilm/Star Wars fanatic, and have always gobbled up any shred of info, whether it be about the stories, or the behind-the-scenes realm. I'm one of those fans who knows the names of the modelmakers responsible for those great, worn ships in the original film.And while I am a bit over the top in regards to what I know, this in no way absolves John Baxter for the mountainous errors in his work. Just because I'm sharp on a lot regarding Lucas doesn't mean that Baxter's innacurracies won't be such a sin if they fall on uninformed ears.I won't go through each and every flaw, but let me just warn you that this book drops the ball repeatedly regarding what Lucasfilm fans would call rudimentary data.I t's best to bypass this mess and select David Pollock's &quot;Skywalking&quot; instead. It's the oldest and still the best bio on this great talent. Another book that proved to be immensely entertaining (though only covering the era of the first trilogy) was Garry Jenkin's &quot;Empire Building.&quot; If it's behind the scenes Star Wars stuff you're after, then this is absolutely THE book to get.In closing, I'm most disappointed with Mythmaker because it pales in comparison to Baxter's Steven Spielberg bio released a few years before. It makes me wonder how accurate (or innacurate) THAT bio was....."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"This is quite a comprehensive biography of George Lucas' life to 1999, reaching all the way back to his grandfather's time, and then to George Sr.'s time, before starting in on the life of the man who brought you Star Wars and Howard the Duck. Baxter writes with an engaging style and includes interviews with primary and secondary school friends that show the depth of his due diligence. Be warned that this is not a biography that tries to present everything Lucas in a strictly positive light (Baxter gives examples of the Lucas machine's attempts in essence to re-write the legends surrounding its god). As any good biography should, this book includes not only the shining chapters of Lucas' life, but the less glorious ones as well. Still, the chapters that depict Lucas as a cold, asexual, genius do not detract from our admiration of him as a filmmaker, and the epic chapters that describe the underdog success of the first Star Wars film in fact allow us to re-live the moment as if we were back there in '77 cheering for the rebels in their battle against the Galactic Empire, for Lucas in his fight against the Hollywood studios.Unfortunately, as much great information as this book might have, much of it is made questionable due to some glaring mistakes in the last few chapters. Despite the immense amount of research undertaken to write such a book, it is clear that Baxter has very little \\"street\\" knowledge of American popular culture. Ky Huy Huan was not the name of the Vietnamese Chinese boy who played Short Round (and later Data, in the Goonies) in Temple of Doom. No, Tom Ryan is not the name of Harrison Ford's character in the movies based on Tom Clancy's novels. No, Terence Stamp did not play Darth Sidious in Star Wars: Episode I. And no, the Trade Federation did not have an army of C3POs. For Baxter's target audience, a readership that comes from a generation raised on the films of George Lucas, these errors are painfully obvious and completely absurd, and thus cast the entire book in doubt. This is truly a shame because Baxter has put a mighty effort into giving us a very well-rounded look at the 20th century's most influential filmmaker. Four stars for the book's captivating narrative style."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"I am a big George Lucas fan and I found a few errors in this book. The one that really bothered me was that the author repeatedly stated that Jim Henson did the puppeteering and voice for Yoda. IT WAS FRANK OZ NOT JIM HENSON! That was soooo annoying! I kept wishing that the author was around so that I could just scream it in his face!Other than these small details, the book was pretty good. But still, I can't help but wonder what else was inaccurate that I just took as new information."},{"Title":"Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas","review":"I read this book from cover to cover in less than a week (that's fast for me). The author's style finds the perfect balance between documenting facts and telling a story. Like Luke Skywalker, the hero he created in STAR WARS, George Lucas was a lonely boy who dreamt of worlds beyond his rural desert town. While his emotionally distant father (a clear inspiration for Darth Vader) made him something of a delinquent teenager (like the hot rod character from AMERICAN GRAFFITTI) it was Lucas' loving mother who made him what he is today. After nearly dying when he literally wrapped his car around a tree, Lucas awoke in a hospital bed to see his Mother crying in anguish, convinced that her directionless son would eventually kill himself. From that moment on, this quiet, shy desert farm boy devoted his life to telling stories. The book gives a fascinating history of his film school days at USC with brilliant but somewhat extremist classmate John Milius, his apprenticeship to the passionate and often scandalous Francis Coppola, to his close friendship and kinship with Steven Spielberg, and the marriage to his beautiful college sweetheart film editor Marsha Lucas which sadly ended in divorce. How his battles with studio heads who fought over mere frames just to leverage their positions in a time where the filmmaker, not the studio head, ruled. And how his plan to own the licensing rights so he could independently finance all of his movies through merchandise royalties, ironically established todays corporate studio model that has snuffed out the writer-director as the boss. If you're interested in the history of American cinema of the 60s, 70s and 80s and how the influence of counter-culture youth changed it forever, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Summer Daze (Late Elementary Piano Solos)","review":"This listing has been corrected (for the most part) since I originally wrote my review that follows.This is an incorrect representation of this book.

Keble, who was born in 1792 and is credited for having started the Oxford Movement with his Assize Sermon in 1833, was an Anglican priest, poet, and professor. \\"The Christian Year\\" is his book of poetry in which he wrote a poem for each week of the Christian year, as well as a poem for each of the services from The Book of Common Prayer. It's a work that is not much read today but that was wildly successful in the 19th century. While the aesthetic level of the poetry is second-rate compared to Keble's contemporary Romantic poets (at least the more famous ones), when read as devotional poetry that connects one to God through the Church, the Bible, the Prayer Book, and nature, the poetry still has the power to move.While the poetry of \\"The Christian Year\\" will seem outdated to most, if not actually inferior, a proper reading of it in its context will benefit not only students of history and literature but also the patient Christian reader in search of a profound devotional literary work.The full title of the work is: The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and Holydays throughout the Year. The volume begins with a \\"Morning\\" and \\"Evening\\" hymn, corresponding to Morning and Evening Prayer services, followed by a poem for every week in the Church year. These are followed by poems for the various saints' days, Holy Communion, Holy Baptism, and the occasional services. In 1828 poems for the State services were added as well.Keble's poetic life originated in his undergraduate days when he relieved his emotions by composing poetry, often on any scrap of paper he could find. When Keble began around 1819 to compose the poems that would eventually be included in The Christian Year, he had no intention of crafting his poetry into a unified companion to the Prayer Book. He apparently began while a tutor at Oriel College, inspired by his tours back and forth between Oxford and his home in Fairford. Keble's own theory of poetry illuminates the personal and individual aspect of poetry from which his own poetry originally flowed: \\"Let us therefore deem the glorious art of Poetry a kind of medicine divinely bestowed upon man: which gives healing relief to secret mental emotion, yet without detriment to modest reserve: and, while giving scope to enthusiasm, yet rules it with order and due control.\\" Keble's poetry, in keeping with his theory, was written first and foremost for the comfort of his own soul. Its most immediate impression was on that of his close circle family and friends, who universally found something new and powerful in the poems. The comfort for the individual soul that the poems brought appears frequently in the correspondence and remains of Keble's family and friends prior to its publication.Keble continued writing poetry for his own benefit in the 1820s, and, at some point not apparently recorded in Keble's correspondence or in the memoirs of those who knew him, he decided to arrange the poetry so that a poem would be provided for each holy day in the Church year. By 1825 Keble wrote a friend, \\"I have got a few attempts at hymns by me, which I have from time to time written, principally for my own relief . . . . My plan was to have one, if I could, for every Sunday & holiday in the year: taking the hint for the subject of each from something or other in the proper Psalms or Lessons for the day.When he did publish the work in 1827, he added to it his own Advertisement, in which he admirably sets out his aims: \\"The object of the present publication will be attained, if any person find assistance from it in bringing his own thoughts and feelings into more entire unison with those recommended and exemplified in the Prayer Book.\\" Keble makes clear that his goal in publishing his poetry was to have his readers use The Christian Year as a companion to the Prayer Book. A better summary of the purpose and effect of The Christian Year could not be found than what Keble himself wrote in his Advertisement. Keble also expected that his poetry, along with the Prayer Book, would provide a \\"sober standard of feeling in matters of practical religion.\\" The Liturgy, he said, disciplined the tempers which need disciplining in such an age of excitement.There is, therefore, a dual origin and dual purpose of The Christian Year. The original poetic impulse for the poetry came from Keble's own desire to express himself as an individual soul addressing His God, often out of a need for comfort. This original source for the poetry was then fitted for use as an Anglican devotional manual which had specific reference to the Prayer Book. This dual origin and purpose of the poetry is highly significant for explaining the astounding success of the poetry in the nineteenth century and its continuing value.A work of High Church devotional poetry, at a time when interest in poetry in general was beginning to wane, was not expected by many to succeed. Keble himself thought that nothing would come of it. \\"I remember, when it was first in the press,\\" Isaac Williams wrote, \\"coming with Keble out of Baxter's printing-office, when Keble said, \`It will be still-born, I know very well; but it is only in obedience to my father's wishes that I publish it, and that is some comfort.'\\" Keble's perpetual embarrassment by his success provides further evidence that he was never prepared for, and thus never expected, the success he achieved.The Christian Year enjoyed an immediate, lasting, and enormous success. The 1827 first edition of 500 needed little time to sell out and persuade Parker of the need for a second edition. The second edition of 750 also sold out within a few months, and a third edition of 1250 was published around March of 1828. The total number of copies sold in the first year alone, combining the sales of the first three editions, was at least 2500 copies, while the total sold for the first ten years was 26,500. By 1873 when the copyright had expired, 158 editions had been published by Parker, the original publisher, and 379,000 copies had been sold by the same date. My research indicates that approximately 1,000,000 copies of \\"The Christian Year\\" were sold in the 19th century, and many used volumes are available, as well as a plethora of modern reprints.Christians from many different denominations read The Christian Year. One writer said that the spiritual life and feeling of Keble's poetry \\"exist in Christian hearts, whether reared under Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Nonconformist influences.\\" My research indicates that a great number of major figures in the 19th century had read \\"The Christian Year,\\" and many people had virtually memorized it. Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Christina Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, William Gladstone, and many other have left testimony to having read \\"The Christian Year.\\"Those who read The Christian Year most faithfully, however, were likely to be Anglicans due to its connection with the Prayer Book. Many people read Keble's poetry week by week for years: the vast majority of these were Anglicans. This is what one would expect, since the contents of the book were based on an Anglican Church year, a specifically Anglican lectionary, and services which were often specifically Anglican.Finally, many readers of the 19th century wrote that \\"The Christian Year\\" did more to promote High Church and Catholic principles than the Tracts for the Times because Keble wrote through the vehicle of poetry and a poetry that appealed to all Christians, even while it subtly expressed Catholic ideals of the Church and a sacramental worldview."},{"Title":"Colfax","review":"My grand parents lived in Colfax at the time of their death.

This is confirmed by the late Lester Bangs, so no doubts are accepted. (And I agree.) This book covers some two hundred dates in the period 1988-89 his then current band worked. Gibbs, a survivor of the UK Subs, is asked to join the band by Andy McCoy, a Johnny Thunders-inspired fellow from Hanoi Rocks, and then begins a tour that covers small clubs in the hinterland to Texas Stadium to Brazil, Japan, and even parts of the wilds of Canada to New Zealand and Australia. Iggy is married at the time and civilized, and so is merely a ticking time-bomb (as opposed to the usual exploding one), and thus quits cigarettes and hard drinking. (But check out his Miami temptations.) We hear of the life suffered by those forced to live in 5-Star hotels. the horrors of having to say no to groupies, the pain of Iggy taking the author's last bottle of cognac--yet it all adds up to a pleasant and literate read; the work of man who knows what of he speaks and does it well. While all readers with a knowledge of Iggy would await a book by, say, Ron Asheton, this one will do."},{"Title":"Neighbourhood Threat: On Tour WIth Iggy Pop","review":"In the sleazy, fly-by-night world of rock'n'roll there are many pretenders to the throne, but few true legends. And in that select group of larger than life icons, few can lay claim to having made a deeper impact than one Iggy Pop (a.k.a. James Osterberg). His groundbreaking work as frontman for the explosive Stooges from the late 1960s through the mid-'70s, as well as his later solo albums (including collaborations with David Bowie) challenged the established ideas of how a rock band could look, sound and behave.By the time Iggy recorded \\"Instinct\\" in the late '80s, the L.A. glam metal scene had taken the music biz by storm, and the album's sound perhaps reflected Iggy's desire to fit in commercially after a series of poorly received albums. For the subsequent tour, Iggy assembled a band of seasoned pro's--including former UK Subs bassist Alvin Gibbs and the eccentric ex-Hanoi Rocks guitarist, Andy McCoy. Many months of touring followed in the U.S. and abroad--and while Gibbs indulged in the offstage debauchery, he obviously also observed the goings on around him with a keen eye and ear. The result was \\"Neighborhood Threat: On Tour With Iggy Pop\\" a compulsively readable first-hand account of a major rock tour with none of the dirt excised for the faint of heart.\\"Neighborhood Threat\\" unflinchingly captures Iggy at his best and at his worst: onstage, backstage and out on the town. Gibbs also took care to document the real life \\"Jim Osterberg\\" side of Iggy, providing a more fully-fleshed portrait of this rock immortal than any other writer. In addition, Gibbs delves into the excesses of ex-bandmate Andy McCoy whose personal demons may have cost him opportunities at greater glory."},{"Title":"The Paterno Legacy","review":"This is an excellent guide to the web.

He wrote books that perhaps were not literary masterpieces but contained a certain kind of fear that seems to be lacking in todays crime books.This is his most mainstream book and it takes some getting used to as it is a bit slow at places but it really does pick up at points throughout the book and contains the quiet horror of people making mistakes that change their lives forever.Worth a read."},{"Title":"Heed the thunder","review":"Heed the Thunder takes place in rural Nebraska over a period of several years starting somewhere around 1910. Civil War veteran Lincoln Fargo presides over his extended family with the help of his God fearing wife, Pearl. As the story begins, their daughter Edie Dillon and her young son Robert arrive from Oklahoma to live with them. It seems that Edie's husband has deserted her and Robert, leaving the two of them in dire financial straits. Readers familiar with Thompson's early life will recognize the autobiographical underpinnings of this book. Young Robert Dillon is a stand-in for the author and Edie is a dead ringer for Thompson's mother, Birdie.First published in 1946, Heed the Thunder predates the many dark, disturbing, noirish paperbacks that would secure Jim Thompson his status as a cult hero. Because it is billed as \\"perhaps the most mainstream of Thompson's novels\\", I was expecting it to lack the tough edginess one usually associates with Thompson's work. I was wrong. Here are just three of the many examples of brutality and depravity to be found in this book:A dishonest preacher is unceremoniously tarred and feathered.A misbehaving schoolboy receives a harsh beating and is permanently disfigured.There's an incestuous affair between cousins. As shocking then as it would be now.Heed the Thunder has a large cast of very interesting and richly drawn characters and several intriguing subplots that unfold as the narrative progresses. There is much humor of the kind that will remind readers of Mark Twain. Like when an impoverished lawyer makes a name for himself by bringing a lawsuit against God. And there's plenty of social criticism, especially when it comes to the subject of inhumane working conditions.In fact, there's so much material here, Thompson could easily have written Heed the Thunder as a 600+ page epic. Instead, he wisely opted to keep the length down to half that.This novel gives an intriguing account of life on the plains of Nebraska in the early years of the 20th century. The hardscrabble lives lived by most of the characters are presented in an unvarnished manner. The humiliating poverty, the appalling ignorance and the inescapable cruelty which pervaded everyday existence are all unapologetically exposed. All in all, this is an intriguing and substantive book which forshadows the frighteningly disturbing, brutally stark type of novel which would soon become Jim Thompson's trademark."},{"Title":"Heed the thunder","review":"This is a noir classic. The whole town of Verdon in Nebraska is filled with conflicts, and everyone has a vendetta.This book is also horrific as well, as Thompson at times tries his hand at horrifying the reader. I don't believe this novel is for everyone, but as the back cover suggests, everyone who enters this town should carry a .45."},{"Title":"Heed the thunder","review":"I disagree with these other reviewers. Yes, this book has slow parts, but the good parts are so good, so unique, so ridiculously awesome that it easily earns 5 stars. The horror elements will scare you for the rest of your life, and to hear the characters muse about war and environmentalism you will realize how way ahead of his time Thompson was. Yes the writing is a little rough but the ideas are there."},{"Title":"Aa Explorer Japan (Explorers)","review":"There is the sad thing: sometimes big corporations like AA (and they ARE big in UK, selling everything from roadside rescue to insurance to travel booking) think they can also be publishers and sell books on the strength of their very strong brand.I can almost see them coming up with the idea. &quot;Let's get someone to write this stuff, we'll get some nice pictures from agency libraries, some kinda map, and bingo!&quot; Sorry, it doesn't work like this. You need some knowledge and experience and skills in travel writing business, and just because it's a big business and you're a big company does not guarantee success.The book does not position itself anywhere, really. It tries to be as pictorial as Eyewitness Guide or Insight Guide but there is a distinct feeling of everything done in a hurry and on tight budget.As for practicalities, it doesn't even try. It's just an eclectic collection of semi-relevant factoids. You could write a guide like this without ever actually going to the country.And for maps - who called them &quot;clear&quot;? They're awful. I could draw you a better map myself, and I am no cartographer. Map depicting a river and a dozen of main streets? Wow, that's helpful, thank you very much. It's good these guys are not in charge of defence or anything serious; on this occasion, they stayed in the business of producing a bad guidebook which hopefully not many people will buy.Avoid like a plague."},{"Title":"When a Woman Discovers Her Dream: Finding God's Purpose for Your Life","review":"I digested every word written in this book.

Jim Walker takes the novice writer from a blank piece of paper to a complete poem by offering direction and creative ideas that will engage the mind. I've been writing for several years, and gleaned so many new concepts from this book. The topics of revision, language, subject matter, and form are systematically detailed for the reader to follow. And for anyone who has ever had writer's block, the variety of writing excercises alone in this book make this a valuable poet's tool."},{"Title":"Poetry Report: Creative Ideas and Publishing Strategies for Aspiring Poets","review":"\\"Poetry Report\\" is a must have for any aspiring poet as well as those who are more experienced. Jim Walker takes his considerable knowledge of poetry and experience as a professor and passes this information to the reader. However, this isn't one of those \\"more gifted than thou\\" books in which the author parades his superiority; the subject is presented in a \\"user friendly\\" format even the most novice poet can understand. The exercises within the book are designed so that beginners can easily understand poetry and learn how to write it.Each chapter contains simple exercises geared toward finding the poetry in everyday circumstances. The reader simply has to take a pen, notebook, and a little time to work through the examples. For each exercise, Walker provides a sample poem showing the reader what the resulting poem may look like. But he makes sure to point out that each poem the reader completes will be unique and not to worry about emulating the \`professionals'. Also, there's a great chapter with interviews from actual, published poets. It's interesting to read how poetry has affected their lives, and provides examples of poetry at its best.Though \\"Poetry Report\\" is clear and concise enough for a beginner to enjoy, it's challenging for more experienced writers. The exercises given provide a greater understanding of poetry, as well as tools to take their own poems from \`good' to \`great' - crucial for any poet who wants to take their work \`to the next level'. Also, the chapters dealing with publishing are essential for those desiring to share their poetry with the world.Walker's love of poetry and enthusiasm for helping writers shines through. As someone who has taken two of Prof. Walker's classes, I can affirm that he sincerely believes and practices what he says in the book. As for me, \\"Poetry Report\\" is a reference book I'll easily keep in reach along with \\"The Elements of Style\\", \\"On Writing\\", and Webster's Dictionary. The information contained within is that essential to every aspiring and experienced writer.Poetry is a way of life. With this book, anyone can develop an appreciation for the craft as well a life long love of writing poetry."},{"Title":"Fostoria American : A Complete Guide (4th Edition)","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK.

Even though this has happened to some extent, it is fascinating to read this book. In it, the author is calling for an alignment, common respect, and better understanding between religion and psychology. But the book goes further in getting us to look at ourselves in different areas. It almost seems impossible to not have these two great forces that help mankind working together. One of the greatest quotes on tolerance I ever read \\"I do not agree with what you say, but I defend your right to say it to the death\\" is in this book. Just got an original copy of the follow up book \\"Hope for Man\\". Looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"For a light and quick weekend read, Jill Churchill's Fear of Frying fit the bill. For those of you unfamiliar with Churchill's Jane Jeffrys series (of which this is the ninth installment), amateur sleuth Jane is a single mother who likes to cook and/or eat, and has a detective boyfriend (a no-show in this story) and a best friend named Shelley. Despite the title, Jane doesn't do much cooking here, though it does give a hint with regards to the murder weapon of choice.Along with various other people in their social circle (including two car dealership execs and their wives, a high school principal and her complacent husband), Jane and Shelley volunteer to spend a few days to evaluate Camp Sunshine, a wilderness resort which owner Benson Titus hopes to contract to the area school district for summer programs. Shades of Allan Sherman's &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah&quot; are evident during this trip as a bit of heavy rain spoils the atmosphere for Jane and Shelley, but not so much as the lifeless body of car dealership owner Sam Claypool which they discover lying by a doused campfire.When Sam turns up alive later that evening, and the rest of their working vacation is marred by environmental activists, a washed-out bridge leading to freedom and a grumpy sheriff, Jane and Shelley are hardly happy campers. All the same, it's fun to read. I hated camp, I sympathize entirely.Fear of Frying may be predictable for some, but as a cozy read it works: I enjoyed being introduced to Jane and Shelley and hope to become more familiar with them in the future. They play off each other with good humor, they seem like real people and their ability to rely upon observation rather than blatant snooping is reminiscent of Christie's Miss Marple. A good read to take to the beach."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"Jill's former books have catchy titles, i.e. A quiche before dying, from here to paternity, a knife to remember. This shows that she has a sense of humor and it comes thru in in her books. The latest takes place at a summer camp where the parents are visiting. As you might expect, the murder takes place with a frying pan. All of her novels have the same characters which makes makes it more enjoyable as you feel (if you have read all her books, as I have) that you know the characters. Ms. Churchill deserves a good following."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"Jane Jeffrey, suburban housewife and sometime detective, accompanies her friend Shelley to learn more about a summer camp for their community's students. What they never expected though was the remote campsite, interesting guests and murder.Fear of Frying is the 9th book in the Jane Jeffrey series which I first began reading in 1998. The series began with the recenly widowed Jane as she helps to solve the murder of a local housekeeper in Grime and Punishment and has continued with other murders and personal events. Note the clever titles based on other well known book titles.For the most part I have enjoyed all of Ms. Chruchill's books and Fear of Frying is no exception. I am also in the process of reading the author's second series, the Grace and Favor series which began with Anything Goes.If you enjoy light and cozy tales of murder and mayhem, consider reading either of these series and enjoy."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"I started the Jane Jeffry series with &quot;A Farewell to Yarns&quot; (being interested in knitting) and have since progressed to reading all of them - at a rate of 2 per week-end. While much enjoying the descriptions of the day-to-day life of a suburban American housewife (particularly the food she prepares!) - my time is limited, which means that my own housekeeping has gone completely to pot. However a little dust never hurt anyone and they are most entertaiing - to the extent of bearing re-reading."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"Jane and Shelley, who are best friends, camp out at a camp resort that has invited several people. The \\"camp\\" atmosphere is very cozy. I thoroughly enjoyed the camp activities, and Jane and Shelley's friendship.This book is full of food, fun, adventure, coziness, interesting people, murder, and a very interesting plot. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves cozy mysteries.Although I probably say this about every book in this series, but I think this book is one of the best in the series. Actually, this whole series is so fun and cozy. And some of them have really \\"fun\\" atmospheres, such as this \\"camp\\" atmosphere."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"Friends Jane and Shelly head for the woods and chaos ensues (big surprise).

This is really a bad moment for Jane and Shelley as they're the ones that discovered the body to begin with! Great, fun mystery."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"Each book in a cozy mystery series usually has a theme and the theme of Fear of Frying was summer camp. Having been a camp counselor in my youth, this was of particular interest to me and I wasn't disappointed with the treatment it was given. Fear of Frying veered away from the series usual format focusing on Jane and Shelley and leaving the usual supporting characters behind. While necessary for the theme of the novel to be realistic, the lack of familiar interaction made Fear of Frying a little less engaging then the other books in the series. As with all the Jane Jeffry mysteries, Fear of Frying was a fluffy, fast bit of fun."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"Fear of Frying is a very light easy to read mystery. The downside is the story is very predictable which hard core mystery fans might find disappointing. Also although the main plot is wrapped up the minor side plot involving the evil environmental extremist group and the resort is never resolved, although one could argue this makes the book a lot more realistic. The fact remains though that this story is very enjoyable and has characters many will be able to familiarise with from those they come across everyday in the real world. A short read only 206 pages in large print, if you've got a few hours to kill you won't be disappointed by picking this up.In Fear of Frying a couple of middle aged women set off for a rural resort in the Wisconsin Woods. They are one of a number of couples assessing the resort and its programs as to its suitability to be an external educational facility for leadership camps and the like. They can't get enough of the high quality food and luxuries but when they search for a missing watch at a rural cookout site they are shocked to discover the body of one of their fellow assessors with a frypan beside it. When they go to inform the lodge and the police they are further shocked when the sheriff tells them there's no dead body there. Insisting there is they are further humiliated when the corpse walks through the door without the frypan head injuries they described. Embarrassed they sneak off to their cabin but after a nights sleep are determined to discover what really happened and restore themselves in the eyes of their fellow assessors and the resort owners."},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","review":"The opening scene, a journey to a wilderness camp, captured my interest instantly, especially following Jane's angst about whether she would have to resort to \\"peeing in the woods.\\" Would this truly be a resort to relish, as Shelly was working too hard to promise? Loved the way, upon arrival at the camp, Jane's angst was suddenly soothed by the actual nature in \\"nature,\\" simultaneous to Shelley's greater fears being augmented.Jane's spirits began their sap rising routine when she saw the fresh coat of paint on the camp's welcome signs. Her spirits continued the upward surge as the birds, bees, flowers & trees began randomly staging their magic.Shelley's spirits were fried like a finger in a light socket when, arms bundled with beauty enhancements dangling electrical cords, she discovered the cabin's kerosene lantern sans electrical accouterments.I won't say more about that; wouldn't want to spoil the fun of your discovering in-plot the interesting ambiance of this unusual camp's arrangement of just the right luxuries couched within an almost Amish austerity. With the joys of both maximist and minimalist tendencies mixed chust so, I could make-do with this setup, especially within the pages of a book.Rubbing my virtual fingers together, I willingly showed up for the breakfast \\"continuum\\" of offerings, along with Jane & Shelley, drooling for crisply fried bacon, scrambled eggs and Velveeta (that rich brand would be my cheesy addition to the plot), balanced with a cantaloupe slice and molasses-bran toast from the health side of the food group. I like to mix health business with spiritual pleasures, as long as I'm not being fooled by the fake food fru fru.What I wonder is what will pseudo-science do when Mulder and Scully finally place Truth into a Common Knowledge medium, as a last-ditch message to save the health of humanity on its last legs and breath, after that pair of rogue FBI agents join forces with Marshal McCluen (Marshall McLuhan), and conglomerate his clues within the Truth Track, on the wrack in the Village Green for all to see.Okay. All right already. I'll untie the above syntax knot.A fear of frying is what it's all about all right.And what I really want to know is HOW did that fear get so built up to fly in everyone's face when they were chust trying to eat a good Amish, farm fresh, hearty-for-the-heart breakfast.While I'm on this, \\"And-what-about...\\" track, what about the French, who do all sorts of fries, super sauce meat drippings by adding BUTTER (they're too smart to \\"buy\\" plastic goo), and have the grace of gall to not die of collective heart attacks?Huh? Huh?What about that???Why don't they die like flies on the vines of cholesterol?And, do NOT copy out and use \\"DUH\\" as an excuse.McDonald's is \\"to die for\\"; it is NOT to die from.When are we Americans going to get. A. Clue. Maybe a Coke, too.Guilt is the USA's most abundant commodity, and we're selling the heck out of it, as non-profit agents, of course. Wouldn't want to earn a buck then be told to give it away, instead of spending or saving it for ourselves.We use that self-replicating commodity (guilt) like super glue to stick every pseudo-science tenant to our foreheads. We carry on by forcing a habit of looking in the mirror at the stupid tenants, avoiding the shame of seeing the eyes of that starving soul looking back at us, sadly wondering why we believe that to be Good we're supposed to kill the flavor in life.And what would we see in that mirror if we looked beyond the false-god tenants (which are very difficult to read, not just because they're smudged full of Sacred Fertilizer, but because they're reversed by being reflected through a mirror)?Maybe we'd see someone blessed to not be starving (because he's living in a wealthy country), who's been cursed to eat only food with the flavor religiously leached out.It's not the fear of frying, precisely, which has us brainless and clueless. BTW, my friend Dr. BJ Ferrell noted that the brain is 90% cholesterol. Cholesterol is not only a GOOD thing; it's vital to the health of the nervous system, including the backbone, which we have less and less of.It's the fear of ...Lost my train of thought again. Forgot to put enough butter on that molasses bran toast I mentioned above, so my thoughts got off track and took on a tangent. Then one of my prime soap box collections slipped under my feet. That's my excuse for spouting off at the mouth when I might not know what I'm talking about.Anyway, this novel caught my attention instantly and held it like super glue throughout the subplots, machinations, schemes, and dreams coming true about luxury bathrooms in the wilderness.But, the real question is, did Jane have to pee in the woods?In conclusion I might note that I felt a healing force work its way back in time, through my early history, as I skated through the mystery menagerie with Jane & Shelley within the scrumptious setting of this particular summer camp. My personal experiences with summer camps were all literal nightmares, which made this vicarious adventure such a deeply enthralling read that it chust may have erased the scars from that ugly history.Can you beat that? Probably.But I'm thankful for my new well-being which arrived at the conclusion of living through this story (which in a Jane novel is always a sunny-side-up or over-easy treat).What a gift for the price of a paperback.Maybe if more people regularly read the escape fiction of their tastes, the medical profession might have to worry. There's something very health shoring in the sensual process of reading a good novel with the heavy head cushioned atop a few cozy pillows feather-touched and fluffed by butter-colored lamplight.Before I close my mouth and eyes on the last page of FEAR OF FRYING, I should mention that there's a book in the Jane Jeffry series which opens more directly along the lines of my above diatribe on unfair food bashing. That book is THE CLASS MENAGERIE. Need to get it. For my health.Linda ShelnuttP.S. Marshall McLuhan wrote THE MEDIUM IS THE MASSAGE (implying more than \\"message\\"). I visited the Amazon buying page for that book to check spelling of his name. The 15 customer reviews there were amazingly insightful as well as delightfully (and crisply) worded. Even the slight criticisms felt clean, clear, and honestly helpful. Without reservation, I voted \\"Yes\\" on each of the 15 reviews. They told me more about the book than I \\"got\\" when I read it in college, umpteen Ages ago, and returned to memory and life what I did get. Borm in 1947, I'm in the Baby Boomer crowd.

Cohen's writing is several cuts above the usual hack quality found in car books. Alas, he is awfully focused on Alpina, Hartge, etc., and skimps on info on the M models that are presumably the subject of the book! More detail on what, for instance, makes an E34 M5 different and special, or what are all the mods made to the E30 M3 that make it such a big deal, and how did it do in racing? None of this is addressed; rather, he spills a lot of ink on detailing every nuance of every Alpina product made in the last 30 years. If he wanted to write a history of Alpina, that's fine, but the cover, title, and description of the book leads one to believe that its principal focus is M and the products thereof.Nonetheless, the book is still several cuts above MBI's usually atrocious quality standards, and makes for an interesting evening of reading."},{"Title":"BMW M-Series and Performance Specials (Sports Car Color History)","review":"This is a very good book. Goes into great detail on BMW's history of performance special cars, how this came about, and where Alpina and Schnitzer and even Hartge fit into this. However, there is clearly a slant towards Alpina. The author does state however that Alpina has more of an &quot;in&quot; with BMW than the other tuners and therefore is a bit more respected. There is great detail on engine specs, displacement, special models, and even production numbers for each model. He details the evolution of the 2002, then goes through the 3, 5, 6, and 8 series. There is a section on the M1 also. Whenever possible, the author seems to mention whether any of a certain type of car were ever imported into the U.S. or not. He includes a description of the U.S. grey market in the 80s in the beginning of the book. The pictures in the book are fantastic and almost all are in full color.

What it does contain is background information and formulas for a bunch of the most common situations you'll encounter in computer graphics.This book covers a lot of ground in relatively few pages, making it a tight read. It moves through Algebra, Trig, and Geometry, along the way covering such topics as 2D and 3D transforms, perspective, and Beziers. Most of the topics in the book are explained in sufficient detail in a small amount of space. The author makes great and liberal use of diagrams and pictures, which I find particularly helpful to understanding the material since math isn't one of my strong points.There are also straightforward examples that demonstrate the mathematical principles, although there is usually only one or two examples per topic. This can be difficult if, like me, you have problems &quot;getting it&quot; without lots of examples to chew on.As a software engineer, I enjoy figuring out how things work. And in that respect, this book is great. I have some experience dabbling in OpenGL, and I've read several other computer graphics texts that were laden with code examples but lacking in adequate explanations of the math being used. I have also read basic math books that were not geared towards computer programming topics, which made application and transfer of the mathematical threory difficult. This book filled the gap for me, taking me from thinking things like &quot;Hey, look what I can do with OpenGL&quot; to &quot;Hey, I know how OpenGL is doing that!!&quot; Well, maybe I don't know *exactly* how OpenGL works behind the scenes, but because of this book I have a much better understanding of basic computer graphics.Highly recommended, especially if you don't have a strong math or computer science background."},{"Title":"Essential Mathematics for Computer Graphics fast (Essential Series)","review":"This book is terrific. The word &quot;fast&quot; in the title hints that you are only going to get a superficial overview of various topics, but this is not the case: you actually come away with an UNDERSTANDING of the topics. The chapter on interpolation is a case in point... I came away being able to derive cubic interpolants, which means that I UNDERSTOOD cubic interpolants. The discussion on quaternions paved the way for me to be able to use them, and the chapter on Bezier curves and patches also gave me an excellent foundation on which to begin using them in OpenGL. In short, I guess this is just one of those magical books in which the author knows how to explain complex subjects in a simple, direct manner. This book is excellent, and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Essential Mathematics for Computer Graphics fast (Essential Series)","review":"I love that the author was able to fit so much into so few pages.

The outcome was catastrophic and a bad situation became far worse as test scores dropped, schools were closed, and many employees lost their jobs. Interestingly enough, the turnaround team has been hired by both the New Orleans and New York Public Schools to consult within the past 2 years.

Add to this mix the impact of decisions made by a high-priced business turnaround team, none of whom had any experience in the field of education, which resulted in decreased test scores, huge loss of accreditation points, and lack of basic services.

The students who have checked it out, tested the recipes and then discussed it with me say the recipes are rather challenging or taste decidedly un-delicious. I still like it because, hey, it's from Roald Dahl and his family and features food photos inserted in Quentin Blake's stylized illustrations. It's good fun to read or skim, but the cooking technique side is rather weak.

The latest edition of \\"The Oxford Dictionary of Art\\" carries on that tradition.The guide offers to the general reader an excellent grounding in the facts and philosophies that underlie the media. The entries cover artists, movements, museums (with addresses and websites), materials and, in the back, a chronology listing key works and when they were completed.While it sometimes falls into the thicket of scholarly jibber-jabber -- and one should recognize the possibility exists while trying to describe visual art using only words, in a book which contains no pictures -- the dictionary is even-handed in describing the critical reaction to a work. With its wide range of descriptions, both geographically and chronologically, this revised guide allows armchair art appreciators to brush up on their learning."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms","review":"Although this book is much less popular than Goldberg's and Mitchell's, it is the most complete reference on evolutionary algorithms in my opinion. If you're looking only for an introduction to EAs, this may not be the perfect book for you (the 2 other ones are more concise) but if you're seeking a detailed review of foundations of EAs, this book is excellent. It provides mathematical insight, and examples of how to implement such algorithms."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms","review":"I don't really know why this book didn't sell as well as some of the other standard books in evolutionary algorithms. It's much better in many respects and presents a balanced view of the entire field, including evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, and genetic algorithms. Anyone who is interested in evolutionary algorithms should have this book...."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms","review":"In comparing this book with, say Goldberg's \\"Genetic Algorithms...\\" (may be the most popular genetic algorithms text), this book reads more like a German habilitation thesis (which I imagine it may have served as such), where as Goldberg's book seems more of a light introduction for the mathematically uninitiated. Indeed, Back's book seems quite scholarly with lots of useful references, and gives a good introduction to not only genetic algorithms, but also to evolutionary strategies (a paradigm that is most applicable to Euclidean-type search spaces) and evolutionary programming(simular to ES and not to be confused with genetic programming).I found Chapters 1 and 2 quite good, in that Chapter 1 presented the biological motivations for evolutionary computing along with a brief introduction to the theory of computation and computational complexity, while Chapter 2 gave a very good introduction to the above-mentioned evolutionary computing paradigms. The remainder of the book reads more like a report on the author's experiments in evolutionary computing.It is important to note that Goldberg's book does not cover Evolutionary Strategies, which I have found to be a more fruitful approach since it is specifically designed for Euclidean space where many if not most interesting optimization problems are formulated in.Finally, I offer bit of advice for those who plan to read through this book. Some of the definitions are stated with such generality that they seem very opaque upon first reading. It is very important to understand them, so do not give up! Once the defintions are understood, the algorithms will seem much easier to comprehend. In fact, the algorithms have a very simple outline:i) initialize populationii) while the terminating condition is not yet met: recombine to form new population members, mutate the population members, select the most fit population members to form the next generation.The partial analyses provided for the algorithms can be skipped on first reading."},{"Title":"The creative way to paint","review":"I am fortunate to have studied with Al's daughter in Dallas.

While I found some of the pictures to be quite interesting and the articles to be somewhat informative, I would still say that this is more of an overview kind of book - as opposed to a detailed version of our elections.I think the author could have picked some other pictures or visuals to make the book more appealling, and could have written in more depth about the campaigns.Nevertheless, the book is a nice book and is a book that could be used as a reference in some respects."},{"Title":"Hats in the Ring: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns","review":"This book is a must-read for following this year's election. It reviews elections from Washington to Clinton, and the history lessons it teaches will help you make a good decision in November."},{"Title":"Hats in the Ring: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns","review":"This book provides an overview of American Presidential elections from George Washington's first election in 1789 to William Jefferson Clinton's reelection in 1996.Each Presidential election from 1789 to 1996 is covered by a separate chapter. The individual chapters provide information about the character and personalities of American political figures, historical and political context for the Presidential election being covered, the major issues raised during each Presidential election, the manner in which political figures and political parties approached each election, and the results of the Presidential election. The text is supplemented by illustrations and photographs of American political figures, political cartoons, campaign memorabilia, and campaign events. The book also has many examples of colorful political nicknames, campaign slogans, strong political insults, and frequent partisan reporting that show American politics has often been raucous, with gritty, down-to-earth aspects.One flaw with the book is its uneven use of opinion: sometimes the authors' opinions are expressed in terms that are clearly identifiable as their opinions and not historical facts; other times, the authors' opinions are embedded in words and phrases that superficially appear to be factual, but actually reflect the authors' opinions more than the historical facts. A completely dispassionate discussion of the history of American political issues would be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. But, this book would have been better if the authors had been more consistent in using language that would make it clear to readers when the authors are expressing their personal opinions and when the authors are engaged in historical writing not based on their personal opinions.The book is written in a style that is suitable for members of the general public, and high school and college students. The book gives a basic look at American Presidential elections for readers interested in a brief, introductory look at the subject. But, anyone interested in more detailed, more scholarly descriptions and analyses of American Presidential elections should look for other pertinent books."},{"Title":"Hats in the Ring: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns","review":"Politics is the great American sport and its bats and balls are pins and bumper stickers. This is a great history of torchlight parades, whistle stops and all sorts of campaign paraphenalia. It makes me happy I saved that LBJ for the USA button--it doesn't take long for this stuff to acquire value. SAme can't be said for websites, though. Words and images here are also a healthy reminder that one great tradition of the sport is slamming the other guy--don't forget Jefferson's Sally Hemmings scandal and Lincoln &quot;the big monkey.&quot; More fireworks, fewer veep debate lovefests, please."},{"Title":"Hats in the Ring: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns","review":"Deep in the political season, this book makes for a good read. It is neither a complete history nor a complete pictorial of all the great campaigning photographs which abound. I was suprised by the iconic photographs not included. I wish I had leafed through this in the bookstore before buying. That said, it is a good book for any fan of political campaigns."},{"Title":"The Spy Wore Silk","review":"I especially enjoyed this book because besides being a woman who enjoys reading accounts of real life espionage, I also lived in Morocco during this period of time and appreciated the chance to hear the full story of the assasination attempts on this country's ruler from a first hand observer who was herself steeped in the intrigue and the action! James Bond may have his gadgets but Countess Aline has a personality that sparkles and apparently a wardrobe to match! :)"},{"Title":"The Spy Wore Silk","review":"Countess Aline was an American-born lady who was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services (later to become the CIA) during World War II. After training, she was sent to Spain as a spy. She subsequently married a Spanish count and continued to operate as a spy (codename = \\"Tiger\\") in Europe and elsewhere for many years. At the same time, she was raising three boys and living the privileged high society life in Spain.The best thing about Aline's books is that they really do read like novels. She highlights the most exciting and fascinating events and dispenses with the dull details. They're better than novels, though, because the events are true!In The Spy Wore Silk, Aline takes us to Morocco as she recounts her 1971 assignment to discover who was plotting to kill Morocco's King Hassan II. She participated in an elaborate ten-day hunting trip with the king's friends, advisors, and military leaders, hobnobbing with the high and mighty while sniffing out treachery. The trip turned out to be harrowing and life-threatening for Aline and others in the group, with intrigues at every turn. Her introduction to Morocco, while traveling with royalty in lavish and glittering style, is almost as thrilling as the spy story.The Spy Wore Red remains my favorite of Aline's books, but all of them are worth seeking out."},{"Title":"The Spy Wore Silk","review":"I have purchased 4 books by Aline Romanos. I absolutely love them. The fact that there is truth behind the story and that she really was an upper-class lady as well as a spy excites me. I find myself wishing I lived an adventurous life. She has a talent when it comes to recreating her life and exploits.

The OSS should be very proud of her contribution to WW II. I highly recommend this wonderful book from Amazon.\\"Countess please have your new book published here in America!\\" \\"What a life, what a book!\\""},{"Title":"The Spy Wore Silk","review":"Countess of Romanones Aline writes a pretty good thriller for a book to be fiction but based on facts. I always think these kinds of stories are far more interesting than fiction.Aline lives in Spain with her Spaniard husband but was a spy for events in Morocco, Africa. Now she lives in Marabella (southern Spain) which is just over the Mediterranean Sea from Morocco. Her travels take her to many other far and distant places like Las Vegas, Nevada, Paris, France and many other very interesting places.Countess Aline tells about the life and death of about 10 or 12 people that she was spying on. She and her husband were attacked several times also but escaped each time. Her job was to spy and report information she found back to the USA in HOPE to foiled any attempt to kill the King of Morroco. Aline does not do very much like most spys. And, she does not prevent 3 different attempts to kill the king. Although the king survives, it was not do to anything Aline does. Truly, Aline would have been more effective working as a travel agent as she did a very good job of moving from one continent to another. Give this book a read and see what you think."},{"Title":"The Standard Book of Quilt Making and Collecting","review":"This is a wonderful old-fashioned book, first published in the 1940's. The quilt patterns are nostalgic more of the 19th century, than of the early 20th century quilts. It's a fun book for book collectors. Pictures are all black &amp; white, and instructions for making the quilts are pretty minimal. Also watch out -- some of the applique patterns provided are not drawn exactly as the photographs show. Definitely not a good book for beginners, and probably of little interest if your taste runs toward the contemporary."},{"Title":"The Standard Book of Quilt Making and Collecting","review":"This book was written in the 1940's (I believe) and gives instructions on drafting quilt squares using brown paper (like the old grocery bags we used to get).

I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Standard Book of Quilt Making and Collecting","review":"482 illustrations of old patterns, black and white, of the nostalgic yesteryear, it is a delightful historical exercise in quilt making, old-fashioned work in the not-so-modern way. A person making her first quilt may have some difficulty, but it can be managed. Information on planning the quilt, calculating the number of blocks needed to fit a bed, pattern selection for a given room, and buying the materials are all here, explained in detail.

That's why I love this book's approach which enabled me to absorb the new information and gain some understanding of the world of quantum mechanics.

If you have any interest in what is happening on these frontiers of science, start with this book."},{"Title":"The Search for Infinity: Solving the Mysteries of the Universe","review":"From quarks and dark matter to the LEP synchrotron, radiation and neutrinos, this is an excellent collection of some of the highlights of our search to understand the cosmos. This is a fine historical perspective beginning with Greek philosophy, early interpretations of the speed of light and electromagnetism and moving on through sub-atomic particles, proton decay, supercolliders and the Big Bang Theory.The authors also delve into the possible sources of cosmic rays, black holes, brown dwarves and how the remnants of stars often spawn new stars and planets. Great reference book for home, school or library."},{"Title":"The Search for Infinity: Solving the Mysteries of the Universe","review":"Astrophysics today is required to observe the infinitely small, in order to find answers for the big picture.In this view the book explores particle physics before plunging into astronomy. It retraces the history of discoveries, starting from the ancient greek concept of the atom, all the way to the latest theories and discoveries made through modern particle accelerators.The book does not propose answers; it limits itself to presenting the accepted theories, and does so with an everyday language. I would say the book is at such a level that anybody with high a school level of education will be able to understand it.I would criticize the fact that the authors don't make questions that invite the reader to be more curious about the universe. We know there are inconsistencies in the existing theories but this aspect is not explored. Too bad because I think astrophysics make a very fascinating research."},{"Title":"The Search for Infinity: Solving the Mysteries of the Universe","review":"Each section begins with the understanding of the Greeks.

You look up a topic of your choice, like \\"self-delusion\\" and you will find a host of Bible verses on that topic. Unlike a concordance where you actually are looking for a specific word embedded in a particular verse, a topical Bible allows you to find verses in the Bible that may not have that word in the verse. So if you were to conduct your own study on the subject of self-delusion, for esample, you would look it up like you would in a regular dictionary (it is arranged alphabetically) and then learn the following taken directly from the Nave's Topical Bible, \\"A characteristic of the wicked, Psa. 49:18. Prosperity frequently leads to, Psa. 30:6; Hos. 12:8; Luke 12:17-19. Obstinate sinners often given up to, Psa. 81:11,12; Hos. 4:17; 2 Thess. 2:10,11.\\" And that excerpt is just the first paragraph.

Primarily, this book is a narrative of those journeys.You will most likely not be able to find a writer in English today who can write so well, with such precision and yet lightness. Mr. Pallis takes us into the mountains of Ladakh and Sikkim, with an observant eye that can identify even the rare flowers along the path. An excellent chapter by his fellow traveler C.F.Kirkus gives us a first-hand account of a mountain-climbing experience that tested the nerves of the climbers and left them exhausted.The author's prose has true elegance, yet it is limpid and direct, so that the reader can easily imagine the delights of the almost pristine Himalayan mountain valleys and passes through which the explorers passed. We are given word-pictures of monasteries, remote towns, the interesting clothing worn by a mountain tribe, the landscape as one rounds a bend or climbs up a trail ... And the author weaves into this travelogue many observations about the beliefs and customs of the people he meets along the way. The sometimes vexing, sometimes humorous vicissitudes of traveling with porters and packs add lightness to the narrative. There are notes about the history of the region ... the reader quickly realizes how little we understand of this remote part of the world.We are taken along a metaphysical path as well. One chapter is given over to an explanation of the Doctrine, as it is called among the Tibetans whom the author so admires. The Buddhist influence is seen in the context of the Tibetan (perhaps one should say Himalayan) beliefs that take the reader into a world quite apart from our materialist concerns. In other chapters, Mr. Pallis discusses, somewhat in passing, the Tantra and the deities of Hinduism. His closing section on Tibetan art may seem esoteric to some readers, but will interest others who are specialists in that area.A fine book, with some of the rarefied air of the Himalayas in it ... Remember, Marco Pallis was a noted Tibetan scholar; his book will probably not appeal to a weekend or casual reader. However, if you enjoy fine prose and good travel writing, and wish to gain a greater appreciation of the metaphysical underpinnings of Buddhist and Tibetan thought, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Peaks and lamas","review":"On an expedition to the Ganges-Satleg watershed, Marco Pallis first began to study the lamas' teachings and way of life, studying Buddhism, Tibetan living, and art. Peaks And Lamas: A Classic Book On Mountaineering, Buddhism And Tibet has long been recognized as a 'bible' on the Himalayan-Tibetan tradition of Buddhism and mountain climbing, and this edition returns to print a classic which has been unavailable for thirty years, adding fine black and white photos taken by Pallis and his friends."},{"Title":"Peaks and lamas","review":"\\"Why climb?\\" On Sikkim's Zemu slope in 1933, this pioneering explorer wonders. He imagines \\"an unseen Lama\\" whispering: \\"There can be no true achievement so long as there persists the slightest hankering after an individual enjoyment of its fruits.\\" (88) \\"The solitude to seek is the concentration of your own heart; if you have once found it, it will not matter where you are,\\" Lachhen's abbot tells this mountaineer, who, thwarted from his Himalayan conquests, is asked his true purpose. (168)The elevated register reflects Pallis' attempt to render in careful English the tone of dignified Tibetan, which he learned diligently and which later made him one of the leading interpreters of Buddhism to the West; he wrote the preface for Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa's memoir \\"Born in Tibet\\" (also reviewed by me). This account, edited in 1974 from earlier versions, never tells you of Pallis' WWI experience in the trenches, where he was shot in the knee, nor affirms clearly his own initiation into the dharma in 1936 Sikkim. The author opts for presentation of what he sees and hears and learns, more than telling you his own background (he's from a Greek family who'd moved to London), emotions, or personal insights. As the narrative deepens, the travelogue merges into a metaphysical presentation of Buddhism as encountered at the foot of lamas with whom he meets.Pallis prefers a more self-effacing storyline to emphasize how, if in understated style, his mountain expeditions in 1933 once stymied lured him and his companions (rarely mentioned once the climbing so well described in opening chapters subsides) to the frontiers where Tibetan culture dwelt, if beyond the kingdom's southern borders. He differentiates bit by bit how a Westerner starts to separate once in the Himalayas from the dominant mindset, and the chapters unfold in the same manner, unfolding a deeper, elusive, yet tangible wisdom nearly imperceptibly.For instance, compassion vs. charity early on gets defined. Buddhism favors an intellectualized concept recognizing inter-relations between all creatures, whereas the Christian-tinged view stresses a \\"usually more passionately expressed virtue.\\" (50) The Hindu label of those who deny that a believer in one faith cannot express devotion or reverence in another place of worship get denigrated as \\"pashu,\\" trapped by parochialism to condemn the practices of another sect. He contrasts this with \\"Viras,\\" or heroes. The philosophy with which Pallis later has been identified, Traditionalism, holds the unity beneath diversity of religious traditions, and the need to ground in whatever way beliefs are demonstrated a respect for roots and customs if these convey more good than evil, more sense than their abandonment would bring to a people who deny or leave behind a culturally and ethically solid practice.The way to Truth in a Tradition, Pallis holds, is like \\"a difficult mountain peak, which, though free of access to all mankind, is yet actually scaled by a chosen few, by those who are willing to pay the price in self-discipline, steadfastness, and risk.\\" (125) Most doubt if the ascent is worth the risk; a few clamber up in pain, inching along. Once in a while, as with Milarepa (whose story later Pallis translated and here sums up), a mortal makes it by a perilous \\"direct path,\\" as in Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism's \\"diamond-sharp\\" method of attaining insight.The book tells of \\"The Round of Existence\\" or the wheel of dharma, and of Tantric teachings. He does not romanticize the poverty he saw, but he does insist that spiritually, Tibet before the Communist attacks was advanced spiritually in ways we Westerners do not value. Impermanence after all came to Tibet, and for this, Pallis offers a sobering lesson in Buddhist aspiration towards changelessness. Appendices delve into the defining Tibetan doctrine of the Bodhisattva, pre-1950 landed estates and medieval/ theocratic/ feudal parallels, criminal law, and especially artistic approaches.Pallis explains deftly the demon-filled thangkas or wall tapestries: \\"Many of those diabolical-looking figures are in essence identical with those who look so gentle. The Tibetan divinities all have a variety of aspects according to the functions that they are called upon to fulfil, perhaps even more according to the state of mind of the beholder.\\" Therefore, \\"to the saint and the evil-doer the same divinity will show himself in widely differing guise. To the virtuous soul the Divine is necessarily glorious and comforting, but to an evil conscience the same can be a cause of horror and anguish.\\" (213) The abodes of gods or purgatories ultimately, as with those who populate them, are illusory revelators of what the mind suffers when it has not attained enlightenment.There is an appeal to simplicity that may have inspired future countercultural readers. Pallis lauds the 1936 Ladakh villages however poor, for in them can be found a pair of \\"intangible amenities\\": \\"time to think without the sense of being driven, and the absence of organized persuasion and regimentation at the hands of a state or of a commerce that does not fall far short of it in power.\\" (225) Vigilance, however, must be shown lest treasures of the tradition within such fastnesses decay. A visit to one dissolute monastery, Himi, finds wall paintings flaking: \\"Here the face of a Bodhisat, his finely chiselled features still composed under the impenetrable calm of Knowledge, looked out on us, though his body had all but crumbled away. There we saw a torso, there a pair of hands still making the gesture that bespeaks mercy. In a corner we discovered piles of books, volumes upon volumes, wood-block prints and manuscripts, all jumbled together, their loose leaves drifting about in hopeless confusion: who could tell what wisdom was on its way to oblivion?\\" (264) One reads this with a fearful premonition of the invasion of Tibet.Pallis updated the 1948 second ed. in his 1974 final version, and he makes asides to this decimation of so much of the Tibetan culture he loved in its far western reaches. His appended chapters discuss-- if in a clotted, denser critical fashion than a narrative that opened so clearly with its evocations of icy heights climbed by mere mortals-- how perennial wisdom impels seekers to find in suffering as justice the method of release. This is Buddhist metanoesis, a \\"radical change of heart,\\" with mercy as compassionate truth, for self-questioning draws one away from suffering through the dharma-doctrine onto the spiritual path. (313)He insists to later devotees (he knew the Geshe Wangyal in his early travels; that lama later fled during the Cold War to New Jersey where he instructed Robert Thurman and inspired Allan Ginsberg as among the first Americans to learn about Tibetan Buddhism in the U.S.) how Tradition must form the shell around the kernel of insight. Adherence to a religious practice must precede the transcendence of dogma or ritual by careful discipline through a venerable authenticity. The seeker must never mistake the emanation for the vision beyond, the trappings for the spirit within it. This reminds me of Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa's later warning about \\"spiritual materialism,\\" confusing the means with the end, attaching to the method of guidance without letting go for the ultimate goal of wisdom beyond representation.Pallis, like Trungpa, will inveigh against idolatry, confusion of the image with that beyond its manifestation. Pallis imagines a lama correcting an inquirer who puts Work or Service over Knowledge, which erodes the soul. \\"I would define it as an upsetting of the natural hierarchy, to the overvaluing of what is lower and the underrating of what is higher. Whoever holds to this principle is in no danger of misusing symbols, or of sacrificing to false gods, from the State or his own ego downwards.\\" (356) The book's tone does hover around a shift in diction as it progresses, he revised it twice. It can be daunting, like the peaks Pallis earlier has ascended on paper. The metaphysical pilgrim replaces the physical journeyer, as Pallis himself has evolved imperceptibly from English trekker to Buddhist adept, without even telling us the moment outright. This is a modest yet ambitious chronicle, not for the impatient. It rewards study and contemplation. It's not the first book I'd begin with for Buddhism. But, it deserves its place on a higher shelf, so to speak, once a newcomer surveys and charts the terrain of deeper dharma.With chapters titled \\"Porters and Sahibs,\\" \\"The Bursar of Spitak,\\" and \\"Of Missionaries and Moths,\\" this book carries a slightly antiquated air, one enhanced by the decades since which must have altered every place Pallis witnessed. He conjures up the fragile forests and harsh horizons well, and for this memento, Pallis left us with a valuable testament. Thomas Merton would ponder this work in the 1950s at his hermitage; it remains a measured, thoughtful, and composed legacy of how an English adventurer, skilled in the viola de gamba, a man of culture and taste, learns slowly to discover an alternate direction into lasting achievement, to a more satisfying triumph than planting a boot on a summit."},{"Title":"Peaks and lamas","review":"Next days, a english version.MARCO PALLIS. Peaks and Lamas. (Alfred A. Knopf, New York). - Bien qu'il ait d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; parl&eacute; ici de cet ouvrage &agrave; deux reprises (n de juin 1940 et de janvier-f&eacute;vrier 1947) nous devons y revenir encore pour signaler un important chapitre intitul&eacute; The Presiding Idea que l'au-teur y a ajout&eacute; sp&eacute;cialement pour l'&eacute;dition am&eacute;ricaine, et dans lequel il s'est attach&eacute; &agrave; d&eacute;finir d'une faon plus explicite le principe d'unit&eacute; qui est propre &agrave; la civilisation thib&eacute;taine et qui la distingue des autres formes de civilisa-tions traditionnelles. Que ce principe se trouve dans la doctrine bouddhique, cela n'est pas douteux, mais une telle constatation est pourtant insuffisante, car, dans les pays autres que le Thibet o&ugrave; elle s'est exerc&eacute;e, l'influence du Bouddhisme a produit des r&eacute;sultats trs diff&eacute;rents. En fait, ce qui caract&eacute;rise surtout la civilisation thib&eacute;taine, c'est l'importance pr&eacute;dominante qui y est donn&eacute;e &agrave; un des &eacute;l&eacute;ments de cette doctrine, &agrave; un degr&eacute; qui ne se renconlre nulle part ailleurs ; et cet &eacute;l&eacute;ment est la conception de l'&eacute;tat de Bodhisaltwa, c'est-&agrave;-dire de &quot; l'&eacute;tat de l'tre pleinement &eacute;veill&eacute; qui, bien que n'&eacute;tant plus li&eacute; par la Loi de Causalit&eacute; qu'il a d&eacute;pass&eacute;e, continue cependant librement &agrave; suivre les vicissitudes de la Ronde de l'Existence en vertu de son identification avec toutes les cr&eacute;atures qui sont encore soumises &agrave; l'illusion &eacute;gocentrique et &agrave; la souffrance qui en est la cons&eacute;quence&quot;. Une apparente difficult&eacute; provient du fait que l'&eacute;tat de Bodhisattwa. est, d'autre part, consid&eacute;r&eacute; commun&eacute;ment comme constituant un degr&eacute; inf&eacute;rieur et pr&eacute;liminaire &agrave; celui de Buddha ; or cela ne semble gu&egrave;re pouvoir s'appliquer au cas d'un tre &quot;qui non seulement a r&eacute;alis&eacute; le Vide, en un sens transcendant, mais qui aussi l'a r&eacute;alis&eacute; dans le Monde mme, en un sens immanent, cette double r&eacute;alisationn'&eacute;tant d'ailleurs qu'une pour lui&quot;, puisque la Connais-sance suprme qu'il poss&egrave;de est essentiellement \\"sans dualit&eacute;\\" . La solution de cette difficult&eacute; parat r&eacute;sider dans la distinction de deux usages diff&eacute;rents du mme terme Rodhisattwa : dans un cas, il est employ&eacute; pour d&eacute;signer le saint qui n'a pas encore atteint l'ultime degr&eacute; de perfection, et qui est seulement sur le point d'y par-venir, tandis que, dans l'autre, il d&eacute;signe en r&eacute;alit&eacute; un tre &lt;qui est identique avec le Buddha par droit de Connaissance, mais qui, pour le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice des cr&eacute;atures, \\"r&eacute;capitule&quot; en quelque sorte certains stades pour des raisons \\"exemplaires\\", afin de \\"montrer la Voie\\" , et qui, en ce sens, redescend dans la Ronde plutt qu'il n'y reste, quelle que puisse tre l'impression produite &agrave;cet &eacute;gard sur des tres toujours prts &agrave; se laisser trom-per par les apparences ext&eacute;rieures &quot; . Cette faon d'envisa-ger le Bodhisattwa correspond donc proprement &agrave; ce que nous avons appel&eacute; la &lt;r&eacute;alisation descendante&gt;, et natu-rellement, elle a aussi un rapport &eacute;vident avec la doctrine des A vatras. Dans la suite du chapitre, qu'il nous est impossible de r&eacute;sumer compl&egrave;tement ici, M. Pallis s'appli que a dissiper les confusions auxquelles cette conception du Bodhisatlwa pourrait donner lieu Si elle &eacute;tait fausse-ment interpr&eacute;t&eacute;e, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; certaines tendances de la mentalit&eacute; actuelle, en termes de sentimentalisme \\"al-truiste&quot; ou soi-disant \\"mystique&quot; ; puis il donne quel-ques exemples de ses applications constantes dans la vie spirituelle des Thib&eacute;tains. L'un de ces exemples est la pratique de l'invocation, largement r&eacute;pandue dans tout l'ensemble de la population ; l'autre concerne particuli&egrave;re-ment le mode d'existence des naldjorpas, c'est-&agrave;-dire de ceux qui sont d&eacute;j&agrave; plus ou moins avanc&eacute;s dans la voie de la r&eacute;alisation, ou dont, tout au moins, les aspirations et les efforts sont d&eacute;finitivement fix&eacute;s dans cette direction, et que les Thib&eacute;tains, mme relativement ignorants, regar-dent comme &eacute;tant v&eacute;ritablement les protecteurs de l'huma-nit&eacute;, sans l'activit&eacute; \\"non-agissante&quot; desquels elle ne tar-derait pas &agrave; se perdre irr&eacute;m&eacute;diablement.

Peyser is not a creative person so the sorry side of the book is that it remains as an outsider looking in, for Boulez's creative secrets are not revealed simply from hanging around him as she did. No you need to have studied the Boulez aesthetic, where it comes from, from the roots of modernity, Mallarme, Paul Klee, Schoenberg and recently Francis Bacon.Those books do exist and excellent one by Dominic Jameux, and there are a few on specific aspects of the Boulez aesthetic, (harmony Lev Koblyakov, one on Mallarme,another on conducting,Jean Vermeil) I still enjoy re-reading this work, Peyser knows how to tell a good story, how to pick at details of the everyday, the excitement of creating and conversing."},{"Title":"Clairvoyance,","review":"It was one of the first books by C.

The text on the pages isn't even typeset, or a \\"fresh\\" version - it is more like a xeroxed manuscript, with crooked letters, blurs, and toner spots. The binding and cover are flimsy at best. I guess what's really important are the words, and I mean, it IS the actual text of the book in its entirety, but if you have any taste for packaging or collectability, this will leave you disappointed.

I view the latter as akin to instrumenting software development, and the author does a good job of dividing the process into measurement domains. The next section addresses validation, using criterion, content, construct and empirical validity as attributes. This is an excellent taxonomy of validation.Static software measurement (discreet metrics, such as source code and quality attributes) and derived measures (variation and complexity) covered in the next two sections provide a foundation for the discussions on metrics and modeling, specification and design attributes, and dynamic measurement. These sections are a blend of concept and concrete examples most software engineers will recognize and relate to.I liked the sections on measuring testing and availability - both of these were in areas of direct personal interest, and the information contained in these sections, especially statistical testing, were excellent.The book wraps up with a section on implementing a measurement strategy, and an approach for a research plan.Overall this is a book that empowers you to develop the best measurement and metrics approach for your particular environment. It accomplishes this by providing the knowledge for understanding metrics within the context of software engineering and measurement concepts that can be employed to create a tailored strategy."},{"Title":"Software Engineering Measurement","review":"Munson shows you how to apply empirical validation to the software development process. I say software development instead of engineering because that is where the industry is happily situated at the moment. To move beyond the reality of software craftsmanship, as glorified by popular books such as \\"The Pragmatic Programmer\\", the software industry MUST embrace an engineering discipline. To that end, Munson uses proven statistical analysis methods to measure and thus quantify the use of software metrics in the software engineering process.This book is an eye opener for any software engineer. I consider it a must read..."},{"Title":"Software Engineering Measurement","review":"Excellent book on measurement techniques with solid math and statistical formulas that I worked through using Maple. The measurement process presented is a great template for getting to CMM level 4 or 5. As a software engineering manager concerned with quality, measurement and metrics I found this book to be worthy of including in our workgroup library and using it for the development of a measurement process. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Software Engineering Measurement","review":"There are better-written and more mathematically sound papers available on the topics covered.

Last summer I visited the Chamberlain Museum in Brunswick, Me. and bought this book based on the recommendation of our tour guide. I can't begin to say how wonderful I think this book is. Smith has excellent insight into Victorian character and mores, and transmits that insight to her reader. I've always thought that JLC was about 50 years ahead of his time. After reading this book, I've come to realize that part of his forward thinking might have been a product of his relationship with his remarkable wife. Fannys self sufficient persona was NOT typical of the 19th century; through Smith, the reader comes to realize Fanny was in fact 20th century in much of her thinking. The marriage of such an independent soul with the soul of a such a fair minded, yet fierce, warrior makes for a fascinating read. I read this book into the wee hours of the morning until I finished it, in about 3 days. I never thought I'd read a history book that I just couldn't put down. I'd highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Fanny and Joshua: The Enigmatic Lives of Frances Caroline Adams and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain","review":"Diane Smith offers a more intimate portrait of the relationship between Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Fannie Adams than previous writers have done. Using &quot;love letters&quot; and other family correspondence, Smith reveals not only the couple's penchant for teasing each other during courtship but also Lawrence's early bouts with depression and jealousy. Additionally she explores what might have been a budding romance between Lawrence and his cousin Hannah &quot;Annie&quot; Chamberlain. Smith interprets Fannie's sometimes independent behavior with kinder motives and gentler judgment than previous critics have offered. She insists that Fannie agreed with Lawrence's decision to join the Army and offered him her moral support during his years of service. Readers of previous Chamberlain biographies will enjoy seeing more of the Chamberlain's family life, smiling at the nicknames the couple chose for each other, sensing the heartbreak of the untimely deaths of their children and other family members, accompanying Lawrence on his several campaigns both during and after the War. Supplemented with photos (e.g., a rare snapshot of an aging Chamberlain sailing aboard his beloved Pinafore), setting the correspondence apart in italics, replete with insights and incidents previously unpublished, Smith's &quot;Fanny &amp; Joshua&quot; is a perfect supplement to Alice Trulock's great work and is surely destined to be a treasured account for all who want to know more about &quot;the hero of Little Round Top&quot; and the exemplary life and service that make him a popular and worthy hero today."},{"Title":"Fanny and Joshua: The Enigmatic Lives of Frances Caroline Adams and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain","review":"A wonderful book that &quot;fleshes&quot; out the outlines of JLC and Fanny. For years, their lives were painted with a &quot;light brushstroke&quot; yet one felt that had to be more behind these very complex people and their relationship.The author has painted a very complex picture of these two with all the dark and light hues of the palette. Fanny was not merely JLC's wife, or the Reverend's adopted daughter, but a much more complex individual who could be considered an early feminist.JLC's inner feelings about service to country and greater good are reflected and help to answer that question of why a college professor in Maine would take it upon himself to defend the country he loved to the extent he did. It is easy to understand why nothing ever again measured up to his experience of leading those men at Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Fanny and Joshua: The Enigmatic Lives of Frances Caroline Adams and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain","review":"Many biographers of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain have treated Fanny Adams as an after-thought. Some have even treated her as a subject of disdain. Ms. Smith effectively refutes those authors, using Adam's and Chamberlain's letters to one another as her primary source materials.What emerges is the vision of a strong, educated, ambitious, self-directed, courageous, emotionally-stable and patient woman, who endured every hardship brought to her home by her husband's long career of service to his country.What also emerges is a more complete picture of our nation's greatest hero. The same man who quietly endured the terrors of war, who courageously accepted an horrific wound, and who was so gracious with a defeated enemy, could become quaintly insecure when dealing with the woman he loved. The stellar academic, warrior and politician was as much of a quivering paramour as any other husband in love.For Chamberlain fans, this book offers a more human image of the titan. For everyone else, this book offers a touching tribute to the power of love."},{"Title":"Fanny and Joshua: The Enigmatic Lives of Frances Caroline Adams and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain","review":"What appears at first to be a biography of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain mainly in terms of his relationship with his wife Frances \\"Fanny\\" Caroline Adams changes direction about halfway through, with Fanny almost falling by the wayside. Using family letters as her primary source, Diane Smith is very good at tracing the courtship and early marriage of Joshua and Fanny, but falters after the Civil War years when Chamberlain was elected governor of Maine. What might conceivably be the most interesting aspect of their relationship - Fanny's deep unhappiness with Joshua and their even contemplating divorce - is barely touched on by Smith. She quotes from a long letter Joshua wrote to his wife advising against her seeking a divorce and suggests that Chamberlain might have been an abusive husband. But what does that mean? Smith never says and seems very reluctant to wade in those waters. Apparently the couple spent a great deal of time apart, and most of this time Smith spends tracking Chamberlain's life, his political affairs in Maine, business ventures in Florida, Presidency of Bowdoin College, and Civil War reminiscences, and pays very little attention to Fanny. In the preface Smith claims that Fanny became Chamberlain's \\"love, helpmate, and confidante,\\" but she doesn't illustrate much of this in the book. She also acknowledges that Fanny has been at the receiving end of much negativity in other biographies - something she implies might not be fair, but does little to dissuade her own readers from concluding as well. There is a great deal of information here on Chamberlain (though most of it is related in year-by-year list form), but if the purpose of the book was to be a dual perspective of husband and wife, Smith only met that purpose in the first half."},{"Title":"Peace with God","review":"This is what it is; medecine for the ones who are constantly searching for truths in life; ones who have a wound; an empty part of them; needing that empty part to be filled. Well the wait is over. This extraordinary book soothes the spirit as it helps one to understand the Christian Religion and the Bible to a great detail in which it makes perfect sense! For those of you who have thoughts rampaging your soul, this book will connect your thoughts together; a peaceful conscience. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Peace with God","review":"Rev. Billy Graham hits a homerun with this book, Peace with God. He has an aggressive writing style that won't leave you bored. This book was written for the everyday man, not just for theologians, it is informative, profound, and simple. If you are looking for a good Christian book, you can't go wrong with this classic. There is no hidden agenda, just the truth, and the truth will set you free. God Bless."},{"Title":"Peace with God","review":"Written in 1953, this is clearly Billy Graham's best book. It was penned for any person who wants to know how to have peace with God. \\"Peace with God\\" is a term that the Rev. Graham uses to refer to how a person becomes a Christian and a child of God. Becoming a Christian generally involves the following steps:1. Realizing our (mankind's) state of sinfulness and spiritual depravity and realizing we need a Savior.2. Repenting of our sinfulness (turning our backs on sin and the willingness to seek a new life).3. Learning how the death and resurrection of Jesus makes a new life (being \\"Born Again\\") possible.4. Accepting the sacrifice of Jesus and making him the leader and King of one's life.5. Beginning a new life in Christ, receiving his Holy Spirit, and living a life that is pleasing to God by loving others.Billy Graham's book is probably the single best book that explains the above process in detail. The reader learns what sin is, how God's law affects man and its implications for salvation, and what mankind can do through Christ to find a rock-solid secure salvation. People often hear how \\"Christ died for the sins of mankind\\", yet, many people do not understand what this means. Billy Graham makes this very clear chapter by chapter.This is a wonderfully written book and is gripping for the earnest person seeking peace with God. It helped me understand what the purpose of God's Law is, and what significance Christ's death has for every believer. Highly recommended. This book can change your future forever!Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"Peace with God","review":"This book by Billy Graham is one of the best religious books I have ever read.

He has preached to more people anyone else in history. He is a man of great faith, devotion, and character. In his book Peace with God, Graham walks us through the Christian conversion. He communicates why we need salvation, how we are saved, and who is our Savior. He explains the message of Christ in simple terms, answering typical questions one may have about Christ and salvation.If you have been a Christian for a long a time, nothing in this book will surprise you - which is good.

Milton Alexander working for Trahan's firm stole the painting, but private investigators have failed to come up with his whereabouts. Unhappy with their results, Sam decides to take charge by visiting the thief's former girl friend Zora Redwood in Brooklyn.Sam believes that Zora helped Milton with the theft. Believing she knows where the rogue is hiding he blackmails her into helping him in his quest to get to Milton by threatening to bring her to the police as an accessory as she has proof she had the painting in her apartment. Though she joins him on his quest heading to the Caribbean island of Jamaica, neither trusts the other. However, as they work together to find Milton and the masterpiece, Zora and Sam fall in love, but although danger mounts as their lives are in peril from Milton and his allies, distrust between the duo remains high.PORTRAIT OF DECEPTION is an action-packed thriller. Once the lead couple journeys to Jamaica it never slows down until the final confrontation occurs. The romance between the reluctant partners seems more an afterthought as the fine amateur sleuth chase takes center stage. Zora and Sam are a delightful distrusting lead protagonists whose love revelations seems off kilter while Milton is superbly developed as he proves over the course of the solid tale to be quite a tough villain. More for thriller fans, Janette McCarthy Louard furbishes a fine novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Portrait Of Deception","review":"Sam Trahan became the matriarch of the Trahan family after the death of his grandmother Ma Louise. Her one dying wish was for Sam to recover her family's prized possession, the Black Madonna, a portrait of her great grandmother. Since the portrait was stolen while in Sam's care, he will stop at nothing to ensure its safe return.Zora Redwood was madly in love with her fianc&eacute; Milton Alexander until the day he walked out on her. Zora was desperately trying to put the past behind and get on with her life when she is implicated as an accomplice in the theft of the Black Madonna. Milton has stolen the portrait and after two months Sam has been unable to pinpoint his whereabouts. Sam knows that the only way to find Milton would be to enlist Zora's help. However, Zora is very adamant about not helping him and tells him in so many words. Sam, who has never had a problem with getting his way, is taken by surprise when she refuses. When Sam threatens to press charges against her, Zora has no choice but to agree to help.Janette McCarthy Louard has written an interesting novel filled with suspense. The book was well-written but the author spent, in my opinion, too much time on the mystery of finding the painting rather than the budding romance between Sam and Zora. I did enjoy how the tale surrounding Rose Hall was intricately woven into the framework of this book. All in all, PORTRAIT OF DECEPTION was a wonderful read and I look forward to reading other novels by Ms. Louard.

Vashti passed away in 2006 and is buried in a small cemetery in southern Arkansas where her marker carries her name, birth date, day of her death, and the court case number of this important and historic battle. A great read of a Supreme Court decision I knew nothing about."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"Joe McGinniss is a journalist and author of numerous books. He first \\"hit it big\\" at the young age of 26, withThe Selling of the President, 1968, on the successful marketing efforts that led to the election of Richard Nixon. (Suspect he'd have to add a few \\"0's\\" to the cost of the marketing effort if he updated to cover the 2012 election). And his latest book concerns the illustrious 2008 vice-presidential candidate,The Rogue: Searching for the Real Sarah Palin. \\"Going to Extremes,\\" yet still remaining within the United States, concerns Alaska, roughly 20 years after statehood was granted, and just as the latest \\"gold rush\\" was irrupting, oil on the North Slope.McGinniss demonstrates his desire to understand the \\"real\\" Alaska by his method of entry: taking the ferry up from Washington, in November. No tourists and no mosquitoes. Everyone has some reason, besides \\"serendipity\\" for being on the boat. Often, it is some \\"problem\\" in the lower 48, and the \\"Last Frontier\\" offers a fresh slate. More felicitously, sometimes that \\"problem\\" is simply boredom. The weather extremes, at least in portions of Alaska, can shake off the ennui, and help concentrate the mind. When McGinniss reaches Fairbanks in December, it is 49 below zero, Fahrenheit. And then there is the matter of the \\"self-selection\\" of most of the residents: they tend to have more interesting stories, and McGinniss seeks to record them.The author covers virtually the entire state in the year. He is on the North Slope, in winter, at Barrow. The impact of all that oil money is overwhelming the traditional Eskimo (and yes, in the late \`70's, that word was still operative.) He captures it with this insight: \\"The creases still fresh in their mail-order Brooks Brothers suits, the Eskimo leaders planned the Arctic of tomorrow.\\" Nome and Juneau also rate visits, and in February, McGinnis spends three weeks on Crescent Lake, on the Kenai Peninsula, around 100 miles south of Anchorage. Summer eventually arrives, along with those aforementioned mosquitoes, and he experiences Bethel, and the perpetual light of the long arctic summers. For me, by far, the best part of the book is the last sixth, on the Brooks Range. The \\"occupational hazard\\" of hiking in the range is grizzly bears, and McGinniss does relate his party's encounter with them. In this section, his prose seems to be particularly evocative of the beauty of the range, enough so that it has become a \\"must-see\\" destination hopefully before I shake off this mortal coil.McGinniss covers a lot of ground in one year, and that is one of the \\"knocks\\" on this book: there is that all-too-natural tendency towards \\"parachute journalism,\\" that is, summing up a place on one's first visit, after only a week. And although Alaska was, in one sense \\"new,\\" the \\"antecedents,\\" are only very lightly covered, which, to the author's credit, he notes in his acknowledgments: \\"This is a work based largely on personal experience and it has not, therefore, involved massive amounts of library research.\\" (Though he does go on to recommend six books).Comparisons with John McPhee'sComing into the Country, which was issued around the same period, are inevitable, and I'd give a slight edge to McPhee's account. But if you are going to Alaska, both books are highly recommended. 4-stars."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"A really light book that has great stories (fiction or not) about Alaskans, it was fun and quick."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"excellent rundown of what it is really like to be/to live in Alaska. Incisive writing with humor and insight. The land and the atmosphere of living in Alaska defy description, but in combining readings from different sources the McGinniss book should be included in one's library."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"Mcginness seems to be a writer you can't put down (in that you can't stop reading his books once you start). I'm basing this on Going to Extremes and a couple of his other books I've read. This covers Alaska in the seventies, and it's a personalized account; it seems he hangs out with the people and gets to know them so he is able to write about them in depth and describe them well. Brings alive the uniquness of Alaska, which in the early 70s (I think that is the copywrite date) was a state for only a little over a decade. Comparing it to another book about Alaska that sold a lot of copies (John McPhee's \\"Coming Into the Country,\\" written around the same time), Going to Extremes is way better. McPhee's book is dry and factual, and not very experiential and fun, like Extremes is. Enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"A very interesting and well-written book that I couldn't put down. According to my friends and family in Alaska, it is the most accurate account of life in Alaska at the time (1989).

Indeed, many of his characterizations about the people here are accurate--this state is full of quirky characters looking to escape one thing or another in their lives! It was also interesting to read about the places he visited, since I have been lucky enough to visit many of them.However, I found his blatant bias against development and the oil industry disturbing. I found myself contstantly wanting to remind him that without those planes and automobiles, which require oil in one form or another, he never would have been able to visit all the places in Alaska he wrote about. The first oil was just going through the pipeline when he was here, yet he had already made up his mind that oil development was &quot;bad.&quot;I hope Mr. McGinnis doesn't drive a car or heat his home with oil--ditto for all the other environmentalists that want to lock up Alaska."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"So McGinnis takes a few plane flights and is an expert on Alaska? What a joke. He also talks about a Moses Lake, Oregon! Moses Lake is in Washington, not Oregon. His poorly researched book and his foul language and racist attitude are OFFENSIVE. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"Save your money on this book and buy &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot; by Peter Jenkins instead. &quot;Going to Extremes&quot; was a total waste of my time. His non-stop foul language and embelished stories seems a front to sell books and cover up for the fact that he may not have even been there at all."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"This magnificiently written &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; narrative about The Last Frontier is pretty dead-on and holds up after 20 odd years later. I have travelled many portions of the state on leisure expeditions and felt his emotions throughout each page. The most valuable asset of this book is its ability to both entertain the sourdough among us and in addition vividly depict the Alaskan aura for those who have never been. There are no slow moments: witty, poignant, and eloquent structure make this the most enjoyable book I have ever read - in actual fact, it is the Only book I have ever read whereas upon finishing the last page, I immediately began reading again! Favorite anecdote: In describing the residents of Alaska as thinking about Alaska all the time as if it was an entity onto itself in their lives, he states that this is a unique state of mind in that you would not, say, find people walking around Toledo contemplating the &quot;Essence of Ohio&quot;."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"I don't know anything about Alaska until I read this book. I have no idea whether it is accurate or not the way he described that remote area. But my heart was following him everywhere he went and every feeling he got. I chewed on every word, and was totally lost in the last episode when they found this beautiful meadow. I was speechless after I closed the book. I sat at the beach, and had it to myself again and again, that beautiful meadow, the peace, the harmony...Thank you, Joe!"},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"The &quot;top note&quot; of Joe McGinniss' story &quot;Going to Extremes&quot; is about what happens when a lot of folks from the lower 48 and a lot of money are thrown into Alaska at the same time--the late 1970s, when the pipeline was being built. McGinniss casts an urban reporter's jaundiced eye, for example, toward the drinking and drugs that seem like an inevitable consequence of people in the cold wilderness with nothing to do and some money.Sometimes he intends to be virtually comic, as when a newbie pipefitter offloads his pickup truck from the ferry in a Panhandle town unconnected to the rest of the world by road, or when a drug-addled prostitute runs in to a travel agency in Valdez, Alaska, pointing a gun at the travel agent demanding an immediate trip out of town (to get away from creditors). The agent settles her down and puts her in his truck--as though this sort of thing happened everyday-- while he finishes out his conversation with McGinniss inside.A long essay documenting McGinniss' trip to the far northern Brooks Range is dominated by his fear of bears (that's logical, I guess) and his city-slicker mountaineering inabilities, although it eventually rises to suggest the majesty of the land he was touring.In contrast to John McPhee's &quot;Coming into the Country,&quot; written in the same era, McGinniss seems determined to remain a sardonic outsider, an observer of people and their weaknesses primarily, rather than an observer of nature. It's an insightful approach although I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of real Alaskans objected to it, and certainly I am hoping to avoid the gun-toting ladies of the evening on my upcoming trip to tour the state."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"I read this book in the early 90's, just before I moved to Alaska. After spending 9 years in the Last Frontier, I still loved this book. One of the things I like best about it is that McGinnis doesn't romanticize the state and its people, as so many seem wont to do. His characterization is right on, and his descriptions are accurate...a number of folks ARE quirky, eccentric, social misfits looking to escape the trappings of &quot;down south&quot;, and not everything works the way it's supposed to. You never know what to expect in Alaska, and I think McGinniss paints a humorous and accurate story of our 49th state."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"My wife and I happened to be included in Joe's book.

His version of the hike is amazingly accurate and sensitive to the character of the land. He has the unique ability to make you laugh at him and youself."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"Joe McGinniss divulges Alaska---its geography, its people and socioeconomics, and its image as seen by residents, transients, and visitors---in vivid prose that is simply hard to put down. Here is a guy who loves reading maps and pays close attention to a land's features that are way beyond ordinary: coastal glaciers, unnamed and perhaps unexplored mountains, and details of an unforgiving climate and extended summer daylight that are alien to most readers from the lower 48 states. He describes the interplay of sun, clouds, and the land and always comments on the mountains that are visible from any one of his destinations. McGinniss not only has a powerful sense of place but also has an uncanny ability to share this sense to his readers, allowing them to form a mental image of the beauty and mystery that he sees and experiences. Some of the most interesting parts of the book include his encounter with Olive, a native American girl who is torn between staying with her family in western Alaska and trying out the &quot;other life&quot; in Washington DC, a place where hardly anyone from her group can be found.Another interesting thing about the book is that this was written by this guy who was hardly a hiker, who later dwells in deliberate isolation for a few days at a cabin by a lake fringed by mountains where not another soul was present, and who, at the end of book (a climactic end, I should say, and where finally he mentions grizzly bears after I started wondering why he never mentioned them before!), finds himself hanging on to dear life in pursuit of a ledge that could get him closer to the goal of his companions in the scarcely explored hinterlands of the Brooks Range. This last chapter was lengthy---but for a good reason. After the establishment of Gates of the Arctic National Park, I bet that the grizzly bear territory that McGinnis and his hiking companions, and the breathtaking meadow that they stumbled upon, have been rediscovered by many a hiker or backpacker. Nevertheless, reading a book like this 25 years later after its inception, gives me the vicarious experience of fresh discovery and makes me hope that one's personal discovery is enough for the rest of us to be comforted with the existence of untouched and untrammeled wilderness. Which, I do hope, Alaska still has vast reserves of it."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"I really liked this book. McGinniss has a knack for inviting us along without being too \\"reporterish\\". Having spent quite a bit of time working in Alaska in the 1990's I came to recognise the odd, quirky, somewhat misfit type of individuals that populate this amazing place (The characters in the television program \\"Northern Exposure\\" weren't that exaggerated). McGinniss has captured this oddness without being judgmental. It's so matter-of-fact that the reader connects with McGinniss's experiences and ultimately finds the pull of Alaska, with it's unique population, almost irrestible. It is unavoidable that many readers will compare \\"Going to Extremes\\" with John McPhee's \\"Coming into the Country\\". While McPhee's book is good, he never seems to get the flavor of the whole \\"Alaska\\" the way that McGinniss does."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"This is an essential book on Alaska, both an extreme adventure book and a book that starts to tell the story of why Alaska attracts the people it does. Many great people and stories, I only wish it were much longer and even more detailed. By the way, be warned but actually I think you'll appreciate the old-fashioned politically incorrect tell-it-like-it-ism."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"Joe McGinniss catches the heartbeat of Alaska during pipeline days. He is right on the money! (No pun intended). It would be interesting if he wrote another book about Alaska now, with oil at its high, with our Governor running for Vice President, with many of our elected representatives under indictment or already indicted for a variety of crimes. It would make a real pot-boiler & page-turner! Please think about it Mr. McGinniss.Alaska is a state that accepts differences and welcomes eccentricity. No one judges you by how you dress, what zip code you live in or your last name. It is a place of extremes in many ways. I can't say that I fact checked all of what Mr. McGinnis writes about but I can say that I have heard some of the same stories and other stories that are close enough to those he tells that I believe him. If you want to read a book that is off the beaten track about Alaska, this is it."},{"Title":"Going to Extremes","review":"I enjoyed this book. It doesn't tell you everything about Alaska, but it gives you a good feel for what Alaskans share in common. I have since traveled to Alaska and I think this book captured what I got out of our wonderful trip there. I remember meeting a lady in Wasila who told me how she was drawn to Alaska. She said that her brother from Anchorage sent her a picture showing the midnight sun. She arrived in Alaska in the winter and there was a blizzard and over 3 foot of snow. She said she just loved it and never went back to where she came from. Alaskans have a certain mindset that draws them there and it is rather unique and interesting. McGuiness is a good writer and does a good job of getting us to understand the Alaskan mentality."},{"Title":"Small Business Primer: How to Buy, Sell & Evaluate a Business","review":"Samuel Tuttle's Small Business Primer does a great job of covering a lot of territory in a very user-friendly way. It touches on a broad range of topics and concerns, and uses a straightforward, understandable approach to present the information. Simply stated, but thorough, it challenges you to consider many things, including the motivation to buy or sell a business in the first place. It lays out the importance of having a well planned roadmap, and identifies key resources to use in the process. Worth the read!As an addendum to this, I'd also like to say it was a pleasure to deal with a seller who is as responsive as Mr. Tuttle. He is obviously a seasoned professional who not only understands how to successfully conduct business, but who also holds his customers (AKA fledgling entrepreneurs) with very high regard."},{"Title":"Small Business Primer: How to Buy, Sell & Evaluate a Business","review":"Small Business Primer: How To Buy, Sell & Evaluate A Business is a seminar by Samuel S.

He may \\"meticulously\\" research for historical facts and dates, but apparently not facts for everyday life and vernacular within an era. Would a 19th century person say \\"look at that sucker go !\\" really ?? In the midst of the civil war, food became scarce in some parts, yet the characters always stop at a restaurant for a \\"delicious\\" meal. In another book set in the pre-revolutionary war days , a young lady arrives at her destination, discovers she is invited to a fancy dinner party. She has nothing suitable so she goes to a shop and BUYS a dress for the party ! Really !? off the rack clothes in colonial times ?? Another howler, Mr Little is in prison--next page he is Mr Small, but becomes Mr Little again on another page. Mr Morris is not a talented writer---he churns these books out like an assembly line. These are not books I would want to read over and over again. If you want something to while away time while recuperating from surgery or illness or are stuck somewhere in a blizzard---this may keep you occupied. If you want a well written book with characters you really care about and are interesting, this is not it."},{"Title":"The Dixie Widow (The House of Winslow #9)","review":"Belle Wickham, Sky and Rebekah Winslow's oldest daughter, is widowed during the Civil War.

What will the upcoming battles hold for Davis? Will he make it through the war?This book is better than the previous book, The Last Confederate. It was an interesting take on a female in the Winslow line. Gilbert Morris tends to focus on women that the Winslow men are going to marry but this book actually focuses on one of the women in the actually line.

Admission of Love left me with a need for a continuation to this deep,emotional, humorous and exhilarating story. If at all possible, would you consider writing a sequal to this book with a storyline about Devon's twin brother Deshawn and Cloe's best frind Anika, and you could also elaborate briefly on Devon and Cloe's marriage and children, if any.Thanks again for sharing your artistry and writing skills with me and so many others who enjoyed this book.

Her characters are people that you can see in your everyday life. Even though Chloe was a model she was a \\"down home girl\\". And I don't know there is something about twins in a story that I like. The twins in this story were something else. Also there was so much emotion in this book especially dealing with loss. Woooo. I could go on. This was Ms. Byant's first book but if you did not know this you would have thought she had 15 or 20 books out already! The book is that good."},{"Title":"Admission Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"This was my first Niobia Bryant book. A die hard fan of Brenda Jackson as well, I must say the reviewer who compared Niobia Bryant to Jackson was on the money!The passion and electricity between Chloe and Devon was awesome. When the first met, they hated each other, previous sour relationships kept them from trusting or liking one another. However, after finally spending time together, the two realized that the misconceptions about each other were unfounded. After that, things became heated and oh my goodness! The passionate love scenes left me breathless...I reread them about 2 or 3 times before I moved on...Ms. Bryant tore it up!I also enjoyed Nana Lil's influence on the family and Deshawn's (Devon's twin) charm and wit. Chloe's friend Anika was also funny. (I can't wait to read Anika's and Deshawn's story.)I've added Ms. Bryant to my list of favorite authors and intend to buy all her books.

Her late mother left her some land, and that is where she will live when she quits the rat race of being a world renowned celebrity. The builder of her home is Jamison Contractors, owned by twins Devon and Deshawn Jamison. Devon is suspicious of her motives and is prepared to dislike her while his twin eagerly awaits her. Chloe and Devon bump heads, almost literally when she almost runs into him on the road. It is downhill from that point, despite the strong attraction they feel. Despite his reluctance, Devon realizes that Chloe is not the spoiled, drug addicted person he has associated with her prior lifestyle. But there are those who are not happy about their relationship, one being Devon's childhood friend, Alicia, who has been secretly in love with him for years. Chloe is called back to New York to wrap up some business, and Devon wonders if she intends to come back. This was a well-crafted story with engaging secondary characters."},{"Title":"Admission Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"Ok honestly this was a wonderful story. Great plot and everything but i got really tired of the gear naming. It was like the author wanted to make it clear (which she successfully did) that she knew all the lates Brand names out there.The story would've been a lot better if she didn't mention Gucci this or FUBU that, etc. It was really killing the novel.However, the story and characters were great to read about. I was deeply touched by the death of Nana Lil and how peacefully she went with a smile.I got tired of Devon and his assumptions of Chloe all the time. He really acted like a child the majority of the time and i would've preferred if Chloe had gotten involved with Deshawn (his twin) instead. He had a more out going personality and charm which would win any woman's heart over but i guess that mystery and humbleness do attract a woman more.Alicia, she was really cold hearted to do a thing like she did and i guess that jealousy would drive a woman to do anything.It was a nice story and i'm glad that Chloe and Devon got married but i wish you had mentioned if they had kids or not. Maybe you can write a follow up story probably about DeShawn and Anika and mention Devon and Chloe."},{"Title":"Admission Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"Often times it is difficult for the first-time author to make an impression on readers. It's like moving out of your family home to your first apartment, you want to show your family you can make it on your own.Well, the debut novel for Niobia Bryant, shows us that she has stepped out here and demonstrated to us, she has just what it takes to make it as a successful author. I am quite impressed with Admission of Love for these reasons: well developed storyline, great characters, lots of humor, displayed love for family, lots of sizzling sensual love scenes a herione that takes no stuff with a strong hero to deal with and such a joy using dialouge from the other side with the deceased family members.Chloe Bolton, super-model decides to retire and relocated to her mothers' home in South Carolina where she comes face to face with her hero Devon Jamison who happens to have an identical twin brother name Deshawn. Now, you know the rules, I cannot give the story plot away, but trust me on this book...It is sooooo good and you won't want to put the book down until you finish it.I loved all aspects of this book that sometimes was like one step forward and two steps back with Devon and Chloe. I also enjoyed the special dialouge the author uses with those family members who have died being like the special guardian angels, that seemed to add a special touch for me personally.Niobia, you did an outstanding performance on your debut book and I feel a sequel in the make on this one, don't ask me how, you just got to read this book and find out the answer for yourself. Looking forward to your next one!!"},{"Title":"Admission Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"I agree with Crytal, five is definitely not enough! Ok, this is one of arabesque's best novels for the month of August. I absolutely loved this story. Chloe and Devon were great together. I laughed so much reading this book. &quot;Admission of Love&quot; was a very refreshing read. I loved Chloe's character, she really knows how go after her man. Devon put up a good fight, but was no match for the lovely wills Chloe put on him! The storyline for this book was one of my favorites, if not my favorite! The idea behind two people really not liking each other when they initially meet, but passionate sparks fly between anyway is so good to me! This book really did remind me of my favorite book of all times &quot;Fire and Desire&quot; by Brenda Jackson. That really means a lot coming from a die hard fan of Jackson's.

It was definitely time to go. She didn't anticipate faling hopelessly in love with the stubborn, but fine Devon Jamison. Devin and his twin brother DeShawn would be building her home.Devon Jamison didn't like flashy real beautiful women. He was instantly disgusted with Chloe. He had her all summed up, before he got to know her. He had an old girlfriend that was beautiful and ridiculous. He felt Chloe couldn't be any different than her. BOY WAS HE WRONG! Chloe was not only beautiful, but could cook and was really a deep person. Devon didn't want to admit his growing attraction to her, but Chloe on the other hand did notice her attraction to him. She set out to get just what she wanted HIM.This was a wonderful family drama with a down home flavor. I believe this is Niobia's first book and she did a great job.

I really enjoyed this story. It was so good. This book was light and very easy to read. The characters were so real and reminded me of people I know. I could see a lot of myself in this female character.The story is about Chloe, the beautiful supermodel, who has retired due to burnout. She's also tired of NY, so she has decided to build a house in her mom's hometown of Holtsville, SC. The rugged, handsome, fine, construction worker/builder/architect Devon is building her house. Devon has no respect for supermodels. He thinks they are airheads strung out on drugs. So, when he and Chloe meet, not only do the sparks fly, but so does the name calling.Chloe knows what she wants (Devon) and is not afraid to go after it. There are so many funny lines in this story. I really enjoyed reading this book. Chloe says things like, \\"If you don't keep my name out of your mouth...\\" That sounds just like something I would say. Or \\"What the devil is wrong with you?\\" She also has a down to earth, tell it like it is best friend. Like we all have.Then there is Nana Lil, Devon's grandmother. She is such a lovable character who speaks her mind and sounds nothing like the grandmothers I know. At one point in the book, she knocks on the door and yells out, \\"You two are mighty quiet in there. Whatever it is you're doing, don't need to be done in my room!\\" That was too funny.Just like any good romance story, there is someone in the background secretly in love with your man, plotting to steal him behind your back.

Despite reflecting a long cross-section after a couple of years of the famous &quot;first flight&quot; by Wright Brothers, it's more emotional than a history book but more historical than a &quot;remembrance&quot; book. Simply it's a &quot;love story&quot; between the human beings and planes. Technically. Amazing moments, sadly aviation martyrs, step by step improvements and a crowning &quot;world record&quot;... Very enjoyable reading for those who love to visit the aviation milestones one by one."},{"Title":"Lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres","review":"This is an antique classical course. It's main purpose is to train the student to write on par with Joseph Addison. It requires The Spectator by Joseph Addison. I found The Spectator in two volumes on Alibris, excellent condition, J. B. Lippincott Company 1890. You're to read a piece by Joseph Addison three times and then you attempt to write what you have just read. Thus it's important to find a copy of the The Spectator that doesn't have any editing by Joe Blow.You're expected to know Latin and it is assumed that you do so. There are interpretations of the Latin at the end of each chapter but it is disruptive.It's excellent. I highly recommend it. I also recommend the simplified Christian dialect that is the present fad and learning material from Memoria Press to start the Latin."},{"Title":"Fascist and Liberal Visions of War: Fuller, Liddell Hart, Douhet, and Other Modernists","review":"This book concentrates on the analysis of intellectual growth of particular ideas and styles of thought after the WWI. It is a breathtaking study of the intellectual enviroment of the inter-war years (and not only) and the way it shaped the thinking of strategic thinkers as Fuller, Liddell Hart, Duhet and others. This study clearly shows the connection between the world of ideas, war, their origins and their interaction."},{"Title":"Fascist and Liberal Visions of War: Fuller, Liddell Hart, Douhet, and Other Modernists","review":"Fascinating book on the thinkers of modern war. The author made clearthe relationship between Fascism and mechanised war. What is moreimportnat is he indicated that the concept of \`indirect approach'of Liddle Hart is the key concept of our age. I felt that the war theoryof Man-in-the-dark is highly related to the bounded rationalityof H.A. Simon."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"I was immediately captured and drawn into this story. Mr. Hirt has a wonderful writing style that keeps you interested. And the story is full of a wide array of events, wonderous lands, interesting characters, and a solid story line. You will enjoy this one and the other two in the trilogy I am sure."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"I am so relieved to see fiction of this nature published; it's about time someone got it right when it comes to quasi-historical novels dealing with this time period. I loved the fact that the story ran the gamut from adventure to drama to spiritual warfare. Though I was slightly surprised by some format issues (why not have numbers within the text spelled out, and it seemed odd to have standard biblical spelling of names next to imaginary ones created for the sake of the story), I very much enjoyed the book overall, and was pleased to say that the author has envisioned the world before the deluge as very similar to what I imagine it was like. There are some interesting and original twists and turns in the narrative, and the ending has me eager to pick up the next book. Overall, bravo, Douglas Hirt, for a job well done. Thank you, River Oak, for taking a chance with this series."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"The story was so enagaing I sped through this first volume within two days and went right on to volume two. The antediluvian world has always been a fascinating mystery to me so I loved the author's vision here - a world surprisingly advanced but becoming more and more corrupt (much like ours). Unlike some other Christian fiction I've read, this was a very well written fantasy tale that I would put up with the best of someone like Robert Jordan. My only complaint was the editing process, or lack thereof. I think it is inexcusable for a professionally published work to use 'loose' in a sentence where 'lose' should have been. There were enough such mistakes that it was becoming a distraction. Overall though it did not detract from my enjoyment of this wonderful story."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"This book along with the rest of the series is one of my favorites reads this year. There are many twists and turns in the story and when I had to put the book down, I could not wait to pick it up again. Mr. Hirts' imagination and description of the pre-flood world is realistic and fantastic at the same time. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"I brought this book home, figuring I'd be able to dive into it right away. Right. My husband and my son tussled for it as soon as I placed it on the kitchen counter.When I was finally able to read Flight to Eden, I enjoyed it thoroughly! I've researched Genesis minutely for my own work, so I was pleased that the plot provided so many twists and turns and such action, balanced with a sense of wonder--yet again--at the world as it might have been before the Great Flood. Settle in for a great read!"},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"First off, about the only thing that could detract from the book are a few more noticeable typos than I expected, but not so many that it would keep you from reading this excellent, pre-flood fantasy novel.The characters are strong and varied. The technologies the author invents for the pre-flood world are imaginative and plausible. The variety of animals and the way some are domesticated was an interesting part of the story, as well as the use of certain plants for food and fuel.The way the spiritual realm and the physical were intertwined and effected one another was well done and drove the story. There were some recognizable Biblical characters in the story, which only added to its depth. The portrayal of the Nephilim was well done and reflected a Biblical truth behind the flood that many people know nothing about or gloss over.The whole layout of the story is reminiscent of a classical fantasy adventure where the characters struggle to achieve a particular mission or fulfil a particular quest.I highly recommend this book and I will be on the lookout for book two in the Cradleland Chronicles."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"I really enjoy sci-fi stuff because it contains a person's philosophy regarding many things. This can almost be classified more as paleo-historical Bible fiction.The whole Cradleland series was so much fun to read, and I also found that it reflected and developed many of the ideas and deductions from many sources that I have found throughout the years. Actually, these books have influenced and expanded my thought processes about life before the Great Flood. A sequel that would delve into the making of the Tower of Babel and the beginnings of World Religions in Babylon would be wonderful!!Too bad there are so many typos..."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"I found this book fascinating! It is fiction, but where it includes things from the Bible they are portrayed with attention to accuracy. This book depicts the conditions prior to the great flood in Genesis 6. The deterioration in society is well described and probably not far off the mark, since God chose to give up on his creation and schedule a \\"do over\\". The description of the contamination of blood lines with half demon and half humans was well characterized. There were creatures described that you have never seen or imagined. There were vocabulary words invented to let you know how little you understand about the pre-flood world.For those who loved \\"This Present Darkness\\", you will find a similar spiritual warfare theme here. There are three in the series and they are like potato chips...you can't have just one. I suggest you make a list of names as you read. You may need to refer back to it, because there are many characters and most of them return in the second and third books."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"One of the things I liked most that the author said in this book was \\"Why do we always think of men in loin cloths when we think of pre flood times?\\" His imagination is truely a blessing from God and inspied me to see the creation of man in a whole new way. I can't wait to read the following two stories!"},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"As both an author and reader of fiction, I was impressed with (Flight to Eden). The characters seemed real and the story line was believable. I guess I have always enjoyed a book that could hold my attention and make me think at the same time. I'm sorry that I do not have the time to write a longer and more detailed review so simply stated - I recommend this book.Tommy Taylor"},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"This was by far the best fiction book I'd read for a long time. I was hooked from the very beginning. Don't get this book without the other three; you won't want to wait!"},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"This is an awesome book! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down (and I usually don't have that problem.) The last chapter was so gripping. I can't wait for the second book to be released. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone, whether they like fantasy or not. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"Flight To Eden is a finely woven tapestry of faith, fiction, and fantasy. Douglas Hirt has set the standard for readability with this first book of the Cradleland Chronicles. His plot flows smoothly from scene to scene culminating in an ending that satisfactorily closes the first book yet leaves the reader eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. These works will truly validate this author as the \\"fabricator of armchair adventures\\".Ernest"},{"Title":"Flight to Eden (Cradleland Chronicles)","review":"I love this trilogy, but this was the best of the three.

Well crafted with engaging characters. A story line that draws you in immediately. Hard to set down! Can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book is an in-depth study of the woman of virtue described in Proverbs 31:10-31. Elizabeth does an excellent job of examining the passage in historical context, with personal, practical applications throughout. I would highly recommend this book for either personal or group study. Questions are included in the back."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Through this book, Elizaeth George has inspired and challenged me to be a woman that God wants me to be. She gave practical ideas on how to be a Proverbs 31 woman and not to follow what the standard of this world. She gave insight and practical ideas into each verse describing the Proverbs 31 woman. This book is both for single and married women. Nevertheless, I find myself learn more from it after I got married because after all this book is about being a virtuous wife."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"No more fear of the Proverbs 31 woman. Elizabeth George offers a view of this passage which isn't found in other exegetical and practical studies. I am a single woman, and usually very skeptical of these type of books, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has practical and Biblical advice for any woman od any age."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Elizabeth George is completely down-to-earth, presenting potentially confusing scripture passages in a way that helps me better understand not only the original context of the passage, but also practical applications for me today. Her portrayal of the Proverbs 31 woman was very helpful, and it increased my desire to live as this lady did."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book enriched my spiritual development. I have also read her other books. Great!1"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"My wife's one-time supervisor, who turned out to be clinically mentally ill, gave my wife this book to \\"help\\" her. My wife read it with an open mind and was devastated by the horrible advice, accusations, and faulty exegesis provided by Elizabeth George. I read portions of this book myself and found it to be in conflict with a comprehensive understanding of God and scripture, and grace in particular. If you believe that you need to earn your salvation through good works in order to be beautiful in God's eyes, then this book's understanding of Proverbs 31 will make sense to you. If you believe that you are saved by grace, and it is only Jesus' goodness that allows you to stand beautiful in the presence of God, then you will find this book and its ideas to be, in large part, reprehensible. I do not deny that there are some pearls of wisdom in this book, but my overall impression is that the author is trying to manipulate women into following her interpretation of Proverbs 31 by using emotional triggers. Need I say that this is not right? Even if her interpretation of the chapter were sound, the ends would not justify the means."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book is a must read for women that are striving to be christian examples to their families. I have learned so much about this woman described in Proverbs."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"As a young Christian woman, I read this book hoping to glean some wisdom from Elizabeth George. All of my expectations were surpassed. After reading about thirty pages, I began wondering why I hadn't read it sooner. Elizabeth George breaks Proverbs 31 down, verse by verse--giving each verse, from 10 on, its very own chapter. This book is not only insightful and eye opening, but also very encouraging. For any woman seeking to live a Godly life, desiring for her time on Earth to be spent doing His will, and hoping to become more like Christ, this book is a must read! \\"Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, but a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.\\"Stacy Padula, Author ofMontgomery Lake High #1: The Right Person"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book is a must read for all women! Author Elizabeth George has written an enlightening interpretation of the Proverbs 31 woman. Reading this book will encourage you in your every day life as a Christian woman.Beginning with verse 10 of Proverbs 31 the author takes each verse and applies it to your life today. Some of the chapter titles include, A Spring of Goodness--Her Mission, An Eager Attitude--Her Work, and The Law of Kindness--Her Words. There are a total of twenty-four uplifting chapters that correlate with the verses found in Proverbs 31.In the chapter titled A Spring of Goodness--Her Mission, she gives a helpful list called the ABC's of Goodness. This particular list is great for brides to be or any married woman. Some of the list includes, C-control your spending, E-encourage his dreams, and L-look not at what others have. You will learn how to be an encouragement to your husband and family.In the chapter titled An Eager Attitude--Her Work she shares some reasons why we put off housework and ways to look at the work in a more positive way. She lists four main reasons for failing to do the work: poor use of time, lack of motivation, failure to plan, and procrastination. Each of these reasons is discussed and helpful information is given on how to overcome them. You may even start enjoying some of those tedious tasks!In the chapter titled The Law of Kindness--Her Words you will be reminded how much what you say influences those around you. Just your words in the morning can start your family's day in a positive or negative way. She reiterates your need to think before you speak.Those were just three examples of the many great chapters in this book. You will find the book easy to read with excellent illustrations for today's woman. All women will enjoy and learn from this book whether married or single. You will feel like Elizabeth George is sitting next to you offering these great words of wisdom. Her words encourage you to live up to this Godly Proverbs 31 woman without discouraging you from all the hard work it takes.I would recommend this book as a present for a high school graduation, a college graduation, a wedding shower or even a birthday present. I think once you read the book for yourself you will agree!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"It drove me crazy that the author kept talking to me (dear one, my fellow sister, etc) but it's just a style thing, I guess. She makes lots of assumptions and as I am not of her faith (obviously by my disagreement with some of the things she says about a man's role to his wife), I would have preferred more background or references for her assumptions- especially those that deal with the culture of the time.Good, easy read, but like the title- not earth shattering or life changing for me."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Radiant book. Excellent. Beautiful. Well written. Easy to follow. Challenging. Encouraging. I'm reading it by myself (not in a group study). And I did not get the companion study book to go along with it. Alone, it is good. Worth reading. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"No harping, no munipulation, just good clean examples of that Proverbs 31 woman that we look up to. The author brings it together and makes a beautiful thing."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book really showed me what my calling is. I am a single 21 yearold mother. Elizabeth has shown me how I can be a better mother and future wife. I recommend this book to any female that wants a greater understanding of her purpose in life!!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This is a wonderful study guide for young to lower middle age women. Hopefully, you've got it together somewhat by the time your upper middle age and older and it would seem more like a review."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This is a wonderful and very inspiring book for women. Whether you're a wife, mother, or still single - this book about the Proverbs 31 woman is just very encouraging and humbling. Each verse is translated into a chapter and there is so much to learn! I keep going back to this book even after I've read the whole thing just to remind myself of what my responsibilities are as a woman, wife and mother. A must read for every woman!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"I ordered this book on June 4, but I haven't received this book yet. I read this book before from my friend's library.

I hope I can receive this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"I recommend this text for any woman wanting practical guidance on becoming what God wants her to be: Virtuous!!The women of my church have recently created a book club, and BEAUTIFUL IN GOD'S EYES is our first."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This is a great book for women! A friend of mine told me to read it and I'm so glad I did. It has truly helped me become a better wife...and mom!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. I read this within a couple of days since it was a quick easy devotional read. The reason why I give it 3 out of 5 stars is because I liked it but I couldn't really relate to the stuff when she mentioned having a husband or a family of your own, it was a good devotional on the woman in Proverbs 31. I recommend this to any woman out there who is a Christian, married, or engaged."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"I love her mysteries, but this book left me thinking I was the butt of an April Fool's joke. I started it last night, and thought maybe it was not making sense because I was tired. Then today when I picked it up again,- she calls her husband from every airport, she calls to say she's home from the store. Good grief, barf city! I have been married 40 years and consider myself a good Christian. Does this woman realize marriages succeed with cooperation, not grovelling. Is this the same Elizabeth George who writes the mysteries?"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Elizaeth George, truly inspired me to be a better wife and mother. This book gave practical ideas on how to be a Proverbs 31 woman in today's world. It truly changed me, making me more productive in my duties as a wife and mother. I had a hard time putting it down. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book is wonderful. It has shown me that I too can become like the Proverbs 31 woman. I always looked upon her as a kind of superwoman. Someone who could not be matched. The indepth study by Elizabeth George has made this passage of scripture real to me, and I feel that I can too can be a virtuous woman."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Elizabeth George does an excellent job of giving the reader thorough insight into each verse describing the Proverbs 31 woman. The descriptions are clear and well thought out. She gives practical application for your own daily lifestyle. You walk away from each chapter with something to work on. It is the best book on Proverbs 31 that I've read."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"If you're looking for a good, practical book for home group Bible study, then may I recommend this book to you. Elizabeth George makes a fine study of Proverbs 31 and includes a number of thoughtful study questions to help you work out the practical aspects of this passage for today.This book is for single, or married ladies, but I find that married ladies will probably glean more from it because it is a book about being a virtuous wife!You can also do this study on your own- you don't necessarily need a group. I would recommend it, however, because you can bounce ideas off each, share, and really encourage each other to be this woman.My reason for only giving this book four stars is because Elizabeth George is a little week in her interpretations of some Scriptures. She ignores the primary and secondary interpretations in favor of the point that she is trying to make. I've found that this happens in more than one place, but its a small complaint because the book centers around Proverbs 31. Just read it with your eyes open and you'll learn a lot."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This is a book that you will not be able to put down! Through this book I have had a true heart change about the kind of woman, wife and mother God wants me to be. If you have a deep desire for God and your family to see you as a treasure this book is a must have."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"This book has challenged me, a 22 yr. old young woman, to be all that I can be. Not to fall into the world's modern day trap of what they say a woman should be, but to strive to attain God's ideal for a woman. My personal walk with God has been taken to a new and ever growing level. It has also greatly helped me in my family, work, and personal life. It is a must read for any woman who wants life the best it can be...God's way!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"It has inspired me to become the Proverbs 31 Woman that I thought I never could be! Until I read this book, I thought it was impossible to be that &quot;perfect &amp; beautiful&quot; woman God wants me to be. God has shown me through this book that IT IS POSSIBLE!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Elizabeth George inspires me as a women, helping me to understand God's intention for my life to live for Him. I found this book to be a great guideline for my future walk in Him."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"Have you ever looked at yourself and thought that you could never be everything the Proverbs 31 woman is in the Bible? I know I have! But as I read this book, I realized that thepurest virtues of beauty aren't specific, but rather individual. This book shows you what God meant when describing all the attributes of the Proverbs 31 woman. It introduces each characteristic verse by verse with a chapter for each describing Elizabeth's struggles and accomplishments with the virtues as well as what is intended and expected of the Christian woman today.If you're wanting to live by the Bible, but just aren't sure you can, this book will help you see that every woman can be a treasure and a witness to the beauty and femininity that God gave us. &quot;Beautiful In God's Eyes&quot; helps you see that you ARE already beautiful to Him and how you can bring out the best in yourself for His glory. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews of this book I was compelled to not only purchase it for myself, but 10 other copies for the women in my book club. It was a unanimous decision that we were all sorely disappointed. The first quarter or so was very promising and held our interest, but about halfway through we began to wonder if this woman ever slept or spent time with her family. Not only were we discouraged and left feeling inadequate, but after 20-something chapters I didn't feel like I really wanted to be a Proverbs 31 woman at all. Since reading this book I've gone on to read Captivating by John and Staci Eldredge -- now that is a book that truly makes you feel beautiful in God's eyes. If that is what you are looking for, as I was when I read Elizabeth George's title, then I recommend you find a different book."},{"Title":"Beautiful in God's Eyes","review":"I liked the book,found it very interesting,but I was looking for books by Elizabeth George the mistery writer, so the book I received was a double surprise.

My boyfriend is convinced that I am the Proverbs 31 woman, which is why I bought this book...I am definitely not the woman that Elizabeth George describes. I actually talked to him about it and he was definitely appalled at the whole idea of acting as she does...the two of us are both Christians and all, but we were both thinking that there has to be an element of trust in the marriage otherwise you're going to drive each other crazy."},{"Title":"Out of Sight, Out of Mind (Abby Hayes #9)","review":"This is the saddest book ever in the Abby Hayes books.

The book explains the basic jobs a Web server can do in simple way so that many people can understand it. The description of the tasks, which will be performed on a Web server, is not too detailed. Excellent is the explanation of the different types, advantages and disadvantages of process concepts which can be used for Web servers.

It's light on the technical end, but very good at explaining what's really happening when someone clicks a button in his/her browser app. My only strong criticism is that the examples used to illustrate concepts are inconsistant -- I'd choose one scenario and stick with it throughout the book.

Whereas Thunderbolt and Samurai focus on the exploits of individual pilots, with the aircraft information as a backdrop, much like the B-17 in Flying Forts, the P-38 is the main protagnoist in this story. The pilots and their missions enable the telling of this tale, but the P-38 itself truly comes to life.I have read the book three times in the past six months, and will likely begin reading #4 very shortly.Thank you Mr. Caidin."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"This book very well written with documentation and a large number of pilot testimonials. It goes into great detail about the enception, development, and attributes about the most under-rated fighter of the Second World War. Mr. Caiden, despite his obvious feelings for the airplane, illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of this amazing fighter in both an optomistic, and objective light. This book is a must read for anyone who would like to claim to know anything about the Air war in WWII."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"This book has it all and if you can work through some slow spots you will see it has both a enjoyable histroy view point for the novice reader, a great war story aspect for the WWII junkie, and a techincal stand point for the aviation lover. A good read but maybe a lack of writing experience from the author shows through. Overall very enjoyable and different from your usual Stephen Ambrose-type work."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"A very exciting, well-researched overview of what was arguably the finest fighter of WWII. Caidin interviewed pilots and others close to the development of the P-38, and put together an exhaustive history, replete with technical specifications, &quot;tall tales&quot;, painful shortcomings, and historical color. A must-read for anyone enamored with the P-38, and a good read for airplane buffs and war history fans."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"There are plenty of nuts and bolts histories of the P-38 Lightning. This book is different in that it emphasizes the people behind the design, production and fighting of the P-38. There are plenty of facts, dates, statistics in the book, but the emotions are captured here as well. It reads like a novel, it's fast paced and puts you in the seat of the cockpit.Author Martin Caidin is able to do this with interviews of test pilots and those who flew the P-38 in combat. He readily admits he is a fan of the plane, but does not overstate the case for the Lightning. It was cutting edge at the time, had flaws that needed to be worked out. Deployed early in North Africa and the Pacific, it gained popularity and was successful as a fighter, bomber, and recon plane. This is noteworthy since it was designed solely as a high speed interceptor. For various reasons, it did not do as well in the European theater as a fighter plane, but excelled as a fighter bomber.Each chapter covers a phase of the Lockheed plane, examines the myths, debunks them and moves onto the next issue. The last chapter sums it all up and points out that it's not accurate to label a particular plane \\"the best\\". It depends on which version of the plane, in what mission/conditions/time and other factors are involved. Caidin shows that although you may not call the P-38 the best, you can certainly agree it is among the greatest. This is an accurate and fitting conclusion to a very readable, enjoyable book. Highly recommended to all aviation buffs, P-38 fans, anyone else who wants to learn the whole story behind this remarkable plane."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"If you enjoy reading about WWII aircraft and in particular about the P-38 then this is the book for you. Martin Caidin tells us the remarkable story of this aircraft and includes many remembrances from the pilots that actually flew the plane.

It told of the problems when they designed the plane to when the production ended and the airplane was taken out of service. This airplane had an amazing record for being rugged and yet it saved many of its pilots lives by holding together when all shot up. Some of tales in the book are hard to believe and you might think of them as 'ghost stories' but they are all true and witnessed by the ground crews who were there. A very inspirational book for any combat vet reading who is interested in the 'Great War'!"},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"After reading Zero, by Martin Cadin, I was looking forward to Forked Tailed Devil.While not IMHO as good as Zero, I still enjoyed reading this book.Caidin starts off with the developmental history of the P-38 and then goes into great depths to explain the differences between the different marks. Using testimonials of experts, test pilots and combat veterans, one really gets the feel for flying this beatiful and important warplane.I was very interested in the technical and aerodyamical aspects of the book, I was somewhat let down on the combat experience part as Mr. Caidin only used U.S.A.A.F sources and not Japanese. This to me was a mistake.Just a disclaimer: I am in no way diminishing the abilities or honesty of our fighting men in WWII, I am sure they believed they shot down all the aircraft claimed, However, no combatant on any side in WWII during the heat and excitement and confusion of aerial combat can be sure if he was the one who hit and brought down an aircraft. Double, triple, and quadruple counting is normal under these conditions. When a furball of >100 aircraft is involved, sometimes 4 or more aircraft are firing on the same enemy, thus the multiple claims.During the Rabaul attacks in November-December 1943, the IJN had two Kokutai of Zero fighters, the 204th and the 251st. Combined, these units had about 80 A6M3 zero fighters. Col King in the book claimes that the P-38s shot down 240 enemy aircraft in air to air combat during the one month campaign. A 16-1 kill ratio is claimed.No doubt some of these were G4M Rikko bombers, but still, I am sure the fighter boys were triple counting. Had Mr. Caidin consulted Japanese souces, I am sure this ratio would be lowered by a factor of at least 3.If it were not for this, I would have given the book 5 stars, however, dispite this it is an indispensible work in aviation history for the technical details alone."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"Fork-Tailed Devil: The P-38, Martin CaidinMartin Caidin wrote other books about air combat. The Lockheed P-38 was designed to intercept and destroy enemy bombers, an anti-aircraft weapon. But it is best known as a fighter airplane. It shot down more Japanese aircraft in WW II than any other fighter plane. Caidin discusses other fighter airplanes and why he wrote this book (Chapter 1). Originally only fifty P-38 interceptors were planned. Later it was replaced by the P-51 for economical reasons, production, and training. The P-38 was designed for high speed at high altitude and a fast climb rate (Chapter 2). It was heavily armed, its guns fired directly ahead. It used counter-rotating propellers and the new Fowler flaps. It was the fastest fighter airplane design in 1939 (Chapter 3). There were changes from the original design, as needed.Compressibility, or shock stall, is explained (Chapter 4). Dive flaps solved this problem. Chapter 5 has the details. The long range flight of the P-38 made it a necessity for the North African campaign (Chapter 6). The long range of P-47 and P-51 fighters carried the air war to the enemy. P-38s were preferred for bomber escort in the early days of the war. Their long flight range allowed them to be flown across the North Atlantic (Chapter 7). They escorted bombers in North Africa (Chapter 8). It was \\"the most effective all-round fighter planes\\" (p.108). The P-38 was handicapped by an unheated cockpit in the European winter (Chapter 9). Edward B. Giller tells about his P-38 experiences (Chapter 10). Kenneth J. Sorace tells about his (Chapter 11). P-38s were lost due to mechanical problems. The P-38 was never designed or tested for cold weather at high altitudes (Chapter 12). Their engines had a high failure rate (p.161). Chapter 13 tells of the improvements made to the later models (J, L, and M). Bullet-proof glass windshield, cockpit heating, circuit breakers for electrical systems, dive brakes, automatic control of the engine, bigger fuel tanks, etc.The P-38 was the best fighter below 20,000 feet or 6 km, but not at higher altitudes (Chapter 14). Its Allison engine was troublesome. The P-51 replaced the P-38, which was shipped to warmer climates. The P-38 proved itself in the Italian campaigns as a fighter-bomber and escort (Chapter 15). Bases in Russia were used for shuttle missions for a while (pp.198-199). There are two personal stories from the Mediterranean war (Chapter 16). In the Aleutians the weather was a worse enemy than the Japanese (p.225). P-38s were sent to Guadalcanal as bomber escorts, reconnaissance planes, and bombers. Heat and humidity were a problem in New Guinea (Chapter 18). But the P-38 excelled as a fighter escort for bombers (p.272). Chapter 19 lists official advice on air combat. Wartime conditions resulted in the loss of some records (Chapter 20). Lt. William Sells warned of an attack by bombers (p.287).Chapter 21 tells about combat with the P-38. Its firepower gave it an advantage and it could fly faster than a Zero at lower altitudes. McGuire Air Force Base in NJ is named after Tommy McGuire (Chapter 22). His and other records were destroyed in a bombing (p.318). The 475th was the only all P-38 Fighter Group during the war (Chapter 23). The records of the P-38 was outstanding (p.335). A violent storm caused the worst loss (p.339). P-38s escorted bombers to attack enemy bases (p.346). What happened to the 7,500 P-38s at war's end? Some were sold as surplu for $1,250 (Chapter 24). Art Heiden adds his comments about P-38 training and equipment. The book ends with a \`Note From the Author' for corrections."},{"Title":"Fork-tailed devil: The P-38 (His Air combat books)","review":"It is true that Mr. Caiden's writing style is perhaps pilot to co-pilot, but it is a minor point. He is passionate, well-researched, and interesting. There are plenty of greatly detailed war stories with the P-38 as the star.For me, what really comes through loud and clear, the P-38 was really THE US fighter of WWII. The only fighter in production thorough the entire war. When it 1st flew in 1939, it was the fastest airplane on earth. The only fighter that could match the bomb load of a B-17. The only fighter that US Commanders world-wide screamed for more and more throughout the entire war. Seven of the US's top 10 aces of WWII flew P-38's.[...]I did not know any of this, and came away agreeing with Mr. Caiden, this was the best American fighter of WWII. BTW, the deservedly praised P-51 Mustang, in the the models that performed with dominance, did not enter the war in decent numbers until mid-1944. The P-38 was fighting in every theatre by mid 1942. The P-38 probably saved more lives than any other US plane due to the F-5 Photo Recon variant. The F-5 used sheer speed to become the best US Recon plane of the war.

The first 50 pages give quick context on the Greek world from 6500 BC. This is very helpful towards understanding the great stories of the past that Athenians all knew, and explaining the origin of the Athenian city plan and political order. Jones's vivid account of Mycenean palaces gave me a whole new sense of Homer and the characters in Greek tragedy.Then the book settles into the city. Jones describes its physical arrangement, government and religion, the main political and economic groups, family structure, and the life patterns of typical occupations: farmers, laborers, craftsmen. Jones has a great way of picking lively details. My favorite is his account of archaeological finds on a street that Socrates used to frequent. It is a very good balance of overview and detail, for a quick look at Athens.One striking feature of the book is how clearly Jones describes other interpretations competing with his own, and how he uses that to make the book more lively and attractive. It does not come across as bickering, but as exploring possibilities. He is generous enough to give sympathetic accounts of many other views (though I suppose the people he disagrees with may not agree with me!). Much of this material is necessarily conjectural, as the sources are quite sparse. Jones makes a few very helpful remarks on the the extent of existing archaeological evidence.And of course the book gives good suggestions for further reading on many topics."},{"Title":"Ancient Greece: State and society","review":"This book is a short (214 pages) introductory textbook on ancient Greece generally and ancient Athens specifically. The reason that the text focuses mostly on ancient Athens is not Professor Jones's fault, rather, there simply is not much documentary evidence from any other city-state in ancient Greece vis-a-vis that of Athens (and the surrounding Attica). The book begins with a few introductory chapters covering the ancient Minoans and Myceneans, the palace-state, the \\"Dark Age\\" of Greek civilization then transitioning into the \\"Archaic Age\\" and the birth of the city-state. From hereon Jones fixes his pen almost exclusively on Athens (there is a short summary of life in Sparta in chapter 5).Since \\"State and Society\\" is the subtitle of this book Jones provides an overview of social life and government and shows how social life and government were almost always intertwined. Included are surveys of Athenian political systems, urban and rural life, economics and economic life, social classes, women, and domestic/ family life. These surveys are well done and detailed for an introductory text; Jones covers the growth and development of Athenian politics and democracy particularly well, as this is one of his academic specialties.Historical narrative is not this book's strength. The reader has almost to dig through the discussions of state and society to find any real historical development, and since this is an introductory text I think that this is an error, and it results in a less engaging read. In this vein there is little discussion about the Persian or Peloponnesian wars, nor is there a chapter on the Hellenistic era of any real substance. There is also no index at the end of this book. Moreover, there is no index (you get my point). Important statistical information is left uncited, and the reader is left to guess which book in the suggested reading list the author used for the information. (For example, in the chapter on economic life Jones presents a list of everyday items (pottery, building materials, shoes, lambs, etc.) and their prices in ancient Athenian currency, but he does not explain his methodology or explain the source of this interesting information.) The writing style is stale at times, and there are no pictures and few helpful graphics.In short, this is a pretty average introduction to Ancient Greece. The discussions on social and political life are valuable but do not justify the price of the book (but it looks like you can buy it used for cheap). I recommend Thomas Martin's introductory history (Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times (Yale Nota Bene)) as an alternative."},{"Title":"Osler s A Way of Life and Other Addresses, with Commentary and Annotations","review":"If you are a student of medicine (current, former, or hopeful), chances are that you will read at least one essay, address, or other writing of Sir William Osler. And, like all students past, you won't have a clue about what in the world the good doctor was saying. Dr. Osler was a peerless medical scholar, an erudite man of letters whose vast learning towered over that of his contemporaries and even moreso of the doctors of today. He was to medicine what Samuel Johnson was to lexicography. Unless you have degrees in philosophy, philology, literature, and classics (in addition to medicine), you will most likely be just as confused as you will be inspired by Dr. Osler's writing.Thankfully, we have this new book from Duke University Press. With more annotations than a Harvard Law Review issue, this well-selected sample of Dr. Osler's most well-known papers and addresses presents an effective \\"translation\\" to satisfy all medical scholars who, though they seek to emulate Osler's compassion and skill, just can't understand all of his references. When I first read \\"Aequanimitas,\\" I felt like an ignoramus. After reading it again in this present volume, I felt like an enlightened student eager to carry the Aesculapian staff into the new milennium (or something like that). I highly recommend this book to all medical students and physicians who seek a model of professional excellence in Dr. Osler, but who have heretofore scratched their heads when reading his papers. Revisit \\"A Way of Life.\\" Read the footnotes. Then don your white coat, tend to your patients, and be proud of the great American medical tradition set forth by Dr. Osler so many years ago."},{"Title":"Outcaste","review":"As there was no editorial review I took the liberty to inform the readers what the story is about.

I'm a bit baffled as to why she doesn't circulate more than she does.I strongly recommend purchasing this brief article - it's dirt cheap, and a good introduction to her meatier and more thorough books such as _Evolution_as_a_Religion_ (a defense of what Evolution really is, as well as what it means for the stories we tell of ourselves and our world: it is not a proposal to turn evolution into a religion or an attack on evolutionary theory, only an attack on some of the dramas that slip in under the aegis of that legitimate scientific theory, distorting the theory and perverting human nature as a result) and _Science_and_Poetry_. You really ought to buy both.I've known for some time that \\"religion\\" is not equivalent to Protestant fundamentalism, but is a dimension of anthropology, rather than some kind of \\"idea-virus\\" or \\"meme\\" that operates as something additional and superfluous to the fullness of our humanity (the bogus science and metaphoric underpinnings of Dawkins' \\"meme\\" is addressed in both of Midgley's books that I mentioned above: it is not addressed in this article). I've also been aware that the dramas and metaphors that are used by many who champion \\"reason\\" against \\"superstition\\" are themselves dependent upon and indebted to the dramas and categories inherited from their chosen enemies (\\"the children of light\\" vs. \\"the children of darkness,\\" anyone?). I've also noticed that they seem a bit preoccupied with Protestant fundamentalism, and rhetorically equate that with Christianity. How irritating and conversation-stopping for the rest of us.However, I'd never really considered at length the mythology (I do not use that word pejoratively or derogatively - I'm quite comfortable talking about my own) of those who live through the peculiar drama of \\"scientism,\\" or the actual symbolic world they live in. Midgley shows us what that is, and compares it with some of the parallel elements she finds unfavorable in other traditions/mythologies. She is not simplistic. She recognizes the complexity of this kind of dramatic/religious/symbolic phenomenon, and yet speaks about it rather simply, in a manner that any literate person can grasp.Highly recommended.

This particular year is the year White and his hubby, Moroccomole, move from Dallas to West Hollywood. It is an epistolary novel for the new era, having its genesis in the occasional emails he sent to family and friends which got forwarded on to their family and friends until White had a wide network of people he'd never met reading his rantings on the evils of implant sluts, movie publicists and Leonard Maltin.As a story, it lacks immediacy. Since the original intent was to tell people who already knew the two main characters well what they were up to, there's a certain sketchiness to the characterizations. On the other hand, this gives it a brisk, conversational tone that brings you deeper into the point of view of the author.There isn't really a story here, but White's pretty up front about that from the get go. In fact, White comes across a bit like the Christina Ricci character in The Opposite of Sex regarding his introduction and the ending, but you'll have to read the book yourself to decide if I'm right.Go ahead and buy Guyville and 101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men toghether.

Dave White provides a year in the life look at his transition into an LA life. He notes at the start of the book that it's origin was a collection of diary notes and emails which makes it something of an epistolary novel. An easy, friendly writing style allowing the reader to pick it up and put it down as needed; but it a book you'll read right through. The progress of his shift from Texan to Angeleno is well paced and always interesting. He has a crisp wit, intriguing friendships, a life where the mundane is shown to have a certain fascination if you just tilt you head a little off kilter. The threads of coming into his own as a writer, the work that gets him by, the new friends he acquires in LA and the relationship with his partner give a context to his evolution over the year. The episodic nature with the quick sketches and cast that he populates his life with provide us with a shorthand look at the days of his life which never seems tedious or dull. Most of all, he made me smile and at times outright laugh so that makes him very likeable and a chance to enjoy running some of the emotions that make life better for us.

His befuddled (and often enraged) case of culture shock makes for hilarious reading, and he'll bring you with him every step of the way. But be warned: he takes no prisoners. Jerks in white Escalades, beware.Dave White: he moved to West Hollywood so you don't have to. But by the end, you'll feel like you've been there with him."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"I don't know about West Hollywood, but I do know about Texas. Dave White does both Texas and LA proud with this series of tales of his migration from one culture to the other. His iconoclastic insights are sharp and his style is I-wish-I-could-write-like-that clean. White's genius lies in his ability to turn the sofa-buying, yoga-stretching, doctor-visiting details of everyday life into hilarious commentary on contemporary culture. He's frank and open, and a quick read of this book is like a visit with an old friend who's moved on to Greater Things...and sort of wishes he'd stayed where he was. This book is going on an eye-level shelf. I have a feeling I'll be returning to it often."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"I didn't really know what to expect going into Exile in Guyville; the expanded title seemed to be putting the bitter right up front, almost challenging me to hate it. Then I started it off, and found myself cracking up on page one. It's fascinating to watch as White's wry observational humor turns into something less cranky and more bemused along the way. At first I was laughing at what was being said, then I was laughing along with the narrator. Most unexpected was the poignant ending that actually had me on the verge of tears - I did not expect to be actually moved by something so uproariously funny. I demand sequel!"},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"This book is a great summer read.

I have. You have and Dave White most certainly has. Funny reading beginning to end. Loved the book. Love Dave White even more!"},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"From a guy who gets plopped down in West Hollywood, in mid life kicking and screaming.That's the gist of this book by Dave White. I just finished it up early last week. Read it in it's entirity over the weekend.I loved it. Having lived in LA for 6 months back in 2002, I know many of the places he writes about within the book although I'd not noticed any celebrity sightings as I was primarily concerned with finding work the conventional way with no real success, which is why I'm not there anymore.Yes, Dave White does come across as bitchy, bighting and resisting things with all his might (I might add, he may be one of those that does not accept change too easily) and a redneck at that so yes, he'll come across as jaded and cynical as well and a little discriminatory at times, or so it appears anyway.I found the book highly entertaining, funny, irreverant and in the end, it becomes obvious that he's settling into LA life pretty well and begins to relax quite a bit. I find his observations quite accurate and funny.For those that don't know, LA is almost like a country onto itself, it's that different than just about anywhere else on this continent.Get it and delve into it. I highly recommend it. I have a feeling I'll be revisiting this book from time to time."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"Dave White gets \\"mean, but funny\\".I don't know from Texas or West LA, and it is okay if you don't either. Dave writes it they way he sees it and is not afraid to make fun of the whole mishpocha (it's Yiddish- look it up) and their little dog, too. I read the entire book in an evening and it has earned a place on my shelf of favorites. Well written and hilarious."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"OK, maybe I didn't cry, but I definitely laughed. I became familiar with Dave White's writing via msnbc.com. Every time I found myself chuckling at an article I'd notice it was written by him. That eventually led me to his blog and then to his book which I thorougly enjoyed. He has a way of pulling you into his neurotic thoughts and then showing you the genunine humor he finds in every one of them. I also enjoyed the fact that yes, he is gay, but he doesn't wave it like a flag. It's not used to prop up the ideas conveyed in this book. He communicates thoughts that are relative to anyone; gay, straight or purple. He portrays his relationship as something sweet, touching and enviable. I found myself identifiying with many of his hilarious psychotic episodes as his stories of surviving the very difficult task of being thrust into a completely different environment unfolded. What's even WAY cooler is that now that I've bought this book from Amazon.com they keep recommending this DVD called, \\"Puppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Art of Genital Origami\\". Awesome."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"Really, give Dave White a chance. Yeah, he comes of as bitchy, stuck up, elitist, philistinic, and oh-so-smug-with-his-world. But he has good writing chops, and it shows. For one thing, he's not a walking, talking gay stereotype. He's folically challenged. Fat. Lazy. Mooching off his ever so supportive spouse, morocco mole. I was beginning to think when I read the book if he ever was going to get off the pity pot regarding his disdain for all things Los Angeles, and hey, I HATE L.A., TOO!!! but, I guess that's the point. Most things that come across his radar are subject for scorn and pitched carelessly upon the junk heap of things he no longer has a use for. Does this have anything to do with the review? Yes, and No. Thank your lucky stars that his spouse had the insight to persuade this redneck twanger out of the swamp cooler, double wide world of trailer park texas into West Hollywood and to have the material to write this book. Dave White has a unique perspective on life, and I am looking forward to more of his shiny happy rants. (yes, Mr. White; whether you like it or not, you are one of the shiny happy poseurs that make up the bulk (no pun intended) of West Hollywood. Now that you have my thirteen dollars, go buy some BBQ.

I promise.If you haven't lived in LA, consider this book a cautionary tale...or a handbook...or an inspirational how-to guide...or evidence that the LA you see on Extra is, in fact, there...just not how you might think.Oh hell, just buy it - it's cheap!"},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"...because mine still hurts from laughing so hard.

His adaptation doesn't come easy, from forcing himself to deliberately ignore celebrities to enduring goodie-bag drenched press junkets of horrid Hollywood reject movies.A great profanity laden read end-to-end.

Raymond Chandler and Joan Didion come to mind. Finally, someone has done it with a nasty growl of humor and a playful sense of language that makes you wish you wrote it.This book isn't about being gay or anything like that. It's about the insanely funny details of acclimating to an insanely funny town.It's got nice bite-sized chapters and it's the cleverest book I've read in a long long time."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"As a wage slave in entertainment journalism, and a child refugee from Los Angeles, I found this book to be gut-bustingly funny. Dave White is one of the most charismatic narrators ever, and he understands the simple concept that the more willing an author is to lay him or herself completely bare, the more hilarious their exploits - however wretched - will be for the reader.

This book is written by a gay man, one who talks a whole lot about his partner, but to label it as solely a gay culture or gay interest title would be completely wrong. Dave White's unique writing style, best described as wry and grumpy, is all over this book. In particular, Dave is deft at poking at the right ripe targets and dishing out the right amount of snark (to those who deserve it) without being one of the overbearing, that-was-so-five-minutes-ago types. Underneath the grumpiness and punk rock attitude lies some really great commentary."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"There are two things in life that make it a little more livable - a good book and a good laugh. Dave White's \`Exile in Guyville' is a good book, filled with good laughs.From the start his quick, ascerbic wit and boyish charm are apparent. Add to that, the fact that his observations are dead on, and the manner in which he tells a story is so endearing that it tends to be difficult to set this book down.Buy this book now.Read.Giggle."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"This book couldn't be harder to put down if it was krazy-glued to your fingers.

Not \\"loved\\" it, and it didn't change my life. But it made me laugh again and again as I watched the author adjust or not adjust to his move from Texas to Hollywood. He is fiendishly accurate in his descriptions of Angeleno/Hollywood culture, and spares no-one including himself in his assessments.So why four stars rather than five? Because ultimately this is simply a series of essays without much besides location to tie it together. Yes, he attempts some \\"tie it all together and say what it means\\" moments at the end, but they barely escape being whiney and self-congratulatory. The guy who wrote the rest of the book would absolutely lambaste the guy who wrote the last few bits.Nonetheless, a fine read. I'm now following his commentary anywhere I can find it.

He's just a biased critic of anything/anyone he doesn't like (or doesn't like him). Not what review readers deserve. WHO WOULD ACTUALLY READ THIS BOOK?

Despite my misgivings, this is the most hilarious book I have ever read, and while I read, write and speak as a profession, I have nothing clever to say, other than if this doesnt make you laugh out loud, to the annoyance of your family or others nearby, then you should be embalmed soon, as a body starts to smell within a day or two. There is one serious, fatal flaw in this personal anecdote, I do not appear, and that all too briefly, until after page two hundred something of a barely more than two hundred something page book. Even in light of this egregious error, and my obvious personal bias in having taught the author everything important that he knows in his formative years, as one of the few labeled heterosexuals in the book, this has collection has little to do with being gay, compared to what it has to do with being stomache-ache-inducing funny."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"For fans of Dave White's blog, this book reads like his sassy posts about LA and pop culture. He has a way of peppering the most mundane observations with clever comedic one-liners that bitchslap you when you least expect it, like the punk-rock David Sedaris you'll never hear on NPR. For the uninitiated, this loose collection of essays only reveals a hint of his emerging talent.

I got it from a friend and enjoyed it a lot. Bought my own, I figure this is one you can read again and again, like Dilbert, but about life in general and with words.I like dry, english humor and satire, so it may not be for everyone. But I was surprised at how much I, a straight girl in the NE, connected with a gay Texan.Fun, fun read."},{"Title":"Exile in Guyville: How a Punk Rock Redneck Faggot Texan Moved to West Hollywood and Refused to Be Shiny and Happy","review":"I loved this book, I loved Dave's unapologetic ranting and whining about LA and its inhabitants (a**holes!!). I loved his special brand of 'gayness' and his queeny categorisations of the OTHER brands of gayness he is forced to interact with in rainbow flagged West Hollywood. For all the other non-shinyhappy people who inhabit (yes they do!!!) anywhere out of the LA geographical area, this book is a refreshing take on the whole stereotypical celeb seething wannabe clusterf*** that is 'reality' for anyone LIVING in LA and earning less than mega squillions a year. If you enjoy reading books like \\"Chorewhore\\", or relate to the hispanic domestics everpresent in the background in any LA-based flick, you'll also enjoy Exile in Guyville.It'd be great to see a follow up, or even a collection of Dave's columns. His observations of his grudgingly adopted home town resonate at the same frequency as Henry Rollins occasionally do: they both live there because they have to but they aren't going down without a fight goddarnit! These are witnesses to the flabbergasting proliferation of acceptable a**holeness which is flourishing in places like LA: road rage, blithe and rampant consumerism, self-centredness, rudeness and downright unfriendliness. Dave observes the LA reactions to his natural Texan inclination to greet a stranger or passer-by with a wave or a smile and he comments also that the people of LA regard themselves, and not the sun, as the centre of the universe.I like that people like Dave and Henry are documenting and commenting.

His accounts of celebrity sightings, neurotic Angelenos, and poignant exchanges between himself and his partner reach a level of hilarity I have seldom seen in print. If you don't buy this book, you are definitely missing out on one of the greatest accounts of gay life I have ever had the pleasure to read about.

Broadening Horizons not only takes readers through the details of the process,butuniquely paves the way to non-exploitative relationships so vital to anti-oppressive practice. This informative book thus should be read by program directors and students alike to learn of the link between values and policies internationally. When you read about the child welfare exchanges in Nova Scotia, for example, you are learning about family values cross-culturally--in Wisconsin, France, and Germany as well as in Canada. Broadening Horizons does just what the title indicates and makesfor fascinating reading besides. As compelling as any travelogue, this book provides exciting personal narratives that take us under a mosquito net in India, into the inner workings at the innovative Family Centre in Sweden and into the give and take at a Children's Aid case conference in Nova Scotia."},{"Title":"Rush to Judgment","review":"Growing up in New England, I have a great distaste for the sort of hippie or the anti-establishment nut case conspiracy theorists. In college, I wanted to write a paper supporting the Warren Commission's findings in order to spite the nut cases I had grown up around. I picked up this book expecting to tear it's arguments a part, however, Mark Lane ended up converting me. Mark Lane is one of the few people to take Ford's challenge and comb through the many volumes of \\"evidence\\" that the Warren Commission left behind. He points out many flaws and out right distortions of facts that the government made in their report. He is no \\"We did not land on the moon\\" kind of conspiracy theorist, but more a concerned citizen who was disturb by what he found and decided to write a book on it.

There is NO CREDIBLE evidence that proves Oswald fired ANY shots.Also it is a known FACT that Jack Ruby was an FBI informant for Richard Nixon and had ties to the NEw Orleans mafia who were heavily involved in Cuba.

It was the first widely read book questioning the official report. It was bold and risky to take on the establishment on such a huge cultural event, but Lane perservered. Like other early commentators, he didn't yet have access to the Church Reports of the mid 1970's, nor subsequent reports of what the CIA and the FBI withheld. It was the murder of the century. How often does a work of art (Oliver Stone's film) result in a new law passed unanimously by Congress to \\"open up the files?\\" In 2009, there are still a million pages withheld. Lane knew something was fishy.This was the start, and many books have followed. Those by Sumners,Thompson,Marrs,Hancock,Fonzi,Epstein,Waldron,Talbot, Meager,Morley,Weisberg,Scott,Lipton,Newman,Kurtz,Kaiser and Douglas, have expanded upon Lane's initial impulses and provided the citizens with what the governmen, through it's leaders, withheld."},{"Title":"Rush to Judgment","review":"Mark Lane (born 1927) is an American lawyer who has written other books such asLast Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK,Plausible Denial: Was the CIA Involved in the Assassination of JFK?, andA Citizen's Dissent. Mark Lane Replies To The Defenders Of The Warren Report, To The Press And Communications Industry, To The Establishment Intellectuals And Commentators And Tells The Often Grim Story Of How His Dissent Was Almost Silenced..This 1966 book was the first substantive book-length criticism of the Warren Commission report on the JFK assassination. It includes many troubling observations, such as that Howard L. Brennan (the man who is said to have seen Oswald through the Book Depository window, and later identified him in a police line-up) \\"himself FAILED to identify Oswald in the police line-up---in spite of the fact that he had by then seen Oswald on television. Only afterwards, when Oswald was dead, did Brennan say that... (he could have picked him out) had he not been afraid of 'communist' reprisals.\\" (Pg. 11-12)He notes that J. Edgar Hoover admitted to the Commission that the doctors examining Kennedy \\"at first thought the shots had come from the front.\\" (Pg. 12) The doctors stated that they believed the throat wound was an \\"entry wound\\" (pg. 47) Furthermore, 92 out of 124 witnesses affirmed that they believed the shots came from the \\"grassy knoll\\" in front, not the Book Depository in back. (Pg. 39) Two out of the three marksmen the Commission hired to test whether Oswald could have fired three shots in less than 6 seconds failed to get the shots off quickly enough, and none of them struck the head or neck of their stationary target, much less a moving one. (Pg. 127)He suggests that Oswald might have been murdered because \\"the conspirators wanted to silence him or because his ultimate vindication would have caused a search for the real criminals...\\" (Pg. 272) He concludes that the Commission \\"failed to conduct a thorough investigation... I believe the final failure of the Commission to be that it has prepared a fertile ground for the cultivation of rumor and speculation.\\" (Pg. 343)Although there are many more extensive and recent books on the JFK assassination (including those by Lane himself), this early book remains of interest to those wanting to get the complete background on the JFK assassination and the Warren Commission."},{"Title":"Rush to Judgment","review":"If your into studing the Kennedy assassination, this is one of the early books by Mark Lane on the subject(1966).

If so, why use Oswald at all?Where are the second shooter's bullets? Never found. So, they were hidden immediately AFTER the shooting? Where? In Jackie's purse? In the ash-tray?You see what I am saying? I'll give Mr. Lane credit for asking the right questions, but his answers really strain the evidence.Sometimes I feel like I was the only one NOT included in the conspiracy, probably because I was three years old at the time."},{"Title":"Rush to Judgment","review":"Lane is the only conspiracy dimwit who bothers to take the next step, and we can see where that step inevitable leads. Most other conspiracy morons simply say that the Warren Commission lied or covered-up whenever they prove conclusively that Oswald acted alone. In order to back up these claims, the conspiracy paranoids usually lie or distort themselves. They will tell you that Kennedy had enemies, and therefore he must have been assassinated, even though every president has enemies. The conspiracy nuts never manage to take into account how bad it would be for any group to actually kill the president. They will tell you that Ruby must have killed Oswald for the Mob, and they never take into account the absurdity of that idea. Lane actually tries to explain how a conspiracy happened, and he only manages to create a logistically impossible situation. I hope Vincent Bugliosi has finally put an end to these maddeningly paranoid conspiracy books."},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","review":"This book creates instant inspiration the moment you open it.

I have learned so much from reading it. What an artist!!!"},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","review":"This is absolutely THE book to have on mosaics, whether you are seeking historical/geographical information, artistic inspiration, or technical know-how. I own and use just about all of the mosaic books currently available, but this is the one book on the subject that I would say is essential, whether you're a beginner or an experienced mosaicist. No skimping on the beautiful and detailed pictures (over 500, all of them luscious), and the author's friendly, inclusive tone makes it clear that mosaic art can be joyfully and successfully participated in by just about anyone who wants to play.Creating mosaic art is an interesting field - it can be both highly technical and joyfully simple. Sonia King's book is by far the best I've encountered at bridging those two ends of the continuum; she discusses the properties of materials used (necessary to know so that your stuff will stick to your other stuff and not fall apart), the wide range of materials available now that can be utilized in successful mosaicking, and step-by-step how-to, but also makes it very clear that this is a field wide open for your own experimentation and self-expression. Maximum info, minimum rules - wahoo, what more could you want?And beautiful! Never mind whether or not you ever intend to cement a shard of glass to backing - the wonderful photos in this book make it well worth owning for anyone that appreciates art. She covers both historic and contemporary works with well-photographed pictures and in sufficient detail that the truly obsessed can examine them essentially tile by tile. Just looking through this book is inspiring, whatever your aesthetic sense or medium of expression. It will get your creative juices flowing, and once you are inspired it will lead you through the steps to create beautiful works of your own."},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","review":"I have over 50 books about mosaics and this is by far my favorite.

Like Biggs, King is an original -- taking this art form to new levels by mixing materials, designs, and methods in ways not seen before.The projects showcased are both delightful and instructional. You'll be able to work from start to finish on any of them without those nagging uncertainties that plague one when approaching a new medium. I've bought plenty of books on mosaics and started into something only to stop at some point and go &quot;Huh?&quot; Not with this book. Ms. King has translated her years of work as a mosaic instructor into useful, easy to understand, and thoughtful information.Last, but not least in a list of the book's attributes is just how much fun it is to read. If you're like me, you've fallen asleep while wading your way through &quot;The History of Mosaics&quot; sections in a lot of books. You will not find that the case here. Ms. King writes from the heart and shares her love of this art form in a genuine voice.

She also includes photographs of all kinds of different work, so the reader can be inspired by a style that speaks to him or her.

Sonia King draws from many historical traditions of mosaic making and gives you very good background on the art. Her work is of the highest quality."},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","review":"I really enjoyed looking at all the pictures in this book. Its a wealth of information on the history of mosaics too. As for actual ideas for projects to do that appealed to me... not so good. There was a time-out chair that was cute and some mirrored ornaments and maybe a water fountain... but that was it. I didn't really think there was that many project ideas at all. But she does give lots of info on the techniques and tools. It all depends what your looking for. If you want lots of ideas to make things yourself then this isn't the book in my opinion... unless you want to copy ideas from days gone by where mosaics were highly laborious and huge."},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","review":"I looked at many descriptions of mosaic books and took some out of the library to try. I was very lucky I picked this one to buy. It has a great section on the history of mosaics and many wonderful pictures.Then it shows in detail what tools you need and how to use them for mosaic projects. It describes the glues and the kinds of material you may be using: tessere, smalti, broken china etc. And then there are projects you can do to gain skill.I was looking for a book that had a more in-depth approach and this is it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in mosaics. Even if you don't do any projects, it expands your knowledge of the artform.I come from an art background and was interested in using mosaics for practical purposes like the garden. I also wanted to use the broken beads left over from making lampwork beads and this technique seems to be ideal for that."},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","review":"Para una autodidacta como yo, ha sido fant&aacute;stico poder contar con este libro, en el cual la autora entrega todos sus conocimientos, tanto de historia, materiales y t&eacute;cnicas.

The hero and heroine are of warring clans but their mutual attraction is what draws them together but not before our heroine has some heartaches along the way and the hero must deal with his family's wicked ways.

I had a hard time with the heroine in this book. Maddie is self-centered in the extreme - and yet everyone loves her. She is supposedly an intelligent woman - but she is the only one who does not guess at the identity of the villain (we readers figure it out pretty early in the story). Maddie is a very proper English countess who DESPISES men like our hero, Armand - yet she quickly jumps into bed with him when she learns the ship they are on is sinking. When there is a chance of Maddie's rescue, she does not hesitate to leave Armand to &quot;go down with the ship&quot; while she is saved. Maddie was VERY hard, no, she was impossible to like. When she came into some danger later in the story, I actually hoped something might happen to her, so that the hero (whom I DID like) could find the kind of woman that he deserved.As I read this book I found myself saying &quot;hmm...&quot; quite often - this is one of those stories where things happen a LITTLE too conveniently. For example, the strong man from a traveling circus shows up at Maddie's door one day to become her bodyguard, simply because, as he explains it, &quot;I had a dream that told me to come here&quot;. The hero, Armand, falls in love with Maddie at first sight, even though he is a playboy and even though he knows nothing about her (and as he says &quot;she isn't even the most beautiful woman he has met&quot;. Hmm...).There were some things that I liked about the book. I do think Ms. Ryan has a nice style of writing. The general plot wasn't bad, and I enjoyed the setting. And I did like the character of Armand - think Rick from Casablanca transplanted to New Orleans (in other words, the noble scoundrel). I will probably try another of Ms. Ryan's books, as she has gotten good reviews for her writing, but I would recommend that you skip this one."},{"Title":"The Countess Misbehaves","review":"I agree: I loved him, hated her. I am a true fan of Nan Ryan. I have read nearly all of her books. I must say that this is not her best work. I did like it though. I finished the book in two days time. It had a well-planned plot, and it flowed well. The wording, as in any Ryan novel, is wonderfully poetic. However, the rest of the book was far from original. I understand that with so much literature out there, it is hard to reach any level of \\"originality\\". But, it seemed like she just finished watching \\"Titanic\\" and became inspired to write this novel. (Jack and Rose/ Armand and Maddie, a few similarities could be seen). Yet, this novel is not even original for Nan Ryan herself. Nan Ryan's \\"Silken Bondage\\" has a similar beginning, where our heroine beds the rouge hero immediately. This book even resembles Ryan's \\"Sun God\\", (my all time favorite read!) where we see Luiz go beyond his limits to seduce Amy, as Armand does with Maddie. But one must keep in mind, though we may dislike her, and feel that poor Armand could have done better, that means that we have been effected. Ryan created characters that moved us, inspiring us to choose who we sympathize with, despise etc. And besides Nan Ryan gives the reader a bit of fanciful hope: if a woman as self-centered as Maddie could win the heart of a handsome, charming aristocrat-rogue, I guess we could too."},{"Title":"The Countess Misbehaves","review":"I agree: I loved him, hated her.

Take your time and embrace it."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"Kundera's \\"Art of the Novel\\" rings with the same provocative and bold insight that marks all his writing. He begins by exploring the unique capacities of the novel, springing from what he describes as \`Cervantes' depreciated legacy'. The novel, for Kundera, is the place where the whole non-Manichaeistic ambiguity of human experience - both banal and dramatic - can be explored. From this eagle-eyed view he moves to discussing the compositional techniques in his own novels, examines key writers from Central Europe and explores Kafka's work as the epitome of the \`anti-lyric' poetry which, for Kundera, is the distinguishing feature of all the great novels. He goes on to develop a polemical list of key terms that underpin this \\"Kunderesque\\" critique and finishes with the text of his 1985 acceptance speech on receiving the Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society. \\"It pleases me,\\" he observes in this address, \\"to think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of God's laughter.\\"Kundera takes up the themes of these essays again in \\"Testaments Betrayed\\" (1996) and revisits and hones them in \\"The Curtain\\" published in 2005. While all three collections circle around similar insights and obsessions, it is interesting to watch Kundera elaborate and distil the central preoccupations of his own novelistic impulse. Devotees of the work of Ren&eacute; Girard will find familiar themes here and Kundera acknowledges this debt to Girard explicitly in \\"Testaments Betrayed.\\"Don't expect a through-worked philosophical examination in any of these essays but do expect an impassioned and always engaging examination of the novel that cuts through a lot of the tedious claustrophobically self-referential tendencies of much postmodern criticism."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This is a good and insightful book. Because each chapter was written under different circumstances some may find it disjointed, but their is an underlying understanding of the novel that is coherent and profound. Kundera goes all the way back to Cervantes and show us how novelists have perceived and influenced the world down to our time. We pick up some central European novelists, like Hermann Bosch's trilogy, The Sleepwalkers, scandalously unknown in this country. Kundera shows us how novels occupy a role in culture were nothing else can go. A book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"In this book of essays, Kundera reveals an understanding of the progression of the European novel and his place in that progression. He reviews the paths that the development of the novel has taken and relates his own work to this literary tradition"},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"The book takes as its main subject the body of Kundera's own work. It is more demonstration than exploration of what constitutes the art of the novel. More focused on a central subject (Kundera's production) than exhaustive object (the generalization \\"novel\\"), the book approaches its argument from several vantages and seems most interested in revealing something as close to the impetus to write as possible. The tone is that of \\"serious play.\\""},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This book is amazing. Like all other books of Kundera (some I've read myself, of some read summaries and reviews), this book too conveys the simplest philosophies in the best of words. For example, when he explains 'vertigo', you'll know his unique interpretation of things happening around. A must read for all literature lovers and will certainly make an interesting reading for those looking for a different definition or dimension of oft-repeated terms in English."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"A light and heavy journey with Kundera along his personal aesthetic path that also takes in the road of the European novel.

Maybe they're amazing. Maybe. But judging from this book--and from some of the other reviewers who have posted here--I'd guess they're about as unpretentious as a pale, young intellecutal discussing the merits of W.G. Sebald and Friedrich Nietsche at a Cambridge, Massachussetts tea shop.This book DEFINES pretentious. The author knows you're an uneducated fool, and he will prove it to you.That said, he's not an idiot, and a lot of his pompousness is justified. If you don't mind having a thousand things quoted at you that you've only read half of, or the author's overall snobby tone, then you really might find some good insights into a the structure of books and the weaving of stories....Or, you might find yourself scribbling death threats to the author in the margins. ...Yeah, that's a bad habit of mine."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I know I read this book. I read it all. I tried to learn about the art of novel- writing from it.I have just read the Amazon reviews posted about this novel. A couple are good. They tell me that Kundera writes here about Cervantes, Sterne, Balzac, Dostoevsky and Kafka. They tell me the book has a seven- part structure as his novels do. They tell me that Kundera contrasts the art of the novelist with the thought of the philosopher- and that for him the art of the novelist is in portraying ambiguity and complexity. They tell me that this particular book is one of his best.Now I have read other Kundera works. I know his work plays much with chance and infidelity and philosophical reflections by the characters on whether their disloyalty or love is bringing them to the incredible lightness of being which some seem bound to living in. They tell me too that the reflections touch about politics , Czech freedom, what it means to write under tyranny and what it means to live in the West.But the truth is I having read this work on the novel by Kundera remember not one single sentence or thought from it.This the impatient Amazon reader perhaps thinks says more about my own empty head than it does about the value of Kundera's work.But I now wonder if something in Kundera's world and way of seeing things, his kind of liberation, his kind of emphasis on the incidental and very secular do not repel this religious reader seeking to feel that all, even in the novel, should have some kind of deep and permanent connection with the One Source of all true meaning.It may be I have forgotten Kundera because his themes and understanding are ones I simply do not wish to know."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"&quot;Outside the novel, we're in the realm of affirmation: everyone is sure of his statements: the politician, the philosopher, the concierge. Within the universe of the novel, however, no one affirms: it is the realm of play and of hypotheses. In the novel, then, reflection is essentially inquiring, hypothetical.&quot;Thus Milan Kundera affirms the wonder and beauty of the novel and explains the difference between how philosophers think and how novelists think. Born of the Modern Era ushered in by seventeenth century rationalism, the novel contemplates and explores existence in the Modern Era. Like the Modern Era, the novel is distinguished by its ambiguity and complexity. For Kundera, the novel's core is an inquiry, not a moral position. It makes sense, therefore, that in a world where humans long for black/white, wrong/right distinction, that the \\"wisdom of uncertainty\\" which Kundera calls the wisdom of the novel, should be so hard to accept and understand.This remarkable short book shares the seven part form of several of Kundera's novels: each can stand alone but all are connected by vital and pervading themes. The seven parts comprise two essays, a collection of notes, two dialogues, a dictionary of sixty-three words, and an acceptance speech for a literary prize--and not in the order just mentioned. This mosaic structure works well to underscore part of Kundera's point: there are many ways to approach an understanding of the novel. Is Don Quixote a critique or a celebration of idealism? Both cases have been made often, neither is right--the novel's spirit of complexity and continuity brooks no dogmatism. In fact, the novel has its own \\"radical autonomy\\" which Kundera uses to illuminate the works of Franz Kafka. It can say and show things humans cannot achieve in any other way.If the novel that is art--the novel that truly says something new--is to survive, novelists would do well to think more like Milan Kundera. Readers of THE ART OF THE NOVEL, meanwhile, will gain a new appreciation for the genre as well as valuable insight into the thought process of one of the world's greatest living novelists."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"Milan Kundera is a Czechoslavakian writer who lives in France. He's written a number of novels, among the THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING. In this, his first nonfiction effort, Kundera relates the concept of the novel to his own work. The first two essays were inspired by an interview he gave to The Paris Review on his practical experiences with the art of the novel.His focus goes beyond his own work, however. Kundera presents some rather intense and unusual analyses of his personal favorite writers: Cervantes, Rabelais, Sterne, Diderot, Flaubert, Tolstoy and Kafka, to name just a few.This is a book for the scholarly reader; the reader who knows literature. It is one that illuminates all sorts of possibilities for writing the novel, for Kundera points out the the novel can express life in ways that can't be achieved by any other form.He moves from the general to the specific -- from the form of the novel, to the way others have used it, to his own work. Particularly interesting is his dictionary of 63 key words which he says are essential to understanding his fiction. His observations about the state of contemporary Russian literature -- what is being published and why -- are fascinating. He also expresses his frustration, as an author, with translators of his works and how they handle language.&quot;The art of reading,&quot; wrote Andre Maurois, &quot;is in great part that of acquiring a better understanding of life from one's encounter with a book.&quot; Readers will come away from this with a better understand of the novel as an expression of life as well as deeper insight into a number of classical works."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This relatively small book (165 pages) offers an engaging peek into the mind of a brilliant novelist and scholar. Consisting of interviews, speeches, and published work, Kundera expounds on his literary beliefs about what makes a great novel. My favorite sections are the interviews because of their immediacy and accessibility, although the author's most profound insights arise from his discussion of other authors: Kafka, Cervantes, Tolstoy, Flaubert, and others.Writers, students of literature, and Kundera's faithful readers should find much to think about in these pages. This is not a light discourse on how to write a novel; Kundera takes his art seriously, in both deeply instinctive and scholarly ways. Those looking for a how-to book would be well-served to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I recall that when asked about his &quot;Theorie Aesthetique&quot; by a journalist, Picasso took out a pistol and shot it in the air. Evidently Picasso did not care to banalize his works into neat theories for art critics. The problem is that Picasso often did lapse into following a theoretical form...more so in his later works.I read this book in French, &quot;L'Art Du Roman&quot; and while it does not attempt to reduce Kundera's works to neat theories, it does shed light on the philosphical underpinnings of many of his novels.In fact, one of the main themes of this book is the critique of reductionism. He exalts the &quot;Wisdom of Uncertainty&quot; and eschews any art work that proceeds from an ideology or moral high ground as such leads to judgement rather than understanding. Somewhat in an existentialist vein, Kundera promotes the idea of &quot;l'ambiguite&quot; as the ideal for the novel. That is to say that given we live in a world where there is no right or wrong way to proceed, the role of the novel is to understand each character within his own constructs, not according to some extrnal morality or ideology.Kundera's debt to Heidegger is made obvious throughout the book, and Kundera quotes him often. One is left wondering what Kundera's ideas on morality might be. However, I would not go so far as saying that he follows suit with Heidegger on this mattter. Heidegger's &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; is interested in the question of being. For Da-Sein, morality is secondary, and relativistic, not primary and essential. No doubt, this indiffference towards morality led to Heidegger's nazism. However, if Kundera does not take a moralistic posture in &quot;unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, he defintiely implies that we suffer or thrive on a spiritual level with certain choices that we make....-Thomas Seay"},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I am starting a novel this summer, and this book was recommended to me by my Creative Writing professor. Being a fan of Kundera already, I bought the book without question.For the reviewer who said that Kundera writes pretentiously: I am actually amazed, since Kundera's lack of pretention and clarity surprised me. So much literary criticism is bloated and difficult to read, but Kundera is very simple, very concise, and yet also explanatory. Often he will make a statement, such as \\"All novels are concerned with the enigma of the self,\\" which he not only explains but gives immediate examples, never letting the flash of his writing try to convey the point.So much ground is covered in this tiny book: the difference between modernism and \\"establishment modernism,\\" the craft of his own work, the history and purpose of the novel, insights into several of his great works, insights into European history, parallels between music and literature, etc, etc. Make sure to take notes, since your memory won't be able to hold everything in.I praise Kundera also for his deep respect for the novel, not only arguing against those \\"established modernists\\" who claim the novel is dead or antiquated, but stressing the infinite possibilities of the novel and how the weaknesses of the great works show the paths future novels can take. Rather than being pretentious or snobbish, Kundera reaffirms the life of the novel as central to the question of the self, which is as infinite as the novel is.This book is also essential for writers especially. For plotting out the structure for my work, Kundera's insights have been invaluable. Of course, Kundera doesn't suggest you write as he does, and you won't want to, but his radiant insight surely helped me find out what I myself wanted to do. Kundera's essays prompt exploration and possibility. A great read."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I haven't read a book this brilliant and intellectually-provoking in a long time. Milan Kundera is a first-class thinker who will be and has been pegged as elitist and pretentious by some reviewers here (and elsewhere I'm sure). Since we're living in an age of ever-diminishing education where a college diploma is equivalent to what a technical degree used to be, this is to be expected, and is indeed flattery. In the section of the book called Sixty-three Words, Kundera himself addresses the issue under \\"Elitism\\": The word \\"elitism\\" only appeared in France in 1967 [note: it appeared elsewhere in Europe as much as ten years earlier]. For the first time in history, the very language threw a glare of negativity, even mistrust, on the notion of elite. Official propaganda in the Communist countries began to pummel elitism and elitists at the same time. It used the terms to designate not captains of industry or famous athletes or politicians but only the cultural elite: philosophers, writers, professors, historians, figures in film and theater....It seems that in the whole of Europe the cultural elite is yielding to other elites. Over there, to the elite of the police apparatus. Here, to the elite of the mass media apparatus. No one will ever accuse these new elites of elitism...In this dense but slim work, Kundera discusses the essence of the novel, which is in his view the exploration of uncharted territory through structure, insight, ideas and themes. Which is the idea of art in general, really, be it painting, music or anything else. In a revealing section, he talks about the tyranny of kitsch, which is the beautification (and in the process simplification) of everything, to make it palatable to the reader/viewer. Kitsch is prettified lies, in other words, and he points out how most of us live all of our lives this way, never looking below the surface, never grasping the complete and true meaning of most anything. With the mechanism of unfettered, unquestioned capitalism the reigning societal model in the 20th (and even more so now in the 21st) century, this uniformity is fast becoming the only acceptable model, in his (and my) view. Thus the very impetus that drives the novel--and all art--is, in his view (and my view) dying, if not dead.Those stuck in the tyranny of kitsch may object: there are plenty of novels out there--Anne Rice and JK Rowlings and Ken Follett and Tom Clancey. Those are the purveyers of kitsch Kundera was talking about. To wit, jazz, another art form, is dead. Sure we have Wynton Marsalis et al, but they haven't advanced the art one iota. Lennie Tristano did and the world is still almost completely unfamiliar with his work, because jazz listeners aren't ready for real advances in the art; they'd prefer prepackaged familiarity being offered as advances. *That* Kundera would define as kitsch. Occasionally a true iconoclast breaks through the mold--Thelonious Monk--but they are usually celebrated long after they make their mark or for superficialities and eccentricities. Of course there *are* definitely exceptions to this grim scenario, but they tend to just prove the rule.This will be a tough one for most people to accept or perhaps even really understand. To do so you have to look at *everything* differently and not accept anything at face value. People who do that are usually labeled \\"elite\\" and \\"pretentious.\\" And as \\"market democracy,\\" of workers who must expend most of their intellectual capital in pursuit and maintenance of their livelihoods, but with increasing disposable incomes, continue to grow (China, India, S. Korea, Brazil, Taiwan), look for kitsch, and the \\"received wisdom\\" contained in it, to increase.Furthermore, Kundera's despair, if I may call it that (for he doesn't, but I get that feeling from him) is that most people don't understand the difference, cannot distinguish kitsch, insincerity, even if you explain it to them, distinguish it for them. They are too lost in the realm of emotions, defending themselves from what they perceive as a personal intellectual attack, a \\"pissing contest\\" of the minds. It is supremely ironic, then, that it is they who call others who make this distinction \\"pretentious,\\" when the very meaning of the word reflects more upon them. By just fitting in with everyone else they are the ones harboring pretense, because they are just aping the behavior of everyone around them, or at the very least endorsing the superficial reality that Kundera discusses, and that he believes it's the novel's duty to overcome. This is a rather cerebral argument, however, and I don't expect it to resonate widely. If economics is the dismal science, art is the equivalent in the world of the aesthetic.And so it goes. Kundera has cogently summed up the dilemma of his, and our, age. The Sixth part alone is worth the price of the book, and the summation of his philosophy of art in the Seventh is brilliant, with a perfect finishing observation that puts everything he has previously said into perspective--in one sentence he smashes to bits the modern wisdom of the premise of cultural-relativism. After closing this book I felt like I had spent an afternoon with an extremely thoughtful person who had seen a great deal and thought deeply about it. One can see how the forces of Communism shaped his values and concerns--our market-driven ones of today are alien to him, and we are the poorer for it. Too bad there are so few, if any, Kunderas anymore. Yes, he's still alive, but at 79, he's hardly a new voice or fresh mind, and to whom he'll leave his intellectual legacy is anyone's guess. And many would consider such concerns to be pretentious anyway.Someone who previewed this review said it reads more like a philosophical discussion than a book review. That makes sense, since a philosophical discussion is precisely what Kunder'a book is. Perhaps a better title might have been \\"The Philosophy of the Novel\\"?"},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"In these brilliant reflections Milan Kundera discusses fundamental characteristics of the novel, its history and its immorality.The object of the novel is the enigma of the self (the subject) functioning in a world full of ambiguities, where all things human are relative.HistoryNovelists, like Cervantes, examined the self through its actions, which (partly) revealed the nature of the self.A new generation, like Flaubert, delved into the self's invisible interior life (dreams, the irrational) in order to reveal the self's secrets.Joyce dissects painstakingly the present.In fine, F. Kafka poses the ultimate question of what possibilities are left in a world where the external determinants become so overpowering that internal impulses no longer carry weight.Radical autonomyKafka's novels are the masterful proofs of the radical autonomy of the novel. By creating an extreme and unrealized possibility of the human world, Kafka expressed things about our human condition which no social or political thought could ever tell.ImmoralityThe novel is boundless freedom. It is not rational or based on verisimilitude.Novelists should use this freedom to discover unrealized possibilities of the human world. A novelist who doesn't unveil a hitherto unknown segment of human existence is immoral.These in depth meditations on one of the major components of human art are a must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"In this critical examination of the \\"art of the novel\\", Kundera meditates upon the existence or non-existence of \\"art\\" in novel-writing. It is a combination of narrative and philosophical ponderings highlighted by Kundera's famed lyricism. However, therein lies the the book's weakness. The dense language could lose your \\"average\\" reader and some issues, such as the meaning of art, begin to lean far more towards the philosophical rather than in analytical technique. Kundera tends to wander off on tangents."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"A highly interesting and introspective piece into the art of novel writing from one of Europe's finest contemporary authors, Mulan Kundera. His philosophical background is particularly impressive has he attempts to relate back the meaning of his work to existential and phenomenological origins in Husserl, Heidegger, and Nietzsche. I also particularly enjoyed Kundera's comparisons of literature to music in which he describes the forms of multiple Beethoven compositions as well as the basic structures of his own novels. This is an enormously stimulating read, though not necessarily helpful for the blossoming writer."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This book has the property of timelessness, much like the \\"writing on writing\\" that is seen in Eric Auerbach and Kenneth Burke. However, it is in no way literary theory, nor is it, contrary to what some of the other reviewers seem to believe, \\"philosophical.\\" It is a careful explication of the author's principles, not a grand theoretical schema. The instantiation of real human circumstances, ones deeply concerned with the problems entailed by Heidegger's in-der-Welt-sein, is what differentiates the novel from philosophy. It is nothing less and nothing more than a series of seven disquisitions on the historical development of the European novel.\\"The Depreciated Legacy of Cervantes,\\" serves to offer the substance for latter explication, meditation, and the occasional tangent. Its subject is the history and development of the European novel that is deeply rooted in existential concern. As Kundera says, \\"A novel that does not discover a hitherto unknown segment of existence is immoral.\\" He is careful to delineate the novel's uniqueness as a historical artifact, and sees modernity as closely tied to the regnant existential themes as those explored by Joyce, Kafka, Sterne, Gombrowitz, and Broch (a somewhat epigrammatic essay on The Sleepwalkers is contained herein). But Kundera sees the inaugural journey into modernity as one that is essentially Cervantes'. Don Quixote enters a world that has seen the weakening influence of religious dogmatism. His experience contains none of the certitude of categorical absolutes that were so indicative of earlier existence (again, that desideratum for novelists)."},{"Title":"Introduction to Organic and Biochemistry","review":"This book was origanaliy writind in three parts, 1-General 2-Organic 3-Biochem and is available in parts or the whole.

For example, we have Superman spraying amnesia gas over the town of Smallville after the people of Smallville discover Supergirl's existence. Superman then proceeds to produce new copies of the local newspaper omitting any mention of Supergirl.Full credit to the writers who had the difficult task of keeping Supergirl's existence a secret until she was ready to face the world. This limited Supergirl's roles in the stories, but clever use enabled Supergirl to travel to the future and to the past, to be stranded on an asteroid by Superman, and even gets transformed into a superbaby.Curt Swan has long been associated, and quite rightly so in my opinion, as the definitive Superman artist. Here we have the definitive Supergirl artist, Jim Mooney.I don't really like the cover by Frank Miller. I would have preferred a new illustration by the main artist himself, Jim Mooney. But despite this, I still give this book a five star rating.No news yet of a follow up edition, but the good news is that a Superboy collection is coming soon. This will make an excellent addition, and companion, for the Supergirl Archives.In the meantime, this is an excellent addition to the Superman collection, and I give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Supergirl Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"I enjoyed this early collection of the origins of Supergirl, who is Superman's cousin. This is when comics had a meticulous continuity and strived to create stories that made sense to the readers. I reccomend this to those fans of the DC family. It makes a lovely gift to someone who remembers those days. It will leave you wishing for still more as it did me.The Supergirl stories are sweet-natured as is Supergirl herself. I look forward to seeing future volumes, hopefully some that will include the era of Kurt Schauffenberger's art.Buy this while you can."},{"Title":"The Supergirl Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"&quot;Supergirl Archives Vol. 1&quot; collects the Supergirl back-up stories from Action Comics #252-268. It also includes the Supergirl &quot;try-out&quot; issue from Action Comics #123, where Jimmy Olsen wishes up a &quot;Super-Girl&quot; companion for his buddy Superman. It all ends badly of course, but paves the way for Superman's cousin, Kara Zor-El to arrive in a rocket 8 months later.In these early issues, Supergirl is hidden away from the public. She is Superman's secret weapon and spends most of her time maintaining her secret identity of orphan Linda Danvers. Eventually, she goes to the future to meet the Legion of Super-Heroes and Tommy Tomorrow. Her pet, Streaky the Supercat shows up as well.The stories, written mainly by Otto Binder of Marvel Family fame, showcase the beginning of what would become the Superman Family. Soon Comet the Superhorse, Beppo the Supermonky and the entire bottle city of Kandor would be roaming around with &quot;The Last Son of Krypton.&quot; There is a charming innocence in the stories, and they are very well crafted silver age comics. The art, by Jim Mooney and Al Plastino, is suiting to the stories. The new Frank Miller cover is a nice addition, although an odd choice as he is not an artist one associates with the character of Supergirl."},{"Title":"The Supergirl Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"I first discovered Supergirl when I had to accompany my ride to the grocery story. There I picked up Issue 9 of the current Supergirl and was *hooked*. I'd pick up a copy here and there, but couldn't really keep up with the storyline.Then I picked up this book...Yowzah! I'm even more of a Supergirl fan now than I was before! I have to wonder if the current writers were tipping their hats to the original ones when they gave the new supergirl's alter-ego the name of &quot;Linda&quot;...Oy, I catch myself rambling. I'm not a rabid comic book person, in fact, I'd have to say that Supergirl is the only one that ever caught my interest (though I do have to tip my hat to Wolverine, cause he's Canadian!). The publishers did a superb job in their presentation of this classic. The artwork is (of course) superb, and I find that knowing what the *original* Supergirl was like makes me like the current one even more. I earnestly await the second volume, and the next issue!I'm sorry if this wasn't much help, I'm not much of one for reviews.

What you get here are the first dozen or so adventures of Kara Zor-El, Superman's teenaged cousin from the doomed planet Krypton. The one, true Supergirl. Not a protoplasmic blob, not an angel, the Girl of Steel in all her four-color glory.DC Comics killed Kara off during a house-cleaning in the mid 1980s and, to their surprise, fans have been clamoring for her return every since. These are stories from another time, a simpler time, when comics didn't have to be scientifically accurate to be good, clean fun. Share these stories with a youngster who's just getting into reading, you'll make a fan, trust me.Welcome back, Kara. Even if it's just a visit to some fond, old memories. You've been missed, kiddo."},{"Title":"The Supergirl Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"When the planet Krypton exploded, Argo City miraculously survived under a bubble of air. However, the ground soon turned into kryptonite. Despite the diligent efforts of scientist Zor-El, Argo City was soon destroyed, save for Zor-el's daughter, Kara. He sent her to Earth, where he had discovered another Kryptonian survivor: Superman. In a quirk of fate, Superman is in fact Kara's cousin. Discovering her rocket, Superman takes the newly arrived Supergirl to a local orphanage, where, under the guise of Linda Lee, she must remain hidden. For Superman realizes she needs to learn Earth's ways, and he sees an opportunity to develop a secret weapon.I have a personal caveat when it comes to reading vintage comics: plot over character. This is especially true for silver age super-hero comics, which were predominantly aimed at kids, and so went more for elaborate plot gimmickry. Another caveat must be brought to \\"The Supergirl Archives\\" Vol. 1: this series of stories, written by almost exclusively adult men, was aimed at girls. As such, it's not hard to see certain presumptions of the day taken at the heart of most of these stories. Indeed, the central premise of the series it pretty \\"girl-friendly\\": Supergirl must live covertly as Linda, never allowing her existence be known. When she does go into action, it's usually to prevent some disaster, or solve some minor problem around the orphanage. In other words, Supergirl wasn't given much opportunity to punch out Lex Luthor.Written mainly by Otto Binder, the stories are whimsical, and get a great deal of mileage out of the simple idea of a 15-year-old girl with super powers. While Linda can't operate in the open, she does get a great deal of satisfaction in being able to help her fellows at the orphanage, be it to help them with adoption or simply blowing away rain clouds. Jim Mooney's art, while similar to the other artists on Superman, is still very good, and grew more distinct as the series progressed, conveying the good natured fun cleanly and with tremendous energy.It's hard to pin down any favorites. Most are quite fun and satisfying. There are some that take the premise of the character to illogical extremes, as Superman puts Supergirl through some harsh and dubious tests to prove her ability to keep her secret. There is also one story, \\"Mighty Maid\\", in which Supergirl poses as Superman's super-powered girlfriend, that is just creepy when one thinks about it too much. However, these are minor pitfalls in a collection of stories that feature Supergirl trying to develop immunity to kryptonite, and then accidently giving a normal cat super powers, Supergirl getting adopted by a police officer and his wife, and a team-up with the Legion of Super-heroes, among others.\\"The Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" killed and then erased this version of Supergirl from existence. She's recently been reintroduced after a couple of different versions. It's nice see the character when she was fresh and simple."},{"Title":"The Supergirl Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"The best part of the Supergirl archives is that it is strongly set in the Superman universe where the most outlandish things can happen with nary a bat of an eye.

DC has done a fantastic job in providing a quality hardbound collection of the world's greatest comics at a very low price.

There are some problems, though...I got this volume because I was looking for superhero \\"girl\\" role models for my daughter to enjoy, and while I appreciate the relatively nonviolent nature of the Supergirl stories, I did have problems with the underlying sexism of the series. For many months in the early episodes, Supergirl was hamstrung by her bossy older cousin, Superman, who tucks her away in an orphanage and tells her never to go out in public and use her powers. Now, this isn't to protect her from harm -- no, it's so that he can use her as a \\"secret weapon\\" against crime, a backup superheroine who will blow the minds of criminals when she's finally let out of the box. Thus, most of the early stories revolve around endless clumsy and utterly unnecessary plot devices employed so that Supergirl can sneak out and break her super-curfew. The only real reason for the character to be neutered this way is because the editors just weren't ready to have a \\"girl\\" be as strong as Superman; surely they could have come up with *some* way to make the stories more interesting without playing the same old hiding-her-true-identity trick over and over again. Still, even with the silly restrictions, Supergirl had her fun, and these late-vintage Silver Age stories are way more engaging than the sluggish super-comics of the '40s, and far less dark than the stuff we've been reading since the 1980s. In short, this era and these stories are an ideal introduction for newer, younger, more innocent comicbook readers. Definitely recommended.

This would be a great companion book for the excellent Schiffer Book \\"Geronimo\\" which covers WWII American Airborne clothing and equipment."},{"Title":"German Paratroops, Uniforms, Insignia & Equipment of the Fallschirmjager in Wwii: Uniforms, Insignia & Equipment of the Fallschirmjager in World War II (Schiffer Military History)","review":"The difficult thing about producing a book focused on a personal collection is that the book will be strong in the areas that interest the author, while being severely lacking where the author doesn't have an interest or has a hole in his collection. \\"German Paratroops\\" suffers from this problem in spades.If you're interested in German paratroopers from the invasion of Crete on, you probably won't be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you want to know about German paratrooper uniforms from the pre-war period through the invasions of Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands in 1940, you're completely out of luck. These were among the Fallschrimj&auml;gers' most notable campaigns, and yet you would never know they happened from reading \\"German Paratroops\\".Another issue that I had is that, while the author offers cursory descriptions of specific items in his collection, he expends no effort whatsoever to place that item in history. What came before it? What came after it? How was it used? What were its strengths or shortcomings? The reader is left with no idea. Similarly, particular features of featured items are described, but the photos - nice as they are - ignore those particular features. A specific example is that the author describes a feature of the helmet liner that is apparently unique to all early war double-decal helmets. But despite offering several photos of the exterior of these helmets, not once does the author actually turn the helmet over to offer a photo of what he just described. In this and many other places, close-up photos of details are lacking and are sorely missed. Finally, while individual items are shown in isolation, the author never actually puts it all together to show a fully equipped soldier.This is a very nice looking book, and it does offer some useful photos, but overall I was disappointed. I was hoping for something like the Fallschirmj&auml;ger version of Augustin Saiz's excellent \\"Deutsche Soldaten\\" book. Instead, I got an attractive but not very deep coffee table book."},{"Title":"Venice: The Four Seasons","review":"Venice: The Four Seasons is neither a coffee table book nor a travel book, but it wants to be both, with the result that it does not quite succeed at either. Although the photos are lovely and less usual views of Venice, and although occasional bits of prose are apt and revealing, in general the book is just not coherent enough to be involving.Lisa St Aubin de Teran has written at least one excellent book about Italy - A Valley in Italy. In Valley, her somewhat disconnected style supports and is supported by the structure and topic of the book, creating a delightful and funny work. In Venice, that same style is even more disconnected - her paragraphing is almost random, and the paragraphs themselves do not flow into each other, meaning that the text also doesn't flow - and unfortunately the topic and structure of the book make that disjunction worse. This makes for rather uncompelling text that never seems to commit to a train of thought; you might enjoy what you're reading at the moment, but you don't feel any compulsion to continue reading. After a while, I found myself fighting the impulse to skim, something I rarely do, just so I could get to the next set of photos faster.The photographs are lovely; almost all professional pictures of Venice are. It is, after all, one of the most photogenic cities in the world. It is also one of the most photographed, so I was pleased that Mick Lindberg, the photographer, avoided the easy, cliche shots, presenting a more personal, intimate view of Venice. And when Lindberg does include standard shots, like gondolas, he offers an unusual take on them - gondolas in a repair shop, in the snow, covered in plastic, etc. The photos were the most appealing part of the book for me, so I was disappointed that the publishers didn't go for a full-scale coffee-table book approach; the book is smaller than a coffee-table book, and has less space devoted to pictures.In short, the book is worth reading and examining for the creators' take on Venice; they do a fine job of presenting a less-publicized side of the city. With more photos, and more coherent and focused text, the book would be a classic. As it is, it is well worth reading once - but not worth the cover price."},{"Title":"Never While the Grass Grows (Harlequin Romance #2226, January 1979)","review":"Octavia: tall lovely hospital nurse.

His treatise upon negligence and judicial discretion reaches back to Roman foundations (even back to Adam and Eve, p. 27) and ends with modern theories on fault and negligence. Parisi's work is historical, comparative and critical. It was and is a challenging book.In the main the book is structured chronologically. After a short introduction the author describes the early roots of liability, starting with the biblical lex talonis. He then turns to Roman law, to its adoption in medieval civil law and to canon law. Part I ends with the sixteenth century, stressing the achievements of Donellus (for whose ideas the author shows much sympathy (pp. 130-31)). Part II explains how natural lawyers dealt with the problem of fault and the difficulties in setting their ideas into the civil law codifications, that is the French Civil Code and the German BGB. In part III the author leaves the civil law systems and focuses on the development of modern common law, concentrating on its American form. When in part IV the reader is confronted with contemporary theories on negligence, he or she will look at them with much deeper, much &quot;older&quot; knowledge.The strength of Parisi's work lies in his description of Roman law and in his ability to show its influence on the development. of the common law of torts as well as of civil tort law systems. Even where no direct influence of Roman law is shown, the work gives us a clear view of the striking parallels legal systems develop when confronted with the problem of negligence. But Parisi's intention goes further than giving mere descriptions of other people's ideas. His deep insight into the subject enables him to evaluate and criticize the different concepts. In the end, the reader understands why the unsolved riddles of negligence are still unsolved and thus (particularly if he or she has a civil law background) will have a greater tolerance towards the judge's discretion in negligence cases.Kerstin StrickBonn University"},{"Title":"Buffalo soldier (French Edition)","review":"The author, who penned the classic international bestseller, \\"The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother\\", and was the recipient of the prestigious Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, now turns to a story inspired by an incident that took place during World War II in the war torn, Italian village of St. Anna di Stazzema in the region of Tuscany. This is the French text edition of \\"Miracle at St. Anna\\", a war yarn with a twist, as it features a certain segment of our nation's army at the time, the Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Division.The Buffalo soldiers were men of color in the segregated army of yesteryear. On top of fighting enemy soldiers, they were also subjected not only to racist stereotyping but to poor battle decisions by their white commanding officers, which decisions reflected just how dispensable the army thought these Buffalo soldiers to be. This is a story primarily viewed through the eyes of these very soldiers.In the town of St. Anna di Stazzema, something very bad happened, something that would affect all those who would encounter those connected to the town and its events. It would affect Germans, Americans, Italians, partisans, and collaborators in different ways. Its impact would carry through the years and last until the present day.This is a story about those Buffalo soldiers, the village in Tuscany nestled in a war zone, the enemy soldiers, villagers, collaborators, and partisans whom they encounter. At the heart of all that transpires is a little Italian boy, traumatized by war, whose fate would touch all with whom he came in contact and who would be at the heart of the miracle that was to take place. It is through him that they all learn that miracles do, indeed, exist.The book gets off to a great start. In present day New York, an older postal worker, for seemingly no reason, blows away a customer at point blank range with the single pull of a trigger. An investigative reporter runs with a lead and finds that the postal worker has, hidden in his home, a famous piece of statuary, an exquisitely sculpted head, which has been missing from a bridge in Italy since World War II. The mystery deepens.The book then reverts to World War II and the cast of characters that are central to the story. It is here that the author runs into some difficulties. When a number of Buffalo soldiers get caught behind enemy lines, the story start to fall apart. Though it is an interesting story, it is simply dully told. Excruciatingly pedestrian in its telling, the book takes its toll on the reader, turning what could have been a vivid, riveting account into a soporific one.It is not until towards the end of the book that the story again picks up and is able to deliver the same one two punch that it does in the beginning. By then, however, it is too late, and the book never reaches the promise so incipient in its beginning pages. Still, for those readers willing to put up with some disappointment, the book ultimately delivers at the end."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":". . . if, like me, you are curious about what it's like on the inside of the Muslim world.I've long wondered, where are all the atheists and agnostics who used to believe in the Koran? Why don't we ever hear about them?This book will tell you why. It's because people who leave Islam in Islamic controlled countries must fear for their lives. Therefore, it's easier to remain silent.And if they live in the West, they must remain anonymous to protect family members still living in an Islamic country.If this book is any indication, there are numerous skeptics and free thinkers out there today who were raised Muslim - this is so encouraging. I was filled with admiration for those who, even after years of being devout Muslims, began to question what they had been taught.This book is not written by angry people who had some unpleasant experiences with one or two Muslims who behaved badly towards them. It contains accounts written by countless intelligent, introspective people who earnestly sought to find spiritual fulfillment through Islam. The more they studied, however, and the deeper they dug, the more they realized that they had been fed a diet of unsavory and potentially poisonous lies. They are not reactionaries, as some of the previous reviewers have implied. Neither do any of these personal accounts seem at all invented or made up with some sort of agenda to discredit Islam, as some reviewers have flat out stated to be the case.If you read this book, you will find it to be full of accounts written by thoughtful men and women who often agonized over giving up their beloved faith.You can find many similar accounts written by Christians who have left their faith. The difference is, in this country, atheists can be open about their apostasy. They don't have to fear for their lives or the lives of their loved ones. Which makes the contributors to this volume 100 times more courageous.Read this book."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This book was so absorbing I found it hard to put it down. First of all, I grew up in secular, mostly atheist Japan, so I am confident that I didn't have any preconceived ideas while most reviewes here seem to be practising Muslims who are being almost defensive.The process narrated by those growing up as Muslim and how their opinion evolved over time is eye-opening. Of particular interest was the critical viewpoints of children, often so honest, more revealing and to the point than those of adults. Rather than being theoritical, they illustrate life and experience as human beings through school life and family life. Women's life stories are proofs that women can think and make decisions for herself.This book encouraged me to question and analyze everything instead of taking things for granted.Even if you do not agree with the book, one thing is obvious; Every one should be able to voice their opinion without fear. Unfortunately, this is not the case in many parts of the world."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Given that there is so much nonsense written about Islam by a small army of professional apologists, both Muslim and non-Muslim, it is helpful to have this book. It does not deal with particular passages in the Qur'an, or this or that hadith (the sayings and acts of Muhammad), or add to the sira (the life of Muhammad). Instead it consists of reports, from former Muslims, of what it was that finally led them to leave Islam. For some, it was the systematic mistreatment of women, based on Islam. For others, it was the enrollment of Islamic doctrine, and Islamic slogans, to justify brutality and cruelty -- in several cases, Bangladeshi apostates cited the behavior of local Islamists in East Pakistan who worked with the army of West Pakistan to suppress the independence movement in 1971. For others, it has been the use of Islam as a vehicle for the most successful imperialist movement in history -- that of the Arabs, who conquered vast territories, peopled by non-Arab Christians, and Jews, and Zoroastrians, and Hindus, and Buddhists, and imposed on the conquered peoples an ideology (Islam) that often caused them to despise, or distance themselves from, or lose their own non-Islamic past. Islamization was often, though not always, accompanied by arabization, and those who did not convert, or were not killed, found themselves in the condition of being dhimmis (at first limited to Christians and Jews, and later extended to Zoroastrians and Hindus, for practical reasons -- there were just too many to kill outright), subject to its many legal, financial, social, and political disabilities -- a status of permanent humiliation, degradation, and insecurity.Books such as this(...) where the testimonies were first on view, may help make it possible for more people to leave Islam. It may not be farfetched to see, in a new Iran, quite a few people return to Zoroastrianism --not so much because Ahura Mazda is newly attractive, but as a statement of opposition to the \\"foreign\\" doctrine of Islam that, wherever it was imposed, had disastrous consquences for the indigenous peoples. It made sense for those threatened by the Nazis to learn about it, most intelligently, not from Nazi agents but from refugees from the Nazi regime. It made sense to learn about the Comintern, and Stalin, and the Communist ideology and disinformation,, not from Communists themselves but from ex-Communists -- i.e., not from KGB agents but defectors from the KGB. Similarly, given that deception and dissimulation (kitman, taqiyya) to protect the faith is religiously sanctioned in Islam, it is only common sense to learn about Islam, its practices and its attitudes, from those who, though born into it, fought their way out and are now truth-telling defectors from a faith that one is not allowed to leave. That period when people were willing to swallow sanitized versions of the Qur'a (e.g. Sells' \\"hymnic suras\\") is over; the daily news simply brings reality home to too many people. Still, on many campuses, students get not the truth but apologetics -- and from the Islamic equivalent of KGB agents. This book will give you the testimony, in Islamic terms, of defectors from the KGB. Just the book to give others, including your own children, to immunize them from all the nonsense that is abroad. Many will derive profit and pleasure from these testimonies, some of which are signed, fearlessly."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This is a fascinating book, consisting mainly of testimonials by ex-Muslims. Muslim readers will tend to reject it out of hand, but I think Western liberals ought to read it in order to realise that there is no such things as an \\"Islam Lite\\" basically compatible with their own ideology.One thing that worries me about many of the testimonials is that so many of the writers justify their apostacy by their discovery of a new ideology, Science. They accept various scientific hypotheses uncritically, just as they once revered the text of the Koran.Most worrying of all, one testimonial writer justifies her apostacy on the grounds of having discovered the new religion of Freudian psychology.

Ibn Warraq represents a growing number of Muslim people who are really fed up and tired with Islam.In many Islamic societies, he would be ostracized very terribly and SEVERELY. Thats why murtads like him have to flee westwards for safety and security, indeed, today's Muslims have a serious and dire need to yank their heads out from the sand in the ground and like the ostrich, begin to come to terms that there are many muslims - including devout 'alim' ones who find Islam terrible and outmoded with the times and wtih true Society, that they have no other choice but to abandon Islam and to move on with true life.Thats what Ibn Warraq has done, with his other Books as well, I also recommend Mark Gabriel's &quot;Islam and Terrorism&quot;, and Ergun Caner's 'More than a Prophet&quot; (available from Amazon)- Both these gentlemen are converts from Islam to Christianity.It is all the more interesting and revealing that, IN SPITE of ALL THE RESTRICTIONS, PUNISHMENTS, OSTRACISM, PERSECUTION AND HARDSHIPS that muslims face for leaving Islam, that THEY STILL DO IT!

Even disregarding obvious errors like his insistence that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty, the fallacies of his claims are glaring to those of us who have educated ourselves about the implications of communism. So, without further ado, I present you with this all-important piece of information: It's our responsibility to arraign him at the tribunal of public opinion. That's the first step in trying to appeal not to the contented and satisfied but embrace those tormented by suffering, those without peace, the unhappy and the discontented, and it's the only way to guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by Ibn and his claque. His vicious, heinous plaints are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. The intention is to prevent people from noticing that Ibn has been destroying our moral fiber. While there are many insolent sybarites, Ibn is the most sanctimonious of the lot. Is it not positively the distinguishing feature of his invectives to generate alienation and withdrawal? Ibn Warraq runs like a scared rabbit whenever his conclusions are challenged by someone with courage, conviction, and a love of Truth.

But perhaps we shouldn't neglect the battles that rage between idiots! (Take a look at these reviews--both the negative and positive.) To me reading this book is like hearing people in a death contest over which kind of music is better: how do you participate in this type of argument? Well, you don't, you just watch, enjoy a moment of amusement tinged with disbelief, and move on. Of course, people bash Christianity, Judaism, and all other religions, so they might as well bash Islam, too. But Islam will be around long after this book is forgotten, and long after the 'Clash of Civilizations' has shown itself to be only a misunderstood and misnamed phase of history. If you're hot to discover the insidious 'heart' of Islam, this book's for you. If you're a Muslim hot to discover the insidious 'heresy' of the West, this book's for you.

Somewhere in the book I read that women are treated badly in Islam and for a woman to convert to Islam is like an African American to join the KKK. The arabs were burying their daughters alive during the dark ages before God sent the Prophet(pbuh). He taught those ignorant barbaric people how to love and honor their daughters, sisters, mothers and wives. And through out ahadith, there are many many examples regarding exampleray treatment of women by the Prophet(pbuh) and his followers.And if you belive that there is no Creator, than why only critisize Islam ???? why not go after other religions ?Human mind has done wonders over the last 150 years. we still have a very tiny knowledge of the universe and have a long way to go. Yet we are ready to give our strong opinions that this whole universe just happened on it's own and there is no God. There has to be a superior divine force guiding everything.This book is very convenient for people who don't want to follow any religion and live their lives like animals and do whatever they want with out any fear of cosequences or guilt.Even in the animal kingdom, God has given more strength and capabilities to the male species. So if men are mentioned slightly more sperior to women in Islam, what is wrong with it ??There are many different bibles available, but there is only one Quran.I have never seen such mis-interpretation and fabrication of the actual facts of the Quran.Ibn Warraq might be living in a fool's paradise right now, but I am sure of his destiny(hell)!!!!!"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Very, very brave people to have come out against Islam like this.Before reading this, I had met apostates of Islam and heard their stories.

Not even ex-Muslims living in the West are safe.What really got to me, was the repeated betrayal these people felt. Betrayed by a religion they thought they knew. Betrayed by the people they loved - families and friends who turned their backs on them after leaving Islam.Another thing many of their stories convey is the utter depair of having the rug, the ground ripped out from under you. Just falling and falling. Being left with no direction, no faith, etc.I could just weep for these people.The scary thing is being told over and over, by these apostates that those who say Islam means \\"Peace\\", say that the fundamentists do not represent true Islam, are wrong, it is true Islam.A wake-up call to the West and highly recommended.

Should the world ignore the atrocities committed by Muslims in the name of Islam? And don't say there's no base on these atrocities such as killing apostates because there is. The Sharia law in most Islamic countries is based on the Quran and Hadiths.So how can someone argue that it's not a part of Islam to kill apostates when the arguments to defend such actions are taken out from the Quran and hadiths directly?Also just because someone has different views than some of you it doesn't mean they're wrong or hateful.

We need to truly do some soul searching and stop the denial."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I wrote a brief review on this book a year ago (see below) where I saluted the brave souls speaking out that had forsaken dogmatic religion.I am a secular humanist, and an ardent admirer of Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins. My culture is Hindu and I am very proud of it. However, let me say at the outset that it does no good to forsake fundamentalist Islam and become a fundamentalist Hindu.Since I wrote my review, many new reviews including ones by Muslims have appeared on this book. Understandably, Muslims are not going to rate this book highly. However, some of their diatribes about the apostates are merely that - frustrated rantings and ravings. As an example, see the review by Yaseen from Oakland. He says that one of the secularist reviewers who has applauded this book has 'peanut-sized brains'.Yaseen, you must have peanut sized brains if you believe that a 1400 year old text is the literal word of God. The Quran is at best a historical text that represents the creation myths of the Arabs. Likewise the Bible and the Bhagvad Gita represent the creation myths of the Jews/Christians and the Hindus.Over the past year I have been given several books by a colleague at work who is a devout and tolerant Muslim. These books seek to reconcile the Quran with the findings of modern science. Unfortunately, even a cursory reading of this Islamic propaganda is enough to show the hollowness of these wildly stretched claims. One of the key points these books make is that you have to read the text in the original Arabic to truly appreciate how well the Quran foretells modern scientific findings. Strange indeed must be a universal God that needs his readers to understand perfect Arabic (of all languages!) to get his message. There is no mention in these books that the Quran endorses the creation by God of Adam from dust and Eve from his rib. I would like to know how anyone with more than a peanut size brain can believe this ridiculous story in the light of the findings of evolutionary science.I have no difficulty understanding that all Muslims are proud of their cultural heritage and revere the Prophet(PBUH). He was in all probability a very wise man (undoubtedly, he was a superb military commander) whose teachings were relevant to the times that he lived in and to the harsh desert environment. I will also not quarrel with Muslims that the Prophet may have improved the lot of women in those times.However, taking the Quran as the literal word of God today and as the only source of knowledge has led to a decline in Islamic societies. Look everywhere around the world - to quote President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, Muslims are the most backward of all societies. Muslims are either killing fellow Muslims or are being exploited by non-Muslims. Witness how a small country like Israel with 5 million odd Jews is able to dictate terms to the entire Islamic world. The world's only superpower (led by a fundamentalist Christian President who claims that the God of the Old Testament gave him the green signal!) can invade and occupy an Islamic country with impunity in a war that has killed many thousands of Muslims including innocent women and children and face no more than a few pathetic whimpers from Islamic governments.Here in the US, Muslims are viewed with suspicion and fairly or unfairly, as Yaseen from Oakland states 'venom is being spewed on Islam'. In my native India, it appears that most of the outsourcing boom has conferred wealth and comfort on the scientifically educated Hindus while leaving the Madrasa educated Muslims way behind. I worry that this is rapidly leading India to an explosive two-tier society of haves and have-nots on religious lines.Meanwhile Islamic leaders and clergy are spreading the 'reassuring' message that Islam is the world's fastest growing religion. Whereas this growth may be true, how does that really matter? Most of the people who convert to Islam are likely to be underpriviledged minorities or poor or disaffected in some way. How will it help if a 100 years from now half the human population is Muslim, is poor and is exploited by the non-Muslim half ? Muslims, please note that whereas there are billions of humans on this planet, there are trillions of insects. Bottom line: mere numbers are not enough - all power flows from advanced technology. The US could destroy much of the Islamic world if it really wanted to.This whole sad state of affairs is not likely to change until Muslims accept modernization and stop believing that all truth flows from the Quran. Sadly the Muslims can believe what they want but the universe will not care - it will go inexorably on. Ultimate power for humankind will rest with those who open their minds and accept the scientific way to harness the forces of Mother nature.The true heroes of today should not be Jesus Christ, Prophet Muhammad or Krishna but great secular scientists and philosophers like Stephen Hawking and Betrand Russell."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I know Ibn Warraq and many of the people whose testimonies are featured in this book. Ibn Warraq is indeed a former Muslim, and the testimonies in this book are genuine.Islamic apostates are among the most persecuted people in the world. They do not even have the basic right that most of us in the US take for granted; the right to choose their own religion (or no religion.)In Muslim-majority countries these people live tenuous underground extistences. The brave ones, the ones who speak openly about leaving their religion, are often killed or physically intimidated. No Islamic nation has &quot;freedom of religion&quot; as we have in the West. The &quot;moderate&quot; Muslim nations put apostates in jail or &quot;faith re-education&quot; camps; the more strict ones execute these people.What is frightening is that these people are now not even safe in the &quot;free&quot; West as we take in more and more immigrants from Islamic nations. Recently a former Muslim turned politician was sentenced to death by Muslim clerics -- in Holland!Christian organizations such as Barnabas Fund, Open Doors and Freedom House all have extensive documentation of the extreme persecution that Muslims who convert to Christianity or other religons are subjected to in their countries of origin.Wake up and smell the coffee folks. The freedom of Islamic apostates should concern us all -- as it's our freedoms that are on the line as well."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Ibn Warraq you've really outdone yourself, huh? You really hate us muslims? I cant change that I guess, because Allah (God - just in case you've forgotten!) has given us all free will to choose how we think and what we do. Well I wouldn't like to be in your position because if you believe in Allah as I do, you'll know that you're in some serious trouble!Anyway what I want to bring everyones attention to is one important fact - you have to differentiate between muslims and Islam. What I mean by this is how muslims act isn't necessarily according to Islam. So if these apostates in this book suffered some sort of alienation or second class treatment at the hands of muslims, it doesn't mean that Islam tells them to do so.For example if a Jew, Christian, Buddhist etc commits a murder, its not necessarily mean that their faith advocates that killing. Allah knows that humans will sin though - its in our nature - muslims and non-muslims - and that we will stray, that is why he is so merciful and forgiving when we turn to him in repentance, which is I think what Ibn Warraq needs to do.A lot of what you might find in this book stems back to culture rather than religion. For example in Pakistani and Turkish cultures, a girl might be forced to marry against her will, in Islam that is not allowed. So where does this practice come from - it comes from other cultural influences.That reminds me - My sisters former RE teacher who was a lesbian and very open about her sexuality was introducing Islam as a religion they were about to study in their RE lessons. She said that if Islamic teachings and law was practiced properly and enforced around the world (even amongst non-muslims)then this world would be a perfect place! Yet she says this even though she knows that homosexuality is forbidden in Islam.I've read the reviews on this book and a lot of people are mentioning democracy,secularism, human rights etc I just wanna talk about that for a bit.Whilst I did vote in the last General Election, I believe that democracy as an argument is fundamentally flawed. Democracy is based on the majority rule. In theory in a democracy paedophilia can be allowed, if enough people want it - is that right? Human beings need some sort of rules to follow, thats why we have a legal system. What if we had no rules, no accountability, no punishment - chaos, right? So who should make these rules? Humans? Humans dispute & differ. Humans make mistakes. It wasnt that long ago that using black people as slaves and torturing them was seen as lawful and normal!Dont you see that if we're going to follow any rules that we should follow that of God? Isn't the creator of us(God) in the best position to know what is best for us? I definitely think so. What we follow though is up to us.To Ibn Warraq and to all those with similar opinions to him, if you need any experiences of muslims and how Islam treats me - come to me, I will gladly give up my time to tell you of my experience, are you interested to hear another side of the story. I look forward to us arranging a time!Anyway I have two books to recommend instead or at least alongside it to anyone interested in this book1) To Everyone: The autobiography of Malcolm X (as told by Alex Haley) - Read his experience - this book I've read soooo many times- doesnt fail to move me very time2) For the girls or guys who are interested:'From my sister's lips' by Na'ima B Robert - for experiences of muslim womenAnyway this is just my humble opinion - as Malcolm X said in his autobiography - anything good I have said comes from Allah, only the mistakes have been mine."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"From a neutral analysis of the book, one feels that the author, for some reason, is extremely biased against Islam. So much so, that he has completely lost the spirit of the basic rules for being a rational critic. I also had a lot of problems with the authenticity of his sources, his academic qualification and his claim to be an apostate.West Virginia University,Montgomery, WV."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This book is a generalized attack on Islam. It misquotes and misrepresents Islam and Islamic history. The author is entitled to his personal decision, whether to follow or not to follow the Islam he was born into. But the phoebia shown in this and other books by this author show his bias and hatred.This book does a great disservice to the world as well as to the over 1 billion muslims of the world. It goes a long way towards converting the war on terrorism to a war on Islam and Muslims.However, it is not surprising in this day of terrorism and global unrest. Large segments of the Christian right, led by Jerry Farwell among others, together with the Zionist movement of Israel, America and Europe are actively seeking a global war to eliminate Islam and Muslims from the world stage.The continuing struggle in Palestine between the remaining native Palestinians and the ultra-right Zionists is encouraged by the Christian right, who hope to hasten the 2nd coming of Jesus by facilitating the return of the Jewish diaspora to Jerusalem. Jerry Farwell has correctly called his effort &quot;a war against Islam&quot;.Unfortunately America's military has been harnessed to this diabolical scheme, thereby expanding the enemy's ranks from a few thousand terrorists, to more than a billion Muslims worldwide, who would otherwise be our allies, as terrorism affects theirlives and countries even more that it does America. Expensive, not to mention stupid.Books like this one serve the anti-Muslim agenda. Rather than this bullpucky, I would recommend Karen Armstrong's books &quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;Mohammed&quot;, (Ms Armstrong is a former Catholic nun, and hardly a biased supporter of Islam) or better still buy a translation of the Qur'an, say by Yusuf Ali.Despite the declarations of anti-Muslim scholars that the Qur'an is unreadable and incoherent, I was able to read it and found it rational, easy to understand and profound.The 2nd Sura of the Qur'an (2,2 - 2,7) itself points out that only those who approach the qur'an with sincerity will find truth and guidance in the Qur'an, namely those who believe in the unseen, in the hereafter, who accept the revelations sent to the earlier prophets, who are prayerful, and do good works, and generous to the less fortunate, they will find benefit and true guidance in the Qur'an.But &quot;as for those who reject God and the hereafter, God has set a seal upon their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil: they will suffer great torment&quot;. Qur'an 2, 7).Those with a hostile attitude to God will find no benefit and will be confused or angered by any authentic call to spirituality, whether in the Qur'an or in &quot;what was revealed before.&quot;"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I really don't see a point to writing this specific book when these stories are available online left and right anyway. As far as the \\"living in fear\\" campfire stories go, I would say this is true only in Iran and maybe a few other select places. People got better things to do than to hunt down whoever doesn't follow a religion anymore. Give me a break. One example I have is Nonie Darwesh. I kind of felt sorry for her until I learn she is from Egypt. FROM EGYPT!!! Someone go google up names of Egyptian performers like Ruby and see the kind of smutt their movie industry churns out year-after-year, and then come back and tell me that Muslims are living in perpetual fear. I got news for you, people who grow up in perpetual fear end up with psychological issues in many cases. They don't simply run to the west and write books.This book is really for bottom-of-the-barrel. Your throwing money at Ibn Warraq for stuff that you can get for free online (only to realize later that the stories of people leaving Islam are just as dry as stories of people who leave Christianity or Judaism). I say you guys send me a few bucks and I will come over and juggle fruit on a unicycle with a ballerina skirt and a wife-beater. At least you will be entertained if nothing else."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"When in America discrimination towards black/coloured people is displayed no one mentiones it and/or mark Americans as Cold-hearted self centered Chauvinists.When a mad man (who happens to be a devoted Christian, aloving father and husband), rapes girls, and beats women to death, no one ever stands up and points accusingly towards Christianity as a religion being a prime \\"suspect\\".. instead they will try to justify his actions...So why when a muslim is killed or mistreated by another muslim then Islam as a religiion is blamed ?You have to differentiate between Islam, and Muslims as people..we all make mistakes, we all sin, we all have our doubts and regrets..so why shun all muslims when only one has mistake?When you get mistreated by an American, does that mean that all Americans are rude..or bad..etc...??I hope all you anti-muslims who are waiting for a chance to get back at us, have finally got the picture..and i leave you with one advice, and that is to actually read the Quran or at least discuss Islam with Optimistic individuals, who have accomplished something in life, not those who are bystanders who happen to be muslims because they were born muslims."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I wonder what the author's intentions were in writing this book. The question I asked myself was whether this man was really a muslim at one time, or is this an attempt to further destroy the already tottering frame on which Islam stands on.I would like the reader to note that I have checked up on a few verses that he has quoted in the book and I find that some of them are fabricated. An example is:Quran.3:5\\"But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have gone astray\\".Please note that this verse does not exist. Odd! since he claims that his quotes are true. I wonder how many people actually checked up on any of this information.Of the verses quoted that were true he fails to mention the 'context' in which it was said. Upon investigation it becomes apparent that the meaning of the verse changes into something quite different from what it was perceived to be on its own.He also mentions a lot of Hadees (stories of the prophet's life) in this book. His intense research seems to have forgotten the fact that many of the hadees have been fabricated by malicious people over time, this being particularly relevant to several early shia leaders who appeared, and therefore are not all true. This fact is recognized by the majority of muslims and thus the reader should note that the hadees should be treated with care since authenticity is not assured.In conclusion I would like to say that I feel this book was a product of intense hatred and crooked vision. I would not recommend this book to anyone with a clear intention to learn what Islam is about. In fact, I believe that the only source of information that would give a clear and unambiguous description of the religion is the Quran itself. It is a pity that fewer and fewer muslims read the book that is considered a miracle, and a sign to those who believe in god.This book gets 0 out of 5. It would have scored higher if the author had stated 'a novel' on the cover page."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This book is actually the so-called testominies of different people who for one reason or another left Islam. There stories were actually submitted to the website www.secularislam.org and then organized in a book form and sold at a very good price. This book provides nothing but a bunch of stories from all over the world mostly from Pakistan. I finished the reading of this book in 2 days because i found the book very amusing. I could not resist my laughter at some of the reasons given by apostates to leave their faith. Religion is a very wide topic and being a follower of a certain faith is a matter of great importance. I heard many people saying that they are not practicing muslims, christians or jews. Means: They are just the follower because they were either born with that religion or they have no time to look into this important matter. So they just want to live with the title they have(Muslim, Christian, Jew etc.) and thats it. You will find lots of verses quoted from Quran and their interpretation by these apostates as a reason to abandon their faith. I am a Muslim by faith and i would still recommend you to read this book because any sensible person will easily understand that these apsostasy stories or based upon personal likes and dislikes rather than the facts. Some of these apostates were not happy with their teachers because they did not treat them right and some of them were unhappy with their husbands because they changed with the passage of time. Remember readers there is big difference between Christiany and Christian, Islam and Muslims and Judaism and Jews. No human in this world is perfect therefore it is not possible for everybody to completely follow his religion. World is totally different today than it used to be. We must not relate the behaviour of an individual to his religion. Hitler was a christian, responsible of killing millions of jews but we must not get this impression that since he was christian so Christian faith is responsible for his deeds. Same is the case with Islam. The deeds of muslims does not reflect Islam. We people with todays conditions in the world have no other option except to choose some easy options for us. Religion needs committment. We dont have time. Religion needs sacrifice. We cant handle it. Adultry is considered a great sin in christian faith but look around you. You will find it widely practiced openly in the name of secular democracy. We have lost our family values only because we dont have time to think about our faith. When we get addict of such acts we simply deny what is being conveyed to us through our faith. So we simply choose to call ourselves apostates and make our own ways. please read the book because it will give you great amusement but dont forget to research on any claim made in this book. Dont become the puppet. You have the right to know what is good and evil. Because if you dont research these claims they will affect your life in one way or another. Dont let these people play with your lives while they enjoy all the benefits of unlimited earnings through such books. God Bless the whole world. Amen"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"What a perfect time to start anti-islam books! Right after 9/11!This isn't hard to understand at all. So, Ibn Warraq went and searched for a couple of people who thought it benefited them if they left thier religion. What are we supposed to say? Wow?Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and in north america? Why? Why is it that so many people are finding Islam appealing? Who really fought for women and minority rights? Who fought for human rights? Was it not Muhammad(pbuh)? Why does Ibn Warraq fail to mention this?In the Quran, it states that one should fight for justice even if one will have to disobey his family. Without justice, you cant have peace. Justice is of uppermost importance in Islam. Jihad is fighting for justice, not oil, not honor and most certainly not &quot;holy war&quot;. As simple as it might sound, any society that lacks justice isn't Islamic regardless of who follows what. Let me leave it to this verse in the Holy Quran where it states;{O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice as witnesses to God even as against yourselves or your parents or your kin and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts) lest ye swerve and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.} (4:135)Beautifully put."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"As you can see from the previous posts, the verses cited in the book don't even exist where he cites them, such as the one on 3:5 (Quran).If one is truly to destroy a religion, he must do it on factual information and on science; not Bible-text (which is unproven), not opinions of former-Muslims, not even the actions of Muslims themselves. Muslims claim to follow Islam, but Islam is a religion (set of ideas, laws, etc.) that came 1,400 years ago. If Muslims do not follow &quot;Islam&quot;, then those actions in which they DON'T FOLLOW Islam cannot be termed &quot;Islamic&quot;. Hence, they have un-Islamic actions if they are not prescribed by &quot;Islam&quot;, the religion determined 1400 years ago.The Quran contains scientific facts (Big Bang theory, creation of life from water, creation of things in pairs, revolvement of sun around its own axis, sun and moon having different orbits, long-term benefit of wine, plate-tectonic theory) man could not have known 1,400 years ago. If the Quran had ever been changed, multiple versions of it would have come out conflicting in verses with each other (like some Bibles do).Some questions remain about this book:-Is the author scientific or biased?-When attacking Islam or attacking Muslims, does he refer to the laws of Islam or the actions of Muslims? (Salman Rushdie isn't in the Quran...)In my opinion the author is neither just, scientific, nor factual."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"First of all, who is Ibn Warraq?....He as an arabic name but does he really is an ex-muslim???? and by the way he really need to read the coran and tradition of the prophet and to ask him self does Rushdi is a muslim??? he's not!So what are u talking about! U hate muslims well u can hate them, and by the way one of amazone wrote that a LOT of people muslims apostates for islam...well sorry i dont have any proof of this, cause most of the very very very very minority that apostates are people muslims just by their PARENTS! and islam is the world fast growing up religion !!!!! So tell me why? cause smart people read the Koran and ask questions and they dont mix up Islam and Muslims...cause islam is the perfect theory but humans are weak so their culture is weak too but not ISLAM!"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This is a fascinating book about courageous Muslims from all parts of the world that have had the guts to forsake dogmatic religion. I hope that this will book will show Westerners that not all Muslims are fundamentalists and that not all of them believe in the literal truth of the Koran, including the injunction to wage jihad against the 'infidels'.It is very sad that Ibn Warraq should have fatwas declared against him. The Muslim clerics who issue these fatwas and preach hatred do great injustice to the magnificent Islamic culture, which has enriched humanity in many ways.Reading each clandestine account of these people leaving Islam, reminded me that I should thank my fate that I was born a Hindu and can tell the world that I have now converted to secular humanism without worrying about fatwas from Hindu fundamentalists!I hope that one day Islam too will have its reformation and become a tolerant religion like Hinduism and Buddhism. When that day comes, this book will become an anachronism! In the meantime, read this book and salute these brave souls."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This is a sad, disturbing but excellent book that I commend to everyone. It is sad because of the loss of faith it chronicles. Disturbing because most of those who left Islam also left faith in God in any form. Most of them, like the editor Ibn Warraq (who I have a great deal of respect for), ended as agnostics or atheists and secular humanists disillusioned by their bitter experience with Islam and ruined for faith in a better, truer God.The intriguing thing that almost all these apostates of Islam had in common was that their loss of faith was preceded by a period of sincere investigation of their faith. They wanted to understand Islam better or become more faithful or refute attacks on Islam and so studied the Koran, went to the mosque, said the prayers etc. One young girl was upset by the allegations that Islam was a violent religion. She set out to prove to herself through study of the Koran (Qur'an) that it was a religion of peace and was misrepresented by those who tried through force to impose it on others. To her dismay she found that the Koran did indeed sanction violence against the \\"unbelievers.\\" She felt that if there was a God he certainly was not like the god the Koran portrayed him as and she gave up on Islam. Another apostate could not believe that Islam would tolerate such oppression of women. When she studied the Koran she found that it did permit husbands to strike their wives, women didn't have equal standing with men in courts of law and many other inequalities. She could not accept such an unjust creed. Another young Muslim raised in a devout Muslim family by a father who faithfully followed the tenants of Islam heard him say on his death bed that Islam is useless and could help no one. This was just one blow on his gradual departure from Islam. Another was disturbed by Mohammed's life. Why did he marry so many women? How could he consummate a marriage with a nine year old girl? How could the leader of such a faith be so flawed?Almost every story in Warraq's book has a similar ending. They came to know the true tenants of Islam through their study of its holy book and rejected it as unworthy of their devotion. My only regret for them is that they did not go on to seek a better faith rather than give up on all faith."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This is one of the most courageous books to come out in a while.Ibn Warraq deserves our praise for honesty.This book is required reading."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"First of all, after reading this book, it does occur to me that the stories contained therein could have been about any number of other religious situations; and the editor/author does not claim that all of these experiences are unique to Islam - although some are, such as a slaughter by Muslims against Muslims in Bangladesh.But imagine being a young girl living in a polygamous Fundamentalist Mormon sect - the idea of having to marry a 60 year old man when you're 14 is as horrifying a thought whether the 60 year old is a Mormon or a Muslim. Or dying because your sect does not believe in the use of modern medicine; or being subject to some pagan ritual incorporated into the religion that involves mutilating sexual organs! Islam is not alone in some of these horrors. These stories can be replicated the world over in religion after religion.Here is the primary difference: in much of the Post-Enlightnment World, we can discuss these things usually without fear for our lives. There are numerous books about escaping all kinds of fundamentalist religions - but there are precious few about leaving Islam and indeed many of those who tell their stories must change their names out fear for their lives. Humanistic values in the Post Enlightenment World serve to moderate the worst excesses of Christianity, thank goodness. Humanism serves to shame Christianity into a better mode of behavior - sometimes.In this book I am struck how often persons who \\"learn the Koran\\" are doing nothing more than learning how to read the Koran phonetically - an don't have a clue as to the meaning because the Koran is in Arabic and the person is Pakistani or Indian or some other non-Arabic speaker. Their understanding of what Islam is comes from their Imam who tells them what to think. This is the source of their sincere claim so often heard that Islam is a \\"religion of peace.\\" That's what they've been told. This learning of the Koran takes place when children are under 6 years old, at a time when they could be learning so many other things that have a practical use - it's not as if they're actually learning any moral or ethical ideals - they're just learning sounds.Now this situation is extreme but it does not differ from other religions in that most believers really don't understand their own religion either; and that does not stop them from being passionate and chauvinistic in their ignorance.This book is essential reading for all persons, but especially believers who are not afraid of true stories from former believers. Read the stories, read the cited material from the Koran and Hadith, and figure out what is true by using your own sense of integrity. If you disagree with the persons in this book, they will not threaten you."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Ibn Warraq seems to write only on the one subject - Islam. However he writes with having lived through it.Most of the negative reviews simply say 'he is wrong', and this is to be expected as all these reviews come from Moslems.It is a fact of life however that many Islamic nations have legal restraints on people who apostate (that is, those who leave Islam - oddly enough they don't have any laws against people leaving other religions and joining Islam :-) I wonder why?)"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I haven't read this book yet, but I am currently most of the way through \\"Why I am not a Muslim\\".The reviewers below who accuse Ibn Warraq of not knowing his stuff, and not being scholarly enough, ought to have a read of \\"Why I am not a Muslim\\". It is quite dense reading, as it reviews and combines masses of scholarship, from some of the most respected sources (by which I mean, people working in the tradition of scientific inquiry, not defence of dogma). Please read \\"Why I am not a Muslim\\" (and perhaps some of the sources referred to frequently throughout it) before you accuse Ibn Warriq of being someone who is blindly out to destroy Islam out of malicious hate. The scholarship looks extremely solid to me - but perhaps it is a little academic for the general reader, or a bit too daunting in its size for some people to be able to absorb it.I would be very curious to know how many of the people who rated this book as 1 star, actually READ the book from cover to cover. I rather suspect that many of them have never really read anything critiquing Islam before (note: not CRITICISING, CRITIQUING - they are different), and so their reaction is pure knee-jerk rejection. A religion (which after all is supposed to provide you with some perspective in your most desperate times) should be able to stand against some logical inquiry, both from inside and outside the faith."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"These are personal stories of sincere people inside the Muslim Faith and their painful disillusionment.

But I highly recommend it. There was quite a bit of history and explanation at the beginning of the book. It surprised me, but since I have read other books by this author, it should not have. He is a scholar in the old-line sense of the word. If you wish, you can check his sources for yourself but it would probably be a waste of time I doubt you would find anything different than what he is sayingNow I am at the modern part of the book. Present day people are talking about what they went thru to leave Islam, mostly from Islamic countries. It is hard for those of us in the West to really understand down in our souls that people can be killed just for wanting to leave their country and their religion. It makes no sense. Its as bad as the Berlin wall was. But the Berlin Wall was at least understandable as a reaction to the trauma of a recent war that had cost Russia Millions of their citizens. What's Islam's excuse---oh, Holy Books they have not changed their interpretation of in over a Millenia.

While I understand such a response (as honestly Mr. Warraq and Prometheus are avowed enemies of Islam) I hope to offer a more balanced view. I read the book, and in all honesty felt that some of these testimonies were fraudulent. This was not surprising, as the same is the case with apostate testimonies online such as that at Secular Islam, the Apostates of Islam site or the Answering Islam site. All those compilations seem to be a mix of fraudulent and authentic testimonies. The book however is worth reading even for Muslims. This is precisely because some of the testimonies are undoubtedly authentic and it gives Muslims an opportunity to attempt to understand the mindset and motivation of those who have left our faith. I think attempting to understand such people is better than merely sticking our head in the sand and denying that apostates exist. With regard to the testimonies I was pleasantly surprised by that of Ali Sina in particular. I am familiar with his Faith Freedom site and find many of his criticisms childish and unduly hostile. Thus from my experience of reading Ali Sina's writings online I had a low opinion of him. His testimony, however, was very sincere and down to earth, and hence while I still strongly disagree with him I have gained a bit more respect for him. But Mr. Sina's testimony is also relevant because it represented a common theme in that many of these people rejected Islam solely based on the behavior of many Muslims. From Iran to Pakistan Mr. Sina speaks of meeting incredibly hateful and intolerant Muslims. How should Muslims react to this? Those of us who are honest know that such people do exist and in some parts of the world they exist in large numbers. Rather than being angry at Mr. Sina's testimony we should pray for him as well as take it as one of many invitations to clean our own house. While the task is long and difficult we should all begin to work at marginalizing or eliminating hatreds cloaked within Islam, as it is obvious that such behavior has caused at least a few Muslims to leave the faith. The testimony does not give me any reason to doubt the religion of Islam but I do believe it should be taken as an invitation to the Ummah to look in the mirror. While I believe Islam is perfect I think we need to be more vocal in admitting what we all know is true: that the Ummah is very, very imperfect and flawed. With regard to the other testimonies, one from a gentleman describing his horrible experiences during the creation of Bangladesh was heart-wrenching. The testimonies of the Western converts who then became apostates were also very interesting. The one by Dennis Giron was witty, though it was deliberately abusive and somewhat childish. However his being an apostate from a rather heretical branch of \\"Islam\\" should not be a surprise to Muslims. His admission that one could argue that he probably wasn't really ever a Muslim begs the question of why then his testimony appeared in the book. The most impressive by far was the one by Ibn Hoja, who demonstrated a decent command of Islam and came off as one of the most sincere testimonies in the book. There was no dogma in his testimony. It was the story of a Catholic boy from America who discovered Islam, converted and lived faithfully as a Muslim for an extended period of time. As a personal issue for him, he came to disbelieve in Islam due to certain philosophical positions which he held regarding miracles and the reward system in the afterlife. And then in a rare bit of honesty Mr. Hoja admits that while Islam did not solve the problems of his life, neither did his apostasy. His testimony was the most eloquently written and he is no doubt a brilliant young man. It was an authentic testimony of an authentic former Muslim and I appreciated that. In summation nothing in this book offers any substantive argument against Islam. I found it to be an intriguing read but never at any point did it make me doubt my faith. However it is still valuable at least as an anthropological study for both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. The phenomenon of apostasy from Islam though rare is something for real, and this book provides a small window into that world."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"this book is an important fact about faith freedom laws worldwide.Ibn Warraq shows -one more time- the lies made about faith freedom in islamic laws that are blindly praised in many modern communities."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I am from a British Pakistani upbringing and I currently live in the United States. These stories of brave, beautiful and noble apostates are very much the story of my mother, my sister and me. We were living in London's East End when my father began a very disturbing turn to Islamic fundamentalism. His humour and lovable nature disappeared. He became a completely different person, devoted to Wahhabism. He hated the West in every way shape or form. When we were in France, he said he wanted to beat a girl who was sunbathing topless on a nearby beach. He began striking my mother regularly. One day he was going off on one of his anti-Western diatribes when he had to answer his cell phone. When he hung up, I said that if he hates the West so much, he should stop using a cell phone as it was developed with Western technology and science. Then he hit me.My family left him quickly and quietly one afternoon, and we have never returned since.I will be blunt. Islam does not value life. It does not value love. It does not value progression or enlightenment. The only thing Islam values is the worship of a god. And not just any god, but a brutal war god who commands his children to kill one another. You often hear lukewarm and moderate Muslims saying that fundamentalists, Wahhabists and Islamists do not represent true Islam. They are lying. It is they who are not following true Islam.As afraid of Islam as the West is, the truth is Islam is much more afraid of the West and the changing 21st century world. It is out of fear that the radical cleric orders a fatwa against apostates and critics of the faith. It was out of fear that millions of imbeciles protested and spewed hatred at the Danish people, a non-Muslim people who were simply exercising their right to free speech in their own country. It was fear that made a pathetic young thug butcher Theo Van Gogh for exercising his free speech rights in his own non-Muslim country. Any critique or truth seeking sojourn into what makes Islam tick is ferociously set upon by the Muslim world's mobs, because they are deathly afraid and insecure about the religion that they value more than the lives of their children.I urge everyone to read this book"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Muslims are so determined to call their religion the fastest growing in the world that they refuse to acknowledge the fact that many of us who covert to it rapidly leave it. I am one of these. I converted because my Muslim husband insisted that he was committing a great sin to be married to me when I wasn't a Muslim. He'd been trying his best to teach it to me while at the same time pointedly separating me from non-Muslim friends and family. Then he gave me the whole spiel about Islam being so scientific, so fair and kind to women,that hijab was a choice, not an obligation, and Islam was SOOOO peaceful. I loved, respected, and trusted him so much, I actually believed him and converted to Islam.Afterwards, we went to visit the Islamic country of his origin (Iran) and I got to see real Islam in action. I was dismayed, even horrified, to say the least. As a woman, I had neither civil rights nor respect. Quite suddenly, I become a trophy bride and captive sans all the basic freedoms that I, as an American, had always taken for granted. When I went to the Koran and other Islamic scriptures to find support for my missing rights, I found, quite to the contrary, that my trusted husband had LIED to me about the whole thing.Islam is NOT scientific, NOT fair or kind to women,DOES require hijab under threat of violence to those who would refuse it, and - as current Islamist terrorist activities have proven - it is NOT one bit peaceful.Yes, we apostates DO exist. In Islamic countries, those who are discovered are killed by Muslims for their honesting in disavowing Islam. Elsewhere, Muslims just try to shut us up and say we don't exist. Well, they're wrong. Those of us who are consciencious, intelligent, and confident, honest, and have found out the truth, can not help but leave Islam.Ibn Warraq is telling a plain truth that is simply unpalatable to Muslims. Well too bad: the truth is simply the truth and it's about time more people knew it."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"No question, Ibn Warraq's Leaving Islam includes many important essays by former Muslims, by birth or conversion, who subsequently renounced their faith.Ibn Warraq deserves ample credit for this excellent work, which others have called \\"a companion of sorts to his own personal statement, Why I am Not a Muslim.\\"Despite the Qu'ranic declaration (2:256), \\"There is no compulsion in religion,\\" traditional Islam both historically and currently consider apostasy (the abandonment of the \\"one true faith\\") a capital offense. You desert, you die.That item of religious belief, along with many others, are often used by Muslim governments \\"to silence free thinkers and spread a blanket of totalitarian control over [their] communities,\\" as one reviewer has written.Ibn Warraq's collection provides several notable early examples of apostates, including Ar-Rawandi (c. 820-830) and Ar-Razi (865-925), the poets Omar Khayyam (c. 1048-1131) and Hafiz (c. 1320-89), and Sufis like Mansur ibn Hallaj (d. 922) and As-Suhrawardi (d. 1191), but the issue \\"has not seriously been documented or investigated.\\" Undoubtedly that results primarily from the risks to a former Muslim of openly discussing his or her abandonment of Islam.The former Muslims included in Ibn Warraq's compelling book hail from many locales, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Iran, Tunisia, Turkey, Malaysia and Morocco.Ibn Warraq has great courage and passion in defending reason. His struggle is that of \\"a culture ... at odds with reason.\\" This book is indispensable for Muslims who hope that Islam will adopt enlightenment and reform.True enough, Islam needs reform from within. And former Muslims can and should influence this discussion. They could have great influence, if only the majority of practicing Muslims would listen to them and demand reform, accordingly.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"The Warraq name has been used by Muslim dissidents for many centuries, including Harun al-Warraq, who died early in the tenth century. Now \\"Ibn Warraq\\" and others give us an interesting view of the objections to Islam by those who have basically abandoned it.Ibn Warraq starts by making the point that it can be dangerous to leave Islam. Doing so makes one an apostate. Apostasy generally carries a death penalty, especially for men. And even for those who survive, it often results in the forfeiture of one's possessions and legal rights.Nevertheless, some people do leave Islam. My own ancestors did so over a hundred years ago. And as this book mentions, some leave it in favor of polytheism, especially in Indonesia. Or for Christianity. But the main thrust of the book is to describe something about those former Muslims who have simply abandoned religion in general and why.The main reasons for abandoning Islam have turned out to be its irrationality, its immorality (especially the treatment of Women), and the personal life of the Prophet.Others have reacted negatively to the fanaticism and aggression of many Muslims, as well as to the increasing lack of economic competetiveness of Muslim portion of the world.There were a few unusual points made in the book. One was simply that apostasy is not really applicable to Buddhism, let alone most polytheistic religions. Another was that if we humans were in need of divine guidance 15 or 20 centuries ago, surely we are in at least as much need of it now: why are there supposedly no more prophets to supply that guidance?Another point is that Western media are prone to publishing pro-Islamic material. This is explained simply: Islam is in the news, so the media have to say something about it. And the media are reluctant to say anything negative for fear of being called Islamophobic.One of the writers in the book points out that some of the articles about Islam generated by those who have abandoned it are virtually a mirror image of traditional apologetics for Islam. Is it proper to write so vehemently? The conclusion is that while vehemence often obscures otherwise sound arguments, vehement essays often make valuable points too.The book concludes with some useful references to the Koran and on the life of the Prophet, followed by a list of websites critical of Islam and some books critical of Islam.This book is interesting and worth reading. I think it fills an important niche between politically correct whitewashing of Islam and denunciations of Islam from those who never were a part of it."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Ibn Warraq, who has several Fatwas issued against him by Islamist clerics has bravely sallied forth to explicate the tenuous status of former Muslims who for a variety of reasons have abandoned the faith. These apostates are under the threat of death given the clerical rulings in Islam. Some of the testifiers have been brave enough to use their real names!Most prominent among these testimonials is the clear evidence of the lack of basic human rights as allegedly guaranteed under the UN Declaration of Human Rights circa 1948. Muslim countries have signed the UN declaration but consider the act as religiously correct dissimultude-taqqiya in Arabic.Among the more stunning revelations among the testimonials is the genocide wreaked on the Bengalis by the Islamic Paki overlords in the early 70's of the last century. An estimated 3.5 million Bengalis were slaughtered in this religious Jihad. Some of you may be old enough to remember the plaintive Beatles tune: Bengladesh. This genocide cries out the certification before the World Court and prosecution of some of the organizers of this heinous event.Testimonials of former Muslim women, brave enough to reveal their actual identity, clearly indicate the second class status in violation of the UN declaration of human rights.Former converts to Islam who are included in these testimonials have given witness to the lack of basic human rights and the atavistic male domination prevalent in Muslim cricles and countries.Overall, Ibn Warraq-his nom de guerre, has given us a powerful insight into the fundamental failings of the islamic faith to build reform from within and protect basic human rights. It is no wonder several Fatwas demanding his death have been issued. He's very religiously incorrect, but courageous.His works deserve a wide readership in a western world ignorant of the fundamentals of the islamic faith."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Let me begin by saying that like the many authors whose testimonies comprise this anthology, I am a former Muslim, an apostate, and a liberal secular humanist. The Western-born son of a moderate Sunni Muslim family comprising of Turkish and Persian ancestry, I related completely to the sentiments expressed in the various declarations of kafiri (unbelief). It is quite rare that one comes across the idea of ex-Muslims, since apostasy is for most Muslims outside the realm of possibility, both because it goes against everything one has been taught and because it carries the penalty of death. I was once a slave to this type of thought process, though I was never a fundamentalist and never espoused any of the hate-rhetoric that one normally associates with extremist Muslims. I left Islam after reading its holy revelation, the Qur'an, which revealed itself to be nothing more than reworked Bible stories (which are themselves rehashes of pagan myths) peppered with ever-present threats of Allah's fury. I first started to question Islam when I fell in love with a man (who was a Jew, no less!) and went in search of an outlet which would allow me to live with human dignity in full light of my homosexuality. Like so many religious people who know better, I tried to reconcile with my ancestral faith's apparent irrationality, but Logic and Compassion won out.'Leaving Islam' is probably the most reader-friendly of all of Ibn Warraq's anti-Islamic endeavors. It offers not only a historical account of the heretical teachings and persecution of Islam's most famous apostates, but also a comprehensive and global view of why an increasing number of Muslims are leaving the faith, either in favor of other religions (namely Christianity) or, more probably, atheism. The stories come from all corners of the world: Iran, Turkey, Bangladesh, Morocco, Tunisia, Malaysia, India, and even America. A disproportionately large percentage of the accounts come from (of all places) Pakistan. One wonders why this is--are Pakistanis more prone to doubt than other Muslims? Regardless of the disparate national origins of the authors, there is a concurrent thread through all the stories that binds them together: traditionalist (even fundamentalist) faith transmuting into deep disillusionment upon closer scrutiny of Islamic texts and doctrines. You might wonder why if that's all that it takes to get Muslims to abandon Islam why more haven't done so. The reasons are many and complex, and each author explains why apostasy was the only choice.Though I don't expect many to be inclined to read it, I would recommend this book to any practicing Muslim. Many of the traditional Islamic arguments about its validity are deconstructed in this deeply personal and profoundly logical compilation. Though I was disappointed not to find a personal account of Ibn Warraq's own apostasy, the others were fascinating, revealing, and, frequently, heartbreaking. All the accounts are worth reading, but the one's which stood out most for me were those of Ali Sina, Abul Kasem, Parvin Darabi, Azam Kamguian, Taner Edis, Nadia, Denis Giron, Faiza, and Ben Hoja. Sina's account is particularly striking in that it outlines the various stages one goes through when one chooses apostasy (Faith, Denial, Confusion, Guilt, Anger, Sadness and, finally, Enlightenment: I think I am embedded in the Sadness stage, mourning constantly for all the lost lives and wasted potential). Five of the testimonies in the book are those of converts who adopted Islam only to leave it. Giron's story is exceptionally witty and humorous. Hoja's chapter, entitled 'Dark Comedy', had me chuckling and laughing out loud (the footnotes are uproariously funny) only to completely sock me in the gut and leave me in tears at the end. His story alone is worth the cover price.Like all of Warraq's books, this one too shall incite fury and outrage because it shows the growing skepticism and self-loathing among Muslims who happen not to be Ibn Warraq, Salman Rushdie, or Irshad Manji. In his introduction Warraq refers to the various accounts as 'Cassandra Cries', which might give the impression that these apostates view themselves as helpless victims; they are anything but. Every contributor makes powerful, searing indictments of Islam, Muhammad, the Qur'an and God, which cannot be ignored or dismissed. It is no small thing to assert that Muhammad was a rapist, a warmonger, a mass-murderer and a pedophile. List these charges and images of Hitler, Idi Amin and Genghis Khan immediately come to mind, not the noble and humble Arabian sage who populates the hearts of billions. How can it be that the founder of one of the 'great' religions has enacted such brutality? But any balanced and honest reading of Islamic tradition can only lead to this conclusion. Either we accept that History lies about Muhammad or that we lie to ourselves about him. Will we, as humans, seek the Selective Salvation religion offers, or will we seek Truth? As Sina proclaims at the end of his story, 'Truth is a pathless land.'One of the things I am constantly baffled by is the standard Muslim response to critiques and attacks of their faith: instead of utilizing rationalist techniques of debate, argument and logical defense, they respond with violence and death threats to silence the dissenters. These are the actions of people who either have no prepared way to defend their dogmas or know that the only way to uphold these doctrinal 'truths' is to make sure that no one is allowed to question them. Fascism, anyone? But it would be wrong to lay the blame on Muslims themselves; rather it is that 'pie-in-the-sky' deity who is culpable. Those who have read the Qur'an will concede that Allah makes all his proclamations about 'the one true faith' the same way: not by appealing to Reason or Logic, but with force and threat. 'Believe this, behave accordingly, or burn eternally in Hellfire.' This is basically the theme of the Qur'an. It is of extreme irony that all such threats are always preceded by the standard 'In the name of God, the Universally Merciful, the Singularly Compassionate.' Indeed. How, therefore, can we expect Muslims to project and live in any other way than through violence and irrationality when God himself dictates life's truths to them in the same way? If anything, they are merely mimicking God's way, which is what anyone would want to do. Muslims are the first victims of Allah.I must also say that this relatively unknown and small field of Islamic Criticism owes great gallows of gratitude to freethinkers like Ibn Warraq, Salman Rushdie, Ali Sina, and Irshad Manji. It is our duty as freethinkers, reformers, and, yes, even as ex-Muslims, to assume a prominent role in the way Islam adopts to the shrinking modern world. We are, after all, unique in that we know firsthand the extremes to which Islam can be carried and carry its adherents. Yet we apostates have resisted, and in this 'reclaiming of the self' we have shown that Reason has the ability to retain as strongly as Revelation.Islam is a Bedouin Fable, a tribal Arabian Mythology created to validate the Arab Imperialism of the 8th and 9th century. At some point, however, we all outgrow these moralistic, 'do-this-or-else' fairy tales, and--hopefully--learn to live with dignity instead of out of fear. Fourteen hundred years of self-annihilation and delusion is enough. Cassandra's Cries have, at last, become her Courage."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"This book is probably unique in world history. As there is the death penalty for leaving Islam according to Islamic law, and this can be a real threat even today, it is remarkable to see so many apostates come forward with their reasons for leaving the Koran's teachings behind. If an Islamic Reformation should be possible, these brave individuals have the key to this development. Even more testimonies from ex-Muslims are posted at Ibn Warraq's website, http://www.secularislam.org/ . Any person interested in Islam SHOULD have this book.

In contrast to most books about religion LEAVING ISLAM is full of personalities, recent world events, and concrete facts. The variety of people, with their contrasting levels of sophistication and talent, makes the reader feel as if he has had many wonderful conversations and knows much more than he knew before.The appendices contain concise scholarly summaries and references about the Koran and hadith. This added feature makes it two books for the price of one. There are even internet addresses which make continuing study or conversation about Islam available up to the minute.The import of the book is clearly a warning about the realities of fundamentalist Islam and indirectly an argument for humanism as being more desirable as a guide to a good life than any dogmatic religion."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"In Leaving Islam, as Salim Mansur from the University of Western Ontario wrote, Ibn Warraq has assembled a compelling list of writings from individuals of Muslim birth who renounced their faith. It serves as a companion of sorts to his own personal statement, Why I Am Not a Muslim,[Prometheus Books, 1995. See, \\"Brief Reviews,\\" Middle East Quarterly, Mar. 1996, p. 86. Writings of other Muslims and non-Muslims who either share Ibn Warraq's perspective or have contributed to his work in general can be found at http://www.islam-watch.org/] and opens a window into a usually hushed topic, revealing internal Muslim debates concerning history, faith, and culture.The problem of dissent within Islam has been a troubling issue from the earliest moments of Muslim history. Although the Qur'an famously declares at 2:256 that \\"There is no compulsion in religion,\\" apostasy (meaning, adopting another belief or non-belief) is a capital offence. Hence, Muslims' fear that dissent might be viewed as apostasy serves as an insidious weapon for political leaders. Often in collaboration with religious scholars, leaders use this tool to silence free thinkers and spread a blanket of totalitarian control over Muslim communities.Despite the crucial importance of apostasy, it has not seriously been documented or investigated. Ibn Warraq's breakthrough collection of essays offers a compelling and vivid insight into the minds of those individuals who have struggled with the faith tradition into which they were born, eventually departing from the belief of their parents and ancestors to become free of what they considered as oppressive or demeaning to living as rational and independent individuals.The phenomenon of Muslims leaving Islam is about as old as Islam itself. Ibn Warraq handily summarizes some of the most notable cases from the early centuries of Islam, such as those eminent freethinkers Ar-Rawandi (c. 820-830) and Ar-Razi (865-925), or skeptical poets such as Omar Khayyam (c. 1048-1131) and Hafiz (c. 1320-89), or Sufi (mystic) practitioners among whom the most notable victims of orthodoxy were Mansur ibn Hallaj (executed in 922) and As-Suhrawardi (executed in 1191).But the testimonies Ibn Warraq collects of contemporary individuals from across the Muslim world make for particularly fascinating reading. They offer insight into the biography and psychology of Muslims contending with a faith that they find irreconcilable with the requirements of modernity. The voices are those of men and women from Bangladesh and Pakistan, India and Iran, Tunisia and Turkey, Malaysia and Morocco. They are intelligent, aware of their past and tormented by present realities of obscurantism, dogmatism, and intolerance within Muslim societies.Ibn Warraq is a courageous writer on Islam and a passionate defender of reason who continues to struggle on behalf of reason with a culture that seems to be at odds with reason. In this respect, his work, as in the preparation of this edited volume, is an indispensable tool for Muslims themselves so they can wage their struggle for enlightenment and reform of their faith tradition.And here, therefore, lies the conundrum for those, be they Muslim or non-Muslim, who are concerned about the world of Islam and its relationship with others: the act of leaving Islam, however courageous on an individual basis, amounts to abandoning the reformist struggle needed within Islam."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"I was so impressed with the information in this book that I donated a new copy to the Elkton, Maryland, library, where others could read about what it tells about intolerance.

Both those who were born into a Muslim family, as well as those who chose to take up Islam not having been born Muslim. However it seems that not only is this a book about the refuting of Islam, but also seems to have the underlying ulterior motive of promoting an atheistic/agnostic view point. All of the 'Apostates' seem to take their refuge from Islam in either of the two camps. This seems strangely unbalanced. A recent program on Al Jazeera which consisted of several Imam's discussing the need for propagation of the Islam as taught and lived by Mohamed, bemoaned the fact that each hear 6,000,000 Muslims in the Middle East and Africa were converting from Islam to Christianity.

He is one of many who are mistreated and instead of searching for the truth in Islam and speaking against those who misuse it, he speaks against Islam itself. This book is an anti Islamic masterpiece and I must give Ibn Warraq credit for his work. I was disturbed at the testimonies of former Muslims and have to admit I even had an urge of leaving Islam myself. But for every 1 testimony of a former Muslim, there are 5 testimonies of converts to Islam. I am sure that we are tested in this life, and this book is a great test for believers."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"The book is in a series that \\"Ibn Warraq\\" has produced to argue that Islam is incompatible with today's age.Unfortunately, the book follows the same style of his earlier work: \\"Start with a few presupposed hypotheses and support them by quotes from Islamic sources and tradition, selectively compiled and largely taken out of context.\\" The book does not cite any of the scripture that would contradict the stated hypotheses. Also, it does not reflect honestly on the scholarly debate on some of the disputed incidents and show the other side of the opinion. One must note that this is the same style used by the fundamentalists who seek to perpetrate violence on innocent people. In both cases, the style is effective and highly persuasive, as it uses the sources of Islam itself to justify or support an arugment in a literal and superficial manner. Also, in both cases, it is dangerous.The book cites many episodes and interpretations of the scripture to support the ideas that Ibn Warraq wants to communicate. Unfortunately, he does not go into any depth in discussing the scholarly work by Islamic jurists over 14 centuries. He does not seem to either understand this work or is aware of it. Interestingly, this style of literal interpretation of scripture is the same advocated by the Wahhabi sect, although they are 180 degrees in terms of goals.To summarize, in spirit and style, this is book to Islam is equivalent to the slanted misinterpretations that I often find in Wahhabi writing, although they are obviously going after opposite goals. Not very useful, and should be balanced by books that support an opposite set of hypotheses before one would form a definitive opinion about the religion."},{"Title":"Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out","review":"Somebody commented on this book and said it was &quot;one of the best books about ISLAM available.&quot; With all do respect, you must have a brain the size of a peanut if you believe that. Let me comment on a few things I remember that were not true or acceptable by Muslims:The Prophet killed 900 men, women, and children from the tribe of Banu Qurayza.This story is told by Ibn Ishaq, who died 150 years after the event took place. Malik the jurist and others have called him an impostor his sources were unacceptable.There were three tribes in Medina; Khaybar, Fadak, and Qurayza.The first two surrendered before and after Qurayza surrendered to the Muslims, but they were all let go. It makes no sense that Qurayza were slaughtered when the others were not harmed.The rule in Islam is to punish only those responislbe for treason. as the Koran says &quot;No soul shall bear anothers burden.&quot;The conclusion is that the ones who committed the crime were punished, not the whole tribe.There are a few more testimonies that I could shred to pieces but I will comment on the one that said it was impossible for a flood to cover the whole world and that Noah could not have possibly gotten all the animals in the world in his ship.The flood destryoed the people of Noah, not the entire world. It says in the Koran, &quot;When the people of Noah denied the Messengers, We drowned them and We made of them a sign for mankind&quot; (25:36) This apostate was confusing the Koran with the Bible which says the flood covered the entire world.Yes, there are a few verses that say kill non believers.

But if you're looking for a sensible introduction to everything from Abstract Expressionism to Pop to Conceptual Art, it's hard to beat Edward-Lucie Smith's little handbook. &quot;Late Modern&quot; is written in a style almost impossible to find today: clear and simple without being condescending; sophisticated without being pretentious. This is a book on art that doesn't try to be a book on philosophy, nor does it assume the reader to be incapable of intelligent thought, like so much written today. Another element that distinguishes &quot;Late Modern&quot; from contemporary textbooks is the author's willingness to take a stand: his indictment of Bernard Buffet is direct and uncompromising, as is her criticism of Giacomo Manzu, R. B. Kitaj, and the late work of Picasso, among others. This boldness, this willingness to stamp a personal interpretation without descending into pointless rhetoric, gives the book a liveliness that, ironically, gives it an immediacy seldom found in works written in the thirty years since. The author's faults are the faults of age: writing so close in time to the creation of these works, Lucie-Smith did not have the advantage of hindsight, and some of his judgements (especially his predictions on the future course of art) seem a little off the ball. But on the whole he succeeded remarkably well in judging which artists would hold up over time, and displayed a remarkably acute sense for analysis. The book offers a dual pleasure: it is both a highly satisfying introduction to modern art and a fascinating insight into the situation of art and art criticism at a pivotal moment in it's history."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"Now in a newly revised and expanded edition, Cholesterol Control Without Diet! by Dr. William B.

To be fair, I also used red yeast rice supplements, and omega 3 oil, but I can tell you Dr. Parson's knows what he is talking about, and I recommend all physician's read this book as well!"},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"The one big reason why we use statins in daily clinical practice is not for the cholesterol lowering ability, but for the dramatic reductions shown in cardiovascular morbidity (disease occurence) and mortality (death). The Coronary Drug Project (1966-1975) was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled men between the ages of 30 and 65 who had already had one or more heartattacks, and randomized them to receive either niacin or placebo. Despite the impressive numbers that Dr. Parsons cites in his book, there were some significant drawbacks. The study did not enroll women or men of non-caucasian backgrounds, nor did it show impressive mortality benefit until about 6 or 7 years AFTER starting the drug. Statins have shown a role in both prevention of the first MI and prevention of recurrence, and separates from placebo at a much faster rate than Niacin did in its study.To be fair to niacin, it does remarkable things for the HDL which is the good cholesterol. I have not had success with it in the past because I was probably dosing people wrong (too little, and all at once. His book suggests using higher doses and splitting the dose with meals), but I do have a fair share of patients who are quite leery of statins due to the press they have received with things such as memory loss, muscle aches, liver failure, etc. A recent study shows that niacin in addition to statins reduces risk further than a statin alone, but I have not seen head to head studies with niacin and statins. Although I do not do inpatient medicine, I know that people who are discharged with an MI from the hospital are put on statins. There is strong evidence to back up use of statins in patients with a prior MI, much more so than niacin. I believe that if you are relatively young, have a bad family history, and have other risk factors for heart disease (obesity, smoking) then niacin may be a good alternative. However, for people who are diabetic or who have already had an MI or a stroke, the rapid onset of protection with statins is much preferred. As always, talk with your doctor to see if niacin is right for you (ha ha, sounded like a commercial there)."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"Dr. Parson's excellent book should be required reading for any physician who treats patients who have elevated cholesterol. Statins should never be considered first line treatments, as niacin has a 50 year history of being safe, effective AND inexpensive.The popular statin medications have enriched the drug companies beyond belief, and are largely ineffective in raising HDL despite their claims that they do. They also do nothing to lower dangerous levels of triglycerides.Buy this book. Read it. And if you have elevated blood lipids, and are either taking or considering taking a statin, give this book to your doctor. If he won't consider using niacin as part of your therapy, find a doctor who will. My Mayo Clinic physician recommended that I take Slo-Niacin, which I have been using for 6 months now. My HDL went from 42 to 60, and my triglycerides went from 147 to 52. Even Crestor, which I had been taking as monotherapy, was totally ineffective in dealing with either.I have had zero side effects, and my liver enzymes have actually dropped following a high dose regimen of 2000 mg of Slo-Niacin, 1000 mg in the morning, and 1000 when I retire at night.Truly a wonder drug IMHO!BUT DON'T TAKE HIGH DOSES OF ANY NIACIN PRODUCT (as Dr. Parsons emphasizes in his book) without the active supervision of a doctor who is good at niacin therapy.

Check with your dr."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"In a new book, William B. Parsons Jr., MD tells why niacin, a drug whose use for cholesterol control he pioneered more than 40 years ago, is really a &quot;designer drug&quot; for this purpose. Niacin, unlike other drugs in this field, does everything right. It reduces bad cholesterol, increases good cholesterol, lowers triglycerides, and has favorable effects on several recently discovered components of blood cholesterol. No other drug does all these things, or even the first two. Best of all, niacin does all this in the presence of an ordinary American diet. Dr. Parsons calls his book, CHOLESTEROL CONTROL WITHOUT DIET! THE NIACIN SOLUTION, a wake-up call to the public and the media. When most people hear &quot;choelsterol,&quot; they think &quot;diet&quot; because advocates of diet have brainwashed the media, which in turn has brainwashed the public, including the medical profession, he contends. This book shares the author's long experience in research and use of niacin in medical practice. &quot;Although available without prescription, niacin is not a do-it-yourself drug; it requires knowledgeable medical supervision,&quot; the book repeatedly emphasizes. Parsons says that if every doctor were good at using niacin, more than 90% of patients with cholesterol problems could have the drug's distinctive advantages at a cost one-sixth to one-tenth the cost of the expensive &quot;statins,&quot; the best-selling cholesterol control drugs. Dr. Parsons has studied niacin since 1955, his final year of internal medicine training at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Following up on preliminary findings of Canadian doctors, he conducted the firstg systematic study of niacin's effects, which showed that it lowered bad cholesterol and raised good cholesterol without diet. His later work in Madison, Wisconsin led to the Coronary Drug Project, an 8-year study which showed that niacin decreased heart attacks, strokes, cardiovascular surgery, and deaths in men who had already had heart attacks. He advocatess starting prevention of heart attacks by using niacin in young adults as well as middle-aged persons with abnormal cholesterol patterns, then continuing in elderly patients who have no overriding medical problems. While practicing medicine since graduating from University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1948, Parsons has written many medical articles and chapters in several books. In this new book, he outlines for the general public and for physicians his vast experience in the safe and effective use of niacin. For the past 20 years he has practiced internal medicine in Scottsdale, Arizona. This is a very readable book for the general public. It teaches readers how to be sure their doctors are good at using niacin. &quot;The definition of a doctor good at using niacin? One who has read this book.&quot; The knowledge in CHOLESTEROL CONTROL WITHOUT DIET! THE NIACIN SOLUTION can very well reduce heart attacks and strokes, cardiovascular surgery, and deaths, as niacin did in the Coronary Drug Project. From the back cover: WHO NEEDS THIS BOOK? Everyone, really. !The 29 million Americans adults who have cholesterol patterns that should be treated. ! Anyone who has had a heart attack, coronary artery surgery, angioplasty, or other artery procedure, stroke, or surgery on neck or leg arteries. !

Every persons with relatives or friends in any of these categories. YES--EVERYONE, REALLY!"},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"This book contains a wealth of information about preventing heart attack and stroke, not limited to cholesterol control--although that is its main thrust. As in the first edition, it teaches that diet has so little to do with your cholesterol level that we might as well say it has nothing to do with it. The problem is that you inherited a body factory that produces too much bad (LDL) cholesterol, not enough good (HDL) cholesterol, or to much triglyceride. Total cholesterol is essentially irrelevant; you and your doctor need to know and manage all of those fractions.To change the body factory requires medication. The best medication is niacin, which does everything right (lowers LDLC, triglycerides, and Lp(a)--&quot;the heart attack cholesterol&quot;--while raising HDLC. The widely advertised, expensive statin drugs do only one thing well--reduce LDLC. Statin drugs had, until 2001 (no later figures available) caused 112 deaths in the US and resulted in withdrawal of one such drug (Baycol) from the market. Statins do this by causing rhabdomyolysis (&quot;dissolving of muscles&quot;), with circulating myoglobin then blocking the kidneys, causing kidney failure. The muscle pains that often accompany statin use are warning signs to stop those drugs. Read the fine print ot listen closely to the fast talk at the end of commercials, then decide whether the statin manufacturers are trying to sweep these hazards udner the rug.Some experts think statins may, in time, prove to cause cancer, based on the fact that they all cause cancer in animals.Niacin has a safety record dating to the 1950's, when the author pioneered its use at the Mayo Clinic. A landmark study, sponsored by NIH (not by drug companies) showed (in men who had already had one or more heart attacks) that niacin reduced both heart attacks and strokes by 25%, while also reducing cardiovascular surgery, hospitalization, and deaths--as compared to other drugs or to placebo.Why, then, haven't we heard more of niacin? Because it's not patentable; thus no one company benefits from its exclusive sale. Reliable, inexpensive niacin products are available. This is not a fad supplement; niacin has been approved by FDA for cholesterol control since the early 1960's.Although available without prescription, &quot;niacin is not a do-it-yourself drug,&quot; the autrhor points out repeatedly. It require knowledgeable medical supervision to monitor cholesterol results and be sure there are no untoward side effects. The nuisance effect of skin flushing at the onset of treatment is easily avoided by using time-release products and a daily aspirin for the first week or two. The book dispels rumors and myths that niacin is hard to take or that time-release products should be avoided.Worried about prescription drug costs and statin hazards? Niacin costs $10-14 a month for usual doses (less than the co-pay of most prescription drug plans), while statin prices vary from $42 to $142 a month, depending on drug and dosage.This book emphasizes what Laura Bush recently learned: that in women, heart attacks cause more deaths each year than all cancers combined. The book takes the position that heart attacks and strokes are largely preventable. A second copy for your doctor is a good idea. And since obesity has been upgraded to a major risk factor for heart attack (as well as diabetes and worn-out weight-bearing joints), you might also do well to consult the author's newest book, Tough Talk About Fat! How to Reach and Maintain Your Ideal Weight. (It doesn't scold a person for being overweight; it tells him to GET TOUGH with that excess weight and get rid of it--all of it!)"},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"This expanded, updated paperback 2nd edition has all the truths of the 1998 hardcover and much more.

Dr. Abram Hoffer discovered its cholesterol lowering effects in the early 50's and Dr. Parson's picked up where Dr. Hoffer left off and has more good information on niacin in this book than I've seen anywhere else. If you have elevated cholesterol, this is a must read.The information on niacin could not be more complete, but the limitations of the book are when it comes to cholesterol discussion. Dr. Parson's says diet doesn't matter, meat is okay, and vegetarians are not healthier, which flies in the face of all medical studies. I agree a low fat diet is not good, but avoiding meat helps prevent the cholesterol from oxidizing, which is when the trouble starts. Also, he doesn't really even mention anti-oxidants.If you want good info on niacin, buy this book! I think an excellent book to purchase as well to get the entire picture is &quot;The Antioxidant Miracle&quot; by Dr. Lester Packer."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"Dr. Parsons presents a powerful argument for the use of niacin as a lipid lowering agent. His argument would be more powerful on a professional level if he would limit his emotional attachment and let the facts speak for themselves. I agree with his conclusions regarding the effectiveness of niacin and with the power of the pharmaceutical industry to shape public and medical opinion. In my opinion, however, he does downplay the incidence of certain side-effects of niacin and to some extent exxagerates the bad effects of other drugs.In total, this is a solid book that supplies a great deal of information that can greatly decrease one's risk of heart disease."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"I read this book because my cholesterol was off the charts and my HDL was low.

You'll be able to succeed. A portion of the book is devoted to detailed advice to practicioners on how to treat patients with Niacin. Good advice for health care professionals."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"After reading Dr. Parsons book I started taking Plain Niacin following Dr. Parsons' guidlines and found it was very effective in reducing total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL and Triglycerides.

I do not yet have my HDL level to the preferred minimum of 45, but am confident I will get there. Low HDL runs in my family and, fortunately, my total cholesterol and LDL are so low now, I don't believe I am in a high risk category anymore.The vast majority of Americans could prevent heart disease if they would become their \\"own doctor\\" and aggressively pursue a course of cholesterol treatment with a physician.It is odd that Niacin is still in the category of \\"generally unknown\\" given that it was the first drug used in treating cholesterol and still is one of the most effective and has the lowest cost."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"This book may literally be a lifesaver for me!I had a bad reaction to one of the statins.

Why is this generally unknown? As Dr. Parsons argues, there is no big money pushing niacin. (Although the HMOs should be; they'd save billions!) Niacin cannot be patented, so there is no fortune waiting to be made. In fact, niacin is and will continue to be a thorn in the side of pharmaceutical companies that spend millions promoting their statins which are clearly inferior to niacin.I have only a couple of minor complaints about the book. Dr Parsons basically dismisses the use of soluble fiber as insignificant. I know from personal experience that soluble fiber can make a very significant dent in cholesterol. I suspect it does so with even fewer potential complications than niacin. I use them both.Second, the homocysteine connection which is gaining more credence is not even mentioned in the book and anti-oxidants (vitamin e etc) are mentioned only in passing.My final gripe (no fault of the book)is that I cannot locate an MD in New York City that specializes in niacin therapy. If anyone knows of one, please e-mail me! Thanks."},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","review":"Dr. Parsons has written a book that is valuable to consumers and healthcare providers for many reasons. One of the main strengths of the book is a debunking of the myth, perpetuated by \\"Big Pharma\\", that statins are the best agents to reduce cholesterol, when niacin clearly wins the cholesterol-control battle for the entire lipid profile, hands down. Parsons does a good job pointing out flaws in the statin studies and also exposing the huge financial role Big Pharma plays in pushing statins. The main problem with statins, which many MDs as well as the general public still do not understand, is they don't do much for several important lipid parameters faced by a huge majority of the population these days, which are elevated triglycerides and low HDL (\\"good\\") cholesterol, along with small-particle LDL. Fact is, statins do not tackle these parameters well- they are only moderately successful lowering high triglycerides, and are almost worthless raising HDL. Niacin, on the other hand, tackles these lipid factors head-on, and remarkably well. Of course, you'll never learn this from your statin companies, because niacin is a common vitamin and cannot be patented for huge profits like statin drugs can. Hence, the relative obscurity of promoting niacin's clinical superiority in the popular medical ads...But never count out Big Pharma. Aware that niacin is clinically superior as an HDL-raising (and all-around lipid improvement) agent, they have been very busy exploring ways to make money off of niacin. One way, obviously, is to pair niacin with one of the patented statins, which boosts profits. And indeed this is what happened with Advicor(tm) and other niacin-statin combinations. So now, to get around the inferiority of statins doing the job right, statins are paired with niacin and drug companies can claim much better results. Another strategy for drug companies to boost profits is to add something else to niacin that CAN be patented. Niacin manufacturers have long wanted an agent that reduces the so-called \\"niacin flush\\", and research has gone into possible anti-flushing compounds that could be added to the niacin and thus become a proprietary combination that could- you guessed it- once again be patented for mega bucks. For example, look for Merck's new \\"Cordaptive\\"(tm), a niacin/laropiprant combination, to be available soon. But once again, there are common supplements, at a much lower price, that could be used instead. For anti-flushing, check out recent research on flavonoids such as quercetin and luteolin.So, why only my 3-star rating (actually, I give it 3.5 stars)? For one thing, Dr. Parsons seems to share the \\"old-school\\" medical view that cholesterol itself is the main target for heart health, whereas recent research implicates more fundamental root problems, which concern one's endothelial health in general. In short, there is a growing recognition that low-grade inflammation, often linked with high-processed-carb diets/sedentary lifestyle and resulting insulin resistance, produces free radicals that cause a lot of damaging effects throughout the body. Cholesterol production is not a villain; in fact, cholesterol is vital to many bodily functions. When cholesterol goes haywire, such as LDL fractions shooting upward, it is indicative of a more basic problem, and cholesterol, far from being the bad guy, is actually the body's attempt to RESPOND to the problem. Parsons' breakdown into \\"good\\" vs. \\"bad\\" cholesterol, and his niacin solution to both these parameters, is vastly simplistic. Researchers moving in the direction of inflammation control, reduction of excess free radicals, improvement of general endothelial and hormonal health (never underestimate those hormones), optimizing nitric oxide production, etc., are focusing on a much larger, more fundamental, picture than Dr. Parsons is. Niacin is great, but the public should be learning that bad cholesterol is just a marker of more fundamental inflammatory conditions. Heck, tell your doctors too, because they generally don't know that either...after all, physicians tend to rely on their drug reps (who are highly-coached salespeople, not researchers), and \\"cholesterol\\" seems to be a convenient singled-out target that drug companies can greatly profit from. And physicians tend to be too busy/too lazy to question the drug-company sales-talk.There is speculation now that the reason why statins can be effective is not because of their cholesterol action per se, but rather a reduction of inflammation. But hey- a lot of actions impact on inflammation, and most of these cannot be patented, because they are a result of one's diet and activity patterns. And we can't use the excuse of \\"bad genetics\\" as a reason for drugs, since low-grade inflammation doesn't come from your genetics (which only reveals propensities), but rather is perpetuated by lifestyle habits and environment. The problem in trying to attack health conditions with just a \\"pill\\" strategy (drugs OR niacin), is that systemic inflammation can't be tamed by just focusing on symptoms- at some point the root problem needs to be addressed. Want to raise your HDL cholesterol? Niacin certainly can be useful tool, but so is cutting the refined junk out of your diet, making sure you are getting good nutrition (such as adequate Vitamin D), and getting proper exercise, which is what your body is designed to do. Voila! Watch how your HDL/triglyceride ratio improves. Dr. Parsons has already given up on food or exercise to help you, and dismisses your desire to make those changes...for you see, he takes a dim view of lifestyle changes in his book. But don't you follow him here. One should recognize that \\"old school\\" physicians like Dr. Parsons seem happy to concentrate only on improving cholesterol markers via a \\"pill\\" approach. Sadly, this is merely a \\"band-aid\\" approach to cardiovascular health."},{"Title":"Mix Butter With Love (A Cookbook For The Daughter-in-law)","review":"I received this book as a shower gift back in 1975.

Written by a British general only five years after the war, the book has some problems as a scholarly work, the most blatant being it is hardly impartial. The author takes an \\"us vs. them\\" tone, always referring to the British as \\"we\\" and making no secret who he feels the good guys are. Young tends to get sidetracked and talk about himself and tell stories about other officers that don't necessarily have a lot to do with Rommel, just because he finds them interesting. He also fails to explain many abbreviations or translate foreign phrases.It works as a book, however, because it is an interesting look at the time period and the way Rommel was viewed by his contemporaries and his opponents. He interviews Rommel's wife and son as well as many men who served with him and who fought against him. It was written at a time when the war was still fresh in everyone's mind and no one knew how Germany was going to turn out. This gives it an immediacy that most historical biographies, usually written decades or centuries later, don't have. This also means it lacks the new information that would have been uncovered by decades of research, but as I said, it is not the ultimate biography of Rommel, just one side of the story. If you treat it as such, it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Young did a commendable job writing his biography of German Field-Marshal Erwin Rommel. He was able to provide an interesting psycho-biographical picture of Rommel the man, which all too often is avoided in other books chronicling the lives of great military commanders. Rather than only concentrate on the battles and strategies of Rommel, Young provided insight into the opinions of the General in regards to Hitler, the Nazi party, and other aspects of WWII.According to Young, Rommel was a private man, devoted to his family and to the German people. His commitment to Germany was shown quite clearly when he encouraged the Fuehrer to seek a peaceful solution to the war in order to save the lives of his soldiers and German citizens. However, his commitments ultimately cost Rommel his life.However, I wish Young would have provided more in-depth information regarding the major battles in which Rommel participated. A slightly deeper analysis of the campaign in Africa would have brought to light Rommel's decision to join in the attempt to remove Hitler from power. Some maps would have also proved helpful for those of us who lack a profound knowledge of North African geography.Still, Young provided an excellent profile of the one of the most famous commanders of WWII, and of all time."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"hello,this is not a review.i am trying to locate the writer desmond young,or the publisher.i have the authentic oil painting of erwin rommel.i am a collector of world war 2 memorabilia.i came into the possession of the oil painting from a dealer in oklahoma.i've had the paperback book rommel the desert fox,since it originally was published,but i put it on mybookshelf,and never opened it until a couple of day's ago.for whatever reason i picked up he book,andbegan looking through the picture's.then to my amazement i found the photo of frau rommel sitting ona sofa,and behind her hung the oil painting of her husband.the reason i'm writing this letter to you,is i believe the painting could be a significant piece of history,or interest to otyher partie's,possibly desmond young the writer or his publisher,or the rommel family for that matter.whomever read's thisw letter,hopefully you will make an effort to let the interested partie's know thati have the painting,and the signed painting is by the artist heinrich eckhart.thank you,joe"},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Victory and defeat were close companions in the ranks of Erwin Rommel's Afrikakorps. In June, 1942, Rommel finally captured the doughty port bastion of Tobruk and was pressing on to Egypt. By October's end, he was in full retreat, never again to hold the upper hand. What it was like to be a member of Rommel's legions is the subject of this 1951 memoir.Heinz Werner Schmidt got to Africa early, even before Germany entered the conflict. In East Africa, where the Italians were holding on to Eritrea, he commanded a small detachment of German sailors who volunteered to fight. Then, in March, 1941, he was called up to Libya to help Rommel settle into his new command. Soon he was Rommel's aide-de-camp, riding alongside the Desert Fox as he berated subordinates and carefully inspected his defenses - from the enemy's own side.Rommel's theory of desert warfare was comparable to naval combat. \\"Whoever has the weapons with the greatest range has the longest arm, exactly as at sea,\\" Schmidt quotes Rommel saying at one meeting. \\"Whoever has the greater mobility, through efficient motorization and efficient lines of supply, can by swift action compel his opponent to act according to his wishes.\\"Schmidt's history is a worthy read, at times compelling for those with an interest in this part of World War II going in. But it's not the kind of book that grabs you with scintillating prose or probing insights. Schmidt writes in a stilted fashion, starting his story abruptly and leaving a few early tales half-told. When Rommel's waspish chief of staff countermands Rommel's own order to take the inland hub of Mechili, pressing on instead for Tobruk, Schmidt is assigned to pass the order on. But when Schmidt fails to do this, the implications of this (what did the chief of staff say to Schmidt after? What did Rommel say to his second-guessing chief of staff?) are left blank.At another point, early on at the siege of Tobruk, Rommel sends a tank force to their doom while Schmidt watches helplessly, knowing it is all a mistake. Whatever Rommel thought after is left unrecorded.Despite the title, there was not a lot of closeness between Schmidt and Rommel. About all we learn of Rommel's personality was that he was brave, short of temper when the situation called for it, and enjoyed jokes about Prussians (he was Swabian himself). When Schmidt requests a transfer to front-line service halfway through the book, Rommel becomes a distant background figure.\\"Close to him, I found him much more unimaginative and stolid than the romanticized pictures that have been drawn of him by both friend and foe,\\" Schmidt writes. I wish Schmidt provided more of an analysis than that, but it's a spotty book that way.One consistent element in Schmidt's account is that of loss. People pop up all the time only to die or vanish a page or two later. \\"Death began to loom up as a brother, and it seemed absurd that one should fear him,\\" Schmidt writes. \\"He would be kind...\\" Schmidt's own experience speaks to a more general sense of futility. He goes on leave after Rommel's capture of Tobruk and comes back just in time to cover the retreat from El Alamein, the beginning of the end.Schmidt comes across as a good man, unimpressed with Nazism, generous with praise for his foes (South Africans, New Zealanders, and Australians especially), and courageous without calling much attention to it. At times one wishes he had more ego; more chest-puffing would have made a more gripping read. Instead \\"With Rommel\\" is a by-the-numbers account, told sincerely but not imaginatively."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"A rare account from a German aide de camp, with fascinating glimpses into the daily life of a General staff. Add to that the fact that the aide de camp was for none less than Rommel himself, during the legendary Afrika Korps days, and you get a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"I've always wondered why the war in the desert was necessary. I'm a big WW2 fan, and had not really heard much about Rommel other than that he was a great General, and his work in Africa and the French coast defenses was noted. I didn't realize how much time he spent with Hitler and how he could have had much more influence on the war. Desmond Young goes on sometimes too much about his own side, but of course, if you are a student of War history, you will rather like what he has to say."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"The worst thing about this book is that it consistently fails to live up to the reader's expectations. For instance, the author actually spent little time with Rommel himself. The title and various notes led me to believe that the whole book was a sort of there-by-his-side tale, which it is not. And that's just the beginning. The author seems to pick up steam with a good story when all of a sudden it's over. Vague. Brief. Too general, etc. Nonetheless, it's a fairly quick read and did provide some insights."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Young's depiction of Rommel is boring and lacks any insight that many of the other Rommel biographis possess. This book is a short story, without any details concerning Rommel's role in World War I &amp; II. It is for this reason that I suggest you ignore this book"},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"I possess a copy of this book,which I do not deem as being the work of a serious historian.Rather,it is simply a dated and stale product of WWII British propaganda,and certainly better works have been written on the same subject.See for example the book by David Fraser.The role of the Italians -who made up the great majority of Rommel's soldiers in the African theater- is grossly underestimated,and ripe with negative clich&egrave;s on their fighting capabilities,while at the same time skillfully avoiding to give any credit to their most valuable units,such as Ariete,Folgore or Giovani Fascisti.Not the work of an historian.A waste of time."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Written by a soldier who has experienced first hand the desert war, naturally makes this book a good read. However it was written just after WW2 and there was much myth and confusion surrounding the figure of Rommel himself. A standard biography during its time(churchill constantly refers to this book in his WW2 memoirs), however time and research has revealed that Young's portrayal of Rommel's character is not so accurate. For example he says that Rommel was humble and disliked publicity but we now know that the Desert Fox was quite vain, courted publicity and exploited it. The best book on Rommel is I beleive, David Irving's &quot;On the trail of the FOX&quot;. The book reads like an explosive novel and I finished the book in one night. Fraser's &quot;knight's cross&quot; is also very detailed although it is not as exiting a read as Irving's book."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"I have to say I'm biased, for this book marked a decisive moment of my childhood. This was the FIRST book I read in my life. I was eight y.o. then, and I stole it from my father's bookshelf. I loved the book, even if I didn't understand it all. I read it so many times that I'm sure I knew it better than Mr. Schmidt. It's war, written from a very personal and somewhat innocent point of view. After this book, I devoured everything that was printed, and still do. Thanks, Mr. Schmidt, you'll never know how important you've been to me."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Desmond Young, a general in the British army, writes a truly magnificent story of Rommel, his accomplishments, failures - both personal and professional, his emotional journey toward realizing the demon that he was part of, and his tragic end.Young superbly depicts a realistic picture of that era and at times makes the reader feel they are present in the desert watching the game of war.With his command of the English language, his personal experience of WWII, he argues that it is not the German qualities the rest of the world despises, but the frequent abuse of them by their rulers in the past."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"An intimate look at Rommel as a commander and superior officer written by an aide who served him on a daily basis in North Africa. Provides insight into why Rommel, a Field Marshal who was not above jumping into a ditch to help his men \\"unstick\\" a vehicle from the sand, was so respected by the men who served under him.Living in the same spartan conditions imposed on his men, Rommel was a foot soldier's general who sometimes conducted his own reconnoitering, at great risk, led from the front lines, and believed in ACTION. Feared and respected by the British, his chief opponents in Africa, he became a subject of formidable mystique which worried their Middle East HQ and inspired jealousy from the German General Staff. They regarded him as an over-rated middle-class upstart who, in being promoted Field Marshal by Hitler, had encroached upon sacred ground previously occupied mainly by German nobility.With Rommel in the Desert shows that Rommel's appeal lies in his action-oriented personality, his code of chivalry and fairness. It is clear after the North African campaign that he missed the clarity of purpose and independence he enjoyed during that time, and chaffed against subsequent dealings with the politicized world of the German General staff and the Nazi regime which helped build his reputation.Like Patton, Rommel was out of his depth when dealing with political matters, as when he became involved on the fringes of the July 20th plot against Hitler, and like Patton, he was a skilled and highly professional military man whose ego led him to be exploited by the propanganda machine of the nation he served. An excellent book for anyone interested in this famed but enigmatic German commander."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Written by a british officer who fought and was captured by Rommel in the deseret. The author goes to all the human limits of reserch to find and interview anyone who ever knew Rommel personaly. He goes to great lengths to tell us the personality of Rommel and his impact on those who surrounded him. A MUST for any WWII historian or buff. If you have never read a book on Rommel before, Start with this one."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"One of the best portraits of Rommel I've ever read. Told from the viewpoint of a close aide who served Rommel on a daily basis, this book is an intimate look at him as a commander and a superior, offering insight into why he was so respected by his men and yet, as a middle-class \\"upstart,\\" posed such a threat to the German nobility who comprised the bulk of the professional officer corps.Rommel placed the same spartan demands upon himself that he imposed on his men. A \\"hands-on\\" commander who often led from the front lines, conducted his own reconaissance and exposed himself to great danger, even as a Field Marshal he was not above jumping down into a ditch to help his men unstick a vehicle from the sand. More of a personal memoir, With Rommel in the Desert gives the reader the best look at Rommel's action-oriented personality yet. A soldier first, last and always, he had a code of chivalry that harked back to simpler times, and, when it was over, he missed the clarity of purpose and independence he had during the North African campaign. He was similar to Patton in two respects: He was out of his depth when dealing with political matters, as when he became involved on the fringes of the July 20 plot against Hitler; and also, the needs of his ego compelled him to allow himself to be exploited by the German propanda machine. An excellent book for anyone interested in this renowned and enigmatic German commander."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Rommel was first a soldier in the German Army and not a Nazi madman. He served as all soldiers should serve, his country and his troops. By the time he realized the path Hitler had chosen it was too late. This book tells the story of Erwin Rommel the man and soldier not the story of a General/Field Marshall in the Nazi army. Rommel was one of the best leaders of military forces in WWII except he was on the wrong side and was the victim of \\"lack of support\\". The western forces were very lucky Rommel suffered from the incompetence of those above him."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"Written shortly after the war, Rommel is a fairly sympathetic biography of the famed &quot;Desert Fox&quot;. Most interesting was the story of his pre-war military service, in particular his service during the First World War. Previously not familiar with this, I found it interesting how it was tactics learned while serving with a special Wuerttemburg army unit that influenced his thinking during the North Africe campaign. Certainly worth reading for all those interested in the war, but there are no doubt better, more thorough studies of Rommel available."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"In Desmond Young's biography, \\"Rommel: The Desert Fox\\" he gives a stylish and relatively brief telling of the life and military career of Erwin Rommel. Young himself was a veteran of two world wars and served with the British Army in the Middle East. His book is an immensely enjoyable read and puts a human face upon a general who served the most evil man in history. There is somewhat of a legend around the figure of Erwin Rommel and this book definitely adds to the lore. While it includes the documented movements of the Afrika Corps and the British 8th Army, the real focus of the book is the larger than life persona of Rommel.The author definitely held on to some Victorian beliefs about warfare and chivalry which are evident in the book. Much of the testimony is from German generals Bayerlein and Von Ravenstein who both developed a friendship with the author after the war in the process of writing this book (originally published in 1950). The existence of this code of conduct and even mutual respect between adversaries is a defining feature and it paints the exploits of Rommel in a most sympathetic light. The reader also understands the divisions that existed in the German military between the Wermacht and the SS. These were key in bringing the ultimate demise of Rommel after the attempt on Hitler's life on July 20, 1944.Rommel's life began most ordinarily in the Swabian portion of Germany. While a shy young boy, he developed a love for skiing and athletics during his teen years. His service during World War I is the stuff of legend as his exploits earned him the highest decorations in the German Army. His service spanned the four years of the war as he saw action as a junior officer in Beglium, France, Romania and Italy. His noted for his boldness and lead by example style and especially for his ability to maneuver around the enemy in a dynamic fashion (not an easy task in static trench warfare).The inter war years saw Rommel gradually rise throughout the German Army as he taught at a military academy. Upon the outbreak of the war Rommel lead his 7th Panzer Division (the Ghost Division) through Poland and France earning him a great reputation as leader of men and excellent strategist in mobile tank tactics.AS the war in North Africa heats up with Italy's entrance into the Tri-Partite pact, Rommel is soon assigned to the desert where his genius for armored strategy could be used best in wide open expanses. The bulk of Young's book takes place in Afrika and chronicles the many ups and downs of Rommel's time there fighting the British 8th Army and its three commanders ( Wavell, Auchenlech, Montgomery). Rommel was perhaps best known for his boldness in attack and his intuition in predicting his enemies next move. This sixth sense led to his rapid victory in 1941 as he pushed the British back across Libya with the bare minimum of divisions (mainly the 15th and 21st Panzer). This began almost three years of see sawing desert combat which saw the front lines fluctuate across the entire length of Libya four or five times. Rommel was not the best administrator (which would contribute to the Corps supply problems) but his ability to lead his undersized force in battle after battle is a testament to the cohesion of his units (despite the shoddy Italian divisions which made up the majority of the Axis force in North Africa). With the defeat at El Alamein, Rommel left Africa with a bout of jaundice only to return to the first battles against the Americans. He was evacuated before the eventual surrender in May of 43. The book rounds out with his time in Normandy and his forced suicide because of Hitler's suspicions after the July 20 plot. A great and painless read about the last German general to be respected by the Allies."},{"Title":"With Rommel in the desert","review":"I just finished this book and feel that I really have a glimpse into Erwin Rommel's psyche. Without telling you (and spoiling the book) he was a soldier's soldier. Veterans of the Afrika Korp would say that they \\"fought with Rommel\\" just as 3rd Army veterans proudly say that they fought with Patton.He had almost a naivete about politics and Hitler until the last year of the war.Young (who was captured in North Africa by Rommels Army and a General) interviews surviving members of Rommel's staff and in conversations British General to German Generals talk about tactics in North Africa and the many \\"if onlys\\" and \\"what if's\\".Finally after interviewing both his wife Lucie and son Manfred his description of their visit to his house by a Nazi general with his options - suicide or family punishment and disgrace - well, you believe that you are in the house with the Rommels. With this book you realize that with only a few \\"if onlys\\" WW2 would have been very different.I think this book is a classic - probably definitive - biography on Erwin Rommel and it undoubtedly let to the 1951 movie with James Mason (in which the author has a part)"},{"Title":"Andy: Twenty-Four Years of Foul Play with a Talking Crow","review":"This book wasn't what I expected. 24 years of living with a crow should amount to much more interesting experiences than a handful of personal observances of how this crow felt and how it schemed, which seemed too one-sided."},{"Title":"Andy: Twenty-Four Years of Foul Play with a Talking Crow","review":"Whitney Dough is a cool writer and his book, The Hymn Writers, is *the* reference book if you're ever interested in looking up the bare facts about the lives and works of the male and female writers of your favorite church hymns. They were a varied lot and quite talented, with more quirks than you'd expect! ANDY is even more upfront about its eccentricity. In the Bible there are not very many crows, whereas there are ravens galore, perhaps because the weather conditions of the Middle East prevented crows from thriving whereas it was good for ravens? Most of the time you find \\"crow\\" in the Bible, it's as a verb: for example, \\"Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The \`rooster' shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.\\"Whitney Dough is a religious man and the story of his life with Andy is an amusing one, for all its sadness. There's something about living with a bird that makes you seem kooky to others, but those of us who have had this experience from the inside know that there's something sacred about it. Not for nothing is the Holy Father continually compared to a pet owner, nor we the sinners a flock of birds. Remember Bede's story of human life as a bird darting into one window of a lighted house, on a dark night, then flying back out again into the darkness?I don't know why the other reviewer gave this book only a few stars; maybe because it was too personal and revealing, and not enough ornithology. But there are many books about crow life, and hardly any about spending two decades of one's life with one, and so this is a cherishable book in which you will find tools and tips for appreciating your own pet in (and finding your spiritual side as well)."},{"Title":"Reiner Leist: American Portraits 1910-2001","review":"Whether one views only the pairs of photographs or reads the extraorindary interviews with Americans as diverse as the novelist Barry Lopez, the coal miner, Al Hooper, or Henry Kissinger, the effect of Reiner Leist's American Portraits is extraorinarily poignant and touching. As an immigrant, this book -- in part because it portrays the country in both image and word -- captures for me what it means to be an American. Especially at this juncture in our history when, threatened from abroad, we are searching for our national identity at home, the collected images and words of these 54 representatives of this complex, diverse and complicated nation express the ineffable about this country.Reiner Leist has photographed this cross-section of Americans with so much empathy and sensitivity that the souls of the participants come directly across to the reader. I have never encountered a photographer, especially a portraitist, with such empathy for his sitters. The format of the book, which pairs a childhood photograph selected by a participant with a corresponding adult portrait taken by Reiner Leist is unique. The juxtaposition of the two photographs has the powerful effect of conveying a sense of identity across boundaries of time and geography.I can't recommend this book highly enough and have bought it for everyone on my holiday gift list! The book itself is beautifully made. One comes away from each viewing/reading of it with a heightened sensitivity to one's own (im)mortality, the passage of time and the presence of place."},{"Title":"Besame Mucho: An Anthology of Gay Latino Fiction (New Gay Latino Fiction)","review":"This anthology of short stories is both satisfying and frustrating - satisfying in the varietal range of writers, frustrating in that there isn't more to read! There are common threads that editors Manrique and Dorris have discovered and those threads are woven into sometimes gaudy/garrish flags and at other times into tender/vulnerable mantillas. The flavors are quintessentially Latin and if some of the stories are more tenuous in content and form, this only serves to evidence the valor of a history of suppressed sexuality each author addresses. Some of the works are mature, elegantly written vignettes and the editors are kind to give us past and future works for further investigation. Others show many degrees of promise.

The anthology is quite a varied gathering of gay Latino writers at many stages of their careers, so it was interesting to note how this collection balanced the range of literary talents. I was impressed by most of the pieces, disappointed in others. If you read this collection you will recognize the weak writing rather quickly. (Find out for yourself!) I was, however, a bit dismayed that so many of these stories dealt with sex. There were few exceptions. So I found it difficult to see how this collection offered anything different from the mediocre &quot;white gay&quot; collections that have flooded the market recently, other than that these are gay Latinos. But that is just an observation, not necessarily a criticism. I still have to commend this effort, kudos to Mr. Manriquez.

What did Mary think, feel, believe? This book explores these questions. In the introduction, the author is quite candid about the idea of a written journal being anachronistic, but does point out that Mary is described in Luke's Gospel as a ponderer, just the kind of person who might have kept a journal in a different time and place. Here the auther extrapolates what Mary's life might have been like, and her portrait is both sympathetic and believable. We find a wife and mother, who gets caught up in the minutia of day-to-day life, and sometimes has to remind herself what her son's role is meant to be. Unfortunately, this book ends with the beginning of Jesus's public ministry, so that we don't get to explore Mary's reactions to her son's public role, or witness the agony of standing at the base of the cross when he was crucified. There was a great deal of potentially powerful material that is left unexplored. While this story is enjoyable and moderately inspirational, it might have been truly great if it had pursued the story to its end."},{"Title":"Mary's Journal-a Mothers Story","review":"Bought this for Mom and then read it after she finished it.

And a good scifi book too. Before you read this book however, you must understand that the person who wrote this book was a 19th century priest. So, unfortunately there are some politically incorrect views about women in the book (alway a bit less than the men, in inteligence and the number of sides).But, keeping that in mind, this is a wonderful book that lets you think of the world we live in in a new light. Covers the concepts of dimentions beautifuly in easy to understand writing and the interactions between Mr. Square and Mr. Sphere are interesting to say the least.So, to all readers interested in seeing our world in a different perspective and contemplating the existance of other dimentions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"This was a good morsel in the midst of my newest interests...chaos, quantum mechanics, sacred geometry, etc...if you enjoy numbers and thinking hard - it is a good read. Reading for everyday pleasure may be disappointing."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"Flatland is an excellent pseudo-fiction written to enlighten the reader as to the interactions between the dimensions. The escapades of the squares, lines, circles and triangles as they live their lives in only two dimensions and encounter both 'lower' and 'higher' dimensions is very illuminating as to how different dimensions work together, and how it is not possible for someone of a lower dimension to perceive the higher dimensions.I especially enjoyed Sphereland (which is at the other end of the book, flipped over in a somewhat corny configuration) because of the added thought and depth it brought to the interactions between the sphere and the squares that were being observed in flatland. It is the original introduction of the sphere that leads the enhabitants of the two-dimensional world to ponder the third dimension, and it is this further discussion of the three dimensional world that allows us to ponder what lies out in the fourth dimension. The second book does a very good job of answering a lot of the questions raised in Flatland, as well as bringing up many other curious items (such as the 'flipping' of the dogs and what flipping would entail in a three dimensional world). Sphereland does a good job of walking the reader through the initial set up of Flatland, so if one is reading them back to back there is a lot of initial material that can be skimmed or skipped. I would recommend that you can go straight to sphereland and not miss a beat.I did think that the emphasis placed on the 'backwardness' of the Victorian thinking two dimensional universe was a little much, but understand it was part of the times. It would have been nicer had the author of Sphereland merely skipped over its presence, rather than trying to set things straight through some kind of cultural revolution.All in all, this is a very good book that leads to some very serious thinking - I would recommend it to everyone, regardless of their interest in science and math."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"I have been a fan of flatland since I first read it as a schoolgirl.

The point was partially spoiled by lifting A Square out of his Flatland into Sphereland where A Square then magically developed the 3-D vision that real humans come equipped with. This should not have been the case--Square's vision should have remained the same as it was in Flatland. The main aspect of the Flatland story is that the brain is able to supersede information presented to it by the crude senses. Square was willing to go to prison to stay loyal to his intellectual knowledge. His Flatland jailers would always stay true to their visual sense data.The illustrations for zero, one and two dimensions are now a bit outmoded. With string theory the little one dimensional loops of vibrating energy (said to compose the zoo of sub-atomic particles) are woven together to produce not only the second and third dimension but also the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th dimensions. Alas, there is no theory to support Abbott's Pointland of zero dimensions--this sounds like a spiritual concept. A modern day Abbott is needed to elucidate string theory for the man on the street.The two dreams A Square had, revealing the narrowness of the perspectives in Lineland and Pointland, were the most interesting part of the story. As he slept A Square's brain was in contact with the Matrix Data Base that showed him how adamantly the inhabitants of Lineland and Pointland clung to their simple perspectives. Thus, A Square saw the futility of maintaining his Flatland point of view."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"Jesus' time in our world could be compared to the flatland story.

Read it if you have to in college (if you happen to major in Computer Science or Math)"},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"Abbott's math fantasy Flatland is more than 120 years old, and that alone makes it an interesting reading for people interested in geometry. Written in a time before the age of relativity and quantum mechanics, Flatland explores a two-dimensional world inhabited by geometrical shapes.The math is pretty easy and people with a solid math background won't learn anything new, but Flatland is still interesting. Not so much the story, which is about A. Square's (main character) introduction to a third dimension by a character called Sphere.Besides the math, the sociogram of the Victorian times are amusing. Soldiers are considered to be very dull people, but still worse are women, who have no brains and memory whatsoever. I read somewhere that Abbott wanted to satirize the sexism of the times, but that is not so obvious while reading the book.The book is followed by Burger's Sphereland, a sequel written 80 years later. Sphereland explored further the mysteries of Flatland. Women have brains now, but they still don't have much to say, and have to behave like good housewives. Burger should have known better, but 1960 was still some years before Women's Lib...Could have been a lot more interesting if there were no characters but just plain math and more illustrations. For people who want to understand how Universes expand and to get a more realistic view about dimensions, I suggest to read Stephen Hawking's 'A Brief History Of Time'."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"If you are not familiar with Edwin Abbott's &quot;Flatland&quot;, this is the edition to buy. If you are familiar with it (but presumably do not yet own it), this is still the edition to buy.You've heard the classic criticism of a story is that it is &quot;two dimensional&quot;. Well, Edwin Abbott's tale of an imaginary two-dimensional land adds a whole new twist to that phrase. Flatland, as he describes it, is about as rich as a two-dimensional story can be. And it is marvelously extended by its narrator's encounters with the unknown - the world of 3 dimensions. The challenges that narrator faces as he encounters the incomprehensible, quite closely mirror mine whenever I attempt to think about a 4th (or 5th or 7th) dimension. If you've faced the same struggle, you will be delighted by this book.If you've ever wondered what a 4th dimension would look like, Flatland provides a lens through which you can imagine that extension of our 3D world. From here you can go on to read Rudy Rucker or Pickover or Hawkins - but this is the place to start your exploration of dimensions beyond experience. Abbot accomplishes this by describing the eye-opening extension of his narrator's 2D world when visited by a 3D apparition, a &quot;sphere&quot;. His framing of the foundational issues through the experiences of what you'd expect to be the least interesting character in fiction are really quite engaging. The storyline, however sparse, is as interesting as the mathematics - albeit quite nineteenth-century'ish in tone.Don't misconstrue Abbott's seemingly misogynist portrayal of women and of his class-stratified society. This element was intended to provide a third layer of sharp, Swiftian satire and critical commentary on the rigid social mores of his era. Abbot succeeds in this (but I, nevertheless, decided not to read it aloud to my 6th grade classes - worrying that they might not be attuned to this subtlety of tone.) Be forewarned.The neat twist of this edition, the inclusion of Dionys Burger's 1983 &quot;Sphereland&quot;, as an upside-down &quot;second book&quot;, is quite a nice touch. Although I did not find Burger's stylings quite as engaging as those of Abbott, his extension of the mathematical ideas into non-Euclidian spaces is a nice introduction to that idea for non-mathematicians. Since it was intended as a standalone book, \\"Sphereland\\" commences with a detailed review of the \\"Flatland\\" story. This can be skipped without loss but is not a substitute for reading the original \\"Flatland\\", here, first.Flatland is a timeless classic; a great book for the mathematician and non-mathematician alike."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"I am only 17 and I read both of these books and understood every word of it. Not to say that the things covered in these two books are easy to see or comprehend but the authors did such a beautiful job of making everything easy to understand from life in the 2nd dimention to slightly grasping the 4th dimention through mathmatics and to flipping 3 dimentional objects in the 4th dimention thus reversing them like turning a left shoe into a right shoe. Even if you are not interested in math or science these books let you see the world in another way and will stay with you provoking thought at every turn."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"This book introduced me to the amazingly interesting possibilaty of a fourth dimension, or even an infinite number of dimensions, and the way the material was presented (by a story of A Square and A Hexoagon and there adventures with a sphere) is delightfully entertaining. Since the human mind has such a horrid time visualizing the fourth dimension, taking it down one level by having creatures living in a two dimensional world who try to understand the third dimension is an excellent way to help people grasp the possibility of higher dimensions. I was also very interested in the books discussion about a curved space and an expanding universe. This book is great for any teenager interested in theoretic sciences and geometery and it is a great intellectual read."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"Flatland and Sphereland are very well written books, but for entirely different reasons. Flatland is a fun story that takes you into the 2nd (and 1st, and 0th) dimensions to see what life is like there with its final goal to make you speculate on what the fourth dimension would be like. Flatland, the first book, excels at making you grasp the concepts and has a very good story to go along with it. The story seems to be the main focus, rather than the other aspects.Sphereland is entirely the opposite. Sphereland deals with ideas such as the expanding universe theory others. This it explains even clearer then flatland did. But Sphereland's focus was not on the story, but rather on the theories that it tried to convey. This may be a good thing in some people's minds, but I enjoyed the story of flatland and didn't like it pushed aside to explain the theories. I also didn't like the fixing of flatland to make it less backwards (Besides giving equality to women) since flatland to me was backwards.So If you want to learn complex Ideas simply and with fun, these are the books for you."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"Many topics in modern physics and astronomy involve thinking of the universe in more than our customary three dimensions. Super-string theories, for instance, suggest as many as ten dimensions in our universe. Yet the general public is completely unfamiliar with this mode of thinking. Flatland and Sphereland are both stories with the perfect blend of simplicity and sophistication. Their simple, precise language is easy enough for even the casual reader to follow, yet the concepts presented are advanced enough that even experts in the field will be churning it around in their minds for days after. When I ordered these books, I expected an entertaining story that, while intriguing, would contribute little to my education in the long run. What I found, beneath the delightful tale, was a depth of concept that has changed my thinking."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"I am 17, and I thought that these books opened doors to a new way of thinking for me. It is very likely that anyone who didn't like these books simply did not understand them.

I recomend this book to anyone who is scared of physics or simply wants too expand their mind."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"This is a must read for anyone. Its written simply for anyone to understand yet the underlying principles can inspire thought and contemplation on the ideas of relativity and perspective. On the surface this book explores dimensions but it provokes thought about perspective and encourages you to evaluate your own perspectives. You can get anywhere from mild amusement from this book to philosophical life changing perspectives.In detail, Flatland is a classic story about a two dimensional square that discovers the world of a line, a point, a sphere and beyond. The square contemplates his role in society as a square and realizes that there is something else out there when a sphere comes to visit."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"This book is a must have for all bonafide Flatlands fans.First off, it has the original Flatlands classic by Edwin Abbott Abbott, the mathematician/clergyman would first took us to the world of A Square. And it also has the 1967 followup Sphereland.It bears noting that Sphereland is but one of many follow up so Abbott's classic and because they're all good and worthy in their own right, I'll repeat them here:Spaceland...the Rudy Rucker classic which focuses more on following up the story than the science of Abbott's original book;Plainiverse...the Dewdney work which actually endeavors to thoroughly flesh out the physics and biological issues of what life actually would be like in 2D (for what it's worth philosopher Dan Dennett says that this is favorite take on the Flatlands theme); andFlatland Annotated and Flatterlands...both by mathematician Ian Stewart. If I wasn't as a big of a fan of this book I probably admittedly would've stopped my collection at just these entries because the annotated version has the original Flatland in it and also because in my opinion at least Flatterlands does the best and most recent job of updating the mathematics of Flatland.But that being said, Sphereland is a serviceable entry and does faithfully follow the A Square story...albeit two generations later...and like the original Flatland serves as a great metaphor for the desireability of open mindedness and looking past your limitations."},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"Flatland the book is about many intelligent geometrical creatures who think 2 dimensions is all there is until one day a square starts thinking otherwise. Learn what is would be like to live in 2 dimensions and try to fill in the holes"},{"Title":"Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)","review":"My appreciation of mathematics came late in life, but it finally came. I have neither the aptitude nor the training to be a professional mathematician, but I like to spend a fair amount of time reading books on mathematics. A handful that I recommend are: Darrell Huff's _How to Lie With Statistics_ (1954); David Salsburg's _The Lady Tasting Tea_ (2001); Simon Singh's _The Code Book_ (1999); Robert Osserman's _Poetry of the Universe_ (1995); Reuben Hersh's _What is Mathematics, Really?_ (1997); Bryan Bunch's _The Kingdom of Infinite Number_ (2000); James Gleick's _Chaos: Making a New Science_ (1987); and Douglas R. Hofstater's _Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_ (1979). The last is fairly stiff reading. But it is beautifully written; and if you read only a fraction of it, your perception of the world is likely to change.All of which brings us to a Victorian gentleman who gave some attention to the nature of and the limits of our perceptions of the world. Edwin A. Abbott (1836--1926) was a Shakespearean scholar who also took honors in mathematics and theology. In 1884, he published a mathematical fantasy called _Flatland_. It is set largely in a two-dimensional world, populated by sentient lines and shapes. Most denizens appear as lines to one another, though the relative faintness of lines gives a clue to the nature of different shapes. There is a class system built on the relative complexity of shapes: women (Straight Lines), workers and laborers (Isosceles Triangles), the middle class (Equilateral Triangles), professional men and gentlemen (Squares and Pentagons), and the nobility (Hexagons and Many-sided Figures). There is some movement from class to class, but \\"a woman is always a woman\\". The houses are also two-dimensional, mostly pentagonal in shape. There is a kind of gravitational pull to the south so that the base of various shapes turn toward the south and their apex angles toward the north. The narrator, \\"A. Square,\\" has accepted his world at face value. But one day, he encounters a shape that _seems_ to be circular but who _says_ that it is a sphere... And nothing is ever quite the same._Flatland_ quickly became a classic. Several sequels and companion stories to the novel were written over the years by other hands, but one of the best is that of Dionys Burger, a Dutch physicist. It was originally published in 1957 as _Bolland_ and was translated as _Sphereland_ in 1965. Burger's novel relates how the natives of Flatland discover that their land is really curved. They then discover the Einsteinian properties that it contains. Burger relates how triangles can become greater than 180 degrees, how mongrel dogs can become pedegreed through three-dimensional trickery, how a brave Line explorer defied the courts to reveal new truths about the nature of space, and what geometric fairy tales can reveal about the nature of the world.I hear the dry thunder of voices of the Mathematically Challenged rolling across the Waste Land: \\"We could _never_ understand!\\" And I say unto you: \\"Oh, yes you can.\\" You don't need advanced training in math to grasp the concepts-- and they are presented in a painless, charming, and entertaining manner. So read these books and be refreshed by the rain.Burger's book modernizes _Flatland's_ portrayal of women (Straight Lines). Here is Abbot's treatment in his novel:Nor must it be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute of affection. But unfortunately the passion of the moment predominates, in the Frail Sex, over every other consideration. This is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation. For as they have no pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently wholly devoid of brainpower, and have neither reflection, judgement nor forethought, and hardly any memory. (15)In a foreward to the novel, Isaac Asimov asserts that Abbott \\"may have participated in these now-antiquated social views\\" (ix). Perhaps. But I think that Asimov misses an ironic bite in this passage. I suspect that Abbott was less blinded by the prejudices of his day than his narrator, A. Square. In Burger's book, women still are the bottom social class. But they are better educated, more responsible, and less hysterically emotional. The social classes in Burger's novel (which takes place some time after the action in _Flatland_) have become a bit more fluid.I hesitate to recommend a book because it is good for other people. That sort of praise is the kiss of death as far as most readers are concerned. But sometimes you just can't avoid mentioning that characteristic. These two fantasies are good for you. But they are also great fun.

After The Fire is an insidious portrait of addiction and its terrible costs, hard-hitting to the core, and each page further draws the reader into the experience.

He also does a wonderful job of describing his spriitual journey in the process. How good for our children to read about Christian men who are also highly educated scientists and adventurers.My Bottom Line: This book will be a really great, short read for adventurous boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 14, and adults of any age. My daughter, at age 12 was required to read it but got a little snotty about the content -- she's more princess then space explorer.

My five year old didn't much care, but my 10, 12 and nearly 14 year olds absolutely loved the book. The nearly 7 year old was intrigued as well, particularly loving the gorgeous photos.This autobiographical book was well-written, and compelling. Getting into the head of someone who actually walked on the moon was pretty incredible, even for me -- and I've never been particularly fascinated by all that space stuff.I highly, highly recommend this book.

This one is a marked improvement over the others plotwise."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Despite the fact that this was only the third book I read in this series I had no problem following the plot or characters. Anita Blake, Necromancer and Executioner is a kick butt kind of girl with tough guy attitude. The author manages to deliver a heroine who can compete with the guys, yet she is still all female.Anita is a gal with lots on her mind. She is called to a murder scene which could better be described as a mobile butcher shop and yet the cops who are requesting her help (as a paranormal expert) aren't that friendly to her. It seems that they have issues with how she aquired her expertise. Namely by hanging out with all the dead guys and shape shifters. Her dialogue and banter with the law enforcement types is very well done. You can almost smell the pepper spray.Anita is also trying to fend off some very old and powerful vampires with prior claims to Anita's significant vampire, Jean-Claude. These vampires are pushy and have no manners at all. They need a firm-handed approach that Anita is very willing to provide if she can just do so without getting herself killed or enslaved. She doesn't like vampire politics but she has a knack for leadership and manages to attract many useful allies.Anita is trying to manage these disasters while juggling her very complicated love life (read that sex-life) with two undead lovers and a shape-shifter, not to mention at least three other contenders. If you don't like erotic then you should definitely stay out of the kitchen because it's hot in there. The steam does fuel the plot and the story would not be the same without it.I did get a little tired of Anita's constant worrying and arguing with vulnerable non-humans about her rules and morality. All her lovers have to follow her rules and she is no good at compromise. Not only is that unfair but emotionally she does not really agree with the rules that she is forcing on herself and her loved ones. She is so slow with her decisions about her love life that sometimes the damage is done before she manages to get it right. If she had that kind of hesitation and confusion with her gun she would be dead and buried instead of getting the drop on her opponents. In other matters she is very practical and level headed.All in all this was a very entertaining read.

So, I approached reading this book with trepidation. So, first off - I liked it much better than Narcissus in Chains, which beat even Bloody Bones for the not-so-coveted \\"worst Anita Blake novel ever\\" award.Cerulean has an actual murder mystery that runs alongside Hamilton's continuing (and confusing) vampire politics plot that hasn't slowed down in ages (and in my opinion needs a serious breather). The RPIT return, Larry is mentioned (where did he go for so long?), and gosh, we even have Anita in the thick of said investigation, helping solve it. Who'd've thunk? It was good to see the same sort of book I'd loved near the beginning of the tale.That was the good stuff.The bad stuff is the continuing use of ardeur to make Anita sleep with everyone and everything that moves, including public metaphysical sex to a large audience of Musette/Belle Morte vampire contingency, and her having threesomes and so forth. This is getting old, fast.All that said, the side-characters got a lot more interesting in this tale, Richard had a turning point (and it's not further into Idiot/Moron/Angry/Jerk territory), and I'm very curious to see where Hamilton is taking Dolph.

And if I wanted just [[physcial activity], I wouldn't be paying [money] for Anita books.The big threat of the story is not convinsing at all. Just not scary. And almost doesn't do anything.Jean-Claude became a boy scout!! Toothless, No evil plotting, no nothing. In general - \\"All Anita Wants Anita Gets\\", and \\"I Won't Do It Because You[Anita] Would Be Upset\\"!!!! IN EVERY SITUATION!Discussion of the 4 mark - ten lines! No real discussion at all.Story line with the Were-Pards - almost non existant.Basically - She should have worked on the book for at least 6 more months.

Some of The characters have taken on new life, and I could easily see them having stories of their own in the future.

This book was a little disapointing in the fact that it ended quickly and suddenly leaving us with little to no epilogue. THere was an intersting developement with Jason however that made the price of the book very worthwhile. Also Anita is finally realizing that Richard is going to get himself and others killed. The best line was, &quot;I wondered how long it would be until I began to hate him.&quot; I already Hate Richard and was glad to see that he seems to be fazing out.

Fans will breath a sigh of relief as a few mysteries become clearer. Asher and Jean Claude are now even more embedded in Anita's life. Jason figures prominently as well, though we don't see too much of the other support characters like Rafael, Micah, Caleb, Cherry et al. Anita is faced with another threat as Musette comes embodying the force of Belle Morte. She, Jean-Claude and Asher (an entourage) must depend on their sexual/political maneuvering to outwit this new threat to their happy coven, as well as still fight crime with the RPIT, and fend off disgruntled Dolf. The same dominating theme of friction between Richard and Anita exists, but once again it is pushed to the side as Asher steps into Anita's life for good: front and center. I loved the book and recommend it to all die-hard Anita fans. Laurell has returned Anita back into her executioner ways, levied her eroticism with Jean-Claude, Asher and Jason, and has her developing her necromancer powers. We even have the hint of something \\"wicked this way comes\\" and the introduction to 2 new vamps- It is clear that CS has more balance to it than previous books, but this does not deter in anyway to the plot or characters-but rather enhances the \\"Anita experience.\\" A great read!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book was incredible. I started at 3pm and finished at 4am. I think I strained my eyes trying to read it in one setting. I was so mad when I finished because I will have to wait another year for the next one. Anita Blake was, as usual, as funny and vicious as can be. I laughed, and on one scene I even cried. For a while, I thought that Richard was the best for Anita, however, after reading this book, I find that I must reconsider. I will not disclose why, but for all those people out there who were die-hard Richard fans, be prepared to be very angry with him. I had but one problem with the book, and that was that the ending seemed hurried. Mrs. Hamilton should have added an additional 20 pages to the book to give it the smooth finish her work usually contains. Aside from that, I am completely satisfied with this masterpiece.Warning: Lots of sex and moral decay.

Cerulean Sins starts with a particular plotline (which begins on the very first page)and then does not procede to follow that plotline. It completely disappears until the last two pages or so of the book and then only to brush it aside, in what seems like a ploy to explain away a failed plotline. It is almost as if the author started with one idea, got bored, and changed to a different idea. Do not get me wrong, I did enjoy the book, and was terribly happy to see many of the things I have waited for come about ( I won't say what, that'd spoil them). There was also the small matter of the fact that much of this book bordered on soft literary porn. Some sex is fine, but this is a little much. Anita was boffing someone new every five pages, it seemed. I felt the plotline suffered. I miss all the blow-up fights in which Anita kicked ... and gained funky new powers. There were some, but they just didn't have the old kick. I miss a lot of the old characters too. Larry was there peripherally, Gtephen and Gregory poked their heads in, but their storyline was kind of brushed off, her boss and her job were their in the beginning and then disappeared. Lets get a little of Anita's non-vampire life into the picture next time. Nonetheless, it was enjoyable, and I look forward to the next one. Here's hoping for a little appearance by Edward!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"whew!!! this book saved the series from the flaming downward spiral that was Narcissus in Chains. still too much focus on the sex and not the story for my tastes, but i've been told by other fans that they consider the books romance/horror crossover. still, loved this one. four out of five because nothing has equalled Blue Moon (imo)."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I'm leaving my original review intact(see paragraph below)because it makes sense only if you've read the book. My only excuse is that I wrote it right after finishing the book and I'd been up all night. That being said, my recommendation is that you read all the books in this series first. All of these books can be read by themselves, but a lot of the storylines and characters stop and start between books. This book makes more sense and you get a better feel for the story if you do that. Now, why should you read this story? Because it's a great read with characters you can care about/hate/love/root for. This is Dark Fantasy/Erotica/Horror, depends on how you see the story. Yes, it's about vampires, wereanimals, zombies, and other stuff, but done so well and differently that it is all new. Try it.Great story, great sex. I'm sorry for Richard, but hey, he had his chance. Some of the other reviewers have stated that the sex is overtaking the storylines, not so. What this is doing is giving us reasons why humans 'go over'. Jean-Claude develops new powers, so does Asher. I really like Micah, he is probably one of the better characters in the whole series. He does what needs to be done, no whining. This book sets up possible storylines; Mother of Darkness, baby vampires, Belle Morte (again-Anita needs to be able to get this broad), Richard's choice for lupa, and more cooperation among the shape shifters. Good, fast, tight read. Here's a question--since Sylvie has lost her challenge, is she still number 2 in the pack and if not, can she become Richard's lupa? I like Sylvie's character and she has what it takes to be tough, without hurting the pack. Also, Asher has a new power so why can't he also get an animal to call--how about Christine (weretiger), she was briefly in NARCISSUS IN CHAINS and another book I can't remember just now. If Ms. Hamilton is waking the Mother of Darkness, Anita is going to need all the help she can get, and Asher needs someone just for him, no sharing."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"On most good days I consider myself a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton. I have read and re-read the Anita Blake Series, along with ear-marking favorite pages and gobbling up copies of the series that I find in used book stores to give as \\"gifts\\" to friends. I am also a member of the Fan Club. So, it is with much disappointment that I confess that this is not a good day and that this is not one of Ms. Hamilton's better offerings.The plot goes every which way it possibly can, from vampire politics, to relationship dilemmas, to Dolph's psychological break-down, to the serial killer murders, to the mysterious FBI guys. Personally, I find the most enjoyable moments to be those that concentrate on the police matters as well as Anita's zombie raising and necromancy. But then, I'm not the writer.Throughout the book, I found myself increasingly frustrated by all the emotional BAGGAGE that so many of the characters bring with them. From Anita's emotional distance and lack of commitment to Asher's fear of rejection to Richard's loathing of his beast, to Dolph's disgust and devastation over his son's marriage, to Gregory and Stephen's horrific past... I just want to say ENOUGH. I've been dealing with Richard's emotional turmoil for 4 BOOKS! Burnt Offerings, Blue Moon, Narcissus in Chains and now Cerulean Sins. Get over it already!I would recommend that people wait for these books to come out on paperback, but then if you are at all like I am, you have a hard time waiting that long. Oh, well. I guess it's time to wait for the next one and keep hoping for a tighter plot."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"First, I have to express what a huge fan I am of Laurell K. Hamilton. I wait impatiently for the next installment. So, please take this into consideration of what I am about to say.Cerulean Sins is an excellent fiction read. It doesn't offer the meaning of life or the cure for cancer. However, it offers the reader a ride through a world full of colorful characters.Yes, there is more sex and violence, but one has to consider that Anita Blake is falling deeper and deeper into a world completely ruled by magic and non-human elements. If you wish to revisit the 'old' Anita, then I suggest you reread the first books.Hamilton has allowed her character to grow, perhaps in ways we don't all agree, but grown nonetheless. When there are so many cookie cutter series, Hamilton tries to give the reader new and inventive plots each time. This current installment focuses on the vampire element in Anita's life. Something we have missed for awhile. Also, a greater force (scary, too) starts to raise it's head. Without revealing any of the plot, I would consider this story one that should be read by those interested in strong women, mystery, and the paranormal.I consider my time reading an investment, and I will always invest in Ms. Hamilton...no matter what road she decides to take us down."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Actuall,I would give this book 41/2 stars if the ratings would allow. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars would be Edward. I wish in the next book that they are teamed together and he has to come to terms with her increasing num. of men that are in her group. Musette was fantastic and wierd as usual the two small children vampires Valentina and Bartolome could be valuable assets to Anita and Jean-Claud in future books when the Vampire Council comes into town. I'm really unhappy about Richard I hope that he can come to terms with all his issues and once more become part of the tri. But I'm reall glad that Jason finally got a major part in this story he is also one of my favorites. I also hope that Dolph can learn to accept Anits's new lifestyle or they will always be at odds. Good book, read and enjoy you will be glad that you did. I just hope that she hurries up with the next book. I can't wait."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"CS so far is very different from most Anita Blake books. It takes a little bit of the heighten sex appeal from NiC, and focus on relationships while trying to include the mysteries of old and a new sense of maturity in the characters behavior. Before all the men in Anita's life would take her limitations without a second thought and now they rebel against her and make her question everything in her life--and its about time! Some of the plot is run over a bit too fast, but overall I like the new maturity in the relationships and the continuing search for Anita to be able to be at peace with her life. It reminds us of our own struggles, but in a more interesting way with the complications of supernatural creatures and forces. These books never seem to stop entertaining and enthralling me and I'm sick of people complaining about the sex because it is the most well done and most meaningful sex I've read."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I will not spend time telling you what is going on in this book. All I want to do is be able to speak out and let the &quot;human&quot; population know that Laurell K. Hamilton is one phenomenal writer who knows how to grab your attention and keep it from the front cover all the way through to the back cover. I have been lending the entire series out to all of my friends, none of us could wait for the 11th book &quot;Cerulean Sins&quot; to come out. Well, now that it has and we have read it, I honestly don't know how we will all wait till book 12 comes around! I have never taken the time or effort to RE-read a series before, but I had to start over at book ONE and go all the way through again, just to take up the slack time between books.

This book has all the complexity of her moral challenges along with her personal hang-ups on sex and relationships. There is plenty of vampire action and interaction along with some werewolf interaction although not as much of the werewolves as in other books. It has the mystery that is not solved until the very end. Ms. Hamilton has done an outstanding job with this installment of Anita. Her characters are full blown people with all of their own quirks. She intersperes humor throughout to lighten Anita's otherwise intense life. This book actually takes a couple of readings to begin to fully understand it. The first is to enjoy the story and the second is to understand all of the details in it. Every line adds to the story. I loved it. I recommend reading all of the other books first to fully understand this one as each character becomes better known in previous books."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book was really good.

I finished it in one sitting and can't wait for more."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"When the Anita Blake series first started it was excellent! Anita Blake was, in my opinion, the most fascinating female character in modern fantasy or adventure fiction. The idea of a woman character, a petite woman at that, being so formidable that super human monsters were frightened enough of her to call her The Executioner was just so durn cool! I use to really look forward to these books, but that was then; this is now. Instead of remaining an impressive heroine Blake has become, to be brutally frank, just a (...) for monsters. Slowly, but surely these book have gone from being dynamite adventure/horror fiction to becoming nothing more then weird porn of which Cerulean Sins is the worst so far. Ms. Hamilton is so focused on describing in intimate detail Anita's sexual escapades that everything else has become insignificant. I don't know why Ms. Hamilton took this tact with such a wonderful character and no longer care because Cerulean Sins is so bad it convinced me that Anita Blake, and the series as a whole, is completely irredeemable as anything interesting."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been an avid fan of the Laurell K books (Anita Blake books, anyway) since someone handed me a copy of Guilty Pleasures about 6 years ago). Loved her premise, loved the idea, thought the books a little rife with hyperbole, but loads of fun for all that.I had felt, and this feeling is apparently echoed by a number of readers, that the books lost momentum about mid way through the series (although the book that marks the downturn varies from fan to fan). For me, the books descended into the realm of glittering sexual antics wrapped in leather and smelling of gunsmoke around the Blue Moon stage. Blue Moon was great - but Burnt Offerings was pretty much in sync with its title. Obsidian Butterfly was good in its sheer difference, and Narcissus in Chains was a romp, but one got the feeling that it was a)rushed b)an offering to fans that might have been getting a little too demanding c) relied less on cohesive narrative and more on resolving character issues that were dragging on far too long (eg Richard and Anita's on again-off again-in again-out again-gone again Finnegan relationship - oh the pain of it all). It is important to state, however, that I don't read Laurell K to expand my mind, but to curl up and enjoy myself - and on that level, all her books work to varying degrees.I feel however (yes, I'm finally getting to it) that Cerulean sins marks a tentative up point - where she seems to have settled in to new developments, and maybe new ways to handle these developments, and is gathering steam oncemore. I've read the first chapter of Incubus Dreams - and its looks promising!! And although most of us would like to (at times) slap Anita upside the head with a \\"Please, get OVER yourself\\" - its not enough to make me stop readingHere's to hoping!!Bex"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I will admit that Hamilton has gone into overload a bit with some of her sex and violence, but Im still so entertained by it all. My main complaint with this book is that none of the plots are completed in a way that I felt truly satisfied..the way that the plot with Musette was resolved left me so disappointed..it was too easy! What I really want more of is Asher..I can say that I ALMOST like him more than Jean Claude..I also really enjoyed delving deeper into Jason..hes been one of my faves for so long..it was fun to have so much of him here...all in all another entertaining read.."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"'Cerulean Sins' is the eleventh book in Laurell K. Hamilton's series about Anita Blake and her vampire and shapeshifter universe. I really enjoyed the other novels, but 'Cerulean Sins' just seems to be lacking...something. There is much going on in this book-- Belle Morte, mother of Jean-Claude, threatens to wreak havoc upon the St. Louis vampires, which Anita deals with in between investigating a grisly series of murders, AND coping with her ever-rampagnt ardeur (always an interesting subject to read about), all the while catching the interest of an international terrorist.Oh, and making a few more lovers out of her vampire/shapeshifter friends, of course.So why did I feel vaguely unsatisfied when I finished reading? The conclusion just seemed a little too rushed and unpolished. Everything was wrapped up in an amazingly small amount of pages, which almost lead me to believe it would end with a -to be continued- , but no such luck. Seemingly important characters were introduced and then dropped. Some very important plotissues were even brushed aside and forgotten, leaving only an amazingly idyllic last chapter. How can there possibly be a semblence of peace and tranquility in Anita's life, when there are still so many bad guys still lurking in the shadows?I just hope that everything will be neatly explained and squaredaway in the next book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurell Hamilton is an excellent writer, so it's depressing that such talent is going to waste. The last two or three books have focused almost exclusively on sex. Sex, sex, and more sex. STOP IT! Laurell Hamilton seriously needs to get back to what attracted most of us to her books in the first place; a strong female character blasting the bad guys' heads off. Please, Ms. Hamilton, go back to writing about Anita as a detective and executioner, not a porno star."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"For those fans of Ms. Hamilton, it will be hard to believe but Cerulean Sins is actual better than her last entry in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter Series. Sadly, it's only better by a hair due to a slightly more cogent plot even if that plot is pale rehash of Burnt Offerings. As well, it looks like an editor actually worked on CS because the typos and grammatical mistakes do not leap off the page in this latest offering.Even sadder is that fact that what made NiC so horrid is still laced throughout the book. Numerous sexual encounters that push this book so far past erotic romance that it misses erotica altogether and goes straight to porn. Possibly this is due to the complete lack of romance between the characters or more probably because the sex is more often than not something you'd see in an video tape from the back room of a seedy adult book store.Gratefully none of these encounters are with Micah, the latest of Anita's significant others. In point of fact, there is a pleasing absence of abnormal genitals describe, thank goodness. Ms. Hamilton seems to have gone to great efforts to restrain herself in that respect.In summary, those expecting a miracle in the form of Ms. Hamilton writing returning to it's more creative origins after reading Narcissus Chains will be disappointed. Those readers who loved Ms. Hamilton's last book will be pleased."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This, the eleventh book in the Anita Blake series has all the Hamilton trademarks--sex, action, humor, and a growing mythos. Unfortunately, \\"Cerulean Sins\\" spends too much time on sex and too little on plot development.The Anita Blake series started out as a mixed genre paranormal fantasy-mystery series, with the romance, and later the sex, thrown in for good measure. Anita was basically a good Catholic girl who happened to be a licensed vampire execution--she killed monsters, she didn't date them. However, as the story arc has evolved, Anita has changed. She has learned that between black and white there are many shades of gray, and that the monsters are not always furry or fanged. Indeed, as a powerful necromancer, she herself is a monster in many people's eyes. As she becomes more and more powerful, she must constantly deal with new powers and new definitions of what she is, who her friends are, and where her duties lie.In \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" Anita finds herself still in the throws of the ardeur and bedding nearly everyone in sight. She participates in a menage a trois (Asher, not Richard). All of this goes on, of course, in the midst of yet another set of crises. Vampire politics, international terrorists, and lycanthropic serial killers must all be dealt with while she stumbles through her personal life doing things that the Anita Blake of the first books would never have done. Unfortunately, the plot gets short shrift in between the sex scenes.There are a few brief portions of the book that rise above gore and heavy breathing, as Anita finally begins to get some insight into her psychology. What she sees has an impact on her relationships with her friends, lovers, and pack. I'm hoping that the next book, \\"Incubus Dreams, \\" builds on this, although the buzz says that it probably won't.Overall, \\"Cerulean Sins ' was a weak addition to the series. It's overlong and self-indulgent on Hamilton's part. The book should have been more tightly edited. More emphasis on the story line would have improved the book (how DOES this woman earn a living if all her time is spent on were and vampire politics and on the ardeur?) The sex scenes were overdone and the last half of the book seemed rushed. If you've read one ardeur scene, you've read them all. I'm hoping that in the next book Hamilton can get the series back on track. Anita and her friends are too interesting to let them wither away.Addendum: Alas, sex continues to sell and Hamilton's new book, \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" dishes out more of the same. I had hoped that her fans'disappointed reactions to \\"Cerulean Sins\\" might make a difference. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case, although at least Anita does a little work to pay the rent."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Okay. Anita Blake has undergone some serious changes since Guilty Pleasures. She still has the same humor as before and she still deals with things that go bump in the night, but now she happens to love and care for some of those things....Okay, many of those things. =]The subject of the supernatural is basically what made Hamilton's previous books so enticing for me. I'll agree that now I do miss the added mystery that has slowly started to leak away from the plots, but what I've read in this book makes up for that by far.The view of the vampire world is broadened a little in this installment, as a few of Belle Morte's line drop in for a visit and force some pretty interesting changes for Anita, as well as revealing something about Jean-Claude that is just downright surprising. Add that to the fact that I'm waiting for Anita to pick the person she's really going to love, this book was very fascinating. Also, there is some major foreshadowing in this book, and it's sort of like Anita is unconsciously gathering her troops and power for some big showdown with &quot;Mommy Dearest,&quot; a very dark and scary vamp that's been sleeping for years. It's almost as if Hamilton is promising some sort of war among the non-human creatures, and this vampire's awakening is the starting point.By the way, another candidate has dropped into the running for Blake's love again, one that I find is most interesting. I, personally, am not annoyed by the fact that Anita has so many lovers now. In fact, I think that many of them are attracted mainly to the power she holds, and will continue to stay in her life if she rejects them because they want to be close to it. And after, she won't be so promiscuous (or I predict she won't). So, for those of you that have recently been unsatisfied with Anita Blake, take some time off from reading and don't be so uptight. She's still there."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I bought this book not so much because I was looking forward to it, but more because I can't stand to own an unfinished series. There is a small bit of story, a plot you might even say about a gang of Edward like bad guys who appear, then are forgotten because Hamilton spends the next 150 pages throwing Anita from one disjointed love scene to the next (although I have to admit Jason's \\"take one for the team\\" was kind of funny, not sexy, just funny). After everything has been resolved with the Vampires and Anita has two new guys to have sex with, the bad guys come back and you learn a little bit more about these \\"black ops\\" groups that Anita's world touches. This is why the book gets 2 stars instead of 1.The story has numerous inconsistency errors with the previous novels (ages of vampires, characterization problems), and several notable errors with tense, spelling, grammar, that her editor should have caught. Although at this point I do not think anyone is actively editing her books. One thing that has bugged me is that if you are going to have your characters engage in actions that they (the character) perceive as morally wrong, either stop it or get over it. The guilt thing is not only unconvincing (it is applied inconsistently), it is damn annoying. At least the Meredith series is sex without guilt. Although, it looks a lot like Hamilton trying to re-write Anita without the moral code. (Even the dialog is similar.) The only difference between Meredith and Anita is hair colour, and one is descended from 6 (or was it 7?) fertility gods and goddesses, and the other is descended from farmers and as Anita put it in this book \\"peasant stock\\".Now to give you a little background, my friend knows Hamilton. He was the one who gave me the first Anita novel, and his roommate was in Hamilton's wedding. If anyone was wondering why a plot driven series would suddenly turn into an exploration into graphic sex, then the answer is she got married. Now several years into it, it seems that the effects are permanent. If she wants to write the be-all and end-all novel on erotic S&M; D&S; she is a little late. If you are looking for a novel on alternative or gay erotica, look elsewhere. This book is not it. If you can't stand to not have all the books in a series buy it, it is the only reason I can think of to get this book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I don't know if I will read any more of her books. I definitly will not plunk out my hard earned money for one.CS is better than NiC (how could it not be) but no where near the quality or caliber of her earlier books...too many men (get real please-it's repulsive to me, and unrealistic) I read these books for entertainment but lately I am torn between disgust and disbelief. While I know the books aren't real, it's nice to get lost in the world while I am reading, but the books aren't realistic enough for that any more.For those who hate Micah like I do, Anita is still waiting for the other shoe to drop. maybe the kitty will find a wereleopard in heat and she finds them together and BANG! He is in the book, not much, thank God. But far too much for me.I miss Edward. I miss the honest to God real police mysteries, you know with a real, serious villian. The crime scenes which used to be what the books revolved around, are scattered, not really part of the book, just more like background scenery.As always, she harps too much on RAZ 'values' and Anita's disgust with them, even though they no longer really seem part of RAZ. More like she's throwing it in for consistency, enver mind that it's reading like bull. And here's a fact, I can relate to RAZ, his disgust and pain at what's hes been forced into. But by sticking to his morals, other people got hurt. Repeatedly. And good men which RAZ is, do not allow other people to get hurt for their mistakes. Yet another inconsistency.Sorry folks, but the books ..., especially when compared to TKD or BO or COTD.AND LKH...how could you cut Richard's hair!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've read this series from book 1 (Guilty Pleasures) and have loved each book. Anita has become such a complex character and her supporting cast members are enigmatic and beautifully created. Yes, the books are much different than they were in the first few installments, but I don't believe that to be a bad thing.Cerulean Sins carries on with a character introduced in the previous book (Narcissus in Chains). This character is Belle Morte, the vampire who turned Anita's boyfriend, Jean Claude, into a vampire. She also created Asher, Jean Claude's second in command. Both men are former lovers of Belle Morte. She is insulted (to put it mildly) that both Jean Claude and Asher chose to leave her, as she considers herself the most desirable woman/vampire in the world. Thus, she sends her second in command vampire to \\"visit\\" Jean Claude's territory. The troubles that this visit causes are the central plot in the story (and there's definitely a couple surprises). There is also a sub-plot involving a series of murders that Anita helps to solve.Some readers of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter books believe the series has gone downhill since Anita began engaging in sex with multiple partners as a result of a condition passed on to her from Jean Claude. This condition (called the arduer) causes the person to experience intense sexual desire until \\"fed\\". I don't believe this is a problem in the books, or just an excuse for Anita to have sex. I think this condition represents the only thing Anita has found that she can't yet control or kill. It's something she has to face head-on and must be patient with until she learns control. In the books leading up to Narcissus in Chains, where Anita first learns she has the arduer, there are references to her reliance on guns to control situations. I think the arduer is to teach Anita that guns won't solve all her problems. Plus, she's not having sex with random people on the streets and, considering the length of the book, I didn't feel there were too many sex scenes in this book. I never felt like I wanted to just get past the sex and get on to the plot, as I do with some books.I think the Anita Blake series is still going strong and Laurell K. Hamilton continues to add new elements of surprise."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"hamilton's still one of the very few authors who can keep my attention throughout the novel--i mostly have to force myself to read for many books. her writing style makes the novels interesting, but damn, can you say \\"gratuitous sex?\\"...-- i miss the days of anita going to a showing of \\"guys and dolls\\" with him, and do NOT enjoy reading about every single sexual encounter (and there are quite a few, in the interest of quenching the ardeur).in hamilton's other novels, a kiss of shadows and a carress of twilight, the sex plot is thinly veiled-- no, not even veiled, as the entire premise focuses on getting Merry pregnant. she seems to have developed a similar plot mechanism here, and while the concept was nice for plot development, it seemed to have been at the expense of a plot.everything was shortchanged, every possible interesting plot development-notably the vampire banquet, for me. whereas the banquet was damn near the entire book in burnt offerings, it was given little screen time here.i didn't like gregory and stephen's father being treated as a sub-plot--perhaps she intend to further develop it in the next one, in which case i forgive it.i wish she wouldn't write for her widespread popularity-- namely, i wish she'd stop with the sex on every single page and get down to the witty banter and suspense of the early days. anita seems to have attained a status of invincibility, which makes the suspense factor nil. while i liked that the line between good and bad was blurry in the earlier ones, right now it seems anita and her crew are always good, always right, and thus will always win."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am a huge fan of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series. Until this book, I had been very satisfied with Ms.Hamilton's work.When the book started out, I thought that it had the potential to be as good as the others and a an exellent follow up to Narcissus in Chains. However, I discovered otherwise. This book turned out to be just a bunch of unexplored ideas.In Cerulean Sins, Anita Blake comes face to face with some of her most formidable enemies. Belle Morte, the sourdre de sang of Jean-Claude's line, is coming to St. Louis. Well, Belle isn't coming but Musette (one of her favorite pet vampires) is coming and acting as Belle's surrogate.In addition to the trouble that Belle's visit causes, Anita's complex love life isn't getting any easier. Especially since she and Asher have explored their sexual potential...Richard is still struggling to accept who and what he is and this weakens the power of the triumverate( A triumverate of power forged by Anita, Jean-Claude, and Richard.)In regards to Anita's love life there is too much sex and very little plot. However, a positive is that Jason gives some surprisingly relevent observations while he is psycho analyzing Anita. Jason is finally growing up.In order to add to the chaos, Anita has mysterious stalkers who follow her in her car and finds that they may be connected to acts of terrorism.While Belle Morte tries to \\"own\\" Anita, Anita recieves an unexpected encounter with the Mother of all Darkness which can't lead to anything good...Over all, this book had lots of potential but each plot went un explored and took a back seat to the sex. Also, Ms. Hamilton seems to have a desire to destroy the mental well being of her characters (i.e. Richard, Dolph.)This proves to be very irritating to the reader. The villains, rather than menacing were annoying.I hope to see better things from Ms. Hamilton than the lack of depth she has shown us here. Still a mustread for die hard Anita fans, anyone else would be best advised to avoid this book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I feel I have to rate this book average because it is true what people have been saying. LKH has turned her once supernatural-action filled books into...well to put it bluntly, porn.I continued reading though hoping that maybe she would add action in there but saddly, it never happened. This of course is not my choice but it the author, LKH's, choice. But after reading other reviews I think she should have asked more opinions of the book before publishing.Unlike some, I will continue reading and buying this seris simply because I am, addicted, I need to see wether or not Anita can fix up her love life, what happens with her job, Edward, and so many other things that if LKH decicies to end the seris she might have trouble finding ways to end it.I give her my best wishes and hope for a better next book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"At first I hated this book. I thought it was just like the last one, only Anita was willing to sleep with more guys. I know many fans that have followed this series feel that there is a little too much gratuitous sex. I was one of them.I started by re-reading all of the books starting with Guilty Pleasures and working my way up chronologically. I did this in 4 days, and let me tell you the character progression is there when you do it this way. Once Anita started sleeping with JC, this was a natural, it just gets lost when you have not currently read them all sequentially.The biggest problem I have is the lost characters that I loved. Edgar, Manny, the cast of animators. This book at least brought Dolph back in, but it has really been awhile since we had this much Zerboski and Dolph.What I have come to realize is that LKH has given such wonderful secondary characters that we have come to love an rely on, that is it hard to accept new characters because they take up plot development time, and it seems to take away from the characters we are used to. The books are becoming very \\"character heavy\\", but it is an ongoing series.I would recomend this book, but not as a starter, I would only read this series in order, or you will lose alot of it, and think that Anita is pretty trampy.If you like erotica, you will like this book by itself as well as Narcissus in Chains. Keep in mind that it is otherworldly erotica.I am very glad for the development that will keep Asher in the series as a primary character. Richard needs to grow up or go, I am sick of his histrionics. Go Jason!!! Loved what he said to Anita.I am giving this 4 stars instead of the 2-3 I originally planned because I did find the reason behind Anita's sleeping around, and it did seem to make sense. Again I highly recommend reading all of the books from start to finish if you were disapointed with this one. Good luck.If you are looking for a great vampire series, i would suggest Charlain Harris \\"Dead\\" series. They are wonderful. Kind of Stephanie Plum meets Anita."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers the sex scenes didn't bother me. I also didn't mind the psycho analyzing that went on through out the whole book. It was a chance to see the characters evolving (altho' there might have been a way to do it that wasn't so boring, I got a little tired of the same wish washy dialogue). The most glaring mistake was the lack of a real plot. It did seem like that the international terrorists were just thrown in there b/c the big, bad vampires weren't really enough to keep the reader engaged. Big surprise, but neither were the terrorists. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me to even have had them in there.The resolution with the vampires was just a little too easy. I would have to agree with other readers that there isn't a whole lot of danger for Anita Blake and her loved ones. I almost hate to say it, but it might be time to kill off a few characters (secondary or otherwise). It's hard to feel any suspense or dread when you aren't really afraid for the characters.I definitely wouldn't skip this book since so much happens in the relationships between the characters, however I would advise you not to get your hopes up. Cerulean Sins wasn't that bad but it wasn't that good either.Personally, I think it's a toss up between which one was worse: CS or NIC...altho' at least CS I got to see developments between the characters that I'd been waiting for.IMHO, any LKH is better than none, but this isn't the best."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Unlike all the previous books of the series, this one was not unputdownable. In fact I found myself putting it down after every couple of pages. And then picking it up again a few minutes later.I still do not quite understand it but I have a sense of unfulfillment. There's a just great big *something* missing. Anita does spend more time in bed - but we saw that coming in &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot;. She faced, and faced down, more bad guys and even had a very well written and serendipitous escape from the spooks. Ms Hamilton set the stage for future encounters with bigger and badder bad guys, which is a constant challenge for a writer.But still, I was disappointed and vaguely unsatisfied. All in all, it's still worth buying and reading - but not anything to be proud of. I suspect Anita is not the only one needing a long vacation"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"It's easy to be picky when I didn't have to do the work of writing but....This was not the best, or as good as I had hoped. I do think it has introduced more characters and that perhaps the next book will be great. I was left feeling a sort of wait for it. The last few pages were a really frantic wrap up, as if it needed to be finished NOW. There are characters from previous books I would like to see revisited, like Otto from Butterfly. I thought the plot was thin, and if there must be so much sex it was not as well done as in Narcissus. But it was nice to see Jason and Asher in more detail. Anita's suffering is getting tiresome. Her always saying 'Sorry I didn't know', stopping to argue over morals when the plot needs to move on or dawn is coming.Let Richard do all that kind of stuff, that's his character.I'll continue to buy, but I won't rush for a hard back again."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Having finished the entire 10 book in the series weeks before this 11th book debuted, I could not wait for it to get here. Though I am glad I have read it, and I did find it better than the last book (NiC), I have to agree with others who have said that this book seemed chopped up and not to flow well, and end too quickly with everything unbelievably, and shortly resolved in the end. I have read elsewhere that the publishers cut out hundreds of pages - the story shows it. I also thought this book was going to give readers a lot of info on JC and Asher, I found not much new. It was a good read, enough to make me curious about the next installment, but not the best, and not what I was used to in the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The plot is rehashed with the Vampire Council (in the form of Belle Morte and her entourage) coming to threaten Anita Blake and Company.The serial killer is laughablly close to Anita (as always) and quickly discovered and dealt with by her. The main plot fizzles off as no harm comes to anyone.Hamilton leads into a surprise, but as it goes it isn't that great...maybe it will be in a book or two.Less sex and no romance. The entire book left me wanting and wondering why I continue to read the Anita Blake Series when the Merry Gentry Series is so much better.I am a long time Anita Blake and LKH fan...and I am becoming disillusioned with the plots, characters and writing style..."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Although I am a great fan of Laurell K Hamilton, this last book in this series was a disappointment to me. There seemed to be two separate plots in this particular book, her professional life and her personal life, and they did not flow well together. She might as well have not mentioned any zombie raising or police work at all.Anita's sex life is also getting a little out of hand and the fact that she keeps coming up against an even more powerful evil force and defeating them is getting tiring. I did like the growth of the other characters like Jason and Asher, and the police stuff was good - just wish there had been more.Unlike many people, I did enjoy Narcissus but this book seemed like a repeat of Burnt Offerings but with the sub-plot of the ardeur thrown in. I will probably continue reading any new Anita novels but it is no longer as exciting as it used to be. I'm hoping that her next Merry adventure will be better than this Anita one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I got hooked into the series last year and usually burn through all of her books fairly quickly. Cerulean Sins, though, just seems to lack that amazing suspense that all of the earlier books had. It was a good read and you learn a lot more information about Jean Claude and Asher, but there was too much psychoanalysis in the book and not enough hard core action. I guess that I was just too hyped up for this new book and expected more."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The main plot centers around the dreaded representative of vamp Council member Belle Morte--the rep, Musette, arrives early and havoc ensues. There is also a murder plot, but it takes back seat to most of the main vamp story line and the relationships, lots and lots of relationships.Normally, I enjoy all the aspects of the Anita books: the mystery, the relationships, the new-found triumvirate powers, the wolfy-vampy-leopardy politics, the animating. In Cerulean Sins, the author seems very uneven: some aspects of the story are raised, then dropped for so many pages it was hard to care what had happened before, some remain mere foreshadowing. Certain problems that linger are suddenly solved in a paragraph, and the eventual big finish to the main plot seemed....weirdly anticlimactic. The mystery was almost nonexistent, and I thought a lot of time was spent yacking about relationship issues to not much point. For all of the pages spent, I found that very little was added to the overall series--no clear additions to either the supernatural elements (new creatures, powers, politics) or resolution about Anita and her life. Still, every Anita fan will probably find something to enjoy here, and your time is far from wasted. There are some interesting bits here, especially in the animating sections and in her relationship with Dolph, but I was sorry to see that more time wasn't given to them.Maybe in the next book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I absolutely love this series... If you like loosing yourself in a book, this is the series. There still is a plot eventhough there is so much sex. The sex is what keeps me interested."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Like many others I have to say that the series seems to be going downhill, starting with the previous book, Narcissus in Chains. Cerulean Sins isn't a bad book, mind you, but it doesn't have the engaging plot or characters that the earlier books in the series have.I find it amusing that the person that seems to really like this book has only read three books in the series, that would leave 7 books from which to compare this one too. I know, I know...this is its own seperate work, that said, it is part of a series and you would think it would follow suit.Anita's powers are continuing to grow, great...tell us why? All men seem to want her....ok, again, why? Then there is the fiasco LKH made of Dolph...why?I admit that I will read Incubus Dreams, but at this point it is only because I am anal and want to read the entire series. My interest level is waning."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I loved this book. The only complaint I have is that Anita can't seem to make up her mind on who she wants to be with. I think she should end up with Jean-Claude he likes or loves her even with all her faults and I think she should accept Jean-Claude because of it. Richard needs to accpet his monster and stop giving Anita hell about how easy it his for her to kill. In that world it's kill or be killed and Anita knows this. Over all it's a very good book and the only problem with Anita is that she should have to think that just because she sleeps with someone that she should start to love that person to. If she's going to love someone it should be Jean-Claude and she should recieve the fourth mark and grow more powerful. Other than that this was a good book and I can't wait for her (LKH) 13th book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book is pushing the series in a new direction. Anita's powers are further developing and she doesn't know how to handle it. The arduer is a way to gain power remember, not just a way to add a bunch of sex into the mix. If the arduer hadn't been added a certain very old vampire wouldn't have a way to control Anita. (Anita doesn't like feeling powerless and if the she hadn't gained the arduer she could have easily fought Belle in book 10.) This book feels like a prelude to something much bigger that will happen in the next. Anita's personal life is becoming extremely complicated because of the power she seems to be gaining. She is developing a mix of powers that she shouldn't be able to receive. I don't think you will be disappointed if you read into what is going on in the story. I thought this book was fine, but I think it is building up to a battle royale in the next book. Something much bigger and badder than before is what Anita will be up against soon. It doesn't have a lot of explosive situations like in the previous books. I think the only thing that I didn't like was the story seemed to be over too quickly. All I can say is something big is brewing and if you don't read the book you'll miss out."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The latest in the Anita Blake series is just as bad as the last. I am sorry I read it, it changed my opinion of the character of Anita Blake. The older books were mystery and a no nonsense kinda girl who pulled no punches. Now the whole book is about sex and, in my opinion, the downfall of Anita Blake. She is so out of character anymore, that it is no fun to read. When over 200 pages are devoted to sex scenes, I might as well read romance novels."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Unfortunately, it seems as if the popularity of this series has prompted Laurell Hamilton to write books that are increasingly less compelling. I used to wait impatiently for each new book to be written and become available - but, after reading the last two volumes and being very disappointed, I promised myself to save some $ and never buy a hardcover book in this series ever again!As you may have noticed, it seems that the passage of time for each book has decreased as well. I believe, in her attempts to &quot;stretch&quot; out the series, this book's events takes place over a matter of days...at most, a couple of weeks. I know this series is extremely popular...but this is ridiculous.I didn't give this book a one star rating because I like Anita's character too much to go that low. But, if the next book is as poorly developed and lacking in substance, I will consider skipping a few books until the final book of the series is written. Of course, I realize that I may have to wait for many, many years if this book is any indication."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Personally, I loved Cerulean Sins and barely moved in the time it took me to read the whole thing. I really like the way the series is going, but many may not. The focus in the last few books has started shifting away from the crime-oriented aspects that were so prevalent in the first books and more towards elationships, vampire/wereanimal politics, and character development. So while there are still elements of Anita's daytime career stuff, it's no longer as integral to the story - which I figure that'll either put you off or please you. I'm the latter. Great book. Laurell Hamilton is one of very few authors I'll buy in hardcover."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton's newest outing as Anita Blake is wonderful! I definately feel that it's an improvement over the last few books in terms of character development - particularly Anita. Although I love the books and I love Anita, I was getting tired of Anita's standoffishness. I wanted her to admit to having some feelings and to bend even just a little! Well in Cerulean Sins, Anita makes some important decisions - who she loves, who she sleeps with, who are important people to her. I think she's grown up a lot in this book. Anita becomes embroiled in more vampire politics as Musette, Belle Morte's right-hand gal, comes to pay a visit. This visit precipitates Anita's decisions about Asher and what he means to her; as well as Jean-Claude. Anita's feelings about Richard and Micah also begin to gel and the beginnings of some initial decisions are made. Of course, Anita also manages to kick butt in between her love life! She is once again involved with RPIT on a new case and with her Animating duties, as well. All in all, it's a great book with some revelatory scenes that show that all of the characters have grown and are changing - in good ways!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I stayed up most of the night finishing this book.

There are other books in the Anita Blake series that I thought were better.I am happy Anita is breaking off from Richard, and that she wasn't given even more super powers. How many powers can one person possibly have? Her plate is getting a little too full of men. Even though I was glad to see the Asher/Anita/Jean-Claude relationship developing more.I thought this book was lacking in action scenes. I do understand that this was more spiritual and emotional struggle for the main character. I wasn't very impressed with the Musette/Belle as the main monster. It just wasn't scary enough.I really enjoyed Anita's last words to the serial killing werewolf but I thought that could of been developed more. Less Musette, and more of the serial killer.I think it was a good wrap up of a lot of complicated relationships. I am not sure how much I like Micah.

Having to wait for months, I was not disappointed. Got to reading the book and all I can think is Hotsauce and rollcosters. The sex in it is heavy but not smutty. Loved the whole Asher/Jean-Claude/Anita interplay. Also it was kinda painful and interesting to see Blake get beaten down again and again by Belle Morte. Just when you think she's about to break, she gets that good old second wind and you see the Anita we all know and love come out. The only thing that was kinda a bummer was the abrupt ending to the serial killer. How disappointing. I was looking forward to a good fight scene. Oh well, I am just glad to have her book out. ohh bummer, now I have to wait another year for the next one to come out. Rats!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Wow. This book was so great. Although next time, I won't read so many spoilers for a book before buying b/c then I probably would have enjoyed it more.This book was pretty much about Jean-Claude, Asher and vampire politics. Anita was less active in this book than in any other I read, mostly because she was observing what was going on around her. Unlike most enemies that threaten Anita, these (the bad vampires) were ones that she couldn't fight back physically against because doing so would cause a powerful backlash from the council member Belle Morte. Luckily, vampire society has a lot of laws and niceties, so by using her wits, she once again manages to save the people she has pledged to protect (the were-leopards), as well as other people tied to her. However, in the end, it is Jean-Claude who really saves the day by pulling a new power out of his hat. Due to this power, the bad vampires no longer have the right to be in his territory or bother him due to vampire law. (confusing, I know, but read the book and you'll understand).At first Anita not saving the day bothered me because she always saves the day because she's the main character and the heroine. Aurora Teagarden always saves the day (with help), Stephanie Plum always manages to save the day (accidentally and with help), James Bond ALWAYS saves the day. Frodo saves Middle earth. Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt always saves the day. BUT, then I realized that Anita was the one who helped everyone keep it togethter AND she did make some very important contributions, so even though JC really won the final battle, Anita still got to win the war. Thank goodness.Anyway, some of the other reviews were complaining about the sex. There was a grand total of 3 sex scenes in a 403 page book. I actually thought there should have been more cause they were all pretty short. Just goes to show you what different people want.From the very beginning of the series, Hamilton promised a woman who would kick butt and not fall apart when she killed someone (which she does quite often). Hamilton promised a character who wouldn't be afraid to lead, who wasn't afraid to be self-sufficient. What you get is a confident leader with lots of action. Then throw in all the supernatural stuff like necromancy, lycanthropes, vampires, and succubus/incubus power called the ardeur and you have the best darn series ever written. Seriously, it is truly the best. I have read just about every other present set mystery series out there with female leads and they all fall short. In most, the main heroine can't fight. But anita can (eve dallas can kick butt too). In every single one, the main heroine falls apart after violence. For anita, it's a non-issue. She gets the job done. All my friends (both male and female) love this series. All the girls want to be Anita (except for one who wants to be Belle Morte), and the guys mostly want to be either Jean-Claude or Edward. I guess Edward has a few more fans. He is pretty cool. Oh, there is one guy who wanted to be Anita, after he invented this elaborate hypothetical storyline where the traveler (a council member) steals anita's body and puts her permanently into a man's one. well... that's never going to happen (and it's kind of weird), but it just goes to show you how cool anita is.If you are new to the series, I would really recommend starting at the beginning (guilty pleasures), but if you don't want to and just want to get to Cerulean Sins, I would at least recommend starting at Obsidian butterly (#9), then Narcissus in Chains (#10) before getting to this one (#11) because OB will introduce you to anita without all the complex relationships, and NIC will give you an excellent background on all her current powers."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Unfortunately, the Anita Bryant series are being written using a predictable formula: Super scary uber monster comes to town, threatens Anita and her monster family.

She tries to show she has morals by not having actual intercourse with all of them but to me that is naive, which she is not. The sexual escapades and their descriptions are more pornographic than erotic and without any romance - a deep disappointment.However, I did enjoy the tracking down of a serial killer as that subplot was interesting although this time it was the violence and gore that were too graphic!If you like graphic violence and sex, you would enjoy this book.

Asher is entirely too angsty for his own good *smiles*. I kind of wish that there was a little less plot and a little more romance, because at one stage the plot is buried in romance and so the last few chapters are mostly plot, which if the police work isn't what you read the books for, is a little odd.Richard (who okay, I never really liked anyway, having fallen in love with Jean-Claude) has become a wreck, but you find yourself wishing Anita would just get over him, because she's entirely too much in love with him, when he's far too moral for her - even though Anita still tries to keep her morals afloat.This is an excellent book - if you've not got the rest of the series, I'd say start collecting and if the rest of the series is your thing? Then so is this."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"First of all, let me start by saying that I have no idea why anyone would want to give this book any less than four stars. I for one finished it in a single night just because I could not keep my hands off it! This book, along with the two previous ones, definitely shows just how far Anita has come and how much she's matured. Her sarcastic humor and wit are definitely still there, but in smaller quantities because she IS mentally growing older by the day, a &quot;side-effect&quot; of her lifestyle. At least, that's how I take it. She is definitely on the way to &quot;burning out&quot;, and it'll be interesting to see how she deals with it. ;) This brings me to my favorite part: Jean-Claude. I mean, come ON people, we've been waiting for so long for Anita to just finally admit that she love LOVES him, and now, with a bit of Jason's help, she has! And for some reason, I also think that the length and complexity of their relationship has forged a bond far more intimate, shocking, and tender than that which she had with Richard. By the way, I am SO glad he's out of the picture, for now at least. Micah is a good character for Anita because, like Jean-Claude, he accepts every single bit of her. I would have hoped that once she had realized all that she'd been holding back from JC, Anita would break all the barriers that Jason described (::cough:: Micah ::cough::), but then again, Anita does what she will. Nathaniel and Jason are lovable as always, though I would have liked to see more of how Nathaniel has changed with Anita as his Nimir-Ra. That story definitely has major potential. Our heroine is now immersed in vampire politics and vampire life, and this is definitely a change from the good ol' days when she was just &quot;your friendly neighborhood animator&quot;. And exutioner, of course. LKH, nicely done! Can't wait for Incubus Dreams!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I don't care what anyone says, although I do agree that there was just too much political blather. I also got bored with Mother Dearest's and Belle Morte's visits -- too much and too long. I'm just so happy to have Jean-Claude back. And, I must say, I didn't mind Jason's parts in the book, either."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I don't even remember which book the series i read first, just that it was before OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY. I got so hooked that I had to read the rest and with each one I could not, would not put it down until I reached the last page. I can't say the same for these last two efforts of LKH. The characters are still there, but there is no growth or change, and while I understand that the personal aspect of Anita's life is important, I liked the actual work and action that was present in the earlier books. I hate to say it, but maybe it is time to end it all, because if all that can be offered is more of who is going to sleep with who, and why so and so is too emotionally handicapped to be with, and so on, I think LKH should spend more time on something else like the GENTRY series. I could be wrong and things could improve but the way I see it is simple. I read to escape reality and all the tedious drama, I don't need it in my books too. So if you do decide to read this book, go to the library or wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I was so excited to receive my copy of Cerulean Sins. Except for a hot sex scene with Jean Claude and Asher, this book was too tame and kind of boring. No exciting fight scenes, no other worldly [tail] whippings. Anita lost her thunder. I am so disappointed I could cry. That explains the 2 stars. I really should get a life."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I just finished this chapter of the Anita Blake saga two days ago. You will find the kinky sex and sadism here that the series leads one to expect. The \\"Executioner\\" also executes a couple of monsters along the way. There are simultaneous plots going on, here again as a series reader might expect, that tie together at the end with enough open ended strings to which another novel can be tied. And for you vampire mind game fans there is plenty of that and various vamp and shapeshifter politics.One of the other reviewers talked about character development. I think a better description might be character disintigration. Blake the charcter that drives this series appears to be not changing so much as slipping away. I hope this isn't too an oscure reference, but she seems to be disapparing like Slothrop in Pychon's _Gravity's Rainbow_.There are central parts of the character like her obsession with weapons and clothes, and her massive moral delemmas that have just slipped away. One used to know what Anita was wearing and exactly how her weapons were hidden by her choice of clothes. And the question of who the real monsters seems to have just disappeared. It's always disturbing when a writer gets tired of a character, especially when the charcter drives the fiction and the plots are woven around her. I think this phenomenon is occuring here. Sorry to see it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The biggest problem with Laurell K. Hamilton's books is that she can't write fast enough for my taste. I'd like one book after another after another--very greedy of me.The latest Anita Blake is just superb!! I read it once..and I'm really getting too old to read for eight straight hours..caught some sleep and then read it again. Loved it.My only questions are--if Dolph is a black man and blacks don't catch vampirism easily, why is his son now a vampire?Second isn't really a question, just a comment. I really love Micah as a character--frankly, I think he's an improvement on Richard who is a male chauvinist pig among other things and much too concerned with his own feelings. I do feel that Micah is a bit one dimensional, however. Hope he gets more of a story line in the future.Keep it up, write lots more and WRITE FASTER!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I'm a big Anita fan and the latest work is not up to Laurell K. Hamiltion's usual standards. The story itself is VERY weak; the plot jumps from seb-plot to sub-plot. It doesn't feel like there even is a main story; it's all just an excuse to throw Anita into strange sexual encounters."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"There are more books coming and maybe she gets some better input, but Anita is disgusting at this point. Whatever the excuse, she is a total tramp and has finally embraced it. That is so ridiculous for a character who kept Richard and Jean-Claude waiting for months without giving in to them. Her editor must have told her that the books need more sex to be interesting because there is no good explanation otherwise.I think that the storyline is interesting if you just want to know how things will turn out in the end. Any respect that I have for most of the characters is wearing thin and the entire moral climate of the entire Preternatural community is just ridiculous. It's like any concept of the morality of humanity gets tossed aside. For that reason above all I find Richard to be appealing, he has not forsaken who he was simply because he has been infected with a virus."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have enjoyed the previous books in the Anita Blake series. I couldn't read them fast enough. I was really looking forward to this book coming out and I am very disappointed with the result. Anita has spent the last couple of books getting tough and kicking some serious supernatural butt. In this book, I was frustrated with how she seemed to wimp out. I just wanted a reaction or a really good fight. I also think that Richard is starting to get really annoying and she should just take his character right out. I finished this book totally unsatisfied. I am hoping the next one will be more like the others."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I love this book in the series. It was amazing and really interesting. The previous book let me down because of the fact that the men in anita's life didn't make such a big turn out. The tangle that is anita's love life gets straighten out some and the men are much more involved in this book, most notable is jean-claude and asher.Those that love the series mainly for the police work that anita does in the series, this will disappoint. Although she does get a case, she doesn't spend major amounts of time in the presence of the police and she does not spend that much time beating up her brain about the case either.Many things are taken out of the closet in this book and looked into more closely, even if nothing is really solved. Asher challenges Anita as well with questions about her commitment issues.Mostly I love this because she doesn't end as confused about her life as she started off with and that is progress in my book and I have been waiting for her to make progress.....expecially in the direction of one seductively handsome vamp by the name of jean-claude."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This wasn't even a LKH novel, at least that is what I'm telling myself in order to be up for future books. It had little story line, what it did have was incoherent and very un-LKH like. One sexual travesty to the next and then in the last few pages the quick \\"Last five minutes of Star Trek\\" wrap up. This book contains brief mentions of the furry... the upcoming new \\"big-bad\\" and then it ends with a bit of an \\"eh\\". This book could have been so much more, should have been so much more. This would have been the ultimate Edward book, but he was emasculated in Obsidian Butterfly.I hate to say it, but I'm losing my faith. I miss the old Anita.Guess I'll have to go back and read the earlier books in the series for my \\"fix\\".Bitterly Disappointed"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This is the absolute worse book of the series. It is like one long bad weekend of bed hopping. LKH has forgotten to tell a story along with her belt notching for bed partners. Anita doesn't know what she is doing half the time, and what has LKH done to Richard? The only thing remaining from previous books is Jean Claude's obsession with putting together the perfect outfit. This book is a waste of money, go to the library, borrow it or just skip it. Not worth the time. Maybe LKH needs a little bed time, then maybe she could write about Anita again with some substance and, je ne sais quoi, purpose."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I was so wrong. If you have read the previous reviews, then you may see a pattern forming. If you liked Narcisus in Chains then you will love this book.In point of fact it's apparent the author is happy with the direction the character developement is going.I am not. One of my favorite characters, Richard the nice guy turned badass self loathing alpha werewolf, is as angst ridden as ever, suicidal and pining away for Anita. The way she killed this character is just utterly derpressing.I miss the old Anita, the one with some morals. She still kicked [hiney], and the blossoming sexuality in the books isn't too bad. But my god! Richard is a neurotic and damn near suicidal.Anita practically runs the city, as she is this Federal Marshal now with powers over the police apparently.I can't read this anymore. The love triangle was a great, but now it's just deteriorated to this mess of everyone loving Blake. It's everything that I hated in NIC, and more.I am glad I didn't buy this book, and sorry that I read it. My favorite characters are reduced to subserviant suicide watch victims. It's sad.Those of you that like the direction the series is going, enjoy. I for one hate this."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"When I first began this series, I couldn't put it down. Sleepless nights, distraction at work, it was such a good series. I am beginning to really dislike this series. I am all for steamy sex scenes, but this book is like reading a compilation of vampire/werewolf erotica/short stories.I admit the vampire hunter angle was what first drew me, but the murder mystery and the characters were what really kept me in the series. Now the plotline is all about the ardeur. I almost want to skip over those parts now; I'm so sick of it! I really hope she gains control of it soon or I am going to lose interest completely in the books. I read an afterword in one of Hamilton's earlier books and how she is exploring the darker sides of crime, but I think that this is falling at the wayside in favor of these horrible sex scenes. They're so frequent that it's actually boring.The contrasting characters in Richard and Jean-Claude was wonderful in the beginning, and now I'm hoping Richard is killed off. I actually had an awful thought that he was the killer near the end. That he lost it bad enough that he went rogue. His self-desctruction is so sickening and self-pitying, however no one addresses how he almost got them killed. Where is Jean-Claude's spine? I hear more about what he's wearing that about his character. I really miss the old Jean-Claude. I also liked Asher when he was at least halfway angry about what happened with Julianna. Now he's as woe-is-me as Richard, just not with such horrible consequences.There is also the annoying internal debate about her morality. GET OVER IT ALREADY! If LKH is going to forge ahead with these awful sex scenes, and if Anita is going to be such an all-powerful ball-buster, let's give the girl a spine, too. Anita's tug-of-war of conscience is basically just a repeat of, \\"I don't want to be a monster, but what I do makes me one.\\" And so on and so on. LKH's occasional references to God and prayer and her interpretation of the Bible is pretty uncomfortable and seems sort of misplaced. She doesn't breathe a prayer that her shot to kill the bad guy goes true or for help on how to get out of an impossible situation, but on who to have sex with or how to soothe one of her many lovers' egos.I really hope the next book has more murder plotline than this last book, and less sex, mind-numbing descriptions of clothing, and more wit. In all of the characters."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I just can't read any more of these. After finishing Cerulean Sins I decided not to buy any more of Ms. Hamilton's books. What started out as a really interesting series with complex characters, imaginative plot development, attention to detail, and absorbing storytelling has deteriorated into an excuse to write porn. The ardeur, which was an interesting plot device when it was first introduced, is now simply an excuse to get Anita into the sack with any sentient being with genitalia. A friend who also read the first dozen books in this series tells me that after she found herself flipping through page after page of Anita's bedtime shenanigans in a vain attempt to locate the rest of the story, she gave up and stopped reading these after Narcissus in Chains. Another friend tells me that she didn't give up hope until Anita ended up mulling over whether it might be necessary to start having sex with teenagers, and then she just found the whole downward spiral too creepy to justify buying any more of the books. No idea which book that was. I'm glad I didn't read that far. I don't know what happened to Ms. Hamilton's storytelling skills, but they're gone, or perhaps she's bored with the work of detailing the rules and parameters of the world and characters she's constructed, and it's just easier to write tedious sex scenes. I guess they must sell. Whatever the reason, it's a shame. I used to enjoy Ms. Hamilton's work. She's got real talent as a writer, but she's stopped employing it. As another reviewer herein wrote, there are editing issues: the multitude of typos, spelling and usage errors, poor punctuation, etc., were occasionally disconcerting, and any competent editor should have caught those prior to publication, but another job of an editor is to have a serious talk with an author who's starting to veer off the rails and that apparently didn't happen either. Life's too short to read books you don't really enjoy, and I'm sad to say that I don't find these at all entertaining any more."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Some of the reviews on this book are pretty harsh. I've been reading some of the community threads about this series online as of late and I can understand where a lot of the negative opinions are coming from, I have some of the same misgivings about what's been going on with the series and Anita herself as the main character myself. During the middle portion of the book I thought at times that I was going to find myself not having had enjoyed the book. There are some things that I don't particularly like but I still enjoyed the book as a whole and the ending was quite good.This is a pretty busy book, as are most of the AB novels. It starts off with Anita being back to work, then a series of murders occurs. In the middle of all that, the vampire council comes to town again. On top of THAT we still have anita dealing with her ardeur and the coming of the vampire council certainly doesn't help her deal with that.A lot of the negativity surrounding the later books in the series I've noticed deal with the increasing frequency of the gratuitous sex. There are times when several chapters in a row are nothing but long and quite detailed sex scenes. I'll say this on the matter. I'm no prude, far from it but I think people's main problem with it is the shift from the earlier books. Anita had certain rules, rules she stuck to and that was that. The more time she spent with all the monsters the more those lines get blurred and she seems to have thrown alot of them out the window. Add in the whole ardeur aspect and you really never know who Anita's going to be bedding down with from one moment to the next. Totally her fault? No, but if she kicked Jean Claude to the curb a long time ago then her life wouldn't be nearly as complicated. BUT that would also make for a boring character.I'll be the first to admit it. Sometimes I really can't stand Anita quite frankly! LOL She just makes decisions that are quite aggravating, but she second guesses herself constantly which means there's something left of the old Anita left that I enjoyed so much from the earlier books and she's still human enough where I don't find myself wanting to smack her myself for very long.Most of the decisions that I've found myself aggravated over the last few books have really been a result of circumstance, not knowing what she was truly getting into, and very bad timing. If she was always just a cold hearted witch (which she HAS been at times) with no regret or feeling whatsoever I think I would have stopped reading the series. But she's not. She may be able to pull the trigger without a care more often than not, she may say hurtful things when she knows she shouldn't but at least she knows these things are wrong.While the ardeur is still prevalent in this book (to the point even where sometimes you may find yourself saying 'enough is enough!') there's still elements from the earlier books that made this a good read.There's the murders obviously and as such she's dealing with cops, feds and RPIT. There's more Zebrowski time in this book than there has been in a long time and that's a very good thing. Not that much Dolf time, but given what transpired during that time it's probably a good thing (and that's all I'll say on that!) And as I said, there's a little visit by some Vampire council members and that's always good stuff. The vampire politics and things that Jean Claude reveals during these little visits always makes for good reading. And yes, Richard's in the book yet again. I still thing going to JC over Richard was very very stupid on her part, but that can partially be blamed on circumstance and bad timing, I still remain hopeful though ;)So, while not all of it may be to everyone's liking I think there's still plenty of entertainment value in this one. I didn't go into the plot too much because that's been done to death as there are plenty of reviews on this book that do a better job of detailing the particulars than I can do. I just try to convey my thoughts on the book, Anita and the series as a whole up to the book I'm reviewing.As I said, the ending redeemed some of the ardeur and relationship stuff in the middle of the book that I didn't much care for and it makes a good book end to the beginning as well as the series of murders that take place over the course of the book.So did I enjoy it overall? Yep. Not my favorite of the series but I'm still along for the ride in these characters' lives to see how everything ultimately pans out, quibbles (both minor and major) aside!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita Blake was a great series! I loved everything about Anita, even if some of the other characters were a little stereotypical (Jean-Claude) or annoying (I find Richard's \\"poor me\\" act irritating). But it seems like Ms. Hamilton peaked with Obsidian Butterfly. Naricissus in Chains was excruciatingly long and pointless. But I'm talking about Cerulean Sins, so let me get back to that.All in all, it was much better than Naricissus, that's for sure. I even got excited, thinking things were going to get back on track. But I agree with many reviews about this book. Hamilton's losing her edge and is resorting to sex to make up for it. The serial killer plot in this book became a subplot and left a lot of things unexplained. I bought this book because half of the reviews raved about it and the other half downed it. I wanted decide on my own, now I feel like I should've checked it out of the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Why two stars? Because Cerulean Sins is readable. Not exactly enjoyable but readable. After finally finishing the non-stop crap-fest that is Narcisus In Chains, I decided to read Cerculean Sins. Originally, I wasn't going to read it because I once jokingly told a friend I would be forever finished with this series when Hamilton gave us the Anita/Richard/Jean Claude threeway. My friend later informed me that this book does have a threeway. With the upcoming paperback release almost here my library finally moved the book out of the New Releases section to the regular shelving meaning that I could have the full three weeks to get through it.Okay, plot plot plot. Some were-beastie is cutting up people and leaving them in bathtubs. Anita must find out who did it. The vampire council is in town again, so Anita must deal with them too. In between she has lots of skanky sex with all of St. Louis. I think at this point the only people she hasn't boffed yet are Dead Dave and his bartender and that's only because they seem to have droped off the face of the earth.I think part of the reason the book fared slightly well with me is because I'm reconciled that Anita is a complete slut. What I find irritating to the extreme about her is that her character has degressed in moral, emotional, and intellectual maturity. She's like a super-powered teenager with her nasty little tantrums. Disagree with her and she'll kill or, horror of horrors, not spread her legs for you anymore. Anita spends a lot of time whining about her morals, but little to change her situation. Hamilton and Anita seem to have some idea that the character is morally bankrupt, but still insists that Anita is great because God loves her and the universe always shifts so the outcome of Anita's actions are always correct and right and hence good. Perhaps the most perplexing is that even though Anita is aware of her lack of any ethics she still has no problem jumping on her highhorse and looking down on everyone else. I think that Anita just likes feeling superior to people and holding her humanity over everyone else's head. \\"I am human which is good and pure not like you vampires and werewolves so be glad I have sex with you!\\" The worst part is she's got everyone so cowed they never tell her she's wrong. Someone really needs to turn her over their knee and give her spanking. Maybe that would help her atitude problem.The once cool secondary characters have been reduced to little more than cyphers or engorged sex organs for Anita to straddle. Richard is little more than a madman here as he tries to clinge to the idea that the people living in this semi-supernatural underworld can live by something better than the law of the jungle. Of course, Anita shows him! Killing is good! Anita's right! Worship her! I also think that fact she's not having sex with him is the implied as the way he's so crazy, but maybe untreated STDs he got from her are eating his brain. Jean Claude? What happened to him? He is like this barely there de-fanged brother figure. Once again he been shoved to the side as Anita clamors to bed everyone else though as a concilation he does get to share her with Asher.Hamilton needs to stop recycling plots. The Vampire Council is territory we already covered in Circus of the Damned and Burnt Offering. The werewolf murders are like a cross between the brutality of Laughing Corpse and Lunatic Cafe. The pacing is awful too. Remember when LKH could cover a massive amount of territory in under 300 pages? I bet anyone who has a son or newphew or something between 6 and 12 is at least a little familiar with the Dragon Ball Z cartoon. You know the one were muscled men with spiky hair spend 50 episodes preparing for fight, 60 to boast and posture about whose the strongest before the fight, and 200 to actually beat each other up. Anita Blake is starting to resemble that. The books expand in length but very little is acomplished. The freakishly super-powered Anita spends half the book sleeping around or thinking about sex in someway, spend the next two thirds tring to prove how big her testicles are, and rest fighting against her enemies.Even the climatic scenes are lackluster. Anita is way to powerful and she's got so many allies that there is no longer any chance that she could lose. It's not just one woman against the awsome forces of evil, it's a super-witch and her army against things only slightly more evil and Anita can always develope a new power better than the last to finish the job.In this book, it seems like Hamilton is setting the series up to end, and I don't think it comes a minute too soon. I keep hoping someone with beat Anita with a shovel and hopefully this mega-evil Vampire Mama is up for the task.It's a shame what this series has been reduced to. The only way to give it CPR is if 1) Hamilton goes back in time and writes adventures about Anita's earlier life as vampire hunter or 2) Kill off Anita, the werewolfs and leopards, and JC's group. Do a spin-off starring her ex-friend Ronnie, the wererats, and Malcolm, who takes over as master vampire of the city (Remember him Laurell?)"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have now read all eleven of the current books in the Anita Blake Series. This story follows a simular theme from Book 8 on, and as such it is both enjoyable and frustratingly annoying, simultaneously. I am not sure what happened at the point when Blue Moon was written, but someone desided that making the major thread of the story a continual sexual exploit was the way to go. To be honest, there are a few places where I simply didnt read the story but moved ahead several pages. This wasnt because of the content but because what happens to Anita is too difficult to go through, a strangely uncomfortable kind of reader-voyeurism. It is absolutely full of 'Were-everything' and any scenario that 'forces' Anita to induge her appetite. Hence the contradiction, Anita started out knowing what she stood for, and her very strength of conviction, her sheer will was very appealing. That vanishes from Book 8 on, inlcuding this one. However, Laurell Hamilton has gone where no other author I have read has dared to go, and I dont mean the sex here, and she has created a very unique blend of horror, eroticism, mystery and woven it well. I just wish she would give the other main characters a better chance to develop and ease up on the obvious sexual ploys. Subtelty is often far more potent anyway. All of the books are worth your time, but be forewarned, DONT identify with any of the main characters because it isnt going to make you happy. Try and not think like a human, read it as how she intended, in an imaginary world, and you will probably think this book is pretty good."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've loved all of Hamilton's books, but the erotica has gotten far out of hand. Sex scenes are great when thrown in as a spice. But, the sex has overtaken her new books. It's like cheap porn movies whose budget gets blown halfway through filming: they cut straight to the sex and try to tie up any story line with a few lines at the end. I'm very disappointed with the lack of a story."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've read all of the Anita Blake novels several times over, and despite my pretty positive review of NiC, I was really hoping for more this time around. In some ways, I got my wish, and in others I was really disappointed.I'll start off with the good:a. very little Micah. I was a fan of Micah, but it seems as though he's just another submissive who wants to worship at the altar of Anita. He lets her do anything (or anyone, as the case may be), and fortunately he doesn't show up all that much.b. very little Richard. I hate Richard, plain and simple. His self-denegrating attitude is getting OLD. Fortunately, aside from some psychic stuff, he appears for a short period of time. He declares that the Thronnos Rokke clan will no longer be affiliated with anyone, and you can tell the clan doesn't like it. I suspect that the clan may be on it's way out, prolly forming 2? It was an okay twist, but it means that Richard will have to stick around &lt;sigh>.c. a better dealing with the ardeur. While I am not a prude, and didn't mind the erotica of NiC, it was also getting a bit tedious to have Anita want to do every guy she meets. At least here we got explanations and attempts to control it better. Overall, I think this book was good if only to establish a story that allows Anita to control the darn thing.d. JASON! He finaly is being written as an adult. He is one of my favorite characters in the book. He is written as an insightful, charming, intelligent young man instead of some pathetic boy-toy worshiping at the altar of Anita. Finally he has some meat. ok, he did get sex (whichs he's been begging for), but for him, he recognizes that it means he has a bigger role in Anita's life than some hanger-on.e. The Dolph storyline was really well-done. I liked it a lot, and I'm interested to see where it goes.f. an interesting new character, the Mother of Darkness. I have hopes for her....now for the bad and the ugly:a. the plotline has been used already. Enough with the darn council! It seems that this plotline was contrived just to bring it back to the Anitaverse, an element lacking in NiC. Too bad it was done better in Burnt Offerings.b. Asher. I like Asher, but LKH has now managed to throw yet another man into the fray that is Anita's sex life. We have Richard, and Jean-Claude, and Micah, and now Asher (not counting tension, which would include Jason, and Damian, and Nathaniel and countless others). Complex romantic triangels are a lot of fun. This is just getting tedious.c. No Ronnie, no Larry, no Animators, Inc., and NO EDWARD! I was really disappointed in that. You would think that LKH would at least give these characters more than a mere mention(some didn't even get that!). I'm all for evolution, but don't you think that the human side of Anita needs to be explored as well?!? and why ignore such great characters?!?d. the Thronnos Rokke Clan and Anita's pard were mere mentions for the most part as well. We got a bit of character info on Gregory and Stephen, and a bit of tension when Richard declared independence, but not much else; what little we got wasn't utilized very well. As much as Richard and Micah annoy me, LKH can't just drop em from the plot.e. the assassin subplot was transparent and poorly done. what a waste. i had the bodyguards figured out almost immediately, and the rest of the pieces fit too quickly for my tastes. it seemed like an afterthought to make the book more interesting; it failed miserably.f. another contrived and all too-short epilogue. please don't write them if they're going to be meaningless!overall, not a bad effort, but if the best praise it can get is \\"better than NiC\\", that's not saying much. It appears that LKH is trying to get back on track, so we'll see what the next book holds for us!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Gratuitous sex. So much that you begin to skip the scenes and look for the meat of the book, which you will find lacking. A fan of Anita Blake back from the first printing of Guilty Pleasures, this book was almost abhorrent to me. Literally just becoming a platform for a supernatural cocktail and the author's idealized version of herself, we lose the vibrant personality of \\"Anita\\" that we heard in the first book. There is no tension, everything works out in the end with no one for the worse and yet another bad-monkey conquered. There is no chance of death because Anita -always- wins. She doesn't suffer any true casualties. Hey, why NOT kill off Richard, or Jean-Claude, or Asher.Overdone and you can almost pick the overused lines from each of her books. This is just sex + lines from other books. Nothing new here."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"...but it does in this case. I have read all of Hamilton's Anita Blake series, most of them with great pleasure, and in several hour marathon sittings. But I found myself actually falling asleep and losing track of the storyline while reading the lastest novel in the series, Cerulean Sins.The sex is so constant that it distracts from characterization and plot. I adored the Anita novels in which hot, exotic sex scenes broke up the crime-driven and supernatural explorations of the book, and in which the sexual tensions between the primary characters were sometimes explored and relieved. Then there was enough romantic suspense to keep me hooked. But this book was like a glutton's feast -- far too much, and far too over the top, to the point that the writing actually numbed me out.I would so much more enjoy a novel in which Anita truly explored her relationships with and feelings for Jean-Claude, Asher, and perhaps Richard (despite Richard's rather irritating constant self-pity), the most compelling romantic interests Hamilton has created for her heroine. All the rest, in my opinion -- Micah, Jason, Nathaniel, etc. etc. just make Anita look less conflicted than like a sex addict. This in turn makes the ardeur seem an excuse for Anita to abandon her earlier sexual ethics while still paying them constant, tiresome, self-excusing lip service. While she may, for example, admit that insisting on Jean-Claude's monogamy is \\"monstrously unfair\\" when she has several lovers and semi-lovers at any given time, Anita does not do much to change her attitude. Even when a much-awaited and potentially hot, hot, hot menage-a-trois finally develops in this novel, it is strangely unsatisfying for all the characters as well as for the reader, precisely because Anita still refuses to let herself truly explore or emotionally process the event. Thus reader excitement is abruptly followed by irritation and disappointment -- and atop it all, Anita gets around her moral qualms by messing around with one man in the menage, but not \\"going all the way\\", and the two male characters in the menage do not have sex with one another despite powerful attraction. So, Anita is still maintaining her double standards for her men and still splitting hairs without accepting the true nature of her desires, or accepting the complexities of her lovers' needs, or paying more than lip service to her \\"monstrously unfair\\" hang-ups. I'm not sure what Hamilton plans to do with this for her future novels, but this angst, and these double standards have gone on for so long now that I want to yell at all the characters and tell Jean-Claude to get together with Asher or Richard and simply give up on Anita Blake.If this continues, I am going to give up on the series. It's becoming tedious, in my opinion, and I can't see all this character development some reviewers have mentioned. We learn more about Asher, Jean-Claude, and even Richard's personalities, but we mostly learn more and more and more and more ad nauseum about Anita's libidinous desires and adventures. It does her no good to realize things about herself but then do nothing about them. That's not character development; it's making a token gesture toward a promise of future character development. I do hope it is not an empty promise. If there's not definite change in the next installment, I won't be buying any more of the series.To be fair, Hamilton does have Anita briefly realize she has relationship issues, when she is forced to confront the possibility that she's afraid of full emotional intimacy and commitment with one man. But like too many other occasions in these novels, Anita's realizations lead to far more angst than action. And in this respect she and Richard are perfectly suited.Also, there is strange potential foreshadowing in the book about someone thinking Anita must be pregnant -- but she's not. Perhaps this is what Hamilton intends for the next novel in the series. If so, God help Anita Blake, who quite possibly would have no way of knowing who the father of her child really is... And if this happens, I do hope she will finally make a full commitment to *someone*, even if it is to a baby. Yet that seems very difficult to imagine, so I doubt Hamilton will choose that sort of plot development -- the domestication of Anita Blake. Therefore, I wonder, what in the world was that strange scene all about, anyway? If it's not foreshadowing, it's really confusing writing."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I really enjoyed the first eight or so books in the Anita Blake series. The alternative reality was interesting, dangerous and unique. I suppose it was inevitably realistic the Anita would become more jaded as she became more immersed in the dark world of vampires and weres. What wasn't inevitable was her (the author's) preoccupation with sex.Sins' predecessor, Narcissus, was a train wreck in the same vein as \\"Hannibal\\" where Thomas Harris essentially massacred a wonderful character, Claire Sterling, by having her fall in love with a monster. Hamilton massacres Anita Blake by having her sleep with every monster within her grasp. Cerulean continues with the massacre. The only way to save Asher from Belle's grasp is to sleep with him? Oh, please. After how many menages a trois does one become a certified slut?Anita has zero redeeming qualities any more. She's self-centered, grumpy, self-righteous and hypocritical.Personally, I've abandoned Hamilton in favor of a relatively new author, Kim Harrison. The first book in her series isn't as strong as Hamilton's first book, but they are gaining steam as the series progresses. And her main character, an earth witch who battles vampires, is a refreshing change from uber-slut Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book is so bad, I hardly know where to start. Anita has become a whiney, bratty, difficult slut who has sex with anyone due to the 'ardeur' that Hamilton has conveniently come up with. All I kept thinking as I read this book was that it was nothing more than a laundry list of the author's sexual fantasies. Sex with a stranger, sex with multiple men, sex in public, sex with an animal, etc. It's too much and it is COMPLETELY unbelievable that a character who started out chaste and uptight about sex could do such a complete reversal without a lobotomy.The sudden and frequent appearance of new powers is also tiring. Everything about Anita is new to this world. She doesn't just break the rules, but her powers do, too. Nothing about her is normal and so after a while, even the most astounding and unique things about her are just tedious.And what really, really has to go is the constant whining that Blake does. We can understand that she is conflicted with her life, we don't need to hear about it every other page.I'm giving Hamilton another chance, but that is about it. Either write a decent book or hang up the series. Please."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The first Anita Blake novel I ever read was Obsidian Butterfly. I remember being blown away. When I stepped into Laurell K. Hamilton's world I thought that all of her Anita Blake books would be up to this high standard. I was wrong.Since Obsidian Butterfly there has been, Narcissus in Chains, which fell flat, in comparison with Obsidian Butterfly and now, the wildly disappointing Cerulean Sins.While it is true that Hamilton has worked on some character progression where Jason and Nathaniel are concerned she has not allowed Anita to progress nearly enough. And all of Anita's men are in fact spineless. The once powerful master vamp, JC is Anita's slave instead of it being the other way around. Asher is now under Anita's spell and Micah never pretended to be anything but Anita's pet. It is a shame that Hamilton has written all of these extremely powerful characters and then treated them all in the same way. As Anita's cheap play things. If Hamilton wanted to show that she could write a powerful female character, then congratulations to her, she accomplished that several books ago. However, if she continues to write her story's as badly as the last few... Perhaps she may not have a fan base left to write to.Now... As far as characters are concerned.. I think I covered that as much as I wanted to. Let's move on to the story progression.... It seemed as though Hamilton was throwing her fans a bone with the murder case. As if to say... Oh yeah... I forgot that Anita Blake is a sometimes detective... Let me take a break from writing soft core Anita Blake porn and develop a story line and a half developed story line at that.Let's pretend that Hamilton has not used the same line about Anita's smile not reaching her eyes, a million times. Let's also pretend that all of Anita's love interests are pretty much the same, with the exception of a few subtle differences. Now lets also pretend that as her readers we wouldn't notice that Hamilton takes every opportunity she can to mourn hair cuts. First Jason's now Richards. Lets pretend that all of the stuff she said in this book hasn't been said by her before.Wait..... Lets not pretend. I suggest that Laurell K. Hamilton wakes up and thinks about the next book that she writes. I hope that before her next book, which I can only assume will be a Merry Gentry book she will work on her problems and think about developing a story line, for true. Because lately... All of her writing has been suffering from poor character developement, poor plot and terrible editing. Laurell K. Hamilton if you care about what your readers think and sometimes read what people like me post about your books... Please pay attention to what I am about to say: I am so disappointed in this lack of effort."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"So I was looking for a light and entertaining book to read over lunch. Unfortunately, pickings were mighty slim at the LuValle bookstore next to the law school. As a last resort, I grabbed a copy of Laurell K. Hamilton's Cerulean Sins. Big mistake.I used to be quite a fan of Hamilton's Anita Blake series, but I eventually lost interest in it. Fifty pages into Cerulean Sins, I remembered why.It's not just the gratuitous S&M-tinged; sex and violence. It's not just the incredibly formulaic plots (big bad vampire comes to town; Anita's not allowed to kill vampire bad guy due to some contrived rule of vampire politics; after killing and screwing lots of other folks, Anita finally gets to kill the bad guy. Yawn).It's simply that the main characters have become so unlikeable. Anita Blake is the worst of the lot. She's a insufferably smug psychopathic [...] who is constantly pissed off at something and whose first reaction to somebody new is either to screw them, kill them, or both. She's also one of the most remarkably self-centered major characters I've ever encountered, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts and (dare I say it?) blue balls wherever she goes. (One of the oddities of the series is that, despite the amount of sex in the books, Blake is always leaving somebody high and dry.)It's a bad thing when you root for the bad guys. It's much worse, however, when you want the bad guys to obliterate the story's only POV character. But that's what I want."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I think that the greatest challenge in any series is to have the characters grow beyond the initial boundaries that defined them, characters that fail to do so are either poorly written OR are defined by that lack of growth (in this series, Richard who is rooted in self-hatred and always will be).Anita, through the first 8 books grew and changed and discovered more about herself morally and mystically... but she also stagnated. Several of the characters in the series have noted that Anita will change, make concessions and discover acceptance.. and then immediately snap back to the old starting points. So a change in that hyper-rigid morality is probably a good thing.On the other hand, I'd like her not to be a gun-toting bimbette, as she is in some ways in this book and the last. Yes there is the ardeur by way of explanation? But there's also a lot of romance novel worthy physical sex, which seems a bit beyond 'growth' for her.It's my hope that the next book in the series encompasses more of Anita's understanding of the various men she's bonded with, more of her coming to comfort with NEW aspects of those relationships (as opposed, y'know to the same ones she's dealt wih three or four times now) and, I would hope, an exploration of the metaphysical. We seemed for 3 or 4 books... heck more than that, to be building towards a realization of just WHY the council fears necromancers and just how powerful a triumvirate can be. Perhaps it's time to wrap up some of the more soap opera worthy plot lines (i.e. Richard) and move forward with exploring those new ones.It's worth reading for the teasing glimpses of an Anita that doesn't completely hate herself, but all in all the promises of this book can be numbered equally bad and good. It continues the trend of Narcissus in Chains, which makes it two disappointing follow-ups to the best book of the series 'Obsidian Butterfly'."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Ms. Hamilton has fallen into the trap of making each new book more sensational than the last, at the expense of the twisting plotlines that made us love Anita in the first place. The preternatural crimes in Cerulean Sins are relegated to a secondary role, while Anita's enthusiastic love life takes center stage.The summary on the back of the book says Cerulean Sins is about a hitman who hires Anita to raise a dead relative. That happens in the first 30 pages then falls off the radar for 400 pages of Anita having sex with various vampires, werewolves and wereleopards...sometimes more than one at a time. I'm all for plenty of sex in a book, but as Richard the wereworlf, Anita's ex-boyfriend, says, \\"What is it with you, Anita? Are there any men in the world you haven't slept with?\\" At least she loves them all.For a good Catholic girl who started out 10 books ago not believing in casual sex, Anita has certainly broadened her horizons. Richard is about the only male not on her list of bed buddies.At long last, Anita crawls out of bed long enough to investigate the murders almost as an afterthought. C'mon, Anita, you've a better hunter than this!!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"There was so much I loved about this book and so much I hated! I am an avid reader of this series & always look forward to the new release.Pros: This is typical in that I could not put it down. Laurell has a fast paced style of writing. Jason was cheeky as ever, maybe more so. I can see the Black Ops and Mother of All Vampires coming in a future book. The plot itself was good. Much better than her last two books.Cons: Left the Black Ops and Mother of All Vampire loose ends just a little too lose. And here I agree with all the other reviews. TOO MUCH SEX! Don't get me wrong I love a good steamy romance novel, but this book jumped over the line from steamy to revolting. For those of us that know and love Anita it is just too far out there to be believable of her character. Yes she is changing with each book but this just goes against everything Anita is. She has had the arduer for many books now & was told that the longer she had it the easier it would get. This isn't what is happening. Instead it is getting worse and she has no control (despite the fact that she has in previous books). It's jarring. I think that Laurell is getting Merry & Anita mixed up as she jumps from writing one book to the other. I love the Fairy series also & Merry's character is in keeping with the lurid sex scenes so it doesn't bother me. ANITA IS NOT MERRY. Give us back our old Anita that we all love so much!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Personally, I'm liked this last book, as for it being too sex oriented, can I say Narcissus??? The book still had a good plot, and it kept moving till the end. I think that she needs to loose some of the guy baggage, but, hey, shes ok with it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I love how Anita has come around. She starts out being a bit self righteous in Guilty Pleasures, though hard as nails and sassy enough that we love her anyway. I love how through the series she is slowly \\"corrupted\\". She learns to trust and to give in to her feelings instead of playing the bad ass sociopath all of the time. It does bother me a little that her religion seems to have faded into the background, since it was such a huge part of her life before. Interesting how the cross doesn't glow around Jean Claude...Anita seems like a more approachable character to me now. Maybe because some of her convictions have been compromised and some of her morals challenged. I do miss Ronnie and her \\"normal\\" life. I'm wondering if Edward ended up marrying fragile NM mom, it seems strange to me that he would have a domestic life.Overall, I totally loved this book and can't wait for the next in the series. I'm way too addicted to Laurell K. Hamilton!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I think the reason people don't like this book as much as some of the others is because it seems to be a stepping-stone book -- something even bigger is going to happen in the next novel, something involving the Council. That's why this one seems to drop off so quickly.THAT SAID...The pacing was good. The sex was good, if a little weird in places.Some lines were overused (\\"tan version of the Mummy's hand\\"). The Big Bad Non-Vampire Enemy was too glossed-over and that angle ended too quickly.On the other hand, the development of many of the minor characters was appreciated, and if you like Jason, you'll ADORE many parts of this book. There were some scenes with Asher that were well-written.The ending reminds me a bit of the denoument of Harry Potter 4 (Goblet of Fire). But no one complained about that.Read it if you like Anita. But if you've never read Laurell K. Hamilton before, start with _Lunatic Cafe_."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I can always count on Anita Blake showing me a good time. I love her humor. Ms. Hamilton continues to break all the rules, but gives hopes to all the rest of us wannabes. She just about talked us to death in this one with mundane explanations. Talk, talk, talk. Actions speak louder than words. I bought it, I admit, because I can always count on having a good time. Typical startout -- work, the client, the hire that you know will lead to a plot, maybe. So, why have those final chapters with the police?? And the rush to end this one? So forget the plot, forget the carnage. Forget hanging on to see how Anita escapes from the big bad monsters. Instead, see how many typos you can find. Let's just have more sex. Just so wait for this one to come out in paperback, or check it out from the library. In the meantime, read Quilty Pleasures. There is hope for all us wannabes!! Just keep it within the publisher's word and page count -- good or bad doesn't seem to matter as long as it sells."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This series has gone berserk! I love the police drama of the Anita Blake books but Anita has become a nympho and that is the main focus of these books now. Anita just has sex. This book should have focused more on Dolph's breakdown, Anita's work, and the occasional vampire story line. Edward was missing, which was also a disappointment. I still loved the book but there was too much going on with the ardeur. I want more drama and I don't think Anita should find that she can no longer take violence. We the readers love Anita because she is tough and takes little help. I don't want Anita to become antoher dependent, female stereotype."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In this latest installment of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series we find our heroine once again confronting a phethora of challenges. Early in the novel she gets sucked into vampire politics with the visit to St. Louis of Musette, the scary enforcer of the vampire godfather Belle Morte. Without pausing to take a breath, Anita is summoned to a police investigation of a series of gruesome murders which gets complicated by her recent appointment as a federal marshal. Anita then finds herself being stalked by international terrorists who are trying to recruit her into a nefarious plot sponsored by a secret government agency. Finally we find Anita solving the crime and dealing with a renegade lycanthrope who is connected to most of the problems seen throughout the novel. All the while, she has to deal with her own and everyone else's emotional and psychological baggage.This sounds like a great plot but the problem is that it's all been done before, and done better. The vampire banquet is similar to the one in Burnt Offerings. The stalking of Anita by bad guys was done better in The Killing Dance. The tedious orgies of the ardeur were first seen in Narcissus in Chains and have become tiresome.Anita herself has further descended into amorality when she almost shoots a client in her office and then cruelly mocks and denigrates a grieving widow whose spouse she must raise as a zombie. She completely abuses her authority as a federal marshal and behaves unprofessionally. Most of all, she has lost her sense of humor. The Anita Blake of previous novels was a gifted and attractive young woman with a sharp wit. Her former fiance, alpha werewolf Richard Zeeman, is dead-on correct that Anita has become more of a monster than any of them. In Cerulean Sins, we see Anita as a humorless, paranoid psychotic.Anita continues to have a lot of good friends that she fails to appreciate or even thank. She could be very happily married to a more stable Richard if she could just compromise a little and be supportive instead of confrontational and cruel. Anita handicaps herself by her win-at-any-cost, my-way-or-the-highway style.Thankfully the reappearance of several minor characters greatly helps the novel. The delightfully humorous police sergeant Zerbrowski provides a satisfying counterbalance to the implausible and painful emotional meltdown of his boss, Dolph Storr. The wererat bodyguards Bobby Lee and Claudia provide a pleasant counterbalance to the awkward Anita. Werewolf friend Jason is much more mature and delightfully perceptive.Narcissus in Chains told us that Anita had been appointed head of a new panel of representatives from each of the shapeshifter groups. But there is no mention of this in Cerulean Sins. After reading Narcissus in Chains, I was very much looking forward to seeing what would happen with this new shapeshifter panel but the teaser has been completely ignored.Perhaps Cerulean Sins is not as bad as I've depicted. It had the potential of being very good indeed but is hampered by the sheer implausibility of several issues such as Dolph's meltdown and Anita's grossly unprofessional behavior. There is also no beauty in the relationships such as what we saw between Anita and Richard in Lunatic Cafe and The Killing Dance, or between her friend Ronnie and her wererat boyfriend Louie, or between fellow animator Larry and police detective Tammy Reynolds. Readers would be well-advised to wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"As a fan of the Anita Blake series I believe this is definitely her weakest novel. She clearly set things up for multiple plot lines and then neglected all but one until the very end.It's not a bad book, exactly, but she went off track early on. She set us up for an interesting and exciting monster hunt and a mysterious client and then abandoned them to focus entirely on Belle Morte's entourage visiting for almost the entire remainder of the book. Problem is that visit wasn't all that exciting or interesting, certainly nowhere near as tense and well done as the visit by the Vampire Council a couple of books back. Anita enduring repeated psychic/magical attacks gets dull after a while, too. By the time that plotline was wrapped up there wasn't much time for her to get back to the earlier ones, so she just wrapped them in a very hurried fashion. Frankly, she'd have been better off focusing on them and not Belle Morte, as they sounded like they could have been far more exciting. Hope she gets back to her old style next book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This series has been about the most addicting thing ever for me. I started with Guilty Pleasures just after Christmas (after hearing the name Laurell Hamilton on another website) and read the first 10 books in just over two weeks. ***Ms. Hamilton's newest novel, Cerulean Sins, is not the best of the series, but it is acceptable. The new evil introduced could definitely lead to some great action in future books, but the bad vamps of this story weren't as bad as those of old, in my opinion. Anita is kick-butt as always, but not like we've seen in other books. In fact, I was slightly surprised by the lack of action -- This novel definitely allows the characters, especially Anita, to get very introspective. All in all, though, this is a must read for all AB fans!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been a fairly devout follower of the Anita Blake books since LKH started writing them. I've starting buying them in hardcover because I a) cannot wait to read them, and b) loan them out to so many people and it's easier to keep hardcovers intact. Many of the issues I had with Narcissus in Chains were lightened in this book, and while I'm not adverse to the sex scenes (so many people keep saying that LKH's other series somehow blended with Anita nd changed Anita's view of sex...) I'm glad there seemed to be more plot and the sex wasn't the entire issue.One thing I keep looking for - LKH has created so many alpha characters that take the spotlight and keep it - Richard, Jean-Claude, Asher, Edward, etc.: when she first introduced the Rat-King, Rafael, I wanted to know more about him. And as the were-rats often feature in the books, I keep hoping to see one more glimpse of the character. Maybe because he was definitely alpha and never seems to have many problems LKH doesn't think she needs to elaborate his position? With the sheer number of new characters flooding each book - something I like - you'd thin there'd be room for one more character, who as the leader of the were-Rats should be around more often?On the whole, I'm much more satisfied with this book than NiC."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In the beginning we had Anita BLake Vampire Hunter. Now we have Anita Blake erotica and not any good at that. In the first few books she was human, a necromancer, had a clue, and some issues. The character was almost/relatively believable and somewhat likable. In 11 books none of the characters in the series have developed, the ones even remotely developed have been totally lobotomized in this book. Anita Blake is no longer a believable or even remotely likable protagonist that anyone can relate to at all. Just a super selfish superhuman witch who'll do anything to have what she wants and do anything or say anything to get it. The self aggrandizing prose of the protagonist(Anita) is enough to make you laugh, so there is humor in it. There is no romance to me in a book where I despise the lead and think she herself is the joke. This book is all about bedding this one and that one with a very lame excuse to do so. It's predictable to follow so there is no plot. Even though these books are listed under romance, the books in this series once had plots and were romantic. This book has neither a plot or any kind of believable or even reasonable romance to it at all. Even the sex is a joke, everybody loves Anita to the extreme. It is badly editted, tons of typos and run on sentences. This book like the last one insulted me as a former fan and as a person it insulted my inteligence.

I wish she paid even a modicum of attention to her fans. Just about all of them hate the direction that this series has gone, the only reason the Anita makes the bestsellers list is because her fans buy the book in hopes that this time it will be different.

She was smart, principled, and working hard in a hostile world. Ther first three books were marvels of the supernatural mystery sub-genre, morality tales that made me think.Now this is no longer true. I checked Obsidian Butterfly and Narcissus in Chains out from the library, and after this gift book, I shan't read any more Anita Blake. It's just too painful. A woman who had a strong and sincere moral compass in a difficult world now only has a compass for sex. A woman who made choices is now only left with the choice of whether to enjoy being driven to sex, or to whine about it.Carefully woven plots with multiple threads have now given way to a novelette's worth of plot hidden in the sex scenes.

The first 6 books in the series are absolutely wonderful. The series was still good for a while after that, but for anyone wanting to read the series, I would tell them to stop at Obsidian Butterfly. That was the last one worth reading.After Obsidian, the books take a major dive for the worse.By the end of Cerulean Sins, our once strong, independent, and amazing heroine, has been dragged down to the lowest of the low - she has been turned into nothing but an absolute gutter slut.The entire book MIGHT have 4-6 pages of plot line. The rest of the entire book revolves around her being unable to control her sex drive and banging everything and anything around her.I'm was so disappointed in this book that I just can't believe how terrible it got. I've quit reading the Anita series at this point.At one time, she was a great character.

But don't be fooled into believeing it is \\"just sex.\\"It seems to me that LKH has a line of stories in her head and some books need to be used to get there, and to get Anita where she is going, she needs to be in these situations - to learn to deal with them. So, the mysteries and more elaborate investigations should be back, but Anita is evolving. And hey, if she wants to have lots of sex, it's her choice. My only qualm is that she holds the men in her life up to a stricter standard than she holds for herself. I would imagine eventually they would tell her to ... off and have the same sex that she is having.But, yes, if you don't like sex scenes, don't read this. But don't give up on this series just because of this novel."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"At this point its hard for me to be objective on these books. I got hooked long ago. The break for some people seems to be if you are bothered by intense sex and violence (sometimes combined), you will not like the later books, but if you are not, you will be as hooked as I am.Bottom line, Hamilton's imagination is without bounds, and I for one do not mind tagging along on her sexual fantasies as they are played out in this series.DEFINITELY do not start the series with this book. Read them in order. But if you have been with the series up until now, you will love Cerulean Sins. There are tuns of interesting plot-building transition stuff happening. I especially like the Queen of the Damned similarities."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"While the book was well written, it lacked the kick butt Anita that we all know and love. This book was way too much sex, politics and the ardeur. Anita used to have morals, and now she seems to be sleeping with everyone. Please have Anita go back to the old Anita. As a fan, my wife and I couldn't wait for the new book to be released, but we are both disappointed with this story. Ms Hamilton seems to be confusing Anita with Mary from the Fairy series. Let's get Anita back on track, and be the old kick-butt, monster killer. The story would have been better if she had been tracking the killer the whole time, and dealing with the vampires as a side story as in the earlier books."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Cerulean Sins\\" and feel it to be an improvement over the last book \\"Narcissus In Chains\\". While I like the werewolf politics that permeated Narcissus it is the vampire politics which is front and center in Cerulean Sins that I really enjoy. Jean-Claude is once again threatened by his figurative \\"blood\\" mother Belle Morte. This time Belle feels she has a claim on Anita through her connection to Jean-Claude. As anyone who reads this series knows, Anita does not like feeling owned by anyone. During this challenge Ms. Hamilton seems to be laying the foundation for a much larger future conflict and I look forward to seeing the repercussions of this installment's events. For those who enjoy the werewolf/shape-shifter aspects of this series it is in short supply in this installment. There are some Richard/ Anita scenes but this book is more about Anita beginning to come to terms with her feelings about several of the men in her life. These include Micah, Jason, Nathaniel and most centrally Asher. I think Anita is on the verge of some personal closure by the end of the novel and I am happy to see it finally come to her. Oh yeah, as if there wasn't enough going on there is a grisly serial murderer loose who may be shape shifter. Anita is asked by her police friends Dolph and Zerbrowski to assist. There are some startling revelations about one of the characters during this investigation and while it only takes up a small amount of the book it does have its place in the overall fabric of this novel. It is this sense of so much going on in these novels that makes them so darn fun to read. This is not a place for someone to start if you haven't read the previous books. In fact it is probably impenetrable if you don't know who's who from the previous books. If you've been reading since the first book \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" I think you'll be very pleased with \\"Cerulean Sins\\""},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I read this series through #10. Missed #11 and picked this up. Disappointment is a word a lot of reviewers have used. I think its just a shame that lkh has ruined such a good series. I liked anita blake. she was feisty, had 2 jobs and a real life. There were monsters and with each book she somehow managed to survive. She also had a fun relationship with the cops where she helped solve supernatural crime. I don't know know who this person is and I can't believe I missed this much in 1 book. Boring. Sex scenes can be spicy. Sex scenes without a story is boring. Such a shame. Like the movies, no one watches porn all the way through. The same goes with books. I didn't finish this. Goodbye Ardeur. (Praise God) Goodbye anita."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"280 pages or so into this book and it feels like Im reading some trashy romance novel. I started reading these books because Anita was a kick ass woman who could hold her own, solve a mystery, explored her ample yet limitted powers in order to protect herself and those she cared about. After maybe book 8 or 9, shes basically been reduced to an nymphomaniac who spends all her time jumping the bones of pretty much any preternatural person she can find. At what point in time did the author decide that giving the description of Anita performing oral sex on Jean-Claude merit more attention that the crime scene where people had been butchered was the direction these books needed to take?Will I finish this book? Sure...will I continue to read the series? Maybe, I generally finish series if I start one, which is why Im usually really carefull about what series I read. Surely this crap will get better...please let this just be one incredibly terrible book and not a shift in how all the following books are going to be like."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"If you are not a fan of the series/new to the series, this is not the book for you. If you are a long time fan of the series, this book will be a great disappointment.After the redeeming Narcissus in Chains, I thought the series was back on track. However, Cerulean Sins is just Hamilton's foray into the world of Harlequin Romance novels. The crime subplot, usually expertly weaved into the story, seems vague and tacked on. The \\"Sweet Mother\\" concept seemed a little far-fetched and unnecessary (as far-fetched as possible in a world populated with preternaturals). Richard's involvement seemed like simply a \\"Remember this guy? He's still a lame-wad who needs counseling.\\"This book is most assuredly one of the low points in an ordinarily fine series. Stick with books 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8-10 for Anita at her finest."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have always been a fan of this series, but it has gone down hill during the last two books and I am begining to lose hope of improvement. I thought NIC had been a step down in qaulity, but this one was worse. Any hint of a solid plot and strong in depth characters have been given up in favor of sex, sex, and more sex. I don't mind it here and there but if that is what I wanted to read I would buy the dime a dozen grocery store variety. This book is definatly not worth being bought in hard cover. Wait till it comes out in paperback. What happened to the idea of a good story?"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have long been a huge fan of this series, but I have to say that Cerulean Sins has let me down. I started reading the LKH books, I randomly checked Narcissus in Chains out of my local library and liked it so much that I went back to the beginning of the series and have read each book up until now. At this point, I feel like CS is a waste of my time. Lots and lots of meaningless sex and I am not even half way through. Were it not for the fact that I have all the other newer books in the series sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read, I think I might skip this installment! Sadly, and I dont know if anyone else has noticed this, the Merry Gentry series is also going the way of meaningless sex.....not sure what is going to happen but I think devoted fans are becoming somewhat fed up."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I put off reading this book because of the awful reviews. And of course all the reviewers that bashed it had a valid point. Anita has simply become a little neutotic nympho. Nothing wrong with that... It just is a little hard to read continuously. She's a character working hard at accepting herself. Jean-claude accepts her because he is pretty much at peace with himself. Richard's problem is his self hatred. This is basically why the three of them work and clash so well (and are so annoying).I won't give a bad review because I don't like where the story went... There were problems of course - but a majority of it was just my issue. The Dolph plot was sad and the mystery could have been more coherent but all in all - good.The author writes in a way that it is a fast read (though it can repeat - some plot fillers from previous books, etc). I like the world. The visit is fun. Her earlier books are much better written, but there are more characters now and perhaps too many to keep up with.And, hey, If Anita is going to be a Nympho, at least Jason got his moment...Edward needs to come back for the next book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"First of all, if you have not read any other Anita Blake book do yourself a favor and read Guilty Pleasures first. This is not the type of series that you can just pick up in the middle. Also be aware that this series is full of intense violence and sex, along with action, wit, and romance. If you liked Sigorney Weaver in Aliens then you are going to love Anita Blake!For those that have read the other 10 books, CS picks up where NIC left off and continues on in much the same vein (so to speak :-)). If you absolutely despised NIC you probably will not like CS. I thought NIC was pretty good and I liked CS even better.What I loved about CS:I love the way the characters continue to grow and develop in this book. In so many series, the main characters either stagnate or become caricatures of themselves as the series advances. But in the Anita Blake series, the characters are becoming more real and complex. It's wonderful! It's so much fun to think about what the real motivations are and where these characters will be heading. Even Richard has begun to grow and I must admit I still have hope that he and Anita will form a relationship that will be even stronger than before.I also loved the sex in this book. I thought there was just the right amount of sex and it was very erotic and well done. I never thought I would like the fact that Anita is having sex with more than one man but in CS the sex seemed very natural and relevant to the book. So many people have criticized how much sex is in CS that I went back and counted the pages. I counted approximately 27 pages of sex (in the French sense) being described. If you add in all prose of an erotic nature you probably come up to about 50 pages max. 50 Pages out of 400 does NOT seem like an excessive amount to me! Please keep up the good work Ms Hamilton (and could you try to include Damian somewhere :-)).What I didn't like about CS:Although the book is highly readable and enjoyable I saw many signs of sloppiness. The plot was rather weak and at one point there was a time disconnect. The book end B plot was not well integrated into the A plot which made it feel disconnected and abrupt. Finally, the use of a dues ex machina (once again a major character effortlessly acquires a new power) to resolve the A plot seems lazy. Please Ms Hamilton, this series is too good to shortchange it this way. Give us a plot like Guilty Pleasures along with the character development of CS and you will have one outrageously fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have been a fan of the AB novels since I worked at a bookstore 3 years ago and got hooked. After I'd read all the ones to that date,I'd salivate each time a new book came out. I loved the fact that Laurell was able to so easily incporporate magic and fantasy into a regular world setting. It was great having a female heroine who though human (she loved Sigmund) was as tough and capable as any male one. The characters personalities were all different and each novel more exciting. There was that perfect combination of action, fantasy, realism and romance. But in this last book, all the personalities seem to have changed, or become the same. Anita herself has metamorphed from a wise mouthed, capable woman, into someones chew or sex toy. The writing doesnt even read the same; She sounds more like a star struck teen then The Executioner. Since when does Anita start going goo goo eyed whenever a good looking guy is around? The language is also a bit off... A bit too graphic and way too many sex scenes. I mean, wasn't she supposed to feel guilty about sleeping with two guys at the same time, let alone having a menage a trois?Don't get me wrong, a little bit of erotica can go a long way--I know all Anita fans were cheering when she finally gave in to Jean Claude, but Ive stuck with this series because Anita was a fun, realistic hard-ass, not the herione of a Harlequin novel.I will stick with the series till the next novel comes out, hoping thinngs will change. I do think the ardeur needs to wear off though, and she has to start getting her priorites straight. Bring back some past characters and close up loose ends like Edward and Donna and Olaf, and expand on the new themes, not just tease. And Ms. Hamilton PLEASE stop making the men more feminine then the women in each passing novel! No more male make-up! You are a wonderful author but fire your editor...I found more typos then plot in this last book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"A friend and I race each other to see who can read the new book the fastest.
