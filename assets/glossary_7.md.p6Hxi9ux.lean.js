After my disastrous experience with Love Walked In I was really expecting to hate this book. Krauss immediately drew me into the story of the characters and the mystery behind all of their stories. The chapters alternate from being told by three different characters in the book and the difference between each character's storytelling methods really gives the book a 'real' quality to it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Some good things can be said about this novel. It is a book about a book, which always puts me in a positive mood.The title hero of this book, the book 'The History of Love', was written in Yiddish by a young man in love, in Poland at about the start of WW2; first published in Spanish in Chile by a friend of the original writer, a journalist refugee Pole in Valparaiso; one copy bought by an Israeli in Buenos Aires, who gave it to his English wife, who read it to their American children in New York; the mother translates it into English, and the English text somehow finds its way to the attention of now 79 year old retired locksmith Leo Gursky, who wrote it 60 years ago for Alma, who later became the mother of famous writer Isaac Moritz. The daughter of the translator is called Alma Singer. Maybe you hear the bell ring at this moment, the bell of allusions.So we have history (WW2, Holocaust) and literature and love and fate. This is all very well, but: the plot is impossibly complicated. One might, in a bad mood, call it pretentious (some have done that).Another flaw: the plot has two narrators, Alma Singer, 14, and Leo Gursky, 79. Both contemporary in New York. And both sound like teenagers. There may be system behind that, but it is not convincing. Let's face it, the narration sounds like 'young adult' fiction.Should a young writer nowadays even try to tackle such a complicated and complex 'historical' subject? I have serious doubts about that. It is very hard to be 'original' about these subjects. There should be a very good reason to go there again. I do not see that very good reason in this case. And I am a friend of simplicity anyway. Making a plot more complex does not make it better."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I cannot believe how many people have claimed that this book is \\"confusing\\" and yet also claim that they didn't finish it. It's a book. That means you have to read it all the way through to truly understand it. If it's a good book, that is. Which this is.Of course it's going to seem a bit confusing at first, and even more confusing towards the middle, but that's where the excitement lies in good novels, especially in a novel like this. It keeps you interested and curious and intrigued.I read this book in a single sitting because I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to unravel the mystery and discover the connection between all of the characters and, of course, the point of the book.It's a beautifully told story, and the ending is fantastic. An ending that really does justify all the confusion that populates much of the book.For those who passed judgment on this book before having finished it, I urge you to give it another chance. This is definitely one of the better novels to come out in recent years."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This novel gets off to a magnificent start with the story of Leo Gursky, a very old Polish-American refugee living in New York. Leo's story is heart-wrenching, one all of us hope not to have. He is completely alone and each day does something to make himself stand out so that people will know he is alive. He fears dying all alone in his apartment and no one finding him until the stench alerts them. Whether it's knocking over displays in a grocery store or posing nude for an art class, Leo strives to be seen. Long ago, Leo had been in love with Alma. Their love was ended by the Holocaust. Both escaped to America, but when Leo finally found Alma, it was too late for their love to resume. He spends his entire life regretting the loss of her and their son. He is an extremely sad but well-written and sympathetic character who narrates many of the chapters.Other chapters are narrated primarily by Alma, a young Jewish teen in New York, who is determined to pull her mother out of the emptiness her life has become since Alma's father died. Along with her quirky younger brother, they exemplify the heartache of losing a parent when the surviving parent just can't cope. Alma knows that she has been named after a character in a book called \\"The History of Love\\" and becomes obsessed with finding the other Alma.The plot is multi-layered and in its final stages links the young Alma to the dying Leo in a somewhat confusing but tearful ending. The story was sometimes hard to follow, the numerous characters and their link to others sometimes tricky to comprehend. While I did enjoy it, I like a nice, tidy ending with all loose strings tied up. This is not that kind of novel. If you revel in unanswered questions, ambiguous situations and characters, and drawing your own conclusions, you will enjoy this much more than I did."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss has created a beautiful book. Her characters have depth, reality, and cadence. Her plot is complex without being confusing, and accomplishes not only her narrative goals but also seems vitally appropriate to the characters who drive it. It's creative in the vein of Everything is Illuminated. It's clever in the vein of Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. It pays homage to the philosophies that inspired it, for the academic who sleeps inside of us.A carefully crafted and beautiful masterpiece."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The book is written in the first person voice, half as a fourteen year old girl trying to cheer up her widowed mother, and half as an old man whose only wish is to communicate with his son before death. These two characters are in no sense related. The two do not know of each other; in fact their lives could not be further apart. The only thing they share in common is a book titled the History of Love. To Alma (the 14 year old) the book is the link between his mother and deceased father. To Leo (the old man), the book was once a dedication to his first love.The way the author brings these two characters alive, and the way she brings them ultimately together is nothing short from surprising. After starting reading, I never once lost interest in following the narrative. I enjoyed watching (reading) Alma maturing, as well as watching Leo grow wiser. I found both of their voices genuine, and pursuance of their respective quests heart-warming.Upon finishing the book's last chapter I felt like lending a hand to help heal the two."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"\\"Wait a minute, didn't I just read this book?\\"That was what was going through my head as I got about half-way through \\"History of Love.\\" Let me see...the old man haunted by the past, the precocious child, traumatized mom, European tragedy, typographical tricks--why, it's \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\"! With a sinking feeling, as parallel mounted on parallel, I realized that Krauss had basically recycled her husband Jonathan Safran Foer's most recent book, with a dash of his first book's shtetl magical realism thrown in. Perhaps this is some kind of postmodern stunt the two dreamed up, but I still felt cheated. Especially since the first section of the book, about an old man in New York and his relationship with his best friend, showed so much promise. Krauss brings the two men to life with vigor and humor and exhibits sparks of a talent in that section that eclipses her husband's arduous whimsy. Three stars for that alone. She never hits Foer's brilliant highs, but also never comes close to his mawkish lows. But since I just read \\"Extremely Loud\\" a few weeks ago, I was in no mood for Foer-style hijinks, and as soon as Krauss started hitting the familiar notes, I tuned out. Trust your instincts and your own unique talent next time, Nicole.(Caveat emptor: if you see five-star reviews from people who've only written one review, that a sign that friends/family/agents are puffing up the book's ranking. This book is obviously the recipient of a powerful PR push.)"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I bought this book because of all the great reviews it received, but I am very disappointed with the story. The novel is very interesting the entire way through and I really expected it to build up to something big, but I felt the ending fell flat. The story is a puzzle, and the reader continues turning the pages to find out how all the pieces finally fit together, but then is left feeling unsatisfied. It seemed to me that the author focused on the complicated narrative structure rather than creating a meaningful story that touches the reader."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss' \\"History Of Love\\" is one of the most poignant and beautiful novels I have read in many moons - dare I say years? I do not exaggerate. Her prose is pure poetry, and her writing is a wonderful example of literature as an art form. Although this is not a Holocaust novel, per se, the Shoah casts a long shadow over the narrative. I think the book is much more a remembrance of those who died, a memorial of sorts, than a book about death. Actually, the themes here are love, survival and loss. I shed many a tear while reading, sometimes because of the author's exquisite use of language, and others because of a character's terrible sadness, but I found myself bursting into laughter more often than not at the wonderful humor. Some of the dialogue is especially witty. Oddly, I was reminded of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's work. Perhaps the sense of wonder Ms. Krauss conveys, along with elements of fantasy which intertwine with reality, form a kind of magical realism.\\"The first woman may have been Eve, but the first girl will always be Alma.\\" So wrote young, aspiring author Leopold Gursky. He actually wrote three books before he was twenty-one, before WWII invaded his hometown of Slonim, which was located \\"sometimes in Poland, and others in Russia.\\" Now, years later in Brooklyn, NY, Leo has no idea what happened to his manuscript, \\"The History Of Love,\\" his most important work. He wrote the novel about the only thing he knew, his love for Alma. \\"Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering.\\" He continued to write their story long after Alma's father sent her to America, where she would be safe from the Nazis. He even wrote after the Germans pushed East, toward his home.At age eighty, Leo feels compelled to make himself seen at least once a day. He fears dying alone in his apartment, on a day when no one sees him at all. And he is capable of doing some pretty outrageous things to garner attention, including posing in the nude for a life drawing class. Ever since the war he has felt invisible. He survived by becoming invisible. And now, he needs to be sure he exists. When he came to America, his cousin, a locksmith took him in and taught him the trade. He did so because he knew Leo could not remain invisible forever. \\"Show me a Jew that survives and I'll show you a magician,\\" he used to say. Leo finds some solace in his work. \\"In my loneliness it comforts me to think that the world's doors, however closed, are never truly locked to me.\\" Unbeknownst, to Leopold Gursky, his book has survived also, and has inspired others in many ways, especially to love.Alma Singer is a precocious teenager who lives in New York City. She is named for all the female characters in her father's favorite book, \\"A History of Love.\\" Singer, an Israeli, bought the only copy in a store in Buenos Aires, while traveling in South America. Alma's mother, Charlotte, is an Englishwoman who met her husband while working on a kibbutz in Israel. He gave her the book, a gift, when he realized how much he cared for her. He died of pancreatic cancer when Alma was seven. Seven years later, his family is still adjusting to their loss. The sensitive girl desperately wants to ease her mother's loneliness. She also wants to learn how to survive in the wilderness, and help her brother, Bird, be a normal boy. Bird believes he may be the Messiah. Charlotte, a translator, receives a request from an anonymous stranger to translate an obscure book by a Polish exile, Zvi Litvinoff, who immigrated to Chile. She accepts the commission. The book, written in Spanish, is titled \\"The History of Love.\\" Alma reads her mom's English translation and sets out to find her namesake. Her literary detective work is hilarious and her tenacity is admirable.Ms. Krauss is a master at linking her various storylines seamlessly. Her characters are a delight - all vivid and memorable for their humanity, their eccentricity, and their inner strength. The author brings them to life on the page. They have all experienced sorrow and loss, yet there is not a self-pitying voice among them. And it is impossible not to love Leo Gursky. I hear my grandmother's voice, at times, when he speaks. She died years ago, and was probably a generation older than the author's grandparents, to whom the novel is dedicated.I plan to reread \\"The History of Love\\" in a few weeks, over a weekend when I won't be disturbed. I made the mistake of taking the book with me to work, and between the train and the office, I felt the numerous interruptions seriously detracted from the glorious flow of the language. This is a novel which is meant to be read more than once, anyway. ENJOY!JANA"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend and had such high hopes for it. This book really had the potential to be a great novel. It had love. It had numerous stories that start out spaced far apart, but come together in the end. It has mystery and hope and all of that good-book-nonsense. I REALLY wanted to love it.Instead- I spent most of my time confused. I had to assume things in order to let myself mentally move on in the book. The ending did tie a few loose ends together (for which I am very grateful), but it still wasn't enough for me.I would only recommend this book if you can remember every small detail, every small hint, so that it can help you to understand it all in the end. This book can't be read in small chunks of time- I would say only three or four at most. It would be good for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Just pay attention to the details- they really do count in this book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is another one of those books that is OK, but leaces you essentially indifferent to your overall reading experience. The books seems to have done well commercially, but I'm not sure that is a measure of good fiction these days. Krauss seems to have written a novel with some interesting plots and subplots, but one that ultimately failed for me primarily because it seemed like the kind of book I've already read at some time. This book primarily reminded me of \\"Bee Season\\" (maybe because of it's Jewish themes) with some smatterings of \\"Housekeeping\\" and \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\\" There were so many instances where I found myself drifting off and not even paying attention to what was going on to the characters because I found myself not caring, which in fact is a real shame considering some of the interesting turn of events that take place and some of the decent prose.The story intertwines two very different people - Alma, a teenage girl living with her strange brother Bird and mother who is suffering from depression following her husband's death, and Leo, a Holocaust survivor/escapee who spends his life pining over the love of his life. Their lives slowly creep towards one another, connecting and crossing over in some creative ways, but what bothered me was how labored everything seemed. I could actually feel how hard Krauss was trying to make everything seem so interesting and so neat the way her husband is able to do (albeit in a much much much better manner). I think the novel would have been more successful if she had tried to put away any attempts (or dreams) of completing a surreal novelistic experience a la Foer or Auster and instead have produced something that would emphasize the strengths of her writing - which in my opinion involves her ability to create interesting characters and perspectives. In other words, she shouldn't have tried so hard to play with form and plot, simply because the finished product is kind of average at best. The end was quite problematic for me as I thought she was making a last ditch effort to save the novel by coming up with an interesting and thought provoking ending.Ah well, I think you should pass on this unless you are desparate."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is one of those books that when you finish reading it you're still thinking about it. It appears to leave a lot of questions, but most of the answers were in the book very subtly. The surface is simple to read though somewhat disjointed. However, with more depth the connections are very beautiful.Not a breezy summer read, but not particularly difficult either. I would recommend this to people who are looking for something that isn't too difficult, but still intellectually stimulating."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a book about a book called The History of Love; and both books, are simply put, utterly spectacular.A few pages into this story and I knew I had fallen. Page 11 reads: \\"when will you learn that there isn't a word for everything?\\" This is precisely how I feel. At a loss for words. It is hard to find a single flaw in this book. The writing is so beautiful, so real and so endearing be it in its implicit humor, innocence or compellingly complex cast of characters who are so perfectly constructed and so well thought out.I fell for Krauss's ability to mold words into pure whimsy, especially in the first few pages. The author casts all her characters in a wonderful light, especially our heroes Alma and Leo Gursky. Leo possesses the imagination of a child; allowing his thoughts to transform any situation into a reality that is no more than life viewed through his own metaphorically inventive pair of glasses. His own thoughts haunt him for his lonely disposition makes it easy for him to believe in the power of his own thinking. There is no one to question the thoughts that his fickle mind spews. It is him and his psyche and together they conquer his complicated life. Young Alma on the other hand is his antithesis. She is composed and pragmatic and brave in her endeavors - but they share one common thread that is at the very heart of this tale.The History of Love tells the tale of Leo Gursky, an elderly Polish immigrant in New York City. Like any Jew who lived through the Holocaust, Leo has lived a difficult life. Yet he perseveres. His fear of dying a stranger to this world clutches at his throat and empowers him to be the nuisance that he is. Behind his ragged and cynical exterior however is a man of kindness. At heart, he is a writer - an escapist from truth and a creator of make-believe. Old age finds him reclaiming that skill as a means of making his mark on this earth. While he claims to be doing it purely for himself, we know better than to believe that. Two chapters into the book and we are transported into a wonderfully twisted novel that culminates in the ultimate finale. This book will not let you down.It is difficult for me to review this book without giving away any of its beauty. All I can say is, if you don't already own this book, buy it and read it and gift it. Let the History of Love live on."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss is a pro at observing little things about all facets of life from the little gestures we make, to the way we say things that don't come out quite right and then we're mad at ourselves for what we've said (or not said). Obviously, she has lived and watched and empathized with the characters she so elegantly writes about. There are really two main characters in the book, an old man (Leo) who is trying hard to still matter and to perhaps have a relationship with a son he lost through the war through separation and the marriage of his soulmate Sara to another man. He is a very intelligent and sensitive soul, creative, a writer and locksmith, but has really only survived and has never grown after he lost Sara so many years ago. We observe the world from his old and weary perspective as he tries to make sense of his life and the existence of a book very similar to a book he wrote in his youth.The other character is an insightful 14 year old girl who lives with a damaged yet intelligent mother and younger brother who thinks he may be a religious icon. Her name is Sara. The two main characters, Leo and Sara become connected through the book \\"The History of Love\\" and the plot gradually unfolds.I loved the way Krauss tells the story through the diaries of these two main characters and from their totally different perspectives. I felt love and empathy for both character almost like I have been in their shoes or will be in Leo's shoes as I age.It was a touching, interesting well told story. I will be watch for her next book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The book got off to a real good start. The old man named Leo was interesting -- fascinating in fact -- and I was enjoying reading about him when -- whammo! -- the book turned topsy-turvey and I couldn't figure out what was happening or who was who. As one of the other reviewers noted, I kept wondering when we were going to get back to Leo. Somehow or other we got sidetracked into reading about some other people who weren't at all interesting and about a book within a book whose relevance to anything else was mystifying. I guess this is literature, huh? Anyhow, the author can string words together real well and her tales about Leon were, as I said, fascinating. But around page 100 I got tired of trying to figure out this maze of a book and tossed it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This books works on so many levels that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what I liked the most about it.On the strictly writing level, the book is well crafted and the flow is incredibly smooth and comforting. The words flow over you like a soothing warm soak in the mediterranean. The means by which this flow of language is accomplished is anything but simple. The way Krauss uses the language is impressive and atounding. She has worked it so that the out of the ordinary and difficult seem effortless and natural.On the plot level, the story is complex and engrossing. Krauss has made the story convoluted enough to grab and hold one's attention without seeming to be trying very hard. Her plotting is such that short and concise explanations that are introduced in the middle of the narrative gives information and at the same time seem an integrated part of the story without it seeming like an author's patchwork fix for an intractable problem. John Grisham should be taking notes here.The structure of the narrative, the juxtoposition of the intertwining stories, is a familiar plotting device, and sometimes Krauss had problems maintaining the suave and smooth transitions but she did well enough not to inpede the flow of thew reader's attention, which is an astounding achievement indeed.And finally, the ambition of the book itself is impressive. I have not read her husband's book, but I know that I love this book, his better be simply sublime before it can supplant this book in my mind."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I won't finish this book. It strikes me as another version of Everything Is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Froer and really, once was more enough for me."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"If this wasn't a mandatory read for school, then I wouldn't have read this piece of junk in the first place. The plot was disjointed, jumping around character POV and writing styles. If a better plot was used then maybe the author may have been able to pull this off but in the scope of boring OLD john everyman this book was boring. Understanding without something like sparknotes is also a colossal challenge. When a read is mandatory I expect a well written piece of literature, not some half baked mockery of a book. I don't know why but instead of love, this book gave me intense hatred."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The more our book club discussed this book the more intrigued we became.

I think it is enjoyable and entertaining and heartfelt. I got so wrapped up in it that after I finished, I didn't read anything else for quite a while. This is why I love Nicole Krauss and Jonathan Safran Foer. I've read all of both of their books and each one leaves me with the same feeling. This book has so many tiny references to Foer and to his books and I underlined each one. I think it's sweet that she acknowledges him so many time in this precious story.The story is easy to fall in love with and keeps you interested.

And I have to admit that after I started the book, I was a little annoyed. Yet Another novel written by a hip young writer from the POV of an aging Holocaust survivor. How many of these can be written before we approach some kind of critical mass of ridiculousness?Anyhow. I quickly forgave Krauss for this. She's a smooth and skilled stylist, and there was something really engaging about the work that made me forgive my initial doubts. For the first half of the book anyhow. There were several places where she could easily have pulled her punches or descended into sentimentality, and she did not.In the end, I'm still not sure how I feel about the book. It was a decent reading experience and there were moments where I was really moved. It is, at least, not a *bad* book.Or, mostly not a bad book. For all the things I liked about it, there was one thing that I really really hated. I found the occasional experimentally formatted chapters (they get much thicker towards the end) to be annoying, overly precious, trite, pointless and... well... annoying some more. It felt the opposite of organic and much like trickery for trickery's sake.Anyhow. Good things and bad things.

I knew the plot lines and characters would somehow come together...but always felt like I was about 2 steps behind the author.

But in this, sometimes a feeling is expressed so well, that I found myself nodding in agreement.\\"Yesterday I saw a man kicking a dog and I felt it behind my eyes. I don't know what to call this, a place before tears. The pain of forgetting: spine. The pain of remembering: spine.\\"Krauss takes on a major challenge in her characters...she voices a World War II survivor, a fifteen-year old girl, a twelve-year old boy and a few others...and makes them authentic. Their voices are very clear and very convincing.From Leo, the old man: \\"If we do talk, we never speak in Yiddish. The words of our childhood became strangers to us - we couldn't use them in the same way and so we chose not to use them at all. Life demanded a new language.\\"He's experienced such grief, such horrors in his life that he was never able to fully live it.\\"After she left, everything fell apart. No Jew was safe. There was rumors of unfathomable things, and because we couldn't fathom them we failed to believe them, until we had no choice and it was too late.\\"He remains trapped in the past, searching for that which he lost, and creating the answers that he can, either through words or imagination.While I believe Leo is truly the main character of the book, for it is about him that the major revelations are made - I was drawn more to Alma, the girl who is searching for answers about her life after the death of her father. Where Leo has had many years to search and reflect and live, she is still trying to find a way in the world, some idea of how to become her own person.Her voice is at times so childlike and bewildered...but there is an underlying strength that leads one to believe that given time, she will get where she needs to go.\\"It wasn't that far, so I decided to walk, and while I did, I imagined rooms all over the city that housed archives no one had ever heard of, like last words, white lies, and false descendants of Catherine the Great.\\"There are not many answers to be found in \\"The History of Love\\"...but the questions that are asked and the way they are phrased should be familiar to us all.

It took me longer to read this book due to all the back tracking and re-reading I had to do. The second half of the book brings the story together and overall the plot is wonderful. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone without a disclaimer regarding the complicated story line. It is well worth the read but at times difficult to follow and confusing. I encourage anyone to push through to the end as it pulls everything together."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a story about a man, Leopold Gursky, who lost everything because of the Holocaust. His love for his childhood sweetheart, and their child, who was adopted by another man, gave him something to live for. The resolution of many betrayals in this book would not be satisfying in life, but within the context of this novel, played themselves out wonderfully.There has recently been a spate of books using the Holocaust as background. Unless there are unused, insightful ways to use the Holocaust, this can be tedious. The betrayals in \\"The History Of Love\\" are differently portrayed than others I've read and unfortunately show novel ways people could have been victimized.Krauss is a skillful writer who lets each character play himself out without sentimentality, and perfectly within the parameters of her story. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This story is one of the most complex I can recall since reading John Barth. The way the author weaves together the stories and perspectives of a 90 year old man who appears to have given up on life and a 16 year old girl who is grasping at it is initially confusing but ultimately amazingly gratifying. The story becomes an intricate tapestry of coincidences and inter-relationships that tie together the lost love of Leo, memorialized in a book, and the lives of Alma Singer and her widowed mother. The story is told, at times, in the most pedestrian manner, but a heart-rending love story emerges from the details. The final scene is deeply affecting."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"If I break into a crying jag ONE MORE TIME while I'm working out on the elliptical, I'm gonna have a conniption, which won't help the crying jag one bit! This is all my friend Eve's fault because she keeps recommending tearjerkers. Not sappy maudlin ones, but tender, revelatory tales of the danger and beauty (and yes, the history) of love.Nicole Krauss ends her novel on such a poetic, jubilant note that the last 20 pages alone were well worth the somewhat circuitous, yet captivating route to get there."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This started off very slow for me. It had me quite perplexed, actually, because generally speaking, I either love a book or hate it. And this had me doing both. I would read twenty pages of pure literary brilliance, and then would be bored to death and struggling through it. It wasn't a book that had me rushing back to read, but it was definitely worth it in the end.A lovely read that you should give a fair chance to redeem itself."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a great book. Krauss writes fearlessly about love and death. The pursuit of love and the avoidance of death are the two big impulses behind most of our activity on earth, and are the two big themes of literature, as well. Krauss writes in a whole new way about the joy and the sorrow, the hope and the fear, that go along with love and death, and she adds in something beautiful: how we use words to try to control both love and death, to further our happiness, stave off our misery, and find a bearable truth in the sometimes unbearable reality of living. Despite the heavy themes, there is a good deal of humor and good-natured spirit in \\"The History of Love\\". It is a survival manual of sorts, not so different from the \\"How to Survive in the Wild\\" guide treasured by one of the characters in the book.All the characters in the book have known death, the truth of which they are trying to deal with, and love, the pursuit of which they have run from or are fully engaged in. They use words -- as Leopold writes, \\"words for everything\\" -- to avoid the truth or to confront the truth of death, and to find for themselves a safe place for love to be. Words in the book are translated, they are hidden away, they are plagiarized and they are revealed: through all the manifestations, the words are powerful. And when the words are too powerful, gestures take over the role of communication: one tap (no) or two taps (yes) to convey answers to a lifelong question. Is love worth it? Two taps.\\"The History of Love\\" is the story of Leo Gursky: \\"He was a great writer. He fell in love. It was his life.\\" And it is the story of every person affected by the book he wrote for the woman he loved: the friend who lost everyone and to find someone again, stole the story; Alma, the woman who starred, again and again, in the story (she is the soul of the story, as \\"alma\\" means soul in Spanish); the son who had the story read to him and only too late comes to understand its significance; a different Alma, trying to help her mother find love again, trying to help her brother Bird be normal and not be a chosen one, and trying to understand the life of a woman who left Poland, leaving love behind, and began love and life all over again.Krauss' characters range in age from very old to very young, and include the dead who live on vividly in memory. They are all distinctly drawn as very real humans, with fear and sadness, desires and weaknesses. The ones left alive have a will to survive, some stronger than others, and their unfailing strength to pursue a path they do not completely understand -- to finally share the book written about \\"everything\\", to plant a garden, to go to a house in Connecticut, to attend a funeral, or hunt through old city records in a series of dusty offices -- will, in the end, bring them knowledge and maybe even some peace, before the end.This is a life-affirming, heart and tear duct pumping, and even funny at times, wonderful book about the power of words. The power comes from the people who write the words, the people who inspire the stories, and the people who read the words, becoming inspired themselves. \\"The History of Love\\" is joyous song in favor of the mind and the heart and the body and the soul, and the celebration that occurs when all four work together, the celebration called love.For more reviews, go to www.readallday.org"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A book about the way memory is carried across generations, how threads are dropped and picked up, how we write one another's stories, as well as our own.An old man, most of whose life has slipped away from him: his family dead in the holocaust; his childhood sweetheart married to another man; his novel, a labor of love, lost; his biological son unaware of his existence.A young teenage girl, emotionally neglected by her widowed mother, missing her father who died of cancer, riding the ups and downs of clueless teen dating, scientifically minded and obsessed with \\"how to survive in the wild,\\" desperately trying to fix her mother's sadness and her younger brother's mental health problems.Two exquisitely sad stories, connected by a thin thread that gets thicker and thicker as the novel develops, coming together in a luminous, redemptive ending, where the old man learns that his life has not gone unnoticed. Though he may have experienced his life as \\"unlived,\\" his life actually continued and wove into the lives of others through the medium of writing.Normally, I read the first chapter of a novel and flip to the end. If knowing the plot makes me feel done, then I know the writing and ideas haven't engaged me. But The History of Love tricked me: I couldn't even understand the ending until I read the whole book! And that kept me going, even at points where I wondered in frustration when and how the pieces would come together.This is a beautiful book for anyone who loves to write, for anyone who is interested in holocaust literature, in memory, in experimental fiction.The author's command of the different voices is uneven; it can't compare, for example, to Barbara Kingsolver's work in The Poisonwood Bible. But Krauss is a young writer, who has crafted a work of great depth and complexity. I look forward to reading more as she writes more."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is about at least two persons: Leo Gursky and Alma Singer, both living in New York. Leo is an old Polish-American jew and Alma is a 12-15 year old girl, who has lost her father and is living with her intellectual mother and her religious kid brother. But the book has many more layers. It is not hard to follow....but then again, maybe it is hard to follow all the layers. It is not until the last pages, or close to the last pages, that all loose ends are being tied and you actually understand what has been going on - or rather why it has been going on.Leo is a refugee - he made his way to America in his youth, trying to get away from the nazis in Europe and ended in New York. He immediately find that girl he fell in love with back home in Poland and who had gone to America before him. But when their first meeting in New York does not go well, Leo (tries to) forget all about her and abandons every though of seeing her ever again.But in the next many, many years to come, he still follows her and her family from the hidden siedlines.Alma, the young girl, has one simple wish, and that is that her mother will come out of her loneliness and find happiness again.When her mother is asked to translate a certain book - The History of Love\\" - Alma hopes that the man who has asked for the translation, perhaps could be a good match for her mother. It is because of this book that Leo's and Alma's lives are connected, but before that happens, all characters are going to go through a lot.This very short review really does not show just how complex this book is. There are all the layers that I mentioned before and many more persons than mentioned here. I didn't really get through this book as easily as I had expected and actually I really do not know what I think about it. But it wasn't a bad read at all."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Just want to share that this is the best fiction I've read in as long as I can remember. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"That's the case with the \\"History of Love\\". Its author thought that the book he wrote decades earlier was irretrievably lost. Instead, it had survived and traveled extensively, touching and changing the life of those who read it.I especially liked the character of old Leo Gursky, drawn vividly to say the least, a touching, funny and simultaneously heartbreaking personality, who never forgot his first and only love. She had fled their native Poland during the Holocaust to go to New York and, by the time he is able to reach her, and learns that he has a son, it's too late.On the other side of town (we're in contemporary New York), a young girl named Alma is currently reading the translation her mother is doing of the \\"History of Love\\" -a book she knew had influenced her parents' lives- hoping that by finding out the identity of the man who had requested the translation would help her mother to find love again after her husband's untimely death. Alma cannot yet know that the plan she has in mind will unravel an unexpected path.Emotional twists & turns unfold for both these main characters, old Leo and young Alma. Without knowing each other and unbeknownst to them, their lives and those of their loved ones are tied by the same rope.A tender and often wrenching story about Love in all of its forms. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 (in the absence of that \\"half mark\\" which I find could be useful), is that, at times, I had to concentrate not to mix up the various characters described, despite their obvious pertinence to the story, especially in the middle of the book. A bit confusing.On the other hand, I did appreciate the thin but strong line between past and present, with an original juxtaposition and an elegant prose. It all comes together in the end and the message is incredibly moving."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Impeccable flow. You can't help but love the main characters with the descriptive character development."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreaking all at the same time. One of the best written books I've read in years. I totally fell in love with the main character who is a bit of a dirty old man (literally). Who knew this was possible?"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I loved this book. It is a voyage through the separate lives of Leo Gursky, the love of his life-Alma, Leo's friend-Litvinoff, and a fifteen year-old girl-Alma Singer. THE HISTORY OF LOVE (the novel within the novel) causes their interests to intersect and join.The book begins with a depiction of Leo Gursky (told in a first person narration). He is in the later years of his life. He lives a mundane existence and wants to be noticed. When he was a youth in Poland, he fell in love with a girl-Alma. They pledged their love, but were separated by the Nazis. After five years, they meet in New York, but she thought that he was dead-so she married another man. Leo never forgot Alma, and watched from a distance as their son, Issac, grew up.Next is the tale of Alma Singer (also told with a first person narration). Her mother is paid to translate THE HISTORY OF LOVE for a Jacob Marcus (later discovered to be Issac-Leo's son). Alma searches for clues of what the novel means.Next, the live of Litvonoff (told in a third person narration) is portrayed. He is entrusted with the manuscript for THE HISTORY OF LOVE, but rationalizes that the author may be dead (he is not). He decides to copy the book-to say it is his work (plagiarize) to impress a girl.The lives of Gursky, the girl-Alma Singer, and Litvinoff come together. The true author of THE HISTORY OF LOVE is revealed when Alma Singer and Leo Gursky meet.My book isDreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxia"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I wondered, as I read other readers' reviews of Krauss's surprising novel, why people seem so convinced she stole her characters and writing style from her husband, rather than the other way around. I read Foer's novels before Krauss's and must say, I think it's Krauss who exhibits the greater gifts (and more discipline), although I agree, the similarities in their work are a little disconcerting -- could they have done this on purpose? Writers in love and out of ideas, sharing and thieving in the dead of a Brooklyn night? There is a mutual taste of indulging a stream of consciousness tone that makes me wonder about their writing teachers, whom I'm guessing they shared -- between these two and Zadie Smith, I shudder for the future of fiction writing, in which every run-at-the-mouth, aren't-I-talented bad habit replaces discipline and craft. Nicole Krauss has a real gift, though, which makes the flaws all the more aggravating. I, too, was more moved by Leo's story than Alma's, and I agree you need a road map to follow the plot (and was she watching 'The Sixth Sense' one night when she came up with that final twist??). Still, there are moments of such unexpected grace here that I look forward to her next book, which will, hopefully, stand on its own and will not invite comparisons to her husband's work."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I don't really think this book deserves five stars because, as others have mentioned, it is highly flawed. In fact, about half way through, I became so irritated by the overly precious, twee style and quirky-yet-loveable characters that I almost didn't finish it. (The scenes in Buenos Aires were especially hard to bear).Then, about three quarters of the way through, a plot twist occurred that nearly took my breath away. It caused me to reevaluate everything that had come before, and became a kaleidoscopic lens through which the book's central puzzle could be arranged and rearranged in seemingly limitless combinations. Some may say that the twist was nothing more than an exceedingly clever trick, but I was thoroughly enchanted. By the end, I was willing to forgive anything, even the sentimentality that was so sweet and gooey at times that it made my teeth ache."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"From the title, I had fairly low expectations of the book I ordered, but it was on our book club list, so I had a strong mandate to read it, regardless of my initial impressions.I was happily surprised-finished the book in two evenings, as I really couldn't put it down. It bogs down now and then, but picks up often enough to keep one engaged and waiting/anticipating the next turn of events. I rate books on the story and the writing style, and it is rarer than I'd like that both combine in one book-this one did-and I really enjoyed the read!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Although I read this book months ago, I can't stop thinking about it. Beautifully written, and easily read, this book weaves the lives of the coming of age and the young at heart in an unique, creative story between a preteen girl and an elderly man. I love how the author puts you in the mind of 80-something year old Leo Gursky. Upon reading this many would want to hear the stories and memoirs of a forgotten generation.A real heart tugger, esp. the finale. This book should not be missed."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book sat on my shelf for 3 months before I finally picked it up and once I started it, it was devoured within 24 hours. For some reason I had it in my head that it would be a very formulaic novel, as her husband is Jonathan Safran Foer and I heard somewhere that they fed off of each other's ideas. But what I found here was an extremely original work that wove two lives together in a highly creative way.I always loved books about books and literary people, and here is a great example. We also get a great feel of history and culture, much of it revolving around Leo's past during the Holocaust, and both Leo's and Alma's Jewish heritage.I only wish I had been as intuitive and wise as age 15 as Alma was. And I can only hope I don't become as jaded as Leo, whom surprisingly I felt a great deal of sympathy for. Much like The Poisonwood Bible, we experience a narrative from multiple perspectives which, in the end, come together leaving the reader wanting more. While Alma's and Leo's lives don't intersect until the final pages, I was left with a desire to witness their forthcoming relationship. But Krauss leaves us with a sense of satisfaction that we can draw our on conclusions and whatever we want to believe is the right ending.Kudos to a touching story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I found this book fascinating. The structure leads us mysteriously through the maze of life of simple people, who wind up extraordinary due to the authors exceptional writing ability. I stopped three quarters of the way through, waiting a few days, because I didn't want to let these people go. I have incorporated them into my thoughts...and a very enriching incorporation it is. Thank you to Ms. Krauss. I'm looking forward to reading her other book and anything else she might write. I will also reread The History of Love, many more times in the future. I would give it 1000 stars if I could."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Great read - I loved the intertwined narratives...Goes really well with \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" by Jonathan Safran Foer, Krauss's husband - you can tell the two discussed their subject matter while writing the books: imagine two books which begin with all the same ingredients but end up as two totally different stories."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I have not been so impressed with a book in a very long time. I savored every page & it never disappointed."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Unable to walk away from the characters (who are so deeply made known...and so quickly), I finished this book within 24 hours of purchasing it. The gradually unveiling of \\"the truth,\\" the richness of the characters, the universality of the pain and joy...I was in suspense and awe throughout the entire novel. I will read this again immediately. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is quite frankly one of the best books I have ever read. Leo Gursky is a character that I am fairly certain exists in real life and his story is powerful, enchanting, lovely and sad. I loved this book soo much. It's a very interesting and wonderful book that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Beautiful story, well written, engaging, heartbreaking and lovely. Overall, one of my favorite books of this year."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl. The History of Love is far from what you expect it to be - it is not a simple love story about two people falling in love, breaking up, getting back together and living happily ever after. It's far from that , actually. The History of Love is a beautifully written intricate tale of the fate of two very different strangers and how their lives connect. It takes you from Nazi invaded Poland, to current day New York City. Story number #1 centers around Leo Gursky, an old, old, old Jewish immigrant just trying to live until tomorrow. He reflects often about a girl he loved back in Poland and wants to be remembered. Story #2 shows young Alma who is trying to make her mother happy and fall in love. Her mother, a book translator, lost her husband, Alma's father, many years ago and her only companion is an old book called \\"The History of Love.\\" Knowing that, Alma tries to find information about the book. The story is heartbreaking and beautiful. You're involved in it up to the very last word. In a book where many stories take place, all separate, it's amazing how they all connect together lovingly in the end. I'm really excited to read every other book Krauss wrote and will write."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I'm always a little put off when a first-person narrator is the opposite sex from the author. Still, I managed to embrace Leo Gursky, a Holocaust survivor, and got a sense of his personality, thanks in part to his one- and two-word sentences, such as \\"And yet.\\" Plus, the narrator's voice flips between Leo's and that of Alma Singer, a teenage girl who's into survival techniques. Alma is named for a character in a book which her father, now deceased, gave to her mother. Now Alma's mother is translating the book from Spanish to English for a man named whose identity remains a mystery until the end. The stories of Leo and Alma Singer start to become intertwined when we find that Leo had a girlfriend named Alma in Poland, who preceded him in fleeing to the U.S. There's also Bird Singer, who thinks he's possibly the Messiah and earns his nickname by trying to fly. The story is convoluted but in a good way. At the end, I wanted to wrap this book in a big, warm hug. Also, the fact that there's a minor character who is apparently imagined made me want to read it all over again."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"So, there's lots of reviews telling the plot of the book, I'm sure you know by now or else you could scroll up and read Amazon's description.What I'm going to tell you is that Krauss and her husband, Jonathan Safran Foer, are changing literature, for the better.They are the contemporaries, and they will become the classics. their books are layered with incredible literaray devices that weave philosophy, character studies, unique imagination and analysis on writing itself, into a giant beautiful ball. These books need care and study to fully unravel, just like the classics we read today in English classes.Those who oppose this book, and Foer's books, oppose progress and are afraid of change. Embrace their techniques, even if used in overabundance (ask why they would do that, ask why they change narration so often, etc.), embrace their characters (ask why they are so unrealistic and still so relatable), and most importantly embrace their imagination.This book, or Everything is Illuminated, should be required high school reading."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This was the first novel in 10 years that I wanted to re-read immediately after finishing it the first time through. The prose is remarkable and the story touching."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is by far my favorite novel of the year. Every word is packed with emotion and meaning. Krauss's writing is spare and lyrical. I found myself laughing out loud and crying hard enough to reach for a tissue, sometimes both emotions occurring within pages of one another. Leo's Yiddish/NY \\"voice\\" is astonishing; I felt like I was there with him. The conclusion, when young Alma finally meets Leo, will absolutely melt your heart.One of my favorite passages occurs when Alma and Bird's mother takes them to the movies and Bird eats his entire package of Milk Duds before the end of the opening credits, runs up and down the aisles on a sugar high, and finally collapses in the front row. A few pages later, Leo attends his son's funeral and finds a photo of himself with Alma, his childhood love in Poland. The description made me weep.Please read this book! You will look at the world differently, I guarantee it. And, you will appreciate life more."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This tale is woven together so masterfully it's nearly impossible to put down. The characters and their distinct voices are rich, unique, and memorable in a way that has worked into my own personal history of the love of reading.We begin by getting to know \\"the oldest man in the world,\\" Leopold Gursky. There's an ironic aspect to \\"Leo\\" as he attempts to make himself known to the world everyday. He's afraid he'll die and no one will know he's missing. This is, perhaps, the result of having to make himself invisible during the years of Nazi occupation . . . and for becoming non-existent in the life of his one true love, Alma, (who moves to America before him and marries someone else), and his son, who is a famous writer. Leo does this by making little scenes like knocking over displays in stores and interacting with his best friend \\"Bruno.\\" Meanwhile, he believes his first manuscript, \\"The History of Love,\\" has perished in a flood. It hasn't. It's been published in another language and under another name. His second manuscript has a similar fate and it's amazing that author Nicole Krauss enables this plot twist to both break your heart and make it burst with joy and fulfillment at the same time.\\"The History of Love\\" inspires the naming of the other main character and narrator, Alma Singer, who at the tender age of 14, takes us on her journey to find not only the author, but also the person requesting her mother's translation, and also the real life Alma. She's primarily concerned with making her widowed mother happy, but also becomes wrapped up in the mystery that is The History of Love. Through Alma and her innocent yet forthright drive, everything ties together.This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time for the exquisite writing, the unique characters, and the creative plot. My highest recommendation.Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"An incredibly ingenious work of art by a mistress of the written word!Nicole has excelled in speaking with authenticity be it via Bird, Alma or Leo - characters who are so real & tangible that they break your heart countless times as they share their innermost thoughts & secrets.This is a 'mystery', a story of love, humanity, childhood, heart break, friendship & deceit. The kind of book that lives on in your memory long after the final page.Read it!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is an excellent book with many plot twists and surprises. It was not what I expected from the title. It made me think of \\"Sophie's Choice\\", even though the plot was much different. It explored choices we make under dire circumstances, and their eventual consequences."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Oh, my goodness...what a good book to read. It is one of those in-between books for me, it is not a silly nothing total chic lit (which I do enjoy sometimes too), and it is not loaded with information so that I needed to read and re-read paragraphs to make sure I didn't miss anything. It is an amazing book, it caused me to think, it is somewhat of a mystery and a love story of not just husband and wife, but best friends who are up in their years and share loss and history, of a mother and daughter learning to relate, brother and sister growing up together. For each character in the book it is the loss of such a love and what has caused the pain, and how they reach through that pain to continue on in their love even after death or distance or choices that have put a separation mark between them.Even thought the title would give off a mushy, sappy book, this is not that. It is not that only because it concentrates on people and their difficulties in conquering their loves, but also in how they were or were not able to maintain them. This book deals with the deeper aspects of love, as in loyalty, devotion, patience and trust. I was not able to put it down, and even when I had to (I do have two little boys!), I would just keep on thinking about it until I was reunited with it once again. Now it is over...I wish it weren't. This book struck deep within me, I loved it...truly. It is one of my all time faves."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss's astonishing novel about a manuscript that survives the Holocaust, a flood, broken friendships, a plagiarist, misunderstanding, and obscurity has all the heart and intelligence of the best fiction being published today. Elderly Leo Gursky is afraid of dying unnoticed, and he plans his days so that people will see him and remember him. Among other schemes, he makes a scene in Starbucks and poses nude for a drawing class. Leo wasn't always this lonely. Decades before, in a small town that was then part of Poland, he fell in love with a girl named Alma. He wrote a book about her before the two fled at different times and circumstances to safety during World War II. Despite the disappointments in his life, Leo continues to write, convinced that he will die when this next book is finished. Meanwhile, a teenager also called Alma, named after a character in a book titled The History of Love by a Chilean named Litvinoff, finds herself in the heart of a mystery: her mother is hired by a mysterious man named Jacob Marcus to translate The History of Love from Spanish. Since Alma's father passed away years before, her mother has been overcome with sadness, and Alma sets out to find Jacob Marcus as a possible suitor. Oblivious to Alma's quest, her brother Bird has decided he is one of thirty-six holy men, a \\"lamed vovnik\\", and might even be the Messiah. And then there's Litvinoff himself, in the past, with his personal story and connection to the manuscript and to Alma and to his own beloved Rosa. The stunning coup of this novel is how Krauss brings these diverse elements into a single, concluding moment.Krauss has complete command of a story that could get away from a lesser novelist. Witty, sometimes sadly funny, with unforgettable off-beat characters, the novel draws in the reader from the first page, although its true strength isn't evident until the last hundred pages. The comparison of The History of Love to Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is inevitable, since the two authors are married and both books were published in 2005. While the two works echo each other in parts, use similar postmodern techniques, and concern themselves with related themes, Krauss and Foer are too good to be lumped together. Still, these seem like companion books. The History of Love is every bit as inventive and as emotionally riveting as Foer's novel - and vice versa - but it (as does Foer's novel) seems to wink at readers who have read both. Readers familiar with Foer's book will smile as Leo reveals that he is a retired locksmith who can open any door he wants. And the set-up of a young person, missing his/her dead father and searching New York for clues to solve a mystery will seem familiar. Beyond that, however, these books stand alone as remarkable works about people, both immigrants and natives, who are adrift in contemporary America.This exceptional novel deserves a wide readership. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book is very similar in both content and tone to Jonathan Safran Foer's latest book, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It's interesting to note that Foer and Krauss are husband and wife.Summary, no spoilers:This novel is told from the point of view of several narrators.The first, and best narrator, (the parts that feature him are brilliant), is Leo Gursky. Leo lives by himself in New York. He was born in Poland, and fell in love with a girl named Alma. They vowed to spend their lives together.Due to the war, Leo and Alma were separated, and Leo has spent his life alone, pining for Alma.The other main narrator is a young girl also named Alma, who has lost her father to pancreatic cancer and lives with her young brother and mother. All have been terribly damaged by his death.Although we occasionally get other narrators, the story is essentially told by these two wounded individuals. Alma tries to find the woman for whom she was named, and Leo tries to become a part of the living world, and become a part of his son Isaac's life. And all of this centers around a mysterious book entitled The History of Love.This is a gorgeous book. Like Foer's novel, this book is funny, sad, and quirky. At times a bit too quirky.I thought the chapters involving Leo were terrific. The book starts out with Leo's narration, and hence the book starts out on a powerful note.Although I enjoyed the character of young Alma, the chapters involving her were often odd, and sometimes slowed the pace of the story.Still, this book is worthy of 5 stars, and it would make a wonderful book club choice...there is a lot to discuss.So who has the better book, Foer or Krauss? My vote goes to Krauss, who wrote a page turner that has a better flow, and is more accessible than the Foer's work.Recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is a great novel. Plotted with exquisite precision, propelled by deeply sympathetic characters, and crammed full of mysteries and solutions, this book lights up neural networks you never knew you had. Besides recounting the stories of a 15 year old girl and a Holocaust survivor, Krauss's novel is also the story of a book (The History of Love). What it says about books is just as important as what it says about love, even if it isn't going to make the end-of-paper movement at cartel Microsoft very happy.Nicole Krauss understands books to be what no other medium is: self-contained, tough, mobile over continents and generations and languages, full of the future as inscribed by a piece of someone's soul. The History of Love (the novel within the novel) has a provenance that would make a Rembrandt painting blush: written in Poland, manuscript given away then stolen, conceived in Yiddish, translated to Spanish, published in Argentina, found by a Jewish traveler, given to his wife, secretly translated into English, discovered by a 15 year old girl in New York, AND MORE. In Krauss's telling, none of this is random, and even though characters act unaware of each other, the larger plan somehow manifests G*d in the lives of the Living. Why don't I just write it: according to Krauss, when the soul of the writer is pure, a book becomes an immanent sacred object. And in that way, books are a lot like love, only rectangular and full of numbered pages.If we esteemed writers by what their novels hold faith with, Nicole Krauss would sweep this year's fiction awards. Besides her faith in the power of the written word, there's faith in the integrity and goodness of young outsiders, in the quest to redeem history in old age, in the ability of human beings to shape their own destiny no matter how complicated and compromised, and in the presence of love as an active agent for good in the universe. Last, but not least, Krauss has faith that writers can change the world through writing. If they can, and she has, then we're just a little better off today than we were before The History of Love came into the world of readers."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A book within a book generally reveals itself as a literary conceit by a writer intent on showing his or her craft to an audience deemed too cynical for more straightforward prose. However, author Nicole Krauss has written an emotionally rich novel that uses this binary structure to illuminate two extremely different interior lives. The first is Leo Gursky, an eighty-year old Jewish man who survived persecution in WWII Poland before moving to New York City, where he leads a sad, involuntarily invisible existence. In the confusion after the war, he lost the great love of his life, as well as the son he never knew, who in turn, has become a famous and respected writer. The other protagonist is a fatherless fifteen-year old named Alma. She was named for a character in the Spanish-language book-within-the-book, \\"The History of Love\\", which was a favorite of her parents since her father bought it in South America expressly to give to her mother before his death.As fate would have it, Alma's mother is asked to translate this book into English, and Alma becomes obsessed with her namesake character. The common thread for both Leo and Alma is that they are each searching for someone - Alma for the inspiration for the character in the book and Leo for his long-lost son. The lives of these characters finally intertwine but not in any predictable way, and much of the credit has to be given to Krauss' creative invention for taking such a daring approach in dealing with a plot device that could have fallen prey to condescending manipulation. What the author does very well is capture the transformative nature of literature in all its variety, whether it takes the form of entries in Alma's diary, letters, lists, translations or excerpts from an autobiography. Krauss uses these distinctive writing styles to define each personality vividly, and she is particularly successful in capturing the loneliness experienced by Leo as he tries to gain others' attention and the insatiable curiosity Alma has for her family background.Comparisons to Krauss' husband Jonathan Safran Foer's just-published book, \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" are inevitable, as both authors incorporate a child's perspective in a world that proves itself too overwhelming to synthesize, and both use WWII Poland as a metaphor for the current sense of chaos and loss of identity. Perhaps because she is not dealing with the weightier implications of 9/11, Krauss is more successful in telling her story, as this may be the best multi-linear book I've read since David Mitchell's masterful \\"Cloud Atlas\\" came out last year and nearly won the Booker Prize. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"\\"He was a great writer. He fell in love. It was his life.\\" While those are the final words of Nicole Krauss's illuminating second novel, \\"The History of Love,\\" those three short sentences only highlight what I knew all along. This a unique book, haunting and quietly funny, and which leaves you thinking about memories, about death, and about love.Leo Gursky has a weak heart, and may die at any moment. Virtually no one knows him, and his own son never even knew of him; he drops his change and buys things, just so someone might remember him when he dies. Sixty years ago, he fled Nazi-occupied Poland to pursue a childhood sweetheart to America, but she thought he had died, and married someone else.Before that happened, Leo wrote a exquisite ode to her, called the \\"History of Love,\\" a fictional look at love's origins, its milestones, and at a mysterious girl called Alma. A copy of that book found its way into teenage Alma's household, and she was named after that mysterious woman. Now, as her grief-stricken mother translates one of the few copies into English, Alma sets out on a journey of discovery -- about the mystery author, the person who wants the translation, and the mysterious original Alma.Nicole Krauss writes much like her husband Jonathan Safran Foer -- she also takes a look at the past and present, at immigrants, and at the journies of our elders. And the insights she shows about the nature of love, and the intersections of life and literature, are startlingly deep. Many longtime authors can only dream of such delicate sensibilities.The writing itself is surprisingly fluid, considering that Krauss changes narrators and timeframes several times, and sometimes refers to one character by different names. She also changes her style, depending on the narrator -- the old man has a more rambly style, while Alma neatly compiles her thoughts into numbered lists.All the stories of death, loneliness and memories could be depressing. But Krauss injects them with gentle humor, such as Alma's brother Bird, who thinks he might be the Messiah (yeah, right, kid). There are also surprisingly poignant passages from the \\"History of Love\\" itself, which offer tiny insights into Leo's past love. Never sentimental, never maudlin. Just quietly, sadly romantic.\\"The History of Love\\" is a truly exquisite piece of work, an insightful novel that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. Definitely one of 2005's must-reads, and a beautiful read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I too think this is a very accomplished and ultimately enjoyable book. I wish the narrative had been more straightforward, though. Unfortunately, the author seems to fall back on some MFA techniques, which I don't think really serve her. She fragments the narrative, telling a handful of stories that she comes and goes from throughout the book. Right at the end she whittles it down to the two main characters almost switching from one to other line by line. Could be interesting, but at that point in the book it feels forced and unnecessary. We know these two characters are about to finally meet each other. Why pretend that there's more drama in the moment than there is? Especially, why do that when there's so much natural drama in that moment? It's there in the story she's told, so the technique, in this reader's opinion, gets in the way of the story.I call this an MFA thing because it seems like the sort of thing that comes out of MFA programs. Literary writers - especially young ones - seem to have been warned off narrative. Instead of telling a story in a straightforward manner from beginning to end they cut and splice it, hoping that the many parts add up to a satisfying whole. I think they also hope that this will hide the flaws in their writing. (See anything by Kathryn Harrison for an example of this.) It rarely makes for a better novel, although it can occasionally. (For an example of one that really works see Dan Chaon's You Remind Me of Me.)My problem with this in Krauss' case is that she's a talented storyteller. There aren't that many flaws in her writing. Behind the structure is a series of marvelous stories. She has a very inventive, imaginative vision to here. At times she shows flares of an almost Milan Kundera-like sort of brilliance. I loved the sections directly from the History of Love, and I'd probably read that as a stand alone volume, if she could pull it off in its entirety.When I say I wish she'd told the story in a more straightforward manner it's actually a high compliment. Her story is good enough that she doesn't need to hide it behind anything, or shade portions of it from scrutiny. She is the real thing, and her writing will be even stronger when she fully trusts in it and gives us her prose without relying on writerly crutches."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"As most of the reviewers for Nicole Krauss' \\"History of Love,\\" I found her novel to have some good strong points and some flaws that ran from shallow to deep (I guess that the major discrepancy between the five star and three star reviews is how annoyed you were by the flaws and how forgivable you found them to be). So what was good about it? I loved her tone -- smooth and melancholic but also humorous. I also loved her quirky cast of characters: elderly eccentric Leo Gursky (who is so lonely that he often drops his change in stores on purpose just so people will look at him); survival-obsessed Alma Singer -- a fifteen-year-old girl who had to grow up too quickly after her father died and her mother fell into a depression; and Bird, Alma's little brother who believes that he may be his generation's messiah. The plot, about how these lives intertwine and, eventually, collide thanks to a novel Gursky had written years earlier also called \\"The History of Love,\\" is another aspect of Krauss' book that I loved. What I didn't love is how Gursky's eccentricities, in some parts, seem just plain ridiculous -- reminiscent of Teri Hatcher's pratfalls on \\"Desperate Housewives\\". I also didn't love the way Krauss sometimes tries a little too hard to be quirky, and the way that the plot gets a little convoluted in the second half. But what I really just didn't like at all is the ending, in which all of the storylines just peter out without much resolution at all. It's one of those endings that leaves you frustratedly asking yourself \\"And ... ???? What happens next? Why did I bother reading this book when it had no intention of satisfying my curiosity in the end?\\" Not a good feeling to leave a book with, especially when, as with this one, it had so much promise."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Believe the hype. The History of Love is one of the most original and engaging pieces of literary fiction of the past year. The novel focuses on a book entitled The History of Love, written by Leo Gursky at age twenty in Slonim, Poland, to honor Alma Mereminski, with whom he has shared an extraordinary love. When the Nazis threaten Poland and Alma has to flee, Leo, unsure if he will escape, gives his book for safekeeping to his best friend, who is sailing to Lisbon. Leo eventually makes his way to New York, where as a locksmith, he is a \\"man who became invisible.\\" His book about Alma has vanished.Leo's story unfolds through his memories and moves back and forth in time, running in parallel with the story of Alma Singer, a 14-year-old girl named for a character in a Spanish-language book entitled, coincidentally, The History of Love, which her father bought in Valparaiso, Chile, and gave to her mother when they were newlyweds. Young Alma, lonely following her father's death, spends her days writing How to Survive in the Wild, in an attempt to control the uncertainties of her life, while her brother Bird, eleven and a half, loses himself in religion, believing he may be the Messiah. Their mother becomes a translator of books.Gradually, the characters and their stories converge, and the reader learns how a book written in Polish came to be published in Spanish in Chile, then translated into English by Alma's mother for a client living in Venice. The relationships of the characters as they age, their attitudes toward life and love, and their goals for the future create a fluid thematic structure in which characters spring to life and become the primary focus.Using humor, absurdity, and a variety of points of view, Krauss creates profound emotion and sympathy for these characters as they deal with absurd reality, always keying her unique imagery to their particular points of view. Ultimately the reader recognizes that Krauss's novel, like Leo's book, illustrates the many different kinds of love. With an opening page guaranteed to pique the interest of even the most jaded reader, this confident novel, written with assurance and panache, is fresh and full of charm, a novel illustrating in unique ways some of the oldest themes in literature. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Some of the more lyrical passages in this novel are breathtaking, and the basic story line is an intriguing one. However, the plot twists and turns with flashbacks and different narrators that are difficult to keep track of at times. That said, it's one of very few novels that I KNOW I will reread someday. One piece of advice: it's best not to put the book aside for a few days, but rather read it straight through with only short breaks. Trying to recapture the story is challenging. It's not a light beach read, but perhaps a good read for a long, holiday air trip when you have no distractions."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This remarkable novel is a paean to the strength of the human spirit, the nature of language and the yearning for connection. Leo Gursky has lived in stunning loneliness for most of his life. He has loved but one woman devotedly, a girl he grew up with in the old country. When she leaves for America, he stays behind to see his entire family annihilated by the Nazi's. Years later, after living as a refugee, he too comes to America, only to discover she has married, believing him dead in the pogroms.Leo has escaped through writing since childhood, stories of real people, of the impossible, pages that fill the long, quiet hours. He is an old man remembering his first book, lost along the way years ago. Now he craves only to be seen by others, to be acknowledged in the world every day: \\"All I want is not to die on a day that I went unseen.\\" With his damaged heart, Leo waits for the Angel of Death to appear and take him away.In New York, Alma Singer grows up adoring her father, but he dies of pancreatic cancer when she is only seven. The bereft family is three, Alma's younger brother, Bird, an increasingly religious child who believes he may be the Messiah and her beautiful mother who cannot recover from the loss of her beloved husband. Brilliant with languages, her mother spends hours translating books to support the family, never leaving the house, withdrawing into memories of her love: \\"She chose my father, and to hold on to a certain feeling, she sacrificed the world.\\"Alma is named after all the women in a small, but poignant book, \\"The History of Love\\". By some otherworldly coincidence, Alma's father gave this tome, written in Spanish, to her mother when they met. Now her mother has been commissioned to translate the book into English sending off a few chapters at a time. Alma surreptitiously reads the chapters before they are mailed, hoping for a clue to their benefactor's nature. The book is revelatory, written with exceptional insight and compassion, the lovely Alma at the heart of it: \\"Her answer was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering\\".As she reads the pages, Alma is transformed, awakening a deep yearning in her soul. She begins a search that will open the doors of the past, releasing years of loneliness and regret and reach across generations: from the pogroms of the Jews in their homelands to the cosmopolitan city in South America where the book is published; to America, where lost souls wander the streets, their quiet lives passing with sparse comfort, where fathers and sons never meet, where a woman grieves, a young boy prays to be the Chosen One and a girl finds her way to the one person who will extinguish the burning in her soul.Beautifully written, with exquisite sensitivity and compassion, The History of Love will open your heart, fill you with the bright light of understanding and leave you enriched for the experience. This gifted author has created something extraordinary, not a novel, but a journey into the chambers of the human heart. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book is so beautifully written and so intricately designed as to inspire future readings.My favorite author of all time is F. Scott Fitzgerald, and from the moment I picked up this book I was put in mind of his gorgeous and poetic writing style. Like Fitzgerald, Krauss has a way with making the tragically sad, beautiful and vivid. The story is saturated with disappointment and longing, but also with hope and humor. This novel is so poignant, it will literally make your heart hurt.An earlier reviewer complained about Leo's continual use of \\"and yet,\\" but, I thought it was wonderfully realistic and endearing given his quirks...after all, we all have those little \\"annoying\\" things about us...and often times, they are what separate us from the pack.Nicole Krauss is a contemporary author I can compare only with Ann-Marie MacDonald in talent and promise for future great things. I will most definitely buy anything and everything else this author puts out, though for her to top \\"The History of Love\\" would truly be a miracle.This one is highly and adamantly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love weaves 3 stories into one book. Contrary to some reviewers who found this confusing, I found this quite entertaining. The book revolves around Leo Gursky and Alma. Leo is an octogenarian who, as a young Polish boy, fell in love and wrote a book about love, called the History of Love. Alma is a 14 year old who is named after the lead character in the book after her parents were so moved by the novel Leo wrote.The portions from the perspective of Leo are witty, funny yet sad all at the same time. It made me laugh and moved me. I found the language from the excerpts of Leo's book poetic yet familiar - the kind that strike a familar chord while sounding nice when read out loud.The ending was a bit anti-climactic for me. But it left me thinking about Leo and Alma and the rest of the characters who I wish had given both of them the fairy tale ending they deserved.One of the better books I've read lately, it will continue to resurface in my thoughts as I think of the magic of falling in-love, growing old, dealing with death and the universal need to feel valued and significant."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Beautifully written, this book carries us through the tangential thoughts lived by two people, different in every way except the way they see themselves. The walls we construct around us and the world we create within them do not protect us from influencing countless souls in ways we can never imagine.It's a book that flows naturally from one thought to the next and only when it lets go of you do you catch yourself smiling at the wit and charm of so great a character and so touching a story. This is a book that reminds you why you read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"What a quietly moving and thoroughly spell-binding novel Nicole Krauss has written in The History of Love. The first several chapters in, I thought the book was going to be some good character sketches, but without much of a plot. While I was enjoying the characters just being characters, I failed to notice until much later the fantastic subtle web of interconnection that had been woven around these characters, and had ensnared me to see it fully unfold. It's been said that a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world. The History of Love tells of a young writer who pours out his first, fleeting yet lifelong love into an unpublished manuscript, and how it touches the lives and loves of others across two translations, three continents, and seven decades. And of how choosing the wrong sentence might change the course of a lifetime. The book made me think of Love in the Time of Cholera, as both are epic paeans to a lifetime of love (mostly in the abstract), their pivotal characters carrying an enduring unrequited love for a girl who marries and spends her life with someone else. But where Florentino Ariza spends his life whoring around, Krauss' hero Leopold Gursky spends his life writing. Gursky thinks no one will read his pages, but he has no idea how far-reaching his impact will be. In the end, he touches the lives of others more profoundly and positively than Garcia-Marquez' hero. Of course one doesn't expect much of Gursky when we first meet him, as a cranky, eccentric old man. But as his story unfolds, I grew fond of him, crankiness and eccentricities and all. His story comes out interleaved with the coming of age story of a teen girl and her younger brother dealing with the loss of their father when they were very young, and the story of a Jewish refugee and writer in South America. And perhaps the story is even more about the girl than about Gursky. While the novel jumps from 1930s Poland to 1960s Chile to contemporary New York, I found the narrative flow surprisingly natural and not too hard to follow, especially as the latent threads running through the disparate stories begin to manifest. Krauss' intricate story is brought to life by her ear for voice and her vivid characters. By the end, I was rapt in its magic web."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"It's no small feat to channel Singer, Bellow, Babel, Roth and Schultz and still write in a wholly original style. Despite an overly contrived narrative, this novel nonetheless soars the way real novels always do: on the strength of the insidious narrative voices and moment to moment pleasures. For someone with such a generous and sentimental sensibility (she can't help herself), Krauss is also sharply observant of human foibles, but still makes us hope against all odds."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Leo Gursky, a Polish Jew, loves a girl and, unknowingly, gets her pregnant. She goes off to the U.S., expecting him to join her there. He fails to and the War intervenes. She gives birth to Isaac and finding her boss's son treating the baby sweetly, and finding that Leo had not come over, marries the boss's son and gives him a son. Meanwhile Leo having written, in Yiddish, \\"The History of Love\\", gives the manuscript to Litvinoff to be kept till they meet again. Litvinoff takes it to Chile and after some time publishes it in Spanish as if it were his own work.Years pass. Isaac, now a renowned author, comes across the \\"History of Love\\" and sends it to Alma's mother to be translated into English. Alma, eager to see that her mother, a widow, finds a man, tries to trace Isac and ends up with finding Leo.That briefly is the story. Leo met his girl friend in New York after escaping the horrors of the Holocaust and the War, and askd her to come away with him. She refuses, being the wife of another and again a mother of their child. Leo remains single. This would have made for a very moving story by itself.Krauss does not develop this aspect. Leo attends incognito the funeral service held for his son, Isaac,and is taken to his house by Bernard, Isac's step-brother, where he sees the photo of his girl friend. He is unable to reveal to Bernard his relationship to Isaac. This is another part of the story which, if developed, would have been emotionally fulfilling. Leo had written another book titled, \\"Words for Everythig\\" and sent it to Isaac. This book gets published after Isaac's death as though it had been written by Isaac. Leo muses that Isaac should have read it and understood Leo was his father. Another aspect fit for development. Here also Krauss has failed. Instead there is the involved use of a girl, Alma, whose role does not jive well with the main part of the story. But there are gems of observations such as, \\"There is nothing to match God's silence\\", \\"the role of a father is to teach his son how to live without the father\\", \\"when a Jew prays, he is asking God a question that has no end\\". Also where Krauss writes about Leo thinking in retospect of all whom he had lost during his life, it is touching. The book is a good read but cannot be rated as high as it seems to have been.

It is a book about tremendous loss, the Holocaust, the loss of a father for a young daughter...the loss of a son... fear of death, fear of living... mourning, and it is juxtaposed by wanting to live, discover and uncover motives, personal and otherwise.

This is the story of a fragile thread that connects strangers to bring them together even as they are unaware of the bond they share.In a rare occurrence for me, I will reread this novel to get deeper into the wonderful world of words this author has taken me.Talia Carner, author,Puppet Child and China Doll"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a beautifully written novel.

Facing the end of his life, Leo fears that no one will notice when he dies. He lives his remaining days in such a way as to make others notice him. One day he may push over a display at the grocery store. Another day, he may pose nude for an art class. His character is so incredibly realistic, that the reader can empathize and share with him his feelings of isolation.Interwoven with this plot are other more minor ones, each with equally endearing characters and overwhelming feelings of loneliness.Although the characters are each so remarkably unique and interesting, the story can be difficult at times.

Somehow I didn't find that significant, however. The book as a whole is deeply humane and caring, while being true to individual paths as well as love, hope and the need to grow as well as survive. There is warmth and connection to the story, even as it depicts individuals searching for their very cores. In the end, the novel lets the reader learn about how to love and also to accept how painful that can be. The writing is quite beautiful, with both a lightness and profound meanings. The story itself captured people in their bravery and their fears. And I liked the modernist chapter technique used, and have not (yet) read Safran Foer's books.

It is a pleasure from start to finish, full of charming small details along with an overarching plot that is something to chew on. The most literal read is that it is a rumination on enduring love. There is more than one suggestion that true love only occurs once in life. Leo Gursky, the protagonist, even writes in his own obituary \\"He was a great writer. He fell in love. It was his life.\\" The reader knows how sad this statement is: Leo lost his great love early in life. His one great piece of writing was lost when he fled Nazi occupied Poland. He never earned fame or money as a writer. However, his book did survive and a friend translated in into Spanish and passed it off as his own.Leo's legacy is far grander than he could ever have imagined. There is a touching spiritual message here about lineage and what we pass on. There are also a few twists and turns that are genuinely surprising. There are also questions about how true Leo's love was to him. Is he a man blessed by great love or duped by nostalgia?Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Really good read. my heart was kinda breaking for what could have been all the way through.

I began to read this tale just after having finished \\"Water for Elephants\\" by Sara Gruen. When I realized the protagonist was once again an elderly gentleman, I didn't think I wanted to read it right away. Since that time I've savored it twice. It's a complicated narrative, but not a depressing one, one that I almost felt I needed to read again. There is tremendous depth to the story and the writing is at times poetic .A narrative on many levels, it is the story of lost love, from two perspectives. One is Leo's, author of \\"The History of Love,\\" the novel within this novel. He wrote his tome about his first and only love, Alma. The other lost love is of the translator's husband who died an untimely death from cancer. Their daughter, Alma, named after the main character in \\"The History of Love,\\" sets out to find her mother a new sweetheart. Alma's brother, nicknamed Bird, spends his time selling lemonade and building an ark out of junk, as he's convinced he's a religious savior.Leo Gursky is hilarious with his continual antics to prove someone will notice him on the day he dies. While this sounds like a morbid conquest, in actuality it brings much humor to the novel, as his actions include activities like posing nude for an art class. I often found myself laughing out loud. His relationship with his longtime friend, Bruno, is also touching and humorous, as they support and compete with each other through various stages in their lives.Alma's effort to write a \\"How to Survive in the Wild,\\" her quest to find her mother a new love, while finally realizing that this is futile as her mother will never stop loving her father, and her final pursuit to solve the mystery of who really was the real Alma in the mysterious book, are both heartbreaking and touching.Dreams are unfulfilled and redirected for other characters as well. Leo's mission to be noticed by a son who never knew him brings raw sadness to the story. When Alma helps Bird understand that he must \\"act normal,\\" he searches to find a new task to replace his religious fanaticism and consequently helps Alma solve her mystery.What happened to the missing manuscript? Who is this Jacob Marcus who asks Alma's mother to translate, a few chapters at a time? Questions like these keep the novel moving.I couldn't put the book down in the last hundred pages. The ending is as touching and emotional as the first romantic quote promised.Not an easy read, but a fabulous one. It would be a wonderful book for a book club discussion."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love has several things going for it: it is modern in form in that it is narrated by several different voices (including an omniscient author), it contains an aura of mystery, and it has a very vivid character who propels the action. However, it has several serious flaws. Although Leo Gursky is a lovable character, it is hard to see him as the author of the works of romantic fiction attributed to him which are rather gushingly feminine. The revelation about Bruno at the end of the book reflects ridiculously on Leo and seems motivated solely by the author's desire to surprise the reader. It's not difficult to surprise a reader--all you have to do is withhold information or make the character change his essential nature.The other characters don't inspire much empathy or interest because they seem too detached and artifical or inauthentic. The men seem emasculated, several of whom are knocked off by cancer. Besides, Alma and Bird are too cute by half! What makes the book popular, I think, is an obsessive romanticism that celebrates ideas like love at first sight, the overwhelming power of first love, the romance of silence and difficulty of communication, the notion of synchronicity and connection between distant peoples and cultures, and one idea that in my philosophy is downright dangerous: that in order to survive one needs his illusions.So although the book is entertainingly written by a talented author, it dissolves into fluff and sentiment; there is little character development and not much insight to be gained from what is essentially a fantasy. I recommend the review of this book in the New York Times by Laura Miller."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I just finished this book and couldn't wait to recommend it to others. I really enjoyed the author's husband's book \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" which my book club read several months ago. When I saw this one recommended on amazon, I couldn't wait to pick it up. I found many similarities in writing styles between Krauss and Foer and can almost picture the two of them sitting together over coffee and reading each other's work. If you enjoyed his book, you'll love hers too. I really liked the way her novel was organized: the chapters rotated among three different narrators, each contributing a new component to the story. I did find myself needing to review before starting each new chapter to remind myself what had happened last with this character, but I did like that Krauss put a different icon (representing each narrator) on the top of each chapter which made referring back to previous chapters easy. I must say, the ending was just beautiful. It made you look back fondly at the characters and their histories, and actually question what has really happened over the last 60 years, and the last 250 pages. What is real? What is imagined or invented? In the end, it doesn't really matter. Well done. Definitely one to pick up."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"As you can see by the rating an title of my review I was not impressed by this book. Nevertheless, considering the high number of people who did like it, I tried and wrote my review in two styles: Plain English and, for the ones who liked the book, what I take to be Ms. Krauss very own style. Lets see how I fare. I will appreciate comments on the accuracy of my Krauss style.PLAIN ENGLISHThis is not a literary work, rather the exercise of a student experimenting with a bunch of techniques in the same paper. As students will, the author masters them to different degrees. Perhaps for this reason or maybe due to the sheer number of styles used, they blend together poorly.Interestingly, the parts written in the less \\"innovative\\" voice are the only quality bits of the book (not that anything here is truly innovative, this is the 21st century and it would take more effort to come up with something new). The rest is a pink flowery cake with too much sugar, wrapped in a trivial riddle.For, after using a baroque blend of styles one could call phony, Ms. Krauss goes on to complicate unnecessarily the plot until it becomes hard to follow. Maybe she feels that this way she livens up an otherwise flat account, I wouldn't know. All I know is that it doesn't work.The story is simple and cheesy like can be \\"boy finds girl, looses girl and writes a book, finds girl back but she's with another, he lives to celebrate ever after the beauty of his love and live itself\\" Maybe because she felt this was not quite enough (it certainly isn't in her writing, but she might have been wrong - as Nabokov put it once, any story is basically a fairy tale and it is only the way it is told that makes the difference), she throws in a literary mystery:Who wrote the piece of crap halfway between Pablo Neruda, Borges and Tagore, excerpts of which are inflicted on the reader through the book and which is supposed to be an unknown but VERY GOOD book? Well, we don't care. I'm more interested in why is a book containing such passages supposed to be readable at all, let alone VERY GOOD.Wait, come to think of it, doesn't \\"The History of Love\\" contains these passages itself? - Oh my dog, here I've got a terribly witty game of mirrors very much in the taste of Ms. Krauss, or have I?One last warning: I think it is fair to say that this book is presented to the world as a \\"Jewish Book\\". Well, if you are very deep into Hebraic culture, which I'm not, you will probably find it, again, disappointing. If you are looking for a crash course in the mentioned subject, think before you go for it: you will need to know Yiddish before you start to read. At the very least, you will need to keep handy a bilingual dictionary to look up the following unnecessary words:KishkesTuchasSchlemielMishpochehShiddukhMacherShabbesAnd so on. For the record, you can find the last four in the same page, and such a page is not rare.Finally, if you think of yourself just as human, without need to narrow this condition with adjectives such as \\"Jewish\\", \\"Aryan\\" \\"Patriotic\\" or \\"Believer\\", then you'll wonder as I did why on earth does every single being in the book have to be Jewish. Why, even clerks randomly picked up at their counters turn out to be Jewish. Maybe it does for the Jewishness of the book, but it just doesn't ring likely. And it doesn't make a Phillip Roth of the author.KRAUSS STYLEI saw the book at Amazon's page and it suddenly spoke to me in a little soft voice. It was calling me with Mala's voice, and it promised many happy returns of our bygone youth. But. The book is farkakt. I gave it a try, gave it two tries, gave it three tries and then remembered a saying of Rubick , the tanner down three blocks from our house in Klickz: If three tries are not enough, give it a fourth. In the end, they found him dead close to a multicoloured cube. And yet. The story is a patschkerai. So I cut it in thousands of pieces and scattered around Central Park. Maybe some kids will pick the shreds and read them. With time they might meet and fall in love and, while smoking in bed weave their fragments more skilfully than the writer.

As a result, our discussion was a series of explanations about who was who rather than the themes, characterization, etc. of the novel. One of the members felt it necessary to read the novel twice and took notes in order to make sense of the plot and the characters.On the positive side, several of the characters were engaging - namely, Leo, Alma and Bird. Leo's circumstances made us sympathetic to him as he fought to remain visible in the world. Alma and Bird's struggles to grow and mature as they were overwhelmed by their mother's grief were causes of sadness to us.We decided that the author was attempting to remind readers of the Holocaust so that we would \\"never forget.\\" However, requiring readers to jump from Nazi Poland to New York City to Chile while keeping track of each character's relationship to Leo Gursky obscures the theme and lessens the impact of the story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Read this book for a women's book club, one of our better reads.

After discussing it with five other people, I have a better sense of what the author was trying to do, but the first reading was rather confusing.The author is not only trying to juggle the perspectives of the two main characters, she also tosses in the perspectives of some of the minor characters. This forces her to jump through space and time creating a rather incongruous mess. I am generally good at puzzles, but even I could not see how she was going to weave it all together at the end."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"As I read this book I thought that it might be one of the best books I've read in many years. I loved the characters, the plotlines, the twists and turns, and the writing. But the ending is an insult to the reader, the characters, and the story. I still cannot believe it was that bad. IT WAS THAT BAD."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is a magnificent book. It is deep and operates on several different levels yet, at the same time, it is not one of those horribly inaccessible tomes that we're \\"supposed\\" to read and \\"supposed\\" to be moved by...It is a complicated plot line, with several character shifts and plot turns and twists. I don't want to spoil the several wonderful surprises. However, in a sentence, this is a book about the lasting power of love through the ages and through the generations, as told by a young girl growing up in New York and an aging, indeed dying man, who has survived the Holocaust. He is a locksmith, a profession requiring the delicacy of touch to unluck secrets and locked passages; the young girl dreams of becoming a paleontologist, dedicating her life to piecing together stories from scraps and bits. Other characters, such as the young girl's troubled brother and the old man's dear friend Bruno, are equally well thought out and powerful.That's just the plot. Then there's the writing. It is simply wonderful. The rhythm of the sentences, the delicacy of the writer's touch, the bravery and courage shown in some pretty unconventional literary choices, give us a truly wonderful reading experience.I recommend this book in the highest possible terms."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Sometimes I wish I could rate books in parts. Stop after the first 30%- rate and review. 65%- stop again, rate and review. And then a final. For some books that might be redundant but for books like The History of Love, rating parts would allow me the freedom to 4 and 5 star the sections I loved and apply 2 stars to the sections I found less inspiring. The History of Love starts with Leo as an old man, and I fell in love with him. I also fell in love with his lifelong friend Bruno and how they sustain each other through long, lonely years, tapping on the radiator to signal to the other that all is well. A few minutes into this book I thought, \\"I better get a pen; this is going to get quote worthy.\\" Then the book moves on to young Alma and I didn't enjoy that portion of the story as much. Alma is introduced after Leo so the bar of my expectations was set very high and the adolescent Alma didn't get there for me. Consequently, each time the story went back to Leo my opinion of the book creeped up, up, up. Then upon return to Alma the rating began the downward slide. Portion rating this book would have resembled the trek of a sleep monitor: First part- 4 stars, second part- down to 2, then up to 3-3.5, down to 2.5, and at the close- down to 2 when the ending got very strange and even the Leo I had fallen in love with seemed to lose touch with the elements of his character that made him so easy to love initially.I did notice and enjoy the synchronicity in the tale. The separate stories of the characters touch periodically throughout showing the threads that will ultimately weave them all together in a six degrees of separation way reminding me of the movie Crash and the breathtaking reminder that we are all connected."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Story lines were disjointed and hard to follow.

Much like her contemporaries, Dave Eggers and Jonathan Safran Foer, Krauss approaches her readership with contempt (i.e. a set of low expectations). Most Americans, after all, are gum-chewing television-watchers who have never picked up a book in their lives. I certainly do not believe this tiresome cliche, but the American publishing industry does. And so does Nicole Krauss.Krauss panders. She explains everything to the reader. In the end, the reader feels insulted for being treated with such contempt. I am not fooled by the novel's pretensions at experimentalism (this is NOT a formally challenging novel). Yes, we are presented with three interlocking narratives: one written by an old man, another written by the woman he loves, and the other by a fourteen-year-old girl. But the plot is hideously simplistic: An old man writes a book inspired by his inamorata, Alma. The book gets away from him. Alma reads the book. Fin.Krauss has mastered the marketing strategies of her husband, Foer, who also uses the interlocking narrative structure, a superabundance of nearly-blank pages, and narrators who are functionally illiterate. In the end, THE HISTORY OF STUPIDITY feels like a self-advertisement --- not so much an advertisement for the author as an advertisement for itself. Much like the object of SUV commercials, the target audience here is painfully clear: Typical Dumb Americans who find sweet old men and little girls stupidly charming.Not merely is the novel infantile in terms of its form; the content is also similarly stunted.Particularly stunning are Krauss's scatological obsessions. I am not suggesting that books should not have scatology as their subject matter, nor am I attacking the book on some pseudo-moralistic, Medvedian ground. H.G. Wells assailed James Joyce (whose name is showcased, pointlessly, twice in this novel) for his so-called \\"cloacal obsession.\\" But if there is scatology in Joyce, it serves a \\"transcendent\\" purpose. In Krauss, however, the references to excrement point to nothing other than themselves. Nothing is more infantile than gastrointestinal humor.And so we have Leo Gursky struggling with a bowel movement on page 15, \\"Zvi Litnivoff\\" defecating on page 69, and a tzaddik in an outhouse engaging in one of the \\"coarse miracles of life\\" on page 127. I could go on, but I don't want to. Nicole Krauss seems fascinated by excrementality, which seems appropriate since her book is a steaming mound of yellow horse dung.One last thing: If Leo Gursky has written such an important book, why are all of the passages cited halting and puerile?What we are witnessing is the \\"dumbing-down\\" of literary fiction. We need a new constructivism (I do not use this word in its traditional sense), after three decades of infantilism in American letters.Dr. Joseph Suglia"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I hate books about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds aimed at upper middle class New Yorker-reading women. Krauss wrote this book with one eye on the casting for the movie, which, if made, will star oh maybe Hallie Steinfeld and Robert Duvall, in what critics will call a stretch role, will garner luminous praise from the usual suspects,make 30 domestic,and be forgotten with the rest. If you want to read a true masterpiece about the psychic costs of the Holocaust, try The Pawnbroker, by Edward Lewis Wallant."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I bought this book based on the positive reviews it received just to be totally blindsided by how truly awful it was. It did by the end have some potential to be a decent book but it was never pulled together and the ending just left me thinking, seriously?!The old man's part was very crass and had, what seemed like, a lot of filler. Some of the things just didn't make any sense and jumped from one topic and time to another with no explanation.The little girl's part didn't flow at all. Most of the paragraphs were numbered with headings with no reason given for this. Maybe it was supposed to be like she was writing in her survival book? Also some of the headings seemed to have nothing to do with the actual paragraphs under it.The transition from person to person was really rough and just seemed off. It did not flow at all. It goes from an old man, to a child, to a man who's already dead, to a different child. It jumps around in time with no explanation. I had trouble figuring out what was going on because of the time jumps and rough transitions. Also it was very poorly written as far as punctuation and fragmented sentences go. I am by no means a grammar snob but please use quotations and new paragraphs when people are speaking, and if you choose not to do that, at least keep you method consistent. The most used, and by used I mean overused, sentence in the book is: And yet. It drove me crazy that the author and/or editor did not understand what a comma is meant for. And last but not least, there were Hebrew and Russian and some other languages sprinkled throughout with no explanation of what it meant. I just didn't care for it at all and it was NOT what I expected in the least!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I love books that make you think... make you piece some things together yourself, flip back and find that \\"clue\\" to make what you're reading make sense. I don't want everything spelled out for me.This was brilliantly written and I found myself, on more than one occasion, with tears in my eyes. It makes me want to read Leo's 'History of Love' and I am actually SAD that the book doesn't exist. Excerpts from the book were my favorite parts and those that tore at me the most.I read this book quite quickly because I was afraid putting it down for too long would make me forget things but I'm going to read it again right away to get more out of it for myself. I really honestly loved this book. Loved it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I just finished \\"The History of Love.\\" It makes me hopeful for the next generation of writers ... Nicole Krauss's prose sparkles and is as bright as Waterford in the afternoon sun.Krauss offers up two divergent characters and carefully weaves them into a beautiful tapestry.First, there's Leo Gursky, retired New York City locksmith. Lifelong bachelor. He's a Polish immigrant who came to America after the war took his family and his one true love. He's 80, in ill health and afraid of dying without notice.Then, there's Alma Singer. She, too, lives in New York City. Her father died when she was seven. Her mother is still grieving. Her brother thinks he might be the Messiah.To say more would be to spoil the beauty of Krauss' prose. It is vaguely reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende. When the story is over, you're left with an odd feeling of having been in another place. Coming back to the real world is a jolt.I haven't read Krauss' husband's book, \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,\\" so I can't comment on what critics are calling the too-similar-to-be-a-coincidence factor. I just know that this story was compelling and full of magic.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a beautiful book....NOT a 'history of love' as you might think.

I can imagine readers from different seasons of life enjoying this book - teens to book clubs to older readers. Leo Gursky is the main character - the old man's self-deprecating humor is refreshing. Alma, the young adventuress is charming. The characters are very engaging and their tales are endearing.The writing is witty and poetic. I highly recommend this book, it is a gem.

Kept me on my toes wanting to know more. Only detail I was not crazy about was the fact that Leo never found out his son knew he existed! Would have been more interesting if the ending was different."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I have to start off by saying that I love, Love, LOVE this book. Everything about it works - from the beautiful prose, the carefully spun storylines, and well-crafted characters - this is not just a story about love, it is a book to love.One of the things I believe is most impressive about this work is that although each chapter features a narrative shift (often alternating between the two main characters, Leo & Alma) the book never loses momentum and it is a true testament to Krauss's ability that the transitions are never jarring. Although the characters all had their own distinct voices, one commonality amongst them all is there is a raw beauty in everything they have to say. I actually had to put the book down after a mere six pages in simply because the writing was breaking my heart... but only in the best way possible! Krauss's writing is gorgeous and often evoked stark longing in me, something I wish more writers were able to achieve, but so few do. She deftly examines the beauty of love, as well as how it can haunt us, how it can hollow us, in its wake.This book is quietly complex with delicately interwoven storylines. I don't know how anyone could read this book and not fall in love with it. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who wants a despairingly beautiful read, and personally look forward to reading much more from this author."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The author is talented....however the book was delibrately confusing. Some times though, the author has given us some beautiful words. I have mixed feelings about this book"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A moving tale of two unlikely people searching for -- and finding -- love and connection across the rift of time and tragedy. I confess I had to read the book twice, partly because I found the first read confusing and didn't get that it featured three points of view: 1 through the eyes and imaginative mind of Leopold Grusky, a writer and survivor of the Polish holocaust; 1 through the eyes of Alma Singer, a young girl similarly alone whose father has died, leaving her with a distant/preoccupied mother and a little bit nutso younger brother; and the third person tale of the man who became known as the writer of The History of Love. But the other reason I had to re-read the book was because I found it haunting and beautiful."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I am sincerely surprised by the amount of positive acclaim for this book. I love a book which has different chapters written from different character's view points but this was just too confusing until the very end when it finally begun to make sense but the ending definitely left something to be desired. And after it was all said and done, I felt like I had wasted my time. Just not an interesting story - pass on this one!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is an absolutely wonderful book. The characters were beautifully and sympathetically drawn, even when they disappointed themselves. I recognized myself in them and often thought, \\"What a thoughtful and beautiful way of describing some of my own experiences.\\" The characters were compelling, complex, and always trying to make sense of their experiences in a world that is sometimes wonderful, but also sometimes sad, confusing, and even traumatic. I knew the characters, felt them, understood them, identified with them and last but not least, I loved them."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"An incredibly intresting style of writing. We read it for my book club and it was very well received with a tremendous amount of discussion and analysis of the book. It can become confusing regarding the back and forth of the characters, but it is worth re-reading passages if necessary to sort things out. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This was a beautiful book. I am not usually a rereader, but I wanted to reread this book when I finished it, to put it all together, knowing what I learned at the end. Beautifully written, beautifully conceived. I highly recommend this. Everyone I have recommended it to has also loved it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss has written a strange and wonderful book. The voices of several characters weave their ways across the pages to create a lovely m&eacute;lange, which by the end, makes satisfying sense.First, we meet Leo Gursky, aging and cynical. Once, when he was a young man, living in Poland, he fell in love. And he wrote about it. And she left. And he survived the war in the forest. Now, in New York, he writes again and shows his work to his friend Bruno upstairs. When Leo finally arrives in New York, he finds the woman he had loved, married with children, one of whom is his son. Leo agrees to remain in the background but follows the life of his son who becomes a well known writer.Then there is a girl named Alma Singer, named after a character in a book that her father bought for her mother when he was in South America. Alma's mother is translating the book from Spanish to English for a mysterious patron. Her mother also is mourning the death of Alma's father, and Alma's kid brother thinks he is a Messiah.Interspersed are chapters from The History of Love, the book Leo wrote in Polish as a young man, which is published in South America as the work of Ziv Litvinofff. Rosa, Ziv's wife writes an introduction when the book is reissued after his death.Yes, all of this comes together brilliantly and sweetly by the time the last page is read. Alma is only one of the detectives. Not only is she surprised by events, but so are we as we come across unexpected heros and connections. Krauss writes a book of life, full of characters who leap off the page to confide in you. And you listen. And you cheer them on. And you celebrate with them.by Judith Helburnfor StorycircleBookReviewswww.storycirclebookreviewsorgreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This was a really wonderful novel.

Intelligently written, unique characters, and out and out funny at times. Wish there were more of these out there."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I LOVED this book. It's a great story that intertwines the stories of a number of different people, all of whom are connected to and influenced by a book entitled \\"The History of Love.\\" The writing was beautiful, the characters all quirky and fascinating, some of the stories of their lives funny and some heartbreaking. The only caution I have is to make sure you pay attention from the beginning to all the characters, because there are some surprising connections. We read this in our book club and several people came to the meeting really confused. They had started the book thinking it was just a nice, unassuming story and, as they got deeper into it, realized there was more to it than they thought and found themselves very confused."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Krauss has a beautiful, fluid writing style, but the novel's plot and characters are dangerously similar to Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. Similarly, although it's a wonderful, engaging story, it gets bogged down in the middle and loses its tenacity by the end."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I just experienced this book as an audiobook, and it really helped keep a complex plot line straight. Leo was read by an elderly man with a Yiddish accent. It made me appreciate the author's mastery of that idiom. What struck me was that all the characters had this rich and complex thought life and none of them were sharing it with anyone else. Look how often Leo or Alma, or even Rosa consider sharing some significant fact or feeling and then pull back, unable. The only real communication comes through the written word that unlocks the inner world of these fascinating characters. The written work takes on a life of its own and ultimately allows the characters to connect. Members of three generations each experience falling in love and losing a love. There is a web of themes and connections. The characters and plot are fascinating and the book bears a second reading to bring all the loose ends together. Recommended if you like a mental challenge and sex and action aren't important to you."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Don't let the title fool you. This is not a harlequin romance. Yet this is a romance. It's a human romance. The History of Love is the title of a piece of literary non-fiction nested into the story, of which the author offers parts of chapters throughout her novel. It is a beautiful book, one I wish I could read in its entirety, it so lovingly depicts the birth of feelings, the origin of communication, and the parallel story of a youth in love. Read this beautiful book that you wish would never end."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"From the moment I picked this up, I was entranced, and I literally read if from cover to cover in 8 hours, and could barely stand up to take a pee.....it is mesmerizing.

Happy reading....."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I have never submitted a review before but had to comment on how much I loved this book. The characters are so clearly yet succinctly drawn, they feel so real and are heartbreaking. It was the kind of cyclical book I enjoy where you read the last page and all is revealed yet you are questioning everything as you interpreted it & have to return through the pages to make sure it was as you imagined it to be...A beautiful book...read it!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Unlike many other readers, I did not find The History of Love difficult to follow. It rewards close attention, but that is true of many literary novels.Krauss wants to pay tribute to the memory of a Jewry that was lost in the Holocaust and she wants to remember the warmth, the vibrancy, and yes, the love that were all snuffed out by the Nazis. Her tribute takes the form of this somewhat quirky post-modern novel. The central premise of Leo Gursky's life -- that he has a child who cannot acknowledge him or know of him because of his family history -- is incredibly poignant, as is Gursky's lifelong response to his tragedy.Krauss is able to maintain a postmodern, ironic tone while in no way denigrating the memory of those who died in the Holocaust. This is quite remarkable."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I really liked this book. At one point I got two of the characters mixed-up, which really confused me, but even with the mix-up I still really enjoyed the book, the story and the writing. The change of perspectives through the book kept it entertaining as well."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love comes wrapped up in a catchy title, cute coming of age tidbits, funny and endearing protagonists, and emotional wrenching that only a heartbroken widow could bring. For me the plot was secondary as the character development and humor took front seat as we are thrown into not only the characters current lives, but their pasts as well. Krauss' writing is very enjoyable and she is able to switch tones on a dime without losing momentum. Although her WWII displaced Gursky, is written with an overly feminine psyche, he still takes the cake as one of the funniest bumbling literary characters of recent memory.Unfortunately, there is one major issue I had with the book. It is virtually a copy in style and plot to Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. Incidentally her husband wrote that book the two came out within months of each other so there is no clear indication as to whose ideas we are reading. Since I read the other first, I couldn't help but be disappointed in their obvious similarities throughout the read.Bottom Line: If you like this vein of new modern fiction quirky fiction exhibited in books like Jonathan Safron Foer and Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife, then you might enjoy this although overall I didn't feel it was as strong as either of these books."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Krauss' prose has been described as \\"poetic\\". It's a very apt description. THL is as much an extended prose poem on love, history, and the history of love as it is the telling of a particular 'love story'. I dock one star only because in the breathless final chapter of THL an entire storyline (developed throughout the novel) is simply abandoned (some resolution was required) and because of Krauss' wild over-repetition of the sentence fragment \\"And yet.\\", which, by novel's end had become grating in the extreme. These details aside, THL is a wonderful read. It is the product of a writer very much in command of her craft."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I think it's a whole lot better than most--especially, the over-rated Zadie Smith, and the whole host of \\"chick lit\\" authors that are out there. This author goes over and beyond the level of MOST fiction writers--male or female"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"With The History of Love, Nicole Krauss proves she is as fine a writer as her husband, Jonathan Safran Foer. Writen from the perspective of multiple characters, Krauss delves into (all too familiar) histories of love and loss. The novel is emotionally captivating, down to the last sentence. The only disappoinment lies in the narrative voice, which is stikingly similar to her husband's work."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Very good book. It's one of these rare cases, when I agree with all the professional reviewers. Everything works together - storyline, language. In the beginning, I got confused with different parts of story, but decided not to worry about that - and to enjoy the process, waiting patiently for parallel realities and worlds to come together - and it was worth every minute of my time. Definitely a book that I am glad to have on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"THE HISTORY OF LOVE, Nicole Krauss's second novel, is a complex story that doesn't lend itself well to being summed up in a nice, neat plot synopsis. For one thing, the book travels back and forth in time, narrated by several characters, sometimes in the form of letters, diaries, and even a novel-within-a-novel (also, not coincidentally, called THE HISTORY OF LOVE). For another thing, the book is a sort of mystery, revealing name changes, betrayals, and secret identities as the plot unfolds.Perhaps the best way to explore THE HISTORY OF LOVE, then, is to introduce its two main characters. The first is the elderly Leopold Gursky, an almost tragically pathetic character living in a squalid apartment in New York City. Terrified that he has become invisible to the rest of the world, Leo makes a point of trying to make himself be seen every day, whether it is by purposefully spilling his coffee drink on himself at Starbucks or by volunteering to be a nude model for a life drawing course.Originally from Poland, Leo immigrated to New York after World War II, his heart having been broken by Alma, the only girl he would ever love, and by Isaac, the son who doesn't even know he exists. Now, nearing the end of his life, Leo reflects often on the meaning of his life, on what will be left of him after he is gone. He thinks, \\"At the end, all that's left of you are your possessions. Perhaps that's why I've never been able to throw anything away. Perhaps that's why I hoarded the world: with the hope that when I died, the sum total of my things would suggest a life larger than the one I lived.\\" What Leo doesn't know is that he does have a surprising legacy that may or may not keep him from being invisible forever.Not far away from Leo Gursky, also in New York City, lives Alma Singer. Named after the heroine in her mother's favorite book, fifteen-year-old Alma wants to be a naturalist. She collects tips in notebooks she titles \\"How to Survive in the Wild,\\" and she takes pains to classify her world --- and her words --- in the careful tone and style of a scientist. Alma and her younger brother Bird are both coping with the recent death of their father, as is Alma's mother, a translator who receives a surprising commission from a mysterious stranger --- to translate an obscure Spanish book titled THE HISTORY OF LOVE into English. Alma, who imposes all kinds of romantic fantasies on the stranger who communicates only by letters, starts out on a quest to find the letter writer as well as the real-life Alma who may have inspired the novel's author.In the end, Leo and Alma come together in a surprising way --- and by means of a most unexpected catalyst. With its exploration of chance and coincidence and its multi-layered plot, Nicole Krauss's THE HISTORY OF LOVE will remind many of Paul Auster's novels and stories. Krauss's prose is remarkably versatile, skillfully using stylistic devices to differentiate the voices of her many narrators. In addition to being a genuinely well-crafted (if not exactly suspenseful) mystery story, Krauss's novel is by turns comic, mythic, thoughtful, and almost heartbreakingly sad.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"For me this novel was all over the place. I am intelligent and can grasp different plot lines, narrative points, etc. I just felt the author did not bring these together in a cohesive fashion. I do appreciate some stylings of humor, however her approach on that level tires after a while. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say there wasn't much of one at all.I had to read this for a book club. Half of our members raved about the book - others felt as I did. It really was a mixed bag.The author is young, and I can see she has potential. I will read her next novel. I haven't \\"written her off\\" just yet..."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book was unbelievable. It was quirky, and sad, and happy and honest. I loved everything about it. There are quotes in this book that are absolutely timeless. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book is so beautifully written. Unfortunately, it's one of those novels that cannot be given a proper summary, so my advice is to read it for yourself. You might get confused along the way, but when has there ever been perfect communication? How many times do misunderstandings occur? Words get twisted, forgotten, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and reinterpreted. How many times have you wanted to convey something that you didn't have words for? This funny thing called language is so fragile, so prone to distortion and yet it's all we have to communicate with each other. That's what this book is about.You might not understand right away, and you might overlook a lot of the beauty that occurs in subtle undertones. That's okay, it's what rereadings are for. Don't get discouraged if you get lost, because it happens everyday in the conversations we have. That's life, for us, and this novel captures that beautifully."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"First, I have to say that this was one of the more difficult audio books to follow. A simple distraction in traffic left me tuning back in to the story saying, \\"Wait...who is that talking now?\\" Since it is told from multiple perspectives, and they feel different from one another in the beginning, it was often hard to follow each of the stories. To be honest, I just wanted to hear more of Leo's story. The writing is beautiful, and the images that are drawn up amazed me. I found myself agonizing over Leo's happiness, hoping and praying that this beautifully complex character found the joy he so desperately deserved, before he died. In a culture where we sometimes side step the story of the aged, I found Leo's experiences to be telling, and to show how the actions and experiences of one's life can influence one's philosophy on aging and dying.While complex and beautiful, this story took great care to weave the lives of multiple characters together in a very satisfying way. In an effort to not give away the ending, all I can say is that the entire story feels like it's waiting for the ending of the story, when the reader can see all the plot points finally slide together. Altogether, I found the story haunting, revealing, thought-provoking, and beautiful. Difficult at times to follow in audio, the novel was one that needed careful attention. I genuinely appreciated and enjoyed The History of Love, and would readily recommend it to any serious reader."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is an outstanding, intricate and beautiful expression of several exceptional lives and their fight to conquer ultimate loneliness."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A wonderful look into the need for relational connectedness in the human heart and the power to survive that comes from the memory of these connections in the past and the hope of finding another someday. Brilliantly endearing prose and a fantastic story. I laughed out loud multiple times and found tears impossible to hold back in a few spots. Wonderful work!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"THE HISTORY OF LOVE is both entertaining and just a bit pretentious.The characters in the novel are quite compelling. Leo Gursky and his pal Bruno are both sad and funny. Leo, a retired locksmith and survivor of the Holocaust, is a lonely old man, but he's always out there trying to prove he still exists. Bruno is a boyhood friend whom he meets on the street one day; they embrace like long lost brothers. From then on out they take care of each other. Although he doesn't know it, Leo is a survivor. At one point in the story he signs up to pose as a nude model and actually carries it off. Alma Singer, the fourteen-year-old protagonist, also has her moments. Her mother is a sad, depressed lady still grieving for Alma's dead father, and Alma wants to find her a mate. When her mother gets a job translating THE HISTORY OF LOVE from Spanish into English, Alma sets out to find her mother's employer whom she considers a likely catch and in the process begins searching for Alma, her namesake from THE HISTORY OF LOVE.Then there's \\"Bird,\\" Alma's younger brother who thinks he's one of the 36 possible Jewish messiahs alive at the time. He earns his nickname jumping off a building to see if he could fly.As a young man Leo wrote a book entitled THE HISTORY OF LOVE featuring his lover, Alma. The journey the novel takes is almost as engrossing as the one Leo undergoes as he emigrates at the end of WWII only to discover Alma is married.We get to read excerpts from THE HISTORY OF LOVE as Alma's mother translates. It's pretty much pseudo philosophy. Nicole Krauss also happens to be Jonathan Safran Foer's wife, and she has some of the same bad habits he has. Towards the end of the book, Krauss alternates characters, giving each a little dialogue on each page, much the same as Foer did in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, but at least she doesn't include any pictures of Trade Center bodies falling up.The ending is also a bit rushed. One of the reasons all that white space is so annoying is that you don't want to let these characters go, and Krauss leaves too much to the imagination. There's also a twist (concerning Bruno) toward the end that I thought was completely unnecessary."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Be prepared for confusion; this book weaves in and around you until the end when all of the storylines come together. Be prepared too to live in the aging skin of Leo, the main character. Krauss is a beautiful writer; my book was filled with highlighted passages that I felt compelled to remember!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Few books have moved me like this one. It is achingly sad and achingly beautiful at once. The characters are rich and quirky and interesting. There were pages where I gasped out loud, pages where I cried.It's important to know that the story is told by multiple authors and that the symbols at the beginning of each section indicate which author is speaking. I read the book twice to get the most out of it. This is not an easy read, but it's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I think that the literary analysis of this book has been adequately covered here; this review is purely personal.The History of Love is moving, thoughtful, beautifully written.

The wait is arduous."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I was given the book as a gift by my boyfriend. It's a beautiful story and I highly recommend it. The reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because there are times that you need to flip back to connect certain people and time periods that are mentioned so much later in the book. This is due to the fact that it is three separate stories written so you follow each every 3rd Chapter. But the stories do eventually entwine. It's best to read the whole book in one sitting, but I didn't have the time for that, thus the necessity of flipping back and forth to make sure I was connecting the right people and places as the stories unfolded."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"It took me two weeks to read as I was busy.

Yet, I'm glad I did. The characters are poignant and believable. An old man has been robbed of what should have been his life by World War II which claimed his friends, family, and chance at love. At the same time a young girl, is just beginning to understand love. There is a note of optimism to the beautifully sad story. This is an enjoyable read that will keep you interested to the end."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is honestly one of the best books I've read in a long time.

Suddenly the book switched gears and we were in the mind of a pre-teen/teenage girl. I started to get bored. Then it went to Leo and I was engrossed again. Then the girl and I was bored again. So it went on and off through the book. There were other POVs but Leo's was the most compelling and best written. Bird also, but he played a minor role. The plot of this story is actually good, but the execution was a bit messy with the time frame and again multiple POVs. Some people complained about the ending, but to me, the ending really saved the book.

He is such a sad, yet entertaining, character. Great twist at the end (re: Bruno)."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Around the same time I was reading this, I went to an odd little theatrical production titled \\"Nize Baby\\". It was based on the writings of a Jewish New Yorker, a humorist from the 1920s named Milt Gross. This play consisted of wacky wisecracks interspersed with retellings of classic tales, such as \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" and the William Tell story. I was reminded how this same voice and style made its way into the works of numerous Jewish comedians over the years, people like Jerry Lewis and Jack Benny. I could hear some of the same strains in Nicole Krauss's novel. Unfortunately, \\"The History of Love\\" is not supposed to be a goof. It is supposed to be real literature, a seriocomic contemporary classic with a lots of nice quotes from reviewers on the cover and a handful of awards. Its author was recently named one of The New Yorker Magazine's top young American writers.The Krauss bandwagon is one that I will take a pass on. I only got about 30-40 pages into it before casting it aside. The author's voice simply had no appeal for me, since it came across as the kind of silly, but smart babbling that is cute in a bright high schooler's conversation, but not interesting in a book. The story is told in first person from a couple of different characters, one an old man dreaming of bygone days. the other a teenage girl. Both characters speak in this same irritating voice. Krauss is fond of other fey techniques like pages with one sentence on them, and cute chapter headings every couple of pages (which works a little better, since it is a teen who is supposedly doing it). Overall I was not impressed. It might be a good read for young female readers - I will give it that much. But if this type of ADD-inflicted, semi-serious rambling is the future of American literature, then I promise to never buy a Kindle or a Nook."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I was sorely disappointed by this book. The story it told was wonderful - truly wonderful. The character of Leo Gursky is one of the most bittersweet and heartbreaking that I think I have ever read. Ms. Krauss not only painted this wonderful character, but convincingly told part of the narrative from the point of view of a 14 year old girl.However, that was where my enjoyment of the book ended. It was incredibly difficult to read - unless, I suppose, you have enough time to sit and read it at one sitting. I kept having to look back and forth trying to figure out what had happened and to whom. And Ms. Krauss' use of several different viewpoints to tell the story was not nearly as well-accomplished or easy to follow as Jodi Picoult. I found myself over and over again just completely frustrated by the authors mind-boggling changes in point of view - without using names, so it wasn't clear if the narrator was talking about a character the reader already knew. I wanted to love this book because I thought the story of Leo's books and of Leo himself, as well as Alma (the teenager) were amazingly creative and involving. I guess I just don't want to work that hard to understand a story. Had it not been for my book club, I probably would have given up altogether."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I stopped reading during the third disc (about 1/4 of the way through the book) for two reasons: 1) mainly because I had ZERO interest in what happened to the annoyingly precocious Alma and 2) the voice of the person who was reading about Alma was as irritating as fingers on a blackboard. The first section -- from Leo's quirky perspective -- was charming and endearing. That narration was performed by the always superb George Guidall. Once he became silent, the book lost its oomph. Two stars for that brief visit."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book came quickly and in perfect condition.

Blame the editor."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I needed the book for a class in college. It came quickly to my dorm and does not even look used at all"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This novel is about Leo who left Poland to come to America and finds himself alone and lonely in an apartment he hates, similar to mine here, and reminisces to sixty years earlier when he fell in love and wrote a book. Another similarity; I too wrote a romantic 'novel' four years ago, though I am older than he was then. Love comes in all forms and flavors, from the good to the bad and lots in between. Believe me, I could write the real history of love!In Leo's book, a character named Alma has survived in a human (a 14-yr-old) who is writing her own book. She receives a mysterious letter and seeks her namesake in Poland. Poor Leo feels that life has passed him by, and wonders who will be the last person to find him alive -- could it be the delivery boy from the Chinese take-out, the pizza man, or will ti be the attendant at the nearby Starbucks. He has been a deserted soul now for some time and decides that maybe life just ain't worth living.\\"Leopold Gursky started dying on August 18, 1920; he finally did die all alone because he was too embarrassed to call anyone.\\" It could be that he died thinking of Alma, or when he chose not to. Love does that to one, even an old man, as he remembers how good it was to love and be loved. When he fell in love, that was the beginning of his demise.Nicole Krauss was born in New York in 1974, same year Justin was born on December 4. He will be the death of me; sometimes, you can love your son too much. And sometimes you can love another son not enough. The only one to stand by in your elder years is the one you did not love at all. He just wants to watch you die. Her first novel is called MAN WALKS INTO A ROOM. That title reminds me of a book I loved, A MAN WALKS THROUGH a mirror from the medieval world to carry off a N. Y. librarian to another life, but she chose to leave him behind and return to a loveless life. That is the tragedy of life, we don't love the person who needs us the most. And the person you want the most to love you won't. That, my friends, is the story of love."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"i looked forward to reading this book because it was one of amazons favorites. it was so disappointing and boring. the characters were dull and you never really cared about them."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book.

My girlfriend is a smashing beauty and she has the brains to go with her beauty. It forced me to ask friends about any solid books on relationships that could really open my eyes. After three years of undergrad philosophy, I was sick of the imprecise material around on relationships. The book really knocked my socks off. This book has straightened me out in just one day. I think I'm ready not just for marriage, but for a graduate degree in marriage counseling now! The book is awesome. The book intelligently unravels the mysteries between why couples stay happily married or divorced even after decades of marriage. The foundations of marriage and divorce seemed to fuse beautifully into one structure that made it easy to understand the most important aspects of what to do while single, while dating or after marriage. I wish both my parents were still alive to read this book for their marriage and to be at my wedding. Kudos to this smart doctor from Africa! Hope he saves many relationships through this book."},{"Title":"The 36 Well Kept Secrets of Successful Marriages and Divorce","review":"It's amazing that there is one book less than three hundred pages you know, that can really really help all the types of people I know having one problem or the other with their relationships. The 36 Well kept Secrets is a very helpful book for anyone, I don't give a d... who you are, you need the book if you really want to know about your marriage, stuff that kids need to know before they grow too old and why marriages end in divorce. I particularly liked the way the book describes the risk factors I should identify before getting married. Most books written by therapists and these other gurus are just so vague on what to do before marriage to avoid a divorce. This book really comes clean for me on that. Some of my married friends and cousins couldn't believe the book could help their marriages get better. But I'm glad they didn't just laugh at me, they read the whole book. And we've been fighting over who is next in line. My friend who works in the emergency room loaned me the book but I didn't believe her when she said the book was personally autographed by the author. His book will be a successful contribution to the well being of our society in America. I just sense it. Thanks for the book. It really removes the myths about marriage and divorce for anyone willing to break from fantasy to reality. Cool!I still think the guy was a psychiatrist in Nigeria though."},{"Title":"The 36 Well Kept Secrets of Successful Marriages and Divorce","review":"I am a divorcee with no idea about how I ended that way or even what to do to avoid repeating the same mistakes. After reading this book, not only was my confidence in making the right decisions restored, I learnt precisely what I had done wrong in my first marriage from the causes precipitants and reasoons for divorc. If I ever fall in love again it would not necessarily lead to marriage if that is not the right person for me. The book has really helped me forgive my ex-and I am finally picking up the pieces of my life at the five foundations described in the book. I didn't know there where fiv foundations that you could identify and make your life better, choose a good mate with and even use them to build a good marriage. I am glad the book shows that anyone can fall in love but that marriages that succeed involve couples who share similar foundations with each other. I am currently in therapy and even my therapist, also a divorcee is discovering things in the book she never knew she needed. It's a great book. An author like this needs to be on Oprah or some show that will help millions of people how to use what's in the book to help couples build a successful marriage. Minus some misspellings, the book is a practical, clear concise masterpiece. Knowing my foundations has actually helped me get off antidepressants and simply continue with monthly as opposed to weekly therapy. I hav never had so much peace restored to my broken heart until I read this book by a minister who has also been divorced and now successfully remarried. The guy knows what he is talking about and I have been blessed by it. It is an enriching book for every single who is considering marriage or remarriage as well as for married couples."},{"Title":"The 36 Well Kept Secrets of Successful Marriages and Divorce","review":"I was surprised after browsing through a friend's copy that the book wasn't in every bookstore on the planet. It was even a fight getting my book ordered from the local bookstore. Enough of preambling. Any intelligent individual who reads this book can never be the same again. Ever! It is passionate and pure with a clear description of what we women must do before jumping into bed or getting married. As an assistant pastor of a fairly sized church, I counsel a lot of singles and divorcees. And I could never find a single book to refer some of these helpless individuals to. That has changed since I got the 36 secrets while in Tennessee.With the 36 secrets, everyone, as the title suggests, gets a large piece of the pudding. It is a unique book with a unique perspective by an author who it appears, is from an entirely different culture, Nigeria, yet has had first hand experience of the agonies surrounding a horrible marriage that ended in divorce. Surprisingly he is also a minister. I believe there are few books in print that provide a spiritually balanced and practical yet in-depth look at the causes of divorce as this book. I will recommend the book for singles, pastors, married or divorced women and men and it doesn't matter if you are young or old....I would have given more stars but the book is hard to find in bookstores."},{"Title":"The 36 Well Kept Secrets of Successful Marriages and Divorce","review":"As a busy mother and homemaker, I found the 36 Secrets spellbinding. I have read DeAngelis, Dr. Laura, Wallerstein, Gottman, Phil Gram, Mars & Venus series and when it come to the bolts and nuts of marriage and divorce, this book is the last stop. That is except the author has another book HE is writing. I was taken by surprise with the simple looking cover and by the fact that the book starts with \\"What's Your Risk for Divorce\\" without an introduction. But from opening the first page of the book till I completed the last page I couldn't drop the book. I could see why divorce rates are still so high because most other authors do not hit the nail on the head like this guy did. I was surprised that he is even a minister when he started talking about sexual intimacy. Don't get me wrong. The guy(author) surprised me when he stated that if a man needs healthy sexual intimacy and the wife because of some mindless wandering neglects him, other women will eventually provide what his wife refused to provide. That could help explain some of the high sex scandals in the Church today. I have now become addicted to using the phrase \\"don't destroy the foundations of your mariage\\" when talking with other friends who often describe how they starve their dutiful husbands of sexual intimacy to keep them in line. The 36 Secrets has altered my views, for good, about what men and women often do before and after marriage to create successful or failed marriages. And by the way, this is the first book thatI have seen differentiating between a failing or failed marriage and divorce. I believe that with the author differentiating between divorce causes precipitants and reasons,(it might be the first to define the five causes of divorce) marriage therapists trying to help people like me can do so before our marriages sink into the despair of inevitable divorce. I particularly love the author's description of the five foundations of successful marriages and the corresponding five pillars and how we are supposed to build five bridges of love across those five foundations. Imagine that to build a successful marriage you must do so at the five foundations and that to end with a divorce you will have to attack one or all the five foundations of your marriage. I am yet to find that one book that uses analogies like this guy does in describing how marriages fail. If he didn't have his picture on the back, I would have presumed him to be an elderly female psychiatrist. And it's amazing he is none of these to have writtten this book. Now when my kids go out on a date with the wrong person I now boldly ask them \\"do you guys have similar foundations on which to build a successful marriage? \\"if you can't marry them or have kids that look like them don't sleep with them\\". Meaning the book is good for my parents and their kids. It makes you bolder as a parent and smarter as a young adult planning to get married. I finally have something to teach my teenage kids without worrying if I need to say more or less. If you've got teenage kids who think they're smart, tell them to read the book and show off how smart they are! You'll be amazed. My divorced girlfriend who had blamed her ex-husband for the past five years since the divorce(she and the guy, both good looking, didn't remarry) wept in my arms after reading the book's first three chapters. She too couldn't drop the book until she finished it. Are we talking practical here? My friend and her ex- who had identical foundations couln't find better partners but didn't know they had divorce creating habits described in the book either (yes, divorce creating habits and seven of them) and that such habits lead to divorce. Now they know and now they're back together and every time they call they start wih \\"Thanks Pat\\". The book is a classic and I'll look forward to reading any other books by the author even on different subjects."},{"Title":"The 36 Well Kept Secrets of Successful Marriages and Divorce","review":"I would like to thank Dr. Opere for taking the time to write this book. His insight on marriage and divorce has helped me to think of my relationship in new and better ways. The part about the successful marriage picture puzzle and the differences between marriage failure and divorce is mind boggling to say the least. The book shows why people who are not right for each oher in the first place get divorced after forty years of marriage.

There is no book like this yet."},{"Title":"The 36 Well Kept Secrets of Successful Marriages and Divorce","review":"I found this book offensive and out of touch with reality. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone, and certainly wish I had not purchased it. The views published in this book are closed-minded and judgmental."},{"Title":"Theology and Modern Science","review":"This is a wonderfully thoughtful book about key issues science raises for Christians. The first thing I like about the book is that it takes both science and Christian theology very seriously. I like particularly that the evidence for evolution and a very old universe is accepted as established scientific truth, as it is everywhere in science but all too rarely in Christian books about science. Instead of insisting that modern cosmology is false, Wisemen asks what it means for our doctrine of creation. Instead of rejecting evolution, he explores its implications for the doctrines of divine providence and of the human soul. The discussion of animal souls is delightfully rich and anti-Cartesian. I also appreciated his brief discussion of the findings of contemporary neuroscience and neuropsychology, my own field. He has also includes a fascinating discussion of divine action and natural causality. This book is technical philosophically and theologically. It addresses some issues specific to Catholicism. However, as a Protestant layperson, with only moderate training in philosophy, theology, and science, I found this book thought-provoking and enriching. I would especially recommend it to committed theists working in scientific fields."},{"Title":"Theology and Modern Science","review":"In this slim volume, Wiseman distills key issues in the dialogue of science and faith: cosmology and creation, evolution and divine providence, cosmology and eschatology, divine intervention. He presents coherence based on simultaneously valid views from both scientific and theological perspectives.I am a systems engineer, Quaker, and seminarian currently studying science and faith. For me, Wiseman's book is a breath of fresh air. It does not attempt to survey the field (see Ian Barbour for that) but strikes at the heart of the matter. Wiseman crystallizes the essence of both the science and theology into a few pages. His view is encompassing, informed and respectful to both science and faith. He seems particularly influenced by Friedrich Schleiermacher, Karl Rahner, Thomas Aquinas and St. Francis as well as his own prior work in the Christian mystical tradition.Schleiermacher insisted that \\"the more religious you are, the more miracle would you see everywhere.\\" By adopting Aquinas' model of secondary and primary causes, Wiseman is comfortable with a God that acts at all levels and through the creation itself, remaining both transcendent and immanent at the same time. Perhaps most significantly, Wiseman recovers the awe and wonder we feel in our scientific discovery as an experience of the transcendent mystery on which we are absolutely dependent. He also offers a strong sense of the immanence of God in the interconnectedness of all being. Rather than wrangle with the knot of evolution versus \\"design,\\" he slices through it by revealing \\"design\\" as a metaphor totally inadequate for expressing the overwhelming grandeur of what is revealed in the creation. With Polkinghorne, Wiseman sees the fate of the universe over tens of billions of years and our personal fate over tens of years as not posing fundamentally different issues for theology. The hope of \\"new creation\\" does not depend on the continued existence of our universe any more than the hope of resurrection \\"body and soul\\" depends on preserving our physical bones.In short, in about 150 pages, Wiseman offers what few in the field of Science and Faith have achieved - a compelling and welcoming vision of coehence between the two views of a common reality."},{"Title":"Good Night, and Good Luck.: The Screenplay and History Behind the Landmark Movie (Newmarket Shooting Script)","review":"Edward R. Murrow, trailblazing journalist, produced a series of groundbreaking television shows in the 1950's, daring... just daring to suggest that a rampaging Congressman from Wisconsin was wrong. His courage, in the face of a not always supportive supervisors, in the face of politicians who would rage war against his characters, is tenable. This book is a salute, both to the award winning film, \\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\", and to the comparable Murrow and his re-visioning of news in America.The book is a perfect companion piece to the film. Offering several retrospective articles, they are brief and illuminate the life and times during this paranoid period in history. An extensive question and answer session from George Clooney and Grant Heslov share their experiences with making this film.The true work of art is the script. Spare, sparse, and wonderfully vibrant, the script glistens with the actual words of Murrow, and a taut drama to bring them on to television. My favorite scene in the movie translates to my favorite scene in the script, when Murrow, so eloquently, so precisely proclaims, \\"We're gonna go on with the story because the terror is right in this room.\\" Bingo.Some proclaim \\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\" to be a fluff propaganda piece designed to promulgate the liberal politicial fascinations of George Clooney, et. al. It seems no matter what the subject matter is, as long as Clooney is involved, that labeled is quickly slapped on it. However, this film resonates with a clear message, what's past is prolgue. Those who don't heed the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it.The fact of the matter is, Murrow's words, spoken 50 years ago, are equally as true today. Fact is, we need the Murrows of the world, to stand, speak the truth, and fight for what is right. This film, this book, is a celebration of that."},{"Title":"Good Night, and Good Luck.: The Screenplay and History Behind the Landmark Movie (Newmarket Shooting Script)","review":"I purchased the book for the wrong reason.

It seemed so real that it sounded like he had lived through the loss of a child. I hope he has not. No one should have to. His quote that 800 years in the future \\"medicine hadn't really changed much since the days of leeches and poultices\\" is interesting. He must have experience with the medical field, and assumes that those frauds won't get any better than they are now. Now on to the many problems...Here's the biggest problem with the book. The entire book builds to a trip to the time tombs and a meeting with the Shrike. It doesn't happen. The book just ends abruptly. I thought at first my copy was missing the last few chapters, so I went to a store to look at another copy to check. That was the way Simmons intended it to end, abruptly. I guess he couldn't figure-out how to end the book, so he just didn't.He mentions the name Hawkings 41 times. It's annoying to no end. How about just one sentence explaining how much you respect the man rather than doing so 41 times!The idea that people fly around space on a tree while hanging-out on the limbs like monkeys is just ridiculous. Enough said about that.Over and over again he mentions implanted cornlogs? What is a corn log? Is something technical that looks like a corn cob? Is it a play on the word kernel? A holder for multiple kernels? Some explanation would have been appreciated.It's interesting to see how much Simmons hates Palestinians. He claims that in 800 years we're still killing and terrorizing humanity. I don't think so.The idea that the illiteracy rate is over 99% is ridiculous. Simmons claims over and over again that people in the future won't be able to read signs or something as simple as a label on a radio dial.Sometimes he gets in the bad rut, that seems to affect most bad sci-fi hacks. He starts adding a prefix, in his case the word 'fiber,' to words to make them sound more futuristic. Another bad sci-fi rut he allows himself to fall into is the so-called Star Trek rule of three. In other words, you give two good examples then one made-up example. An example of this tool from Star Trek, and from Simmons, \\"Lincoln or Churchill or Alvarez-Temp...\\" Simmons does this over and over again.Finally, Simmons does the ultimate sci-fi cheap hack: Immaculate conception. The offspring of a computer program and the detective becomes the messiah of the church of Shrike. Copying this idea from the Bible didn't work in Star Wars Episode I, and it didn't work here. How about some originality?"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I agree with reader wsmith@thgi.com from Chicago.

Not to mention, the story as a whole is really a compilation of six 30-page expositional short stories loosely tied together by an additional 100 pages of story set in the \\"present\\". The author also overly uses sex and descriptive references to human fluids in what feels like a contrived attempt to lend interest to the story. It was only through pure will that I made it through this book (and the fact that behind all the garbage, the background ideas are quite interesting). For those looking for an interesting jaunt through sci-fi check out some works by Orson Scott Card, David Brin, William Gibson, or Robert Heinlen. This book just isn't worth the time, IMHO."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The most important rule in Science Fiction for an author is to work the technology and sociology seemlessly into the story as quickly as possible so that the reader can understand everything as the book unfolds. Simmons does not do this. Instead, he writes a very confusing group of independent stories with confusing explanations of the structure of his world. And, as a final blow to the reader, he does not even finish the story. It is one thing to write a novel with the idea of a sequel (as Orson Scott Card does with his Ender series). It is quite another thing to drop the reader into the &quot;valley&quot; with his characters and not even offering some conclusion. Adding to this unfortunate ending is the fact that his characters are annoying and do not create a reason for the reader to care about them. I am reading the sequel only to find out what happens."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Others have clearly taken the author to task for the ending, enough said about that--this may have been an editorial/publishing decision.The rest of the book is terribly uneven. Simmons missed the flaw in the Chaucerian formula: the structure holding the Canterbury Tales together is forced and mechanical, but the individual tales are often wonderful. So it is with this version of the pilgrims' tales structure. The writing at the top structural level is forced and amateurly wooden. At this level I was almost always ahead of the plot, literally stating the plot points before they appeared ( I was listening to the audio version which makes this a bit easier). Characters are ordered around by the author, frequently with no clear purpose; character reactions are easily anticipated, interactions are conveyed with the complexity of the dialogue of soap operas.. On this level the scifi elements are, well, childish. A pastiche of allusions, often pointless, to scifi, fantasy, and myth. At times the characters/narrator consciously acknowledging the 19th & 20th centuries as \\"ancient\\" sources and other times blithely using them as though they were current for a tale set in the far future. For example, the cliched list technique of key illustrative events which begin with a well-known, to the book's reader, historical event, then a more current 20th century event, and then on to an unexplained future event, a la classic Star Trek stylistics. Others have commented on his woeful creation of \\"future' language.Within the individual tales Simmons writing improves greatly. It is more fluid and appealing. The plotting is imaginative and surprising. The tales would have been better presented individually. I suspect Simmons wrote these first and tried tying them together into a book, which is one of several possible explanations for why the writing is so terribly uneven. Though the range of tales appears to be an attempt at displaying Simmons writing breadth by taking up various genres: horror, scifi, detective fiction (hard-boiled, Sam Spade type). That aspect of the novel also appears forced and unconvincing.The forced elements far outweigh the pleasure deep inside the individual tales. I don't recommend this book and will forgo the second novel: there's no sequel that can make up for such a long painful bout of poor craftsmanship."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has written an exclent book. Although the book is confusing, he still describes the characters well. He uses suspense to let the reader enjoy the book. Simmons describes the characters so that the reader can image them as real people."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I enjoy sci-fi. While I'm not a huge buff, I think I have a sense of what is \\"good\\" and what is \\"bad\\". This book isn't bad, but it is pretty far from being good. Simmons has an annoying tendency to over-describe irrelevant details and make up words and phrases that have no bearing on the story. He also gets in a rut of using repetitive metaphors (e.g. referring to the Shrike as a \\"Grendel\\" multiple times within a few pages) and then drops them, and sometimes uses expressions he simply doesn't understand but sound cool (like \\"Deus Ex Machina\\"). Still, he does paint a decent picture of the universe he envisions, and some of the stories are rather engaging. The priests tale in particular will draw you in, but it goes downhill from there. There is virtually no resolution of any mysteries raised in this book, however, so if you want to know what happens you may feel obligated to read the second book. This means that if you are even marginally interested, you will be reading 700+ pages of mediocre science fiction, only to find yourself rolling your eyes at the resolutions in the second book. There is much better science fiction out there that deals with all of the same themes in one regard or another, so if you are looking for something even slightly more than a mind-numbing beach read, you should explore other options."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Let me start by saying that I have have read and absolutely loved seven other Dan Simmons novels. My expectations were high given that I have enjoyed the aforementionerd novels, I love SF and that this was an award winning novel. For the life of me I cannot figure out why this won anything. In lieu of a story, more than 50% of the text is concerned with descriptions. Endless descriptions. In addition, it is a confusing mess of terms and places invented for this universe. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Violates \\"Truth in Advertising.\\" It would have been a better book if they just titled it, \\"A Collection of Short Stories About Hyperion\\" rather than pretending it was a coherent novel. Individually the stories are okay and I kept waiting for the payoff that would tie them together and bring the \\"novel\\" to a climax, but there is neither a payoff nor a climax. There is no ending to speak of. It was like the author got tired of writing, so he just quit. And what the heck ever happened to Het Masteen? The guy just disappeared from the story and was left hanging, but it was nothing unusual since everything else was left hanging. No, I can't figure out why other people gave this a high rating. There are lots of good novels out there, but this is not one. This is the second time I've been burned on a \\"Hugo Award\\" winner, the other one was \\"A Deepness in the Sky,\\" which was just a snore. That's the last \\"Hugo Award\\" winner I'm going to try."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A would-be Foundation or Dune-style epic. The style is tedious and wooden. The story is not particularly imaginative though it has a number of pleasant conceits, ranging from the Canterbury Tales format of the first volume, to the various obsessive exploitations of Keats themes in the second, the zen koans of an AI nammed Ummon, and a pastiche of a famous scene from Romeo and Juliet. The author appears to be a widely-read magpie - occasionally a confused one, mistaking Brahe for Kepler. If his prose style were bearable, it could be quite entertaining.While I prefer writers with a good style, such as Bradbury or Kim Stanley Robinson, or those who aspire to one, like Dick and Bester, still I'm perfectly happy with Herbert's Dune and Card's Ender series, which are adequately executed and reflect the authors' real commitments to their constructed worlds. In other words, as someone once said (Shaw?) \\"fortunately, I am a man of low tastes\\". But not low enough for this. The world of the book is unconvincing, and seems to be based on broad familiarity with the themes of science fiction rather than any internal vision, salted lightly with uninspired sex and violence (not always easily distinguishable) when all invention flags. Even the author seems to have succumbed to the tedium well before the end.Toward the end of volume 2 Simmons repeatedly recapitulates recent events (from the same volume) in the apparent conviction that his readership is too cretinous to follow the plot. In this, I assume he is mistaken.The book seems to be immensely popular. It won the Hugo Award, which is a \\"fan's award\\", as opposed to the Nebula Award, given by professionals. The Hugo went to Harry Potter this year, which in itself speaks volumes. On the other hand, when the Hugo ballots are counted, they have more submissions for the tv/movie award than for the novel award, which suggests that the generic fans' notion of SF is fundamentally non-literate."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Perhaps I simply have never encountered this type of writing before - so dark and filled with unending images of disgust and horror. The writer is a compelling writer but I'm half way through the book and don't think I can take a moment more in such a hideous imagination. I hope some innocent and healing hand touches this fevered mind and lifts it into some kind of peace."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is more than just great sci-fi, it is great litterature, blending the disciplines of poetry, religion, and science. Simmons makes use of technology, the erotic, and the divine to craft a supurb and sophisticated text worthy of being seen as a 20th century Canterbury Tales."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A typical science fiction writer - at least a typical writer worth reading - uses and develops in detail a handful of key points, lest their story becomes gizmo gaga and mutates into the clich&eacute;d state of 'Star Trek'. Hyperion is convincing proof that Dan Simmons is NOT a typical writer... he passed that stage long ago.Hyperion is an incredible book. After the first three pages, in which Dan Simmons is a bit overwhelming, the story does something most scifi fails miserably at: running the gamut and fusing nearly every idea ever made great in science fiction into something unforgettable. The seven stories - the overriding plot and the six travelers' personal stories that explain the mysteries of the Hegemony - weave together into a work of art the quality of which is rarely approached within the genre. If the story didn't get better in the following books in the quadrilogy, I'd say that Dan Simmons had an unimaginably lucky break."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons take us into such a complex and fascinating world that you can't let his book go.The pilgrims' stories are masterpieces in themselves and the web-world scenario presented to us is described in such stunningly details that you would think he (Dan Simmons) had been there himself. Hyperion is a must to read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The 1st book of the Hyperion/Endymion series is the best in the series characterized by a beautifully imagined and described in detail future universe. Simmons has an amazing ability to make the reader believe that &quot;he is there&quot;. There is a huge mystery that unfolds within the 6 stories which constitute the new book. Simmons is a master of using words in a very literate manner."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"great classic book even my bedpost enjoyed i"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Great book. But writing sometimes leaves a lot to be desired. Has anyone counted how many times the word &quot;blink&quot; appears in the book? Probably every other page. I think Dan Simmons needed a thesaurus. As far as I know it's an unconscious reflex, Dan Simmons makes it sound like blinking must have some other physiological function."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It was out of pure curiosity that I read this book and it wasn't all bad. The charcters were wonderful and the plot intriguing, but at some points(like at one spot in &quot;The Soldier's Story&quot;)I found it to be very violent. Normally I don't mind this, but one part of &quot;The Soldier's Story&quot; was excruciatingly hard to read. On the brighter side I found this to be a very well-written piece of work and anyone who is into Sci-Fi a lot should enjoy it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It has been a very, very long time since I have been able to recommend a sci-fi book to my friends. Hyperion has not only been recommended, but I'm being thanked for letting them know such an amazing book exists. The mixture of Canterbury Tales, Keats poetry and sci-fi worked so well that I found myself reading nonstop. Fortunately I purchased the Fall of Hyperion at the same time so I was able to keep reading. The author clearly understands the struggle people go through to find meaning from their respective religions and meaning in their lives. It is so seldom that an author comes up with a new idea and then crafts a well written story that expresses that idea in a detailed, thoughtful manner. I would give this book more than 5 stars if that were an option."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A thought about the &quot;unfinished&quot; nature of Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion. . .Keats' poems by the same names were also unfinished."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"For sheer literary value, this is probably the best science fiction series ever. Anyone in his right mind will read all four books. The prose is just dripping with different symbols, especially if you know much about the life and writing of John Keats, the poet whose work provides the inspiration for many of the characters and passages. In the end, you get a slam-bang thematic message delivered with skill that rivals a lot of classic authors. It's like reading Heart of Darkness if you've got the patience to read into the imagery. If not, you still get a wonderful, action-filled sci-fi story."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is not a book for those who only like hard-core science fiction. Simmons will challenge your basic assumptions about the cosmos, will fill your mind with awesome mental images, and grip you with fascinating tales of adventure and sadness. This is a book you will either love or hate -- and you'll know which before you get far into it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"For those who have already read it, &quot;Hyperion is Cantos&quot;. For the rest of you:Hyperion is full of awe-inspiring concepts, brilliantly rich and real characters, flawless historical and technical accuracy cunningly woven together with broad-ranging philosophy... I could go on. Suffice to write, I have read only three books more than once...this I have read four times. Please read this book! In centuries to come it will be seen as one of the literary acheivements of this century."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is the first book in the greatest sci-fi series in the history of the world. If I had time, I would rather read this again and again than shaking hands with the president. And, I would rate this book as better than sinking the titanic, visiting the Oval Office, or supersizing the Big Mac. Thank you, Mister Simmons, for giving me a reason to live."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read this book on a cross country trip from the midwest to California. I liked it so much, I missed most of the scenery. I simply could NOT put it down!It's interesting to read so many varied critiques of this book. It seems most of the bad reviews have to do with 'unsavory characters' and the fact that the book doesn't finish in one volume.Well, life is full of unsavory characters and this actually lends some realism to the book. This is one of the ways a writer can 'suspend disbelief'. Hyperion is a story about the CHARACTERS - not about the shrike or technology. It is their interaction and relationships which drive the story.As to the book not finishing in one volume, this did not dissuade me at all. Dune, Foundation, Lord of the Rings - they obviously did not end in ONE volume. After reading the first story, it became VERY obvious the novel would require a sequel. And if you don't like this sort of thing, you're not going to like William Faulkner ! either! Stories go on after you finish reading them anyway. Funny how life is the same way. A novel is a slice of time - not the whole pie.I enjoyed Hyperion. It is science fiction/horror/fantasy that entertains. And in the midst of the entertainment, Simmons raises religious and technological issues which stimulate you to consider your own place in the world you inhabit.It may not be for everybody, but almost..."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Rarely, a writer manages to create a universe and characters which are so completely realized, so intensely involving, and so compelling, that it can be hard, after reading about them, to segue back to reality. Dan Simmons has managed to do just that. While alluding to Keats and Chaucer, among other literary giants, he works on so many levels that the reader becomes lost in the world he creates, a fascinating world which I, for one, found hard to leave. This book works on an intellectual level as a commentary on religion, as well as on a simple adventure level. I have read a lot, and I can easily say this is my favorite book. Read the whole tetralogy - it is amazing!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A wonderfully dense and poetic apocalyptic vision"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and its sequels have no equals. As the founder of the leading Internet VR company putting science fiction properties on the net, I find myself thinking about ideas in the book several times a day. I have hired people based on their comments regarding the book. Every person reading this review is probably on the net, so I'd say BUY THE BOOK RIGHT NOW. Why? I just don't think people will get the vast potential of the net that is under construction without reading the Hyperion series. Also, the Hyperion saga is FILLED WITH BILLION DOLLAR IDEAS that scream to be manifested in this world. At the moment, I am developing a satellite IP company, based in part on the inspiration of the farcaster network, as well as putting together designs for wearable technology inspired in part by the cruciforms. This world has become more wonderful and magical because of Simmon's fabulous articulated imagination, and I look forward to making friends with anyone and everyone who has also been inspired by Hyperion. When I finished the Rise of Endymion, I cried to think that there wasn't another book in the series. Please, Dan Simmons, keep writing. Please, reader of this review, write me and tell me how the Hyperion universe insprire(d) you. Thanks! Alex Lightman"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really enjoyed this novel when I read it several years ago. For any big fans I have a little inside info for you. In Hyperion Mr.Simmons mentions a small liberal arts collge on a cornfield planet(the planets name escapes me). This college actually exists, on earth. The place is Wabash College in Indiana."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book focuses on seven pilgrims chosen for a critical mission by an interplanetary government at a crisis point. The planet Hyperion stands between two Empires struggling for their survival. Hyperion's most terrifying occupant, the legendary killing-entity known as the Shrike, may hold the key to the balance of power.The greatness of the book is in the amazing storytelling. Each character tells their own short-story of why they were chosen for the mission. Their tales are amazingly imaginative, haunting, and action-packed. You will live, breathe, and cry with them. Their universe is a wondrous place, so go there right away! Winner of the 1989 Hugo Award for Best Novel. What more can I say?"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A while ago I bought Hyperion because I was bored. I sah the cover and it looked rahter inviting. So I started reading and I was in love! The John Keats-fixation was a bit strange but, what an imagination. I mean, this book is so universal. It questions the church, a uncurable reverse growing dissease and lots and lots more. It's rather like The Cantebury Tales only a hundred times better. After a while a just had to read the fall of Hyperion and was equally pleased with the suspence. Now I have to admit it's hard to find other titles that can match the standard set by Simmons. Also it was this particulairy book that awakened my passion for reading, especially SCI-FI!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Impossible de lacher Hyperion, La chute d'Hyperion ou Endymion!!Ces livres sont de v&eacute;ritables bombes &agrave; retardement dans les mains du lecteur!

Dan Simmons has taken care of developing the personalities of the various charaters; but most importantly for SF readers, the technology foreseen by Simmons is a) staggering; b) totally plausible.I truly envy those of you about to embark on this adventure. By the way, Book 3 is out and it's called &quot;Endymion&quot;.Ed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons is certainly one of the greatest authors alive today. The Books in the Hyperion Cantos are intelligently written with a true sense of wonder. Anybody who reads these books and doesn't like them are just announcing thier lack of intelligence. Simply a must read for anyone serious about thier sci-fi. Sensational!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A milestone, a true classic by any standards.This book describes the travels of two of the most unastounding people you are ever likely to meet. But they are both wonderfully funny with a humour only Douglas Adams can create.The two characters are Arthur Dent (a human with a wholly unleathal temperament, yet vicious wit) and his companion Ford Prefect (an alien skilled with the use of towels the most useful thing in the known universes).Ford works on a book called the hitchhikers guide to the universe and rallys Arthur's help after Earth is destroyed by a race of Aliens called the vogons in order to make a intergalactic bypass. There are many parts to the 'increasingly inaccurately entitled trilogy'.The book describes their adventures around the universe in an unamerican kind of way. An english sense of humour by an english author, this is absolutely unsurpassed as it has no equal. Read, Read, Read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Probably the two best books I've ever read.The second book in particular keeps you hanging on to the many possible outcomes without making you feel too distant from the main players.The only reason for not getting a maximum is the story about the Consul &amp; his mat in the first book, which to be honest I found a bit dull."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion &amp; The Fall of Hyperion:Simply the BEST sci-fi books I ever read"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read this book four years ago, and it still is omnipresent inmy mind before I attempt to read anything else. The sad butmagnificent story of Paul Dure, the commanding presence of Kassad, the epic poem by Silenus, pure tragedy of Rachel W., mystery of Lamia, and the heartbreaking joy of the remembrance of Siri -- reading, to me, simply at its best."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is an awesome piece of literature and will appeal to all avid readers of epic series. The plot unfolds like an explosion of events and implications and is supported by a cast of believable and interesting characters. Looking at the series as a whole, ( Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion &amp; Endymion ) there are a series of political intrigues that keep you turning the pages"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The structure, plot, and pace of this book is excellent. The technologies and futuristic society Simmons has created are reasons alone to read this book. It's scary, funny, poignant, but over-all... mindblowing"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really enjoyed Hyperion. The richness of the detail wasastounding. When reading it, it almost seemed as if youwere on the Templar treeship getting ready to undertakethe pilgramage to the valley of the shrike. The way DanSimmons intertwined the stories of the pilgrams wasmasterful. Throughout,his imagery and imagination wereso good that any one of their tales would stand alone, andin the collective they made Hyperion one of the best andmost enjoyable books i've ever read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you enjoy musing over life's uncertainties then this book offers wonderful insight into another's creative interpretations of the unknown. The author understands the power of story-telling and uses elegant pieces of narrative tailored perfectly to the nature, and tale, of each character."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is one of the best SF books I've read. It blends technology and future worlds with a complex morality. Simmons borrows from Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" to present this book. The reader is treated to different genres as each pilgrim tells their tale - ranging from the speculative, Chandler-like detective fiction, \\"religious,\\" and poetic. My only criticisms are the book has no true ending (as the story is left en media res, to be finished in Fall of Hyperion) and the Consul's Tale felt the most disconnected from all the tales (Simmons first wrote this as a short story, which explains why it doesn't fit as seamlessly into the narrative as the other tales). Still, it's a must-read from a master of many genres and early evidence of Simmons talent as a storyteller."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"How I, after reading scifi for more than 25 years, have missed out on the Hyperion series - is beyond me. The story and the universe Simmons describes is just that slightly &#34;off&#34; compared to other novels Ive read - that I was completely engrossed reading both these and the other Hyperion novels - wanting to find out what was really happening with the Shrike and all.This is a classic!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read Hyperion for the Sword and Laser group on Goodreads and I will definitely be reading with them next month. This was an awesome pick, some of the best sci-fi world building I've ever had the pleasure of reading, and the discussions were also some of the best I've seen. The story centers on a group of six pilgrims, making the last trip ever to visit a mysterious and probably malevolent creature known as the Shrike. They all have a past history with the Shrike and the world on which it lives - Hyperion. In this book, each pilgrim shares their story, slowly building up a picture of the future they inhabit, from its' politics to its' technologies.I loved the short story format, in large part because the characters were so unique. As I mentioned on goodreads, the characters almost felt like caricatures - they were each so very much themselves, so very unique, and so very easy to picture. And each short story reflected that admirably through unique narrative styles and experiences.The world built by the author was also very unique and detailed. What impressed me most was the thought he seemed to have put into future technology. I thought the concept of time debt from travelling faster than the speed of light was inspired and much more realistic than simply teleporting from place to place. The idea of houses existing on multiple worlds; of an AI intelligent enough to secede from human society; even a detailed list of new methods of artificial insemination in this future time - at every turn the author detailed possible impacts future technology could have on society.The writing in general reminded me of some of the classics I've read lately in its'... formality is the best word I can find, but an explanation would be better. Part of it is the large words (occasionally over done - gymnosperms used to describe conifers, for instance). But for me the defining feature is that it's the sort of writing I want to read out loud, to just feel the beauty of the well-crafted phrases and the carefully chosen words roll off my tongue.So with all of this - the masterful writing, the slow interconnection of stories to build a complex world, the great characters - this book was nearly perfect, with one exception In two words: the ending. As I learned after reading it, this book and its' sequel were intended to be one book. Fortunately the sequel, Fall of Hyperion, contains the epic ending such a great book deserves."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book was simply amazing. I ranked it 5 stars and it deserves every one of them. The only downside, if it is one, is that it's written at a high level. This isn't your average 8th grade level pulp science fiction. This was written by a serious author for serious readers but trust me when I tell you that it's worth the tad bit of extra effort."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"it's a very creative history. one thing that surpresided me was the capacity of the author to bring diferent writing styles in the same book as he tells the pilrims tales.but make no mistake, this history is one in two books. there is no way to know the real end without reading &#34;the fall of hyperin&#34;&#34;"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The way the mystery around Hyperion is developed along the book makes you want to stay awaken the whole night. Every character in the history carries a bit of the solution for the whole puzzle. Personally I loved the histories of Martin Silenus and M. Brawnie.Totally recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Crazy good. A sci-fi Canterbury Tales. The stories the pilgrims tell are great and they all tie together in interesting ways."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I loved the way this book flowed all the way until the end. When I read the end I was left with a feeling of \\"what the?\\" It was so bland. It was as if someone else wrote the end of the book. I know that Hyperion is only one piece of the two book puzzle but come on... a Wizard of Oz reference. Really?"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Aye... don't know where to start with this review. In all fairness, my kindle says I'm only 63ish% through the book, so maybe there's a mind blowing finish. But for now, It's an average book at best. The overall story is sort of interesting, and the book itself is exceptionally well written. But the author indulges himself far too much in trying to paint a really cool, advanced, enormous future world (galaxy). So much discussion about fatlines, farcasting, New New York (or other stupidly named future cities), the Web (and not the internet), a publisher constantly changing to the current web fashions, blah blah blah. In my opinion, it comes off as incredible cheesy. Granted the book was written about twenty years ago, so that may have sounded advanced at that time. But for me personally in 2012, I'm finding it not only annoying, but distracting from the main plot of the story.And then there's the overarching story. Timetombs, the Shrike, the pilgrims stories. It's moderately interesting, but it's certainly not a book I can't put down. Once I start reading a book, I'm almost always committed to finishing it. However, I may have to stop this one in it's tracks and move to something that's better at holding my attention."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This was a wonderful read, it was well thought out and so much went into the details. I found myself not wanting to put the book down as each individual's character was unfolded one at a time. The only criticism I have (and not really a negative) was that at first it was a little hard to follow the technical details, but I somehow think this made it a better sci-fi book. Ending the book with a cliffhanger was upsetting, but it only assured that I would be purchasing the Fall of Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion are essentially one book, so you should buy both and read straight through. Simmons comes up with just the right combination of *science* fiction, plus character development, multiple plot lines and locales to create a masterpiece. The ability to visualize from Simmons' text is an essential part of the appeal. This is far more original than the recycled space/war/fantasy works that dominate the SF scene these days. This is exciting and classic, and should not be missed by anyone that wants an incredible reading experience."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I thought there weren't anymore good books out there...doomed to &quot;flashback&quot; reads of tolkien's or r.a. mc avoy's...thank god for dan simmons...next to David Gemmell he is now my all time favorite writer...this book without a doubt will earn the status of a classic(in the league of lord of the rings and such)...the context shows that Mr. Simmons is a most educated person,I had to research his theories on quantum leaps and physics on the whole and he was more or less spot on...then there are the characters...so well developed...each and every one(and then some)at the end you are left wondering what's in store for them and rooting that they all make it...(come on give sol weintraub a break)...I am now compelled to order&quot;the fall of hyperion&quot;I am sure I won't be disappointed ...&quot;Hyperion&quot; DAMN GOOD BOOK buy it....."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A really great book. I could not put it down and I was even reading it for a college class in science fiction. We read this book after a full semester of science fiction and it was definitely my favorite. The references to Well's works are apparent. The Eloi-like Bikarua and the Morlock-like Ousters with their long fingers and limbs are described in the same vein. Also, is it any coincidence that the Shrike is &quot;The Lord of Pain&quot;? A nice little reference to The Island of Dr. Moreau. I also liked his references to the world of cyperspace pioneered by Gibson. The Lamia story is full of talk anout simstim, cyber-cowboys and the like. And don't even get me started with the literary devices that he uses... A great book I would recommend to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has produced an exceptional work in Hyperion. The book is a gem of ideas that was carried through by a writer who understands wordsmithing, storytelling and characterizations and how they all work together.Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Simmons wasn't very successful getting the same power in his next few book about Hyperion and the extremely interesting characters."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the first book I've read from Dan Simmons, and needless to say I'm hooked. This book is quite simply one of the most breathtaking SF books I've ever read. It easily equals the best of Asimov or Silverberg with it's brilliant narative. And yet it's strangely humane...Read It."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This sci fi series is as revolutionary as Asimov's Hyperion or Robot series. Simmons' ability to paint an entire universe in stunning detial makes the book unbelievably realistic. It stays with you well after reading it. I would--and have--recommended this book to EVERYONE, not just sci fi fans, and they have never been disappointed. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is one of the best if not the best story i have ever read in my entire life. It had all a good book should have and more. Those who are afraid of this book are just jealous that it might be better then some of the classics!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This story has everything a reader could ever want, realistic characters, amazing worlds, an enveloping plot, morethings than I could possibly think to list here. From the beginning of Hyperion to the end of Rise of Endymion this story explores things I would neverhave dreamed of. This and all the otherbooks in the Hyperion Cantos are a must read for any sci-fi fan!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've read what most people call classics. The Tolkien series. 2001: A Space Oddessy, along with the stories that followed. But, Dan Simmons's Hyperion, along with the following Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion, blow every other book away. From the start of Hyperion to the end of The Rise of Endymion, this series will not let you stop reading. These books are magnificent."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This series is so spectacular! I've read it 3 times & plan on reading it again soon. Definitely buy at least the first two books together, since they are the same storyline split right down the middle, it will frustrate you if you don't have the second book right at hand. The last two books were by far my favorites!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"What can I say about Hyperion, except it is one of the finest written Science Fiction books in the last two decades. Dan Simmons pulls you in right from the start. The charactors are very believable. And you feel for each and every one. Including the one you shouldn't. It is not a easy task writing through the eyes of seven people. And often when each charactor goes of into there one narration it some times comes of like you are reading seven different books. But Mr. Simmons pulls this off with out a hitch and makes it look all so seemless. I can easly say I read Hyperion and its sequels Fall to Hyperion, Edymion and The Rise to Edymion at least 5 times each. Don't hesitate to pick up this book or any book by Mr. Simmons."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I first caught Dan Simmons when I read through Illium a few days ago. I was sucked in by the Illiam due to its setting as a futuristic version of the Trojan war. After I was finished (and very pleased), I decided to check out his other books. Hyperion was the first.I am not a huge sci fan but have read most of the greats- Ellison, Herbet, Card, Anthony, etc. Hyperion, for me, ranks up there with any of those wonderful writers great works. The characters are wonderfully realized, the stories are compelling (on several occasions, I was up for later then I should have been to finish the pilgrim's tale) and the mysteries which are unraveling are keeping me on the edge of my seat. My only complaint, of course, was the abruptness of the ending- if I didn't have the Fall of Hyperion sitting in front of me, I'd be a bit more upset.Personally, I didn't find the blood, gore, sex and dark themes any more gratuitous then any other modern sci-fi or fantasy. This book, however, is not for kids and not for adults who don't like very dark fantasy"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"For me a good book is an easy read. That is not to say I like simple books, topic aside I like well written books and Dan Simmons has without a doubt written a very good book. The fact that this book has an average of 4.5 stars does not surprise me at all. You just have to read it to believe it :)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"To begin this review I will say I am on my second read of this book and have not yet read the next in the series. I am a big fan of sci-fi/fantasy but to put this book in that catagory seems to be an injustice as it would turn off many potential readers and also put it it the same catagory as one bestselling fantasy/sci-fi author who I will not mention ( hint being if you think a 4 book series is too much on an investment of time mutliply it by 3). This book has reminded me that sci-fi is really about opening a world of possibilities rather than falling into a pulp fiction formulae. I also read children of the night by simmons which is good, but pales in comparison to Hyperion. Very creative, imaginative, and original, isnt that what sci-fi was originally all about? Highly recommended. I withheld a star not because of any complaint just not necessarily on par with the \\"great works of literature\\" per se (whatever that may be)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a story of stories. A group of strangers take a one-way pilgrimage to confront a very disturbingly evil creature on a distant world called Hyperion. Each tells their story to the others in hopes that they can better understand the meaning of their quest.Quite frankly, each story could spawn a book in itself; they are all utterly phenomenal stories. They all push the boundaries of science fiction and each one is entirely unique.Consider a few of them:- A woman who ages backwards;- a priest who discovers evidence of Christianity 10,000 years before Christ... or is it an alien?;- A poet whose writings unknowingly shape the future;- An AI who makes the jump from machine to human;- A futuristic battle commander having a secret love affair inside the battle sims.Whether this series delivers depends on the sequel, 'The Fall of Hyperion', which I have yet to read. But, this book stands alone as a great one; though it does leave you hanging."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion will absolutely blow you away.The thousands of worlds of the human Hegemony are slowly collapsing into decay, corruption, and war. It is against this dark setting that seven pilgrims--a diverse collection of people ranging from a sadistic ex-soldier to a two-hundred-year-old poet--set out on a journey to the mythical planet of Hyperion, seeking out the monstrous Shrike. Each carries a desperate hope and a terrible secret. One holds the fate of humanity in his hands.The book centers on the tales of the seven pilgrims, their hopes, their dreams, their fears, and the motives that drive them to risk almost certain death at the hands of the Shrike. The story is richly imagined and textured with deeply human intensity. It's dark, frightening, enlightening, humorous, and heart-breaking.And impossible to put down."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Hyperion\\", the first novel in the \\"Hyperion Saga\\", involves seven individuals relating encounters pertaining with either Hyperion or the elusive Shrike during a final pilgrimage to face the dangerous entity who might either aid or kill any or all of them in a quest for knowledge or vengeance. The author brilliantly varies his meaningful writing to reflect the separate traveler's cultural background and combines elements of politics, religion, and science to create a fantastic universe.The Scholar has the most compelling and touching story, yet each tale beautifully told has its own flavor specific to the education and experience that include detective, warfare, and spiritual.The primary motivations behind political and religious organizations, which developed in a highly advanced computer space age, can be difficult to understand. The history behind the space expansion and some terminology is confusing throughout the novel. A detailed map of the significant terrains would have been useful.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the science fiction genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A millenium from now, a secretive Consul is called apon to join a Pilgramige to a world called Hyperion, home of the Time Tombs, mysterious structures that travel backwards in time. One of these seven Pilgrams may receive the ultimate answer to their lives' unanswered questions - most likely they'll all be slaughtered violently.In \\"Hyperion\\", Simmons has successfully blended disparate science fiction sub-genres such as military adventure, detective cyberpunk, alien mythology, and large scale political drama with personal and often heart-wrenching individual stories. Simmons uses the storytelling technique of Chaucher's \\"Cantebury Tales\\" to propel the overall story along. Each individual and vastly different Pilgram tells a unique and different tale that somehow meld together to become one coherent plot - all intersecting with the terrible killing creature known as the Shrike.\\"Hyperion\\" left me wanting more from these characters and ends in an Act 1 fashion.

Convoluted, a bit slow in places like all epic sci-fi, but what a story! Dan Simmons takes his wealth of literary knowledge and spreads it thickly all over the first in this classic series. Told as a form of Canturbury Tales, the book follows pilgrims to a shrine none of them believe in, toward a confrontation with the enigmatic Shrike on the planet Hyperion. And, like the Tales, they tell their stories along the way. Virtually nothing is predictable. Every personal story is gripping. For those who can get over the hump that is the slowness of the beginning, I can guarantee a life-changing read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the most fascinating series. I can read and re-read these books again and again, always discovering something new. Epic, and very well thought through."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is the first book in the four book series that is among the best series I have ever read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It's just as good as I've been told. Enthralling, with truly epic world-building that beats the pants off of the Star Wars expanded universe, it's also a compulsively readable page-turner, complete with lots of action, sex, poetry, and horrifying deaths courtesy of the Shrike, the coolest antagonist ever. I'm really looking forward to the sequel (though it makes me sad to think that I'll have to stop reading the series there, since by all accounts the series goes downhill with ENDYMION). But it's still awesome, and something I can recommend to anyone who loves science fiction, fantasy or speculative fiction."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. But be forewarned, if you are going to read this book, make sure you have the next book, Fall of Hyperion on hand for when you finish. In reality these two books should be one. There are a ton of unanswered questions at the end of the first book that are answered in the second."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a wonderful book. It's become one of my favorite science fiction books.It follows a group of pilgrims who have traveled to Hyperion to get answers. Each pilgrim has their own unique reason to be there, and this book is largely made up of their stories. And what stories they are! Each is wonderful, unique, engaging, well-imagined, and brilliantly written in a well-developed setting - everything you'd want in science fiction.It's the first book of a two-book story ending in \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", which I enjoyed but didn't find quite as good as this. Still, you'll have to read the sequel if you want to find out what happens as Hyperion ends just as the overall plot line is about to take off."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Well developed world, intriguing characters, taut apprehension and great allusions to other literary works. What more can I say, I purchased the next book in the series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The plot is not as good as the setting but still pretty good. It grabbed me with a lot of mysteries, some are solved throughout the story, some remain unanswered. I hate it when I have to buy the sequel to know what happened."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Fantastic and could not put it down. The only problem was that it is basically split in half with the Fall of Hyperion. Assume you'll have to buy two books if you want to finish the story (reason I gave it four stars). The universe created by Dan Simmons is satisfyingly fun and I liked the various individual stories. Each were great in their own right. Completely page turner."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Great Book! The stories for each traveler really hooked me. Each one was interesting and really made me feel for the characters."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a great book set in the future. It explores all that the human race can achieve, and one possibility of what role AI take in our future. I found most of the book entertaining, except for the very end. I was quite surprised at the ending and how abruptly it ended. Although, it makes you want to read the sequel, which is a bit more action packed than this one. Overall, this book lays the foundation for a very good syfi series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The beginning is a little confusing, but that just sucks you in because you have to concentrate so much. But your just getting started because this is the slowest moving and least interesting of the four books.It sets the premise for the following three books. This is a heart wrenching tale of future and past traveling in opposite directions, but merging together.I can't believe I had not read this sooner.This is a Sci Fi classic on the level with the Foundation series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It has been several years scince I read this series. What can I say. It moved me. Simmons has presented taboo subjects in a sci-fi content. The place and the times do not exist in reality but the philosophical arguments that the 7 travelers face and the hardships they endure to gain their goals are all real issues in the here and now. There is heavy religious thinking involved in the telling of this tale as well as issues like cloaning, reproduction, energy use, political structure, religion as a political force, religion vs. science, science in general and the list goes on and on. I strongly recommend this to anyone to read but beware. As some of the other reviewers have noted, this is not an easy tale for the meek in character. I lent it to a friend and he hated it beause of its religious sub theme. You will find yourself questioning your own beliefs as you face the dangers the travelers face. To me that is the beauty of scifi. What would I do in similar circumstances? Stories like this help to define the people we become. This book and the three that follow are as detailed and involved as any great epic. I can compare it to \\"War and Peace\\" in its scope and detail although the subject matter is far different. To make a long story short... I loved this It is my favorite scifi story. It is an easy, relaxing read and totally engrossing."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and it's sequel The Fall of Hyperion are masterpieces of science fiction storytelling. What a treat to encounter the far future universe Dan Simmons has created for us. What sets Hyperion apart from so very many sci-fi sagas are the characters. Far too many authors have great stories to tell but fail to develop anything but paper thin one-dimensional caricatures... Not so in the Hegemony of Man. The poet Martin Silenus is as prickly of a smart-ass as you'd ever meet in any timeline. Sol and Rachel's story is as touching as anything you'll ever read. I particularly liked the wit and humor of Ummon the AI personality of the TechnoCore.No need to go into storyline detail that previous reviewers have so ably outlined for you - other than to say that Simmons doesn't make an unecessary mockery of religion and faith like so many futurists do. There was nothing \\"preachy\\" (pardon the pun) in his approach to the religion angle in this epic. Three Cheers for Hyperion!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It's just impossible to finish Hyperion without picking up \\"The Fall\\" and continuing on the journey. Hyperion reads like Canterbury Tales, with each chapter of the story being told by one of the seven pilgrims on their way to meet a monster of mythic proportions, the Shrike. Each story explains the background of the pilgrims, the political situation, and history of mankind up to the 29th century. With each one, you learn more about this vast world Dan Simmons' has created: the Hegemony, the Ousters, the Web, Technocore, the Templars, and the unique planet called Hyperion. Simmons must be schizophrenic, as each story is told in the character's own style and befitting their personality. The priest's story is the most harrowing tale, followed by the intense and erotic experience of Colonel Kassad. The poet's story was difficult, simply because that's Martin Silenus' personality. The Sol's story about his daughter Rachel is the most touching, and after a slow start, the Detective Brawne Lawmia's tale is riveting, introducing us to the Keats cybrid. I found the Consul's story banal, but I couldn't wait to read on."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you read this book, you must finish the series. I had all 4 thrown onto my desk one day. not wanting to commit to reading 4 books I shoved them aside. Late one night I cracked open the first book. 3 months later I was closing the page of the 4th and final book.This series must be read. It is very thought-provoking. Iam someone who is not religious at all, but I enjoyed the parts about religion, it made me think alot.A book that artfully touches on the \\"meaning of life\\"Read it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a great story.Just had to remark on the previous review by J Willis.No offense intended but,Its a COMLOG not a CORNLOG!! Comlog as is communication log.Just thought you might appreciate the remark."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Excellent. Hard scifi.As they make their way toward the Shrike and the Time Tombs, on the planet Hyperion, six characters tell their individual stories. Each of them have been altered by the mysteries of Hyperion in his/her own, unique way, and now they have been called by the Shrike church to make a pilgrimage to the Shrike.Each story is fascinating, and often macabre and tragic.As we hear the stories one by one, we also get to know more and more of the universe in which our characters live. The introduction to the universe is painless, and integrated seamlessly into the tales.And the universe is magnificently constructed. A Hegemony of mainstream humanity, guided/used by a Core of Artificial Intelligence. There is a description of interacting with the AI Core in a manner similar to that popularized recently in the Wachowski brothers' \\"Matrix\\" movies. There is a population of humans evolving separately, the \\"ousters\\", feared and fought by the Hegemony. Both groups left Earth many centuries ago (the \\"Hegira\\"). The Hegemony worlds are connected by instantaneous-travel portals. But to reach non-Hegemony worlds, such as Hyperion, one has to do real near-light-speed travel, with the corresponding relativistic effect of aging slower than the people on the planets.Human nature and capitalistic greed haven't changed much. The Hegemony civilization trashes the environment and life of new planets, and exploits populaces as it expands. Lower classes continue to live miserable lives, in underground slums. There is a rich crime under-world. Publishers continue to exploit poets.The future-view is eurocentric, but not excessively. Among the pilgrims, there is a palestinian and a jew, and a most important character, the Consul, appears to be of Pacific Island ancestry. In fact, the colonization of the Pacific Islands happens again in this far future, as the Consul's native Maui-Covenant planet is incorporated into the Hegemony. There is an Indian planet and an East Asian planet, and many references from non-White cultures --the Hegira, the Benares, goondas, maybe other references that I've missed.Other than human nature and imperialism, the story is also -- quite surprisingly -- about poetry.And finally the question -- which of the six stories did I like best? I thought for a long time and couldn't come up with an answer. They are all excellent. The Scholar's tale is maybe the saddest on a personal scale. The detective's tale introduces us to Hegemony technologies and the AI core.Maybe the Consul's story is the saddest of all, on a global scale. It expresses the author's idea that imperialism and genocide are fundamental to human civilizations. And just as Whites have crushed the rest of us here on Earth today, so will dominant cultures continue to scr_w others, for eternity."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a must read for anyone who appreciates both fine literature and Science Fiction. No cowboys in space here... Well maybe a little...God, Monster, killer time traveling robot or all of the above... Every one should familiarize them selves with the Shrike!Read the first two books and you'll be locked in."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Hugo award winning novel (1990) with a brutal cliffhanger ending. Very cool picture of the universe and the &quot;hegemony of man&quot; in the future. If you liked the Vernor Vinge books you will like this... it unfolds similar to the Canterbury Tales... with 6 travelers sharing their tales to the group while on a pilgrimage. The Hegemony is a &quot;web&quot; of worlds connected by farcasters(teleportation devices). There is a troubling technological over structure called the &quot;techno-core&quot; which is populated by AI constructs that seceded from the Hegemony and serve as the technological framework of the government and economy for their own, unknown, reasons. There are mysterious constructs on the world Hyperion called the Shrike (apparently a creature that brings only death) and the empty &quot;Time Tombs&quot; that are both moving BACKWARDS in time for unknown reasons as well.I finished it last night and now need to get the sequel (Fall of Hyperion) because of how it ended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a great book. It's the first of four, and you need to read them all, twice. The story line is involved, complex and very engaging. Simmons had great depth, he makes you care about his characters. He reminds me of Steven King."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This series is simply brilliant. You do not need to love sf/fantasy to love this book - no, this literature. The flawless construction of future history, the exploration of humanity's flaws and emancipation, the emotionally engaging story of the protagonist, and the artistically engaging architecture make for a series that is simply not to be missed. This series will grab you by the soul and keep you reading long into the night. By far my favorite sf books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Just finished the book. Very good storytelling, new ideas, interesting cast of characters. It tells very personal stories against a backdrop of vast empires and galactic war.I didn't give this book a 5 because as a single volume, it doesn't complete the picture enough for it to be satisfying. The ending was way rushed with a (very) few answers thrown in for conclusion. There's too much left open and untold. It is literally a cliff hanger. I very much recommend this book, but be sure to get the sequels as well."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"i have never been a very big fan of sci-fi. after reading the hyperion series, my opinion will be forever changed. the series was fantastic and after reading hyperion, i had no problems buying the rest of the series. one thing i love is that the endymion and the rise are set in the future (after hyperion) and actually turn out to be a prequel to hyperion. this is not trully a series - more like one big book. paul dure - my god, i was rocked to my foundations after reading his story. read hyperion. i promise you, you will not be dissappointed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Not being a fan of long, epoch-like science fiction, I was daunted by these four novels. However, being a long time Dan Simmons fan, I made the effort. I've never regretted my decision. Hyperion and its' following three stories are &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; of our generation. Simmons proves that he can work and succeed in both horror and science fiction genres."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"How do I start? A great book, that forms the begnning of a series. In this book, a great picture is being reaveled to our eyes: A wonderful and fritning reality. I won't tell the story, but the stories of the six pilgrims are exciting and interesting in so many ways. Altough this book is actually just a prolog, the reality that it builds is something magnificent. I just hope that the following books won't let me down."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I came across this book by mistake, but it was the best mistake I ever made. Simmons' use of the Catholic church was brilliant and totally unexpected. A Catholic myself, Simmons taught me a whole lot about my own religion. He also gives you food for thought throughout the other books in the series by tying in and clarifying concepts brought forth in &quot;Hyperion&quot;. I get something new out of it every time I reread it, which is around fifty times by now. The new way to read it is to try and cast actors for the movie. Recommended to all serious sci-fi readers."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Why is Hyperion such a success ? Why did Hyperion amaze so many people, including reputedly harsh critics ? Well, Dan Simmons has pushed SF a step further, enlisting it in that closed circle called &quot;literature&quot;. SF, for a long time, has given us beautiful stories that have made us dream, clever plots that have tricked us but Simmons gives it a whole literary dimension : his style is unique and amazingly clever, his study of characters is simply enthralling. He uses literary tricks i had never seen before in a SF book and the themes he develops are, both on a philosophical and sociological ground, so cleverly treated I'm still thinking about them (i.e. the choice of Abraham). So much to say about this book and so little place. One thing to remember : if u wanna take a step higher in SF, buy this book, read it and think about it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years, and this remains my all-time favorite novel of the genre. Fascinating, haunting, literate and one you'll want to return to. You'll want to read more by this very talented, underrated author."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If I had to choose one book to read for the rest of my life, it would be the bible. But this would be my second choice, cant wait for Mr. Simmons next Sci-fi work!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Mr. Simmons has created a truly unique story. 6 pilgrims relate their stories on a journey to see the Lord of Pain, the legendary Shrike. Vivid insights into the personalities of the characters (such as the ancient Steinway piano in the consul's ship) and a very believable view of the future make this book a masterpiece. It is the kind of book which you have to put down every now and then to catch your breath (but not for long!). I finished it terrified, horrified, and craving more! The Shrike is the most intriguing and horrifying...well...thing. And the stories catch your imagination so that you are actually living and feeling along with the characters. This story is so different from much of the fluff that's out there nowadays (David Eddings stuff) and is truly memorable. (I found the Priest's story the most horrible and the most wonderful...imagine...seven years!)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons' \\"Hyperion\\" may be the best sci-fi book I've read in the last five years. It tells the story of seven pilgrimages who desire to see the mysterious Shrike. He (or it) is the spiky metallic personage on the book cover. Nobody knows exactly what the Shrike does other than killing people.When I first started reading the book, I was concerned that this was going to be a sci-fi book turned fantasy, because they start in space, and they head towards this planet, and the book cover looks like a typical fantasy cover. The last thing I wanted was for the characters to get stuck on a boring planet.Another concern arose when I got about twenty pages in and the seven pilgrimages made the decision to tell their life stories. The priest got to go first. I looked ahead and saw that his story went on and on and on for at least 80 pages, and then came the end of Chapter 1. I groaned, not wanting to read a boring John-Galt-like treatise on religion in space.I was pleasantly surprised to discover my concerns were unfounded.The format of the entire book is isomorphic to the graphic novel \\"Watchmen.\\" The story is told in the present as well as in the past. A vast majority of the book consists of the recollections of each of the main characters. The story that each character has to tell is amazing. And with each story, the reader learns important information regarding the story of the present, and even information explaining what had occurred in other people's stories.This technique is effective when done well. As you not only get to really know each character individually, but you get an amazing and complex story as well. The result is \\"Hyperion,\\" a very rich and compelling story.This book counts as Hard SF, yet it is very light on the dry factor. Fantasy SF fans may forget that they're reading Hard SF.Simmons somehow puts everything you can imagine into this one book, and he makes it all work: space battles, action, horror, religion, philosophy, artificial intelligence, mystery, romance, the desire of getting published (yes Stephen King fans--that's in there, too), politics, and stuff that jerks tears.It also contains some adult material, so I would classify it at a low-grade Rated R. It contains a few F-bombs, but Simmons is one of the few authors who knows how to use them sparingly and correctly, and I did not find them to be distracting.If I must complain about anything, it would have to be the little things. The main character, the Consul, is never named. There's a reason for that, but it really comes down to \\"because the author wants it to be that way.\\" There's also an epilogue that only exists \\"because the author wants it to be that way.\\" I can see why Simmons did that, but it didn't do anything for me.But that's okay, as Simmons delivered a reading experience that I will remember forever."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Very enjoyable read that I would rank up there with the likes of Earth Abides or the The Forever War. Although the ending does leave you hanging, the book was good enough that I plan on buying the follow up. The stories told by the individual people were quite engrossing and suspenseful enough to keep me up way past bedtime. The book is rated quite favorably and this is one time the ratings are correct. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you are looking for a short book that you can pick up and put down at your leisure, do NOT buy Hyperion.Once you purchase this book, you will not want to put it down until it is finished. Hyperion is not just some Sci-Fi fantasy story about space or time distortion, government deception or Artificial Intelligence plotting against man, although Hyperion has all of this and more.Essentially, the book is about seven travelers who voyage across the galaxies to a planet called Hyperion to ask the Lord of Pain for one request.. or to attempt to destroy him. Each of these travelers is a fully developed character that Dan Simmons could have written amazing stories about just as back-history for Hyperion.If you read Hyperion, prepare to be taken on a journey that stretches over hundreds of years of Hegemony history, spans numerous worlds, encompasses passionate lovers, and is wrought with grief, joy, and in incredible sense that you are not the same person who started this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read this book as part of list of the top 100 Science Fiction books of all time. While it is good, I was not overly impressed. I found books like Dune, Ender's Game, The Red/Blue/Green Mars series better. But it is a good beach read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"this is a very clever bit of fiction - it develops a new, future world, and drops the reader into the middle of it. Then twists the story between a range of different characters. It can take a while to fall into the story because of this swapping in and out - but twisting the different ends together is quite fascinating. It's worth knowing that you really have to read this one with the sequel - Fall of Hyperion - otherwise you're just left in the middle of the plot. And I, for one, found the ultimate ending slightly bewildering and rather unsatisfying - a pity given the work and detail that went in to the books ahead of that."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"There are 4 books in this series and if your read Hyperion you will be hooked. Our author Dan Simmons just didn't write a masterpiece of SciFi, he wove an entire universe. He took known things like Catholic religion and created a future of what Christianity might be. Hyperion introduces us to warriors, monsters, and an illness that makes one 26 year-old girl become a baby again. The entropic tides of the time tombs becomes an enigma that keeps you glued to the pages. The descriptions of the world, wars (both ancient and futuristic) are so vivid you feel like you are there. The excitement builds to a crescendo that makes you scrabble for the next book Fall of Hyperion. Good luck stopping at just one."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I decided to read this book because it was on a generic \\"must read sci-fi books\\" list on the internet. So I began looking at comments...and they were not making sense from \\"This book is horrible!\\" to \\"This book activated something in my brain\\" I was stunned by the effect. The book is well written in the sense that abstract images, scenes, and landscapes are scripted well enough that one need not have the greatest of imaginations to envision them.The book was...a master work! and when I was finished, I was left with the thought...what the hell just happened?......."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"There's virtually not a thing wrong with Hyperion. It tells a wonderfully strange and dark series of stories that are ultimately inter-connected. You've got all of the usual stuff -- aliens and spaceships, battles, and computer AI's. But Simmons does a great job fleshing out his \\"world\\" with interesting and sometimes surprising details. Unfortunately the later books unravel a bit and fail more than they succeed. Hyperion however is very worth reading if you dont mind longer and slower paced novels."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I enjoyed every single wordThe book is wonderfully written and tells a gripping tale which made me buy the sequel"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"At first I was a bit skeptical to read this book. But it came with a lot of recommendations, so I dove right in. Since it was the first sci-fi book I had ever read, the beginning was tough to swallow. I admit that once the author started to describe these \\"tree ships\\", I wanted to stop reading. I'm glad I kept at it, because the book turned out to be fantastic. After completing this book, I devoured the final 3 books of the series, eager to learn more about the fascinating universe that Mr. Simmons had created.Admittedly, this is the strongest book of the 4. The characters, plot, language, element of mystery, and diversity of technology make it feel very fresh and exciting. Dan Simmons does an excellent job of sucking you into this universe, so much so that when you're gibbering on about the book to a friend or colleague, the way in which you will describe the story may invite some strange looks and cause some people to edge away from you slowly with a nervous smile on their face.I recommend this book (and series) to anyone who will listen. It is my go-to answer for the question \\"Do you have any good book recommendations?\\", because I know most people have not read it.In short, do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This review is only as to the Kindle version. Found the story amazing and engaging but the many mispellings in the Kindle version were a definite distraction. Hoping the next book in the series escapes this fate."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Never what I thought I'd ever write about a sci-fi novel. But then again, I've never read one with so much depth. I won't go into the story; you'll have to do that on your own. Simmons shows, however, a remarkable grasp of the sweep of modern and postmodern philosophy, theology, literature, and history. These books are certainly worthy of commentaries as in-depth as anything ever put together about Finnegan's Wake, and these books are much more accessible. Here are just a few of the real-life plot lines turned into epics in this series: 1. The plight of Teilhard de Chardin's persecution at the hands of the Vatican (1930's); 2. A very personal rendering of Soren Kierkegaard's questions posed in \\"Fear and Trembling\\" (the Abraham problem); 3. The aesthetics of modern poetry (John Keats); 4. The betrayal and conquest of Tibet by China; 5. The mystery surrounding the death of Pope John Paul I. Throw in a fascinating story line, a tribute to Chaucer and Dashiell Hammett in the process, and you're reading from one of the most brilliant writers in the English language since Faulkner or Hemingway. If you don't understand it, go back to school, and try again. This isn't sci-fi, this is the Iliad, Oddysey, and Aeneid of our generation."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As many other reviewers have stated, Hyperion is a sort of Canterbury Tales in space, a book set around seven pilgrims and their journey to a location known as the Time Tombs. At nearly 500 pages, the book stops before everything is resolved, forcing readers to move ahead to the sequel,The Fall of Hyperion.What the book does well, it does very well. The multi-voice Canterbury-esque approach allows Simmons to not only explore the lives of the pilgrims, but also expound on the vast galaxy and history upon which the book is set. I was concerned going in that the book would simply confine itself to one planet without exposing me to the larger galaxy, but was pleased to discover that the individual tales become the vehicle for lifting the veil on the rest of Simmons's universe. The Hegemony (the name of the galactic political body), its varied planets, and its mysterious adversaries are all well-developed and alive, inspiring as much wonder in the mind as Star Wars or Star Trek ever did on the screen. The pilgrims themselves are a diverse lot -- some endearing, some irritating, others mysterious -- and their interactions add to the flavor of the stories they tell.The individual tales vary in quality but the best are peerless. The haunting story of Father Hoyt and the emotional journey of Sol Weintraub represent some of the highest caliber of science fiction drama I've ever read. A third, the Lamia story, has a few flaws but is a well-paced mystery in its own right. The rest aren't on the same level but are still better than average and don't out-and-out sink the novel. The interludes between the stories, meanwhile, work serviceablly to advance the overarching storyline and build dramatic tension.The book's flaws are few but unfortunate. Chief among them is the indulgent sexuality that runs through some of the stories. In my view the best writers (i.e. Asimov) lead the readers to the proverbial door and leave the rest to mystery. Simmons, seemingly playing out his own weird fantasies, is at times graphic in his depictions of his characters escapades... and in ways that are neither helpful to the narrative or in some cases even plausible. The Kassad story, which at times reads like something out of a low-budget direct-to-DVD sci-fi movie, is the worst example. More than just titillation, these scenes have a cascade effect on the book: they detract from character development and leave some of the pilgrims less fleshed out than others. It is perhaps no coincidence that the demure tales of Hoyt and Weintraub are regarded as the best of the lot.In the end, Simmons book is well deserving of its Hugo status and is one of the better science fiction narratives of its time. Its few flaws keep it, at least in my opinion, from it from the rarified air of the best science fiction novels ever, but it nevertheless is a solid epic that successfully creates and moves forward a living, breathing, universe all its own."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I agree to the positive feedback given until then. This book is very good and the darkness of it makes it very intricate and dense.I just regret one thing:There are many typing mistakes in the Kindle edition. It looks like it was scanned in low resolution and the l appear sometimes as i, the e as c, the G as C (the famous See of Crass!)...Otherwise, it is this kind of book which makes me enjoy every cent send for my Kindle!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is like a mix between a short-story collection and a MASSIVE prologue. Don't go into this one seeking any real conclusion, really Hyperion is a setup for the next book in the series, Fall of Hyperion. However, don't let this keep you from reading this excellent book. Some of the stories in this book are the greatest I've read to date.Earth has gone to ruin because of an event called the \\"Big Mistake\\", which happened when scientists were studying farcaster portals. A farcaster portal allows you to travel instantaneously to another portal whether it's in a different city, or an entirely different planet. Farcasters (and most other technology) are controlled by the TechnoCore, which is more or less an incredibly advanced AI. Humans are at war with the Ousters (who are also humans, but have adapted to zero-gravity). The Ousters don't really agree with the TechnoCore. The ousters are obsessed with a planet called Hyperion, which is where a mysterious creature called The Shrike lives, as well as the mysterious Time Tombs, which are moving backwards in time. A war of massive scope is about to take place and in the midst of all this we have a group of seven people who all have something in common; each of them harbors a personal secret and they are all connected to the Shrike in some way. Each person has a wish that they will ask of the Shrike and only one will have their wish granted. To muddy things up even further, one of the pilgrams is secretly an ouster. Each person has a story that they will tell while on this journey and that's what this book is, their stories.Hyperion contains some of the greatest stories I've read thus far. The priests tale is absolutely incredible. There are many times when I read a book and think 'this is just a novelette turned into a fluff-filled novel' but this is one of the rare instances where I feel that the story was too short! I could have read a full blown novel about the priests' tale, just incredible. It's unfortunate that most of the other stories don't quite live up to the priest's tale (though the Scholars tale is also amazing). Still though, even the weakest tale is quite a bit better than most other short stories I've read.The Tethys River and the poets' mansion are some of the coolest ideas I've read about!Dan Simmons is an incredible author. His ideas are great and for the most part his execution is spot-on. There were a few instances where I felt bogged down, but overall I found his writing to be well above par.I give this book an optimistic 4.5 (rounded up to 5 for Amazon)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Now this wasn't my first Simmons book. I had read \\"Summer of Night\\" in high school, and although I eventually forgot what it was about exactly, its grotesque imagery stayed with me for years until I reread it again a month ago. Another Amazon reviewer wondered \\"[h]ow could the man who wrote the Hyperion books pen this terrible, mindnumbing, unfinishable novel?\\" LOL. After I finished \\"Hyperion,\\" my reaction was the opposite: how could the same man who wrote \\"Summer of Night\\" be the author of this masterpiece? I mean, it was decent enough horror novel but I've read much better from Dean Koontz. But no wonder that reviewer was so disappointed: \\"Hyperion\\" is light-years above \\"Summer of Night.\\"The setting is some 700 years in the future, in which Earth has since been destroyed by misguided science. Most humans are citizens of the interplanetary Hegemony, a decadent and decaying civilization on the brink of total war with the Ousters, a marauding tribe of quasi-transhumanists reviled as galactic barbarians. Think of it as the Old Republic of \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\": a stagnant, overblown juggernaut suffering the mounting effects of social entropy. But don't let the \\"Star Wars\\" comparisons fool you - this is NOT Saturday-morning sci-fi.At the core of the book, which is actually first in a series of four, is the distant world of Hyperion, an enigmatic place where ancient brooding structures travel backwards through time and a nightmarish entity known as the Shrike feasts on death but is worshiped by many as the righteous instrument of retribution. As the apocalypse rises in the stars, seven strangers have gathered to make one last suicidal pilgrimage to the Shrike and the Time Tombs, each telling his story along the way. \\"Hyperion\\" is essentially a compendium of six interlocking tales (yes, six - no spoilers here!), all of them a celebration of joy, tenderness, and pathos that illustrates the distance between the heights of which humanity is capable and the fallen state of the societies in which they live. Lurking in the background, but coming menacingly forward in the second-to-last tale, is the TechnoCore, a \\"race\\" of sentient AIs possessed of seemingly godlike technological powers (it is at this point that an element of cyberpunk noir is introduced) that act as \\"advisers\\" to the Hegemony government. If you're familiar with Masamune Shirow's \\"Ghost in the Shell,\\" think of a super-evolved Puppet Master.Honestly, I don't even think it's really possible to adequately summarize \\"Hyperion\\" and do it full justice. It's too expansive for that. There is so much that Simmons touches upon - \\"Hyperion\\" is large, containing multitudes. It is a stunning work of art that is both dazzlingly futuristic and achingly nostalgic: it simultaneously rejoices in life and laments what humanity, at its worst, ultimately destroys."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the best science fiction books I ever had a pleasure to read. Dan Simmons has a talent for presenting a reader with full scale of experience. A true masterpiece. As a result I had many sleepless nights while glued to the pages of this wonderful space opera. The sequels are even better. Read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons is, in ANY genre, an amazing author. His narrative voice varies between prose/poetry/screenplay and effortlessly has us living in his worlds within a page or two of his novels. \\"Hyperion\\" and the rest of the books in the series set a new standard for novel-writing in general as they weave a story quite apart from any you've ever read before... and yet at times oddly familiar.Simmons pulls poetic, mythical, religious, and historical elements from throughought our history and history that is yet to be made. He describes worlds in such detail that you long to visit them, but must content yourself with the vivid images you've spawned for them (guided by Simmons' prose)in your own mind. He spins combat scenes -- both on land and in between the stars -- with such flawless splendor that it seems that Simmons himself MUST have served as an infantryman from the 29th century, as a starship captain on the front lines of some vast interstellar war, as a man fighting for his life with his bare hands... and yet these things are just a product of his narrative self.At once, \\"Hyperion\\" intermingles personal stories of characters so real you can empathize with their emotions and motivations; chapters devoted to capturing the sheer beauty of worlds beyond our imagination give way to chapters filled with frenzied action, which in turn give way to chapters chocked with eery symbolism and disturbing plot development...This book is, as far as any book can be labeled so, BREATH-TAKING. If I can advise you to read one science fiction or fantasy work at all, it would be this. BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've read the entire Hyperion/Endymion saga. All of the reviews on Amazon.com here do much of it justice. I'm not here to add yet more about what many people have already said about it... they probably did it better than I could have. I just want to say that it is very rare that a book can move me to tears, Hyperion for one, and the Rise of Endymion for another BOTH did that. Weintraub's tale is worth it for the emotional impact alone... as are all the tales in their own right.Short and Simple: This series will be remembered for as long as there is literature. To not read it is to deny yourself one of the truely sublime experiences of life."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the story, set about 700 years in the future, of a pilgrimage to a world called Hyperion and a mysterious creature known as the Shrike. The Shrike is a mysterious entity, the center of an apocalyptic cult, of great power and danger, but entirely unkown nature and objectives. It is linked to a group of equally mysterious structures on Hyperion, the Time Tombs, which appear to be moving backwards, rather than forwards through time. The events take place against a backdrop of a developing galactic war between the two subcultures of the human race that have evolved over centuries since the destruction of Earth.As the pilgrims travel to Hyperion, each tells their story and recounts how their life has been touched, in some way, by Hyperion, the Shrike, or the Tombs. The tales, the first one told by a poet, are an obvious nod to Chaucer. There are many other allusions as well, particularly to the great romantic poet John Keats, who is a character in this book and actually the main character in 'The Fall of Hyperion'. (Keats wrote two long works, Hyperion and Endymion, each focussing on the mythical war in which Zeus overcame Cronos and rose to the top of the divine heirarchy.)Each of the individual tales, on its own, is effective. Each also has a different style - the poet, Martin Selenus, uses an overblown heroic style to tell his story, the detective speaks in the voice of a noir crime novel, etc. Together the tales form a complex web in which, the more we learn, the more questions we have.This is the first novel in a series of four, and readers shoud be aware that it doesn't really stand on its own. This book and &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; form a complete story, as do &quot;Endymion&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot;, set about 250 years later. But none of the four can really be read alone. The four together form a work closing in on 3,000 pages, but are in this case the scope of the story well matches that great length. This is one of the best SF series ever written, quite possibly the very best."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Mankind has dispersed to the stars. One of its planets, Hyperion, is home to the mysterious \\"Time Tombs\\" - alien artifacts of untold old age. Guarding these tombs is a creature called the Shrike. It is a nightmare creature, able to slow time (thus making it impossible to fight), murdering in gruesome fashion those it chooses. In the galaxy at large, intergalactic war is looming, with the enemy's eyes set on Hyperion. Onto this world lands 7 pilgrims, each granted by the Shrike the chance of an audience. By tradition, only one of any set of pilgrims will be granted a \\"wish\\" by the Shrike - all the others will be killed.This is the setup for what turns out to be a series of stories told by the seven pilgrims (actually six because one pilgrim never gets a chance to tell a story, but I won't spoil it by saying who or why). Each one of them has an intimate connection with the Shrike that is revealed through the stories. Each of them has a compelling reason to risk death (and to risk getting caught in the middle of the war) to try and speak with the Shrike. The stories themselves are a sort of Canterbury tales - they are all told in a unique way, and are complete in and of themselves. The joy of the book is the fact that each is complete and each is varied - one is the story of a soldier training by immersion in simulations of the great battles of mankind through the millenia, one is the story of a father trying to find help for his sick daughter, one is a noir detective story of someone trying to find out who is trying to kill him. Each of the stories is very enjoyable in its own right - clever, varied, and extremely imaginative.The problem with the book is how all the stories are tied together through the legend of the Shrike. In a science fiction (even a science fantasy) story, I expect there to be some consistent basis for the science and technology of the the world(s) presented. Unfortunately, the Shrike does not seem to have any motivation, or even to be properly defined. Perhaps the second book (Fall of Hyperion) brings the disparate elements of the Shrike's character together, but it's still annoying in this book - which should be stand-alone in its own right! - to have the Shrike be a generalised bogeyman that is seemingly capable of anything.A smaller, but no less irritating theme is that of time. The Time Tombs are protected by an \\"anti-entropic\\" field that creates a situation where the Tombs are moving backwards in time. Many have tried this device, and all have failed (in my opinion) to make reverse-time a viable plot device. Simmons does not succeed either - his version of someone moving in reverse time is to have her age forward one day, then backwards 2 days when she sleeps. Unless time is quantised in day-long packets (which I assure you it is not!), this does not make any sense. Sure, it's really just a gimmick to tell the story, but it just doesn't work, even as a gimmick.Thus, the novel is a fine set of short stories, and probably should have been left that way. As it is, with the overarching secondary story of the pilgrimmage, it becomes unsatisfying and weirdly inconsistent. Supposedly the second novel (unread by me) follows a more linear plotline, but although I enjoed this book I don't have a burning desire to return to the world of Hyperion, and may never read it, as the overlying story didn't interest me that much."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book is amazing. This review is not about the content. This review is about the quality of the actual text, which is littered with errors - there is a typo on every other page. I'm not sure how e-books are made these days, but from my experience working with pdf scanners, the types of errors indicate that it was quickly scanned but never actually proofread. Whoever is in charge of this stuff needs to take action."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A very clever sci-fi epic, starting as a re-imagining of the canterbury tales with a series of twists. The Kindle version drove me to distraction, however. Unbelievable number of typos- I was *very* disappointed at the quality control of the electronic conversion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As a reader who considered himself a science-fiction fan, I had done very little reading in the genre in several years. The later Rama books, some of Philip K Dick's work, and others I cannot remember eventually turned me off due to their uneven writing and dated social conceptions.Enter Hyperion. I saw it on a list of defining science fiction, and was stunned that I had never heard of it. A friend lent me his copy, and I devoured the book like I had no other in years.Other reviewers have discussed the book in more detail than I could hope to, so I will instead briefly delineate its merits.* A compelling setting that incorporates relativistic space-travel physics.* An incredible mystery that is satisfactorally resolved in the sequel (which you must purchase *with* this book)* A central conceit based on some of the formative classics of English Literature (Beowulf and Canterbury Tales) in a *fun* way (As a 12th-grade English teacher I found the connection startling, as these two works plus the poetry of John Keats--another important influence in the book--are part of our curriculum).* Self-contained, intriguing stories: no padding. The book is very hard to put down because the stories move along satisfyingly quickly.I'd recommend Hyperion (and \\"Fall of Hyperion\\"--do *not* forget to purchase this as well) to any fan of science fiction or English literature."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"When was the last time you read a science fiction novel that successfully tied together various elements of diplomacy, technology, mystery, military conquest, space conquest, religion, and human interest? Yet remained a page-turner rather than a dull, ponderous tome?Hyperion and its sequel - Fall of Hyperion - are excellent entertainment. They give you all you the above, punctuated by sympathetic imagery and vicious, no-apologies gore. The characters and story line are well developed &amp; consistent. The plot of Hyperion is multi-faceted, a compilation of 7 sub-stories wrapped into one. These sub-plots masterfully blend into and reveal a complex whole in Fall of Hyperion, providing a rich set of building blocks for an engaging final conclusion.Unfortunately, Hyperion alone leaves too many loose ends. At the final page you feel forced to risk reading the sequel without knowing whether the author can tie it together in one more book or less. But without doubt, Fall of Hyperion is superb (a Hugo nominee), ex-post facto conclusive, and more widely appealing in terms of style than Hyperion. I recommend reading both novels together with faith that the unusual style won't detract too much from your appreciation of either."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"First, this is, together with the other works in the cycle (&quot;sequels&quot; and &quot;series&quot; do not do these books justice) a spectacular novel.Yes, Hyperion leaves many questions unresolved. But it is not a matter of a \\"cliffhanger\\" ending designed to make you buy the next book. If you pick up any of the subsequent books looking primarily for answers to earlier questions, you are likely to be disappointed. For every question that the subsequent books answer-which they do only intermittently and incidentally-they open another. Sometimes two. You will not find here any tidy endings or easy answers. Rather, these novels revel in ambiguity. It is not accidental that most of the internal narrative of Endymion and Rise of Endymion was written by a man in a Schr&ouml;dinger's cat box.The novels employ a variety of complex narrative strategies to explore complex ideas and present a complex multifaceted story. If you want everything neatly resolved, and all questions answered, there are any number of books that will meet your needs. This, however, is not one of them.The structural, thematic, and detail-level allusions to other literary works (and especially to Keats) are there for those who want to seek them out, but do not get in the way of more casual readers. This is one of the finest and most literate novels of the second half of the twentieth century, far better than most of what you will find published as \\"literary fiction\\". It dabbles in many genres (most obviously science fiction), but transcends genre as surely as Ulysses or Moby Dick or Huck Finn or Maus. Naturally, this leads to disappointment for certain science fiction fans who prefer strict adherence to genre conventions; virtually all the negative reviews on Amazon seem to fall into this category.If you appreciate superior storytelling, sophisticated narrative, imaginative ideas, and a profound concern with the human condition, this book should be at the top of your reading list."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I like Hyperion, it's a good book 4.5/5 stars.

Hundreds of these typos, there were even a couple missing periods It's as if there was no QA or editing done at all. Like some dude just typed this up in one sitting and said \\"That'll do, ship it\\". I can't imagine the original paper version would have this many errors."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you're reading this review, I assume you are wondering two things: Should I buy this book? And should I go on to buy the whole series? (Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, The Rise of Endymion)As a stand-alone book, Hyperion is one of my very favorite science fiction novels ever. Like the Canterbury Tales or the Decameron, it is a collection of tales by characters who don't know each other at first, and most of the action happens in the tales. But the tales are more closely related than the other two books I've mentioned. They are variations on a theme: What is the greatest pain a human can endure? Two of these stories have been seared in my mind forever. (I read the book several years ago.) I don't remember the others as vividly, but I do know that they gripped me at the time.I loved Hyperion because it is such a wonderful feat of world building -- the best and richest SF world I've read, and that includes Dune. It has the best alien life form?/technology? ever, the Shrike. I appreciated its intellectual seriousness. And I liked it because it was understated, not pretentious, and doesn't over-explain.Now, what about the series? Well, it's everything the first book was not -- grandiose, pretentious, and it explains everything down to the n-th detail. Simmons gets caught up in his own ideas, at the expense of the story. The second book was okay -- perhaps even a cut above the first one in the world-building department, as he provides more of the context for the first novel's action. The third book was dreadful, every bit as formulaic as other reviews on this site have suggested. I simply do not want to read another book about an author's concept of a messiah. It's just a license for preachy writing. To make things worse, Simmons takes his brilliant, unique creation, the Shrike, and tries to outdo it. No! Some things must not be touched. You don't hire a better butler than Jeeves. You don't come up with a cleverer detective than Sherlock Holmes.So it was a long time before I could work up the nerve to read the fourth book -- but it was worth it! Simmons finally returns to his form of the first book, with characters you can care about and questions that matter. Plus, he's got all the great backstory that he's developed in books one through three, and he manages to tie it up with a very satisfying conclusion. And yes, it's tragic. Even though you've known for way too long that the messiah, Aenea, is bound for the fate that messiahs usually suffer, the way she orchestrates it and the redemption that she offers are wonderful.So what do you do? Definitely, read the first book. It's a must. After that you have a tough call. Slog through two disappointing books just so you can read the magnificent finale, or just leave the first book alone and unspoiled. It's up to you!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I love Hyperion. I read it when it first came out and have always had it on my bookshelf. When I got my Kindle, I searched for it and finally seeing it was going to be available, I pre-ordered it and waited with anticipation of becoming lost in the story once again. I could easily have, if I wasn't constantly having to negotiate bizarre words. I must admit that the 'Sea of Crass' made me laugh - the first time. And calling Sol Weintraub 'Sot' could have been funny if by that time I wasn't completely irritated with the abundance of typos throughout. Did anyone edit this, or was it just scanned in, allowing some computer to decide which word it thought was being represented, getting it wrong over and over again? I feel that there should be a re-issue and anyone who purchased the e-version should get a free replacement. And guess what? It goes on. I've started reading The Fall of Hyperion and there are just as many errors in it. These distract from the story and I'm sorry for anyone whose first experience with these books are these 3rd rate renditions."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'll admit that when I first read Dan Simmons &quot;Hyperion,&quot; I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I had read it on the recommendation of an English teacher, and I could immediately recognize the talent the author demonstrated, but it took a few weeks before I realized how much I had enjoyed the read. The prose is beautifully crafted. It flows almost lyrically, with vivid imagery supporting an amazingly creative plot (which, by the way, is a loose parallel to &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;). It is filled with more allusions and references than you can believe, but it isn't written in a style that leaves you feeling lost if you miss one or don't know what is being alluded to. I caught lots, but I'm sure there were just as may more that I read without even recognizing.&quot;Hyperion&quot; is an English teacher's dream, ripe with all of the classical elements of rich literature, but manages that without becoming a student's nightmare of boring, dry plot and 19th century diction that unfortunately seems to characterize so many such 'literary' books. This book is certainly science fiction, but remains clear of the pitfalls that turn many people away from the genre. The characters are well-developed and the reader has no trouble at all empathizing with them.As a stand-alone novel, Hyperion could survive as an admirable work, though one with an abrupt and hardly satisfactory conclusion, but more importantly, it is the entry point to the Hyperion series, which is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This has got to be one of the best science fiction series I've ever read.

Ex. Illium + Olympos = Greek classics by Homer, Hyperion = Canterbury Tales by Chaucer. The idea is for various \\"pilgrims\\" to tell their tale of what led them to the journey. I like how Simmons uses each character to tell stories using different elements of science fiction (space-warfare, time travel, and psycho-horror). Some stories are really engrossing but unfortunately some are not as exciting, but it adds to the depth of the characters. And as other reviewers mention, it is IMPORTANT to get Fall of Hyperion as soon as possible (if you are planning to finish Hyperion) because Hyperion ending doesn't have a climax, it just ends. Fall of Hyperion quickly starts up the action and is more linear. I actually thought Fall of Hyperion was better, but make sure you complete Hyperion first."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am writing a joint review for both \\"Hyperion\\" and its sequel \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" as, together, they are one complete story arc - \\"Hyperion\\" figuratively (and almost literally) ends mid-sentence to be picked up in \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\".Man's civilization and empire spans light years through a wormhole transportation network that hummans use to travel between the stars instantaneously. Through a treaty with humanity after they broke away from man's control, the AIs make this technology possible and run the network of portals - no non-AI computer has the power to create the network.This empire is now threatened by swarms of augmented humans that live and travel between the stars and the focus of their attack is the planet Hyperion and its star system. Hyperion is not a normal planet as it holds the Time Tombs - empty and enigmatic vaults/monuments that are literally traveling backwards in time. Guarding the Time Tombs is the Shrike - a seemingly living entity made of razor-sharp metal blades. A religion has grown around the Shrike and believers in the Shrike Prophesies make pilgrimages to to see the Shrike where they are wither granted a request or sacrificed.As war approaches Hyperion, a group of humans gather for one last pilgrimage - each with their own history and reason for wanting to confront the Shrike. Each pilgrim's story and history is a sub-story in its own right and together they intertwine to build the story as it arcs across the two books.Questions about man and machine, human and AI, are answered in these two books - questions \\"The Matrix\\" could begin to ask.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who thought I might enjoy serious science fiction. And boy, did I enjoy it.\\"Hyperion\\" tells the stories of a group of pilgrims that go on a journey to the legendary Time Tombs on Hyperion, where they will hopefully confront a mysterious being called the Shrike. On the way there, each one tell the story of why he/she is part of the pilgrimage.These stories are easily some of the best I've ever read. They vary wildly in style and theme, but almost all of them are simply great. From the thought-provoking tale of Father Hoyt, to the witty and sarcastic tale of Martin Silenus, to the beautifully touching story of Sol, they all explore various human emotions and parts of life in wonderfully twisted ways.Hyperion is also exceptionally well-written, with prose that's easily up to par with the best traditional literature has to offer. It's beautifully written, without ever becoming pretentious, and really brings the characters to live.Dan Simmons has also created a very complex and original universe. Even if the rest of the universe and the history of mankind in space are mentioned only casually, it's clear that the Hyperion universe is a fascinating place. I especially liked how the author plays around with things we take for granted and completely twists them (for example, how Christianity is reduced to a nearly irrelevant cult, or how the Jews claimed their own planet to finally be free of prosecution). Occasional bits of sillyness (the \\"datasphere\\" virtual reality environment) not withstanding, this is one of the best attempts at world-building since Frank Herbert.\\"Hyperion\\" is a wonderfully written novel, which contains some of the best stories I've read in years, set in one of the most original and fun worlds I've ever seen.

There is mystery, romance, adventure, rags-to-riches, and revenge; all mixed in with a believable sci-fi backdrop set about 700 years in the future.Each story is unique, but the main thing that makes these stories so interesting is that many of the main characters are so believable and complex. My favorite characters were Brawne Lamia, the female private detective, and Martin Silenus, the Drunken Poet. But, the strangest story involves the fate of a Catholic priest sent into exile, after attempting to prop up a fading Catholic church using false premises.The stories are \\"told\\" by 6 pilgrims on their way to visit \\"The Shrike\\" at \\"The Time Tombs\\" on distant Hyperion. The Shrike is a scary metal humanoid, covered with knife-like protrusions, that can move instantaneously, and kill visciously - legend has it that he was sent back from the future thru the Time Tombs, to oversee the destruction of mankind. But, he is also said to be able to grant a request of one from a group of pilgrims, and each of our pilgrims feels it is worth risking their lives for the chance.I think it is worth mentioning that the technology in Hyperion holds up extremely well 16 years after the book was first published. Oh, there were some references to budding or outdated computer technologies (bubble memory, for instance), but even those can be explained away by imagining a \\"different\\" technology than what was probably being referred to when the book was originally written."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book is composed of essentially what serves as an introduction to a journey by seven pilgrims and continues in their individual stories of how they got chosen for the pilgrimage, plus a few chapters to describe their arrival to their destination. Those that read this one should know the next Hyperion book is set elsewhere, and it's The Fall of Hyperion, book three that finishes the stories of these characters as well as taking off where book two left.Few science fiction books have been literary by any standard but Simmons does not fall too short. In fact I wouldn't think it's too much to say this is the scifi equivalent of JRR Tolkien's Lord of The Rings, with rich language, evocative descriptions, even some poetry although it's best not to delve deep into that; let's just say Tolkien was hardly that dead serious of his either.The start of the book felt somewhat average until it got to the pilgrims' stories. You truly relate to them, and their accounts make fascinating short stories with various themes, bound together by the larger storyline. All the characters are far from cliched and have quite powerful contradictions - their inner demons - within what first appears one dimensional.Overall it is a great opening for the series, but the quality of the writing actually manages to improve in the following books. If you consider this impressive by scifi standards, wait until you get to Fall of Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As is perhaps clear by most people, Hyperion is the first book out of four book strong quartet: Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Endymion and Rise of Endymion.Placed in a distant future, the four books are actually two inter-connected stories set about 200 years apart:Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion deals with an inter-galactic war between Humanity of the Hegemony, an advanced galactic civilisation supported by autonomous AI (the techno core), and with travel between planets through instant farcasters. The politics within the Hegemony are incredibly complex, and everything is complicated by two factors: the mysterious and genetically evolved Ousters, known as barbarians to the hegemony, and the mysterious Shrike in the Valley of the Time Tomb. Everything in the Hegemony is planned and checked by the aid of the techno core, but Hyperion defies any clear analysis. All that is known is that a mysterious structure in the Valley of the Time Tombs are travelling backwards in time from the far-far distant future with a terrible message. As Hyperion stands in the balance as the universe is on the verge of intergalactic war between the Ousters, the Hegemony and the AI, a band of pilgrims are selected in order to secure the time tombs and solve its mysteries before it is too late.In Endymion and Rise of Endymion, the story continues in the much-changed universe as it has become, in the aftermath of the conflicts of the first two books.Reviewers typically focuses on the action in Hyperion, which is understandable, and some questions the length and level of detail. The reason for the structure of the book - six of seven pilgrims telling their tale as they travel towards the time tombs - is that not only are their stories interwoven into a larger scheme: through their stories hints are given to the reader to solve the actual and even bigger mysteries of the four stories...And this is what makes the Hyperion quartet such an incredibly rewarding reading experience. I have read all four books two times, and still I am amazed at Simmon's ability to keep track of his story. As a reader, you are introduced to the universe at the same time as you are introduced to the mystery of the universe. As it turns out, the universe itself and the destiny of mankind through incredibyle subtle and oftentimes brutal warfare and struggles of both physical, mental and spiritual kind is the real mystery of the book.Therefore, as an example, you actually cannot understand the full significance of the Labyrinth worlds of Armaghast, the heretic heroism of Father Dur&eacute;, the apparently dumb and mindless Bikura, and the apparent innocence of Lenar Hoyt - which all appears in the story of the first pilgrim - untill you notice how the many different peaces fit into the overall scheme. The very fact that they both appear in book three and four, suffering a terrible fate, is a hint as to how subtle everything works out.It is therefore more appropriate to see Hyperion as an ouverture and a laying out of the pieces to the first mysteries. Entertaining in and of itself but containg clues to the real and horrible and thrilling story that is the true mover of the four books.Simmons must be given a cadeau for being able to keep track of his story. That alone needs sheer genius. That he manages to keep track of it and resolve most of it (!) by the end of book four, makes this a born classic.Buy them - and enjoy a mindblowing trip into a possible future for mankind."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"i have been a fan of simmons for several years now and it is all due to the Hyperion Cantos. These four books and Orphans of the Helix are works that I truely believe, like the works of Lovecraft, Aurthur, and Asimov, to name a few, will stand the test of time. The characters are so well drawn out, and weaved so intricately into the story(even over the 300+ years it takes us through{700+if you factor in Orphans})that I've read the series through 6 times and undoubtedly when i do it again, I will find more that I have missed. It is a definate read. I have told everyone I know of the magic that is this story, and the master that is Simmons."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Simmons creates a hugely complex and nuanced view of a future in which Earth has died and humankind has spread to the stars, encountering alien races and technologies, hostile forces from Earth's past and artificial intelligences that are ambivalent about the future of humanity. He uses the structure of the Canterbury Tales to bring out the back stories of a small band of pilgrims headed to confront planet Hyperion's mysterious and deadly Shrike on the eve of an intergalactic war. Throughout, the underlying themes of the essence of existence and the nature of time link the individual stories of the characters. At times the story is both moving and the reader will forge ahead to understand the mysteries of Hyperion.It's a great idea, and it's richly developed. Simmons has created a sprawling, well-thoguht out and tightly integrated vision of the future. But three huge flaws mar the novel. First, nothing happens. By the time the characters relate their tales, they've arrived at the Shrike's doorstep and the book ends. Second, the characters are relatively flat. Simmons doesn't have much of an ear for language (each character uses the same structure and devices to relate their stories), and he can't figure out how to get the group talking together. And the sex scenes are just embarrassing. Third, there's too much detail that adds nothing except perhaps 150 pages to the book.If you like big ideas and enjoy creative and thoughtful speculation on the future, this may be your kind of book. If you're looking for interesting characters and a solid story, there are better science fiction books out there."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I made it to page 415; Not bad considering I'm not normally a sci-fi fan. The reason I read this book is because Simmons was referred to as a \\"collectible author\\" by a third party book; This is usually synonymous with \\"exceptional writer\\". Also, I like to try new authors. A couple of the stories were very original and craftily written. Other than that, I found his Sci Fi fantasy world lacking in explanation in many areas and very hard to follow page after page after page...Page 415 is when I decided to give up. At that point, I really didn't care about the ending.However, I find promise in his writing. I've ordered one of his horror books which hopefully will be better suited to my tastes."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is another SF story about far future events of cosmic scale, but it isn't child's story like special effect SF movies (think Star Wars). It consists of two books and for me they are one story that shouldn't be judged otherwise.First part, 'Hyperion' , is about seven travelers who tell their own tale and reason for their journey and second one, 'Fall of Hyperion' , is conclusion, with almost all whys and wheres explained (or at least writer tried to do it).Book is very nice but not great great. Last parts are difficult to follow and the end is somewhat pretentious.If you wanna top SF, try Phillip K. Dick's 'Man in High Castle' or 'Ubik', Clarke's 'Oddysey' , and there is much more stuff. This book is somewhat for specialized audience!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"What a GREAT novel - leaves the reader yearning for the sequel (which is equally EXCELLENT). Dan Simmons sets up the first of a very-engaging series. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Hyperion\\" is patterned after the incomplete epic poems by John Keats,\\"Hyperion\\" and \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" which center on the struggle between the Titans such as Saturn, Uranus and Hyperion and the gods of Greek mythology, Apollo, Zeus et al. Simmons uses this theme of struggle to great effect in the interplay between human-kind, a race of AI's known as the Techno Core, the ruling Hegemony and the Ousters (essentially genetically enhanced humans). It's truly grand space opera.Despite my fascination of the space operatic interplay between the large scale elements of novel, I invariably turn first to The Consul's Tale (also published as \\"Remembering Siri\\"), a story of lost love and youthful rebellion against empire. While such a plot might not seem adequate to distinguish this particular story from many other ostensibly similar such stories, it is the telling that makes the difference. Likewise, it is the telling of and weaving of the stories of the other pilgrims into the space opera that make this one of the most memorable science fiction works I've ever read and I've read it several times.In addition to the Consul, another favorite character is Ummon, an AI from the Techno Core, one of the Titans to be toppled. The scenes with Ummon are spectacular, the following excerpts (which are not spoilers) are among my favorite:Ummon of the Core AI: [And have you learned/taken to your spirit/unlearned anything from this]Johnny, the First Keats Cybrid: -- It is hard to die. Harder to live.Ummon: [Are you/ Brawne Lamia/ the layers of self-replicating/ self-deprecating/ self-amusing proteins between the layers of clay]...Ummon: [Yes/ I am Ummon of the Core/AI\\\\\\\\ Your fellow slow-time creature here knows/ remembers/takes me unto his heart this\\\\\\\\ Time is short\\\\\\\\ One of you must die here now\\\\\\\\ One of you must learn here now\\\\\\\\ Ask your questions]Johnny: -- Why was I murdered? Why was my cybrid destroyed, my Core persona attacked?Ummon: [When you meet a swordsman/ meet him with a sword\\\\\\\\ Do not offer a poem to anyone but a poet]With this Gibson meets his master!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"You're maybe thinking, \\"It's just one of those sci-fi series; let me forget it already.\\" Well, think twice before picking up some other book.The Hyperion Cantos is one of the best sf series, and it all begins with this book, Hyperion. In my opinion The Fall of Hyperion is equally good or maybe slightly better; Endymion and The Fall of Endymion are good, too, but are not in the same league as the first two (my opinion, which may change over time). If you appreciate well-written and deep/complex stories, Hyperion will probably occupy your mind.For those unfamiliar with Dan Simmons or his stories (including novels of course), he is a recipient of (I counted quickly) four Bram Stokers, which is an award indicating works of excellence in horror fiction (among other things); furthermore, he won two World Fantasy Awards; and also a Hugo for Hyperion.If you have nothing with awards as such, he's the author of Song of Kali, Carrion Comfort, and Phases of Gravity (and many others, including story collections such as Lovedeath).If none of the above books ring a bell, trust me, \\"Buy and read Hyperion.\\""},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The story is rich, complex, has many great characters, is exciting, makes you think, and fills you with wonder. This, and the Fall of Hyperion, is Dan Simmons best work. The book is so good that unfortunately none of his other work can come close to its greatness (although much of his other work till about 6 years ago) is pretty darn good. A later two addition to this series, while fun, doesn't come close (and somewhat takes away) to these two original masterworks. If you love SciFi at its ultimate best (better than Dune) then don't live without it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"see my review of fall of hyperion"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have read a dozen or so of the lengthier reviews and by and large, I agree with their praises for this book, so read a number of those reviews. Few authors are able to intersperse intelligent, thoughtful commentary on government, technology, religion, environmentalism and politics within an interesting plot, yet refrain from becoming heavy-handed (Tom Clancy should read Hyperion - he could learn a lot from Simmons). I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it kept me turning pages, wanting to find out the next plot twist, and the backgrounds behind the seven pilgrims.However, the book's greatest fault (and this is about as praiseworthy a criticism as I can imagine) is that Simmons rushed through the stories of the pilgrims without providing us enough detail. Each one of those individual stories has a very intriguing emotion-packed theme and I really wanted to see them developed a bit more fully, which also would have developed the characters more fully. In particular, the Consul's story of his military &quot;shipman&quot; grandfather's romance with his native grandmother Siri, in which his grandfather aged at 1/11th the rate of people on Siri's planet, was a beautiful and sad theme that deserved perhaps a whole book, not just 30 or so pages.I was left with a few niggling questions that Simmons did not adequately answer. First, he mentions &quot;The All Thing&quot; and at various times seems to give it the characteristics of a religion, of the body of government in the Hegemony, of the communications system throughout the universe, or the omnipresent data system, but never does define it. Second, Hyperion's world, with hundreds of billions of people in it, seems far too expanded, developed and evolved to take place just 700 years in our future. Third, Siri's romance with her &quot;Shipman' lover becomes famous and celebrated throughout her planet, yet the reason for this is never explained. Is it because of the sad reality of the difference in their aging? If so, Simmons does not explain why Siri ages 11 times faster than her lover - is it because days are so much shorter on her planet? Is it because her people have genetically evolved in that fashion? Is it because she aged at a normal rate, but the Consul's grandfather spent so much time in chryrogenic hybernation during space travel, and did not age while he was gone for years? Maybe these questions are answered in the next volume of this series, Fall of Hyperion (I am about halfway through this book). If anyone has answers to these questions, please post them in a subsequent review.A final comment: a fair number of those with criticisms of this book have been most disappointed with the lack of an ending for this book. Come on people?!?!! It is the first book in a series of four. Were you disappointed that you did not have a complete ending to The Fellowship of the Ring? Of course not! Have some patience and read at least the next book in the series.All in all, this was a very enjoyable, thought provoking book that left me wanting more - not because the plot was inadequate, but because the plots and themes were so interesting that I wanted them developed a bit more. Recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Long story, but interesting development of individual stories. This book was handed to me by someone that could not finish the book due to boredom, it is slow. The ending, well there isn't one, so if you are one of those expecting any culmination to any issue developed in the book, read something else.It's a good story and it's well written if you are not a grammar Nazi but it leaves you flat and it is slow. It's highly over rated compared to classics like Dune, enders game, snow crash etc... but to each his own."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A roller coaster ride through time and space, Hyperion will lead you to the most unexpected conclusions I have ever read (at least after book two)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"To put it mildly, Dan Simmons succeeded in completely transplanting me into another world. This book, along with it's two sequels, completely absorbed me. I can't recommend this book and this series highly enough. Thanks Dan!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have to say that the immense detail that Simmons goes into in this book is truly amazing. He manages to meld a whole futuristic universe together and make it seem like your actually there. However, by the end of this book, I was left feeling uninterested in anything that had passed. The short stories are intertwined rather well, but overall lead in no general direction whatsoever. While this lets you get a good idea of what each character is like, each story is very very anticlamactic. I had no want to read the next book in the series after finishing this, Ill take the book in for the experience It was, a decent read..."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The last great sci-fi novel? Could be, I have never read anything approaching it since. I also recomend you pick up a book of greek and roman mythology. The series gets its character names from there."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons combines horror, science-fiction and very real literary intelligence to produce a fascinating story about the mysteries of the planet Hyperion. Structured loosely like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, &quot;Hyperion&quot; is the account of seven pilgrims journeying to seek answers at the Shrine of the Shrike, the mysterious and cultic killing machine that is somehow inextricably tied with each of the pilgrims' secrets. As they journey to the Shrine, they share their stories.Simmons' fascination with the poet John Keats and the almost tangible presence of his poetry throughout the story only adds to the strangeness of his tale.I highly recommend this book to those interested in imaginative and intelligent science fiction, or lovers of Keats (hee hee)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I would rate this book 6 stars on the 5 point scale.This book will keep you up late and have you dropping your jaw on occassion. It is set in the far future and a completely believeable one at that. You have a creature called the Shrike who likes to cut people to pieces. Time tombs which have this strange property of aging in reverse and a group of pilgrims with very interesting pasts.If you are not a science fiction fan, you might be after reading this tour de force by Dan Simmons. Don't waste your time reading any more reviews, just read the book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I just finished this book an hour ago, and I am still in awe. This sci fi is up next to Dune by Frank Herbert on my list of &quot;Must Reads&quot;. I think that Dune was more planned on the part of the athor though, Herbert was into the research, and explaining everything in detail. Simmons just kinda through everything at me, but in one of the most creative forms I have seen in a long time. I won't bother expaining, just read it, espesially if you like science fiction and have an imagination that you can't seem to control."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is an entertaining and a very satisfying read. The plot slowly unfolds as members of a small group each reveal why they agreed to participate in a pilgrimage to save mankind to Hyperion, home of the mysterious Time Tombs and the Shrike.The stories are rich in details about life and cultures in the massive Hegemon universe. Some tales are especially moving and it is easy for the reader to emphathize with the tragedies that led each character to join the pilgrimage. The ending of this novel is ambiguous but is still neatly wrapped up. I'm looking forward to the next novel in the series!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Great plot, story development, and characters. Actually makes you think."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a very entertainng read - well constructed and thought out science fiction which ranks it up there with &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. What is particularly appealing is the way each character unfolds their story as their pilgrimage progresses, with each story very different but equally as interesting. The world of the future is painted as vivid and believable, though I do agree with some other reviewers who have commented that the author appears to be totally obsessed with John Keats.A final comment - don't bother reading Keats' poem &quot;Hyeprion&quot; if you are not already familiar with it - it sheds little light on the complexity of the novel.Over all it is a rich, detailed and enjoyable epic, great for escapism and one which I thoroughly recommend."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"2 pages into Hyperion and I said to my wife \\"I can already tell that this book is going to be great science fiction.\\" I was right. It really stretches the imagination. A great read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read the whole saga 3 times, all 4 books, and I loved them all 3 times. The only other novels I have read that much is Dune by Frank Herbert. If you are a fan of sci-fi, it doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"How refreshing to read a futuristic sci-fi novel full of alien worlds, races, concepts and imagery - yet one which is very easy to read and understand. For that Dan Simmons deserves enormous credit for the clear nature of his prose.I've sometimes read novels by Banks and Bear where you feel the authors are being deliberately obtuse with their language to try to convey the \`alien-ness' of the settings. No such narrative device is used here - yet the novel succeeds brilliantly in conveying to the reader that we're certainly not in Kansas anymore.As many have mentioned in previous reviews the novel is broken into seven short-stories - each a tale told by one of the travelling companions on a trip to the mysterious world Hyperion, and a strange creature, The Shrike.Simmons alters his writing style for each of the tales giving the impression of seven distinct narrators of the tales. I have to say I enjoyed all the tales in their own way - they are quite different in terms of overall style (thriller, romance, tragedy, crime fiction, mystery, etc), but I have a broad palate and can see why some will prefer certain tales over others..I will not mention much on the overall plot, save to say, I have rarely enjoyed a sci-fi novel as much, and that I'm certainly eager to continue reading the following novels in the Hyperion series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I find very few novels that can really impress upon the reader the vastness of a galaxy-spanning civilization. Without pummeling the reader with cumbersome detail (how else would you do it?) Dan Simmons managed to pull it off. I think it must be the vivid description of several parallel-plot locations. Simmons's treatment of long range travel and communication also added a lot of legitimacy to the universe he managed to create within the span of a book.Although not a \\"horror\\" piece, Simmons I think penned some of the most terrifying ideas in print. One has to do with the \\"Shrike\\" and his \\"Tree of Thorns\\" and the other has to do with a certain character, Father Paul Dure, finding a way to end his life after he has apparently been made near immortal (self crucifixion and something called a \\"Tesla Tree\\" are involved.) I don't want to give too much away, so please read it.The story of Sol Weintraub, the \\"Wandering Jew,\\" and his daughter Rachel, with its Biblical allusions, struck me as one of the most moving and amazingly crafted pieces of wizardry I've experienced in a book (look for it in _The Fall of Hyperion_ also.) I couldn't help my emotional involvement the characters.I persuaded a few friends (who normally shy away from SciFi) to read the book and they all found it a great read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Before I buy a product off amazon or other sites I usually look at the one-star comments first. These are the most detrimental to the rating so I try to get a scope of the general grievances. Most people are turned off by the ending. I will not ruin anything for you but the story is not complete. This novel and its sequel \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" should have been molded into one story, but it my guess that his publisher would not allow the printing of a 1100 page book. The lack of closure is no reason to put this book in the one-star category. It is a fantastic novel and masterwork of the genre. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science fiction and to people who are simply interested in a great story. I will also recommend the other three books but bear in mind that the third and fourth book may share the same universe as the first two, but deal with much different issues."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the best science fiction novels I have read in quite some time. I avoided the book for a few years (since actually hearing about it) due to the cover which seemed to indicate swords and sorcery (the wind driven ship being the hint at that genre). I picked it up after numersous recommendations and a review of some best of lists.Its kind of a book of short stories, as you get introduced to all the characters going on a pigrimage to the time tombs on Hyperion. A mysterious fluid metal character is kiling people around the time tombs while the people on the planet are fleeing an oncoming invasion from another branch of humanity. Each person is coming along for different reasons of course but you do become vested in each person. Very character driven and very universe building. I can't wait to till the second part. I have not been this geeked to read a part two in decades. Ed - Aged 43 - 4-21-08. I am also a big fan of Enders Game, The Dune Series, The Berserker Wars short stories, The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress and this ranks up there with each of those items."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I was in a flea market, browsing around stalls and I happened to see this book lying there. I had never heard of Dan Simmons, the book title, and didn't know it was a best-seller. But the cover art got my attention...I'm like that with books, cds, etc all the time. I got for that alone.I just HOPED, hoped that it would be a worthy read. By the first chapter I was beginning to really dislike the characters and the setting, I wasn't enjoying where it was going at all. Then boom, it started happening...the pilgrims started telling their own stories on the journey to the Time Tombs and bam, by the time the book was over, I managed to appreciate each character for who he or she was simply because they had been FLESHED out. Even though I disliked half of the characters, I began to feel I knew them because each story was so bizarre, unique and showed each person's humanity.Frankly, it was almost worth it alone for Father Hoyt's story of Paul Dure, even more of a stroke of genius was having it all in journal form. I haven't read a tale that chilling in a long time. I was disappointed it was over and had to listen to the next person's story.Granted the story lagged like all books, I found myself disinterested in many places but at some point moat of the stories would reach a frenzy that would hook you til its conclusion. And all the while it strung along the present story of the pilgrim's trip to the Time Tombs. And of course the ever present enigma of the Shrike and what it is...is baffling too.I could have done without some of the occasional sexual and gory detail. That just threw me off in disgust every time they did it.And I kinda thought the ending was funny...it brings up an amusing image when I think of it. I liked how it closed the book personally. The storm brewing ahead of all the characters bleeds into the next book \\"Fall Of Hyperion\\"Altogether, a well written book. I've read better, but it certainly surpassed my expectations."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the story of 7 people that are on a pilgrimage to the planet Hyperion. To be more precise, they're headed towards the mysterious \\"Time Tombs\\" (kind of hard to explain as I had a hard time visualizing them, but I don't think they'd be on anyone's list of \\"sights to see\\". Especially considering that Hyperion (and the Time Tomb area, especially) is home to the Shrike, a metal, towering creature armored with enough blades and spikes that even Predator would think twice before messing with one of them.The 7 people have never met nor do they have any clue what lies in store for them. From the beginning on a giant tree-shaped spaceship the 7 decide to share their stories of Hyperion, in hopes that a common denominator will be found, something that will prepare them for what they'll face in the days ahead.Each person's story is like a novella and the breakdown is like this:The Priest: The priest tells the tale of another priest that went to Hyperion and found an ancient civilization . . . and later a secret that the civilization tried to hide from him. The priest's tale is one of the highlights in this book.The Soldier: The soldier tells of the many battles he's been in and the strange female that he meets in virtual-reality battlefields. The sex scenes, I must say, were a bit laughable here. But overall this was another good \\"section\\" of the book.The Poet: The poet tells of his book that sold BILLIONS of copies in the universe, a feat, needless to say, he was unable to duplicate. Later goes to Hyperion where he hangs out with one of it's early leaders, Sad King Billy. An average \\"section\\" of the book.The Scholar: Of all the stories the pilgrims tell, Sol Weintraub's is by far the best. His daughter goes to the Time Tombs themselves where something goes terribly wrong that causes something that might remind you a little of \\"50 First Dates\\" or \\"Flowers for Algernon\\".The Starship Captain: You might have to read \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" for his story--it's not in this one.The Detective: The detective tells her story of a cybrid that wants her to investigate its own death. This story was the most confusing but still somewhat entertaining.The Consul: The Consul tells the story of a man that goes to a small waterworld planet and meets a girl while on R and R. If you thought long-distance relationships were hard you've got to read this one! One of the better \\"sections\\".And overall it's a pretty good book, some parts are not as gripping as others and the ending is a bit abrupt, but for all that one can easily see how this got the Hugo."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am an avid sf/fantasy reader, and I have to say that this and its sequel (actually, second half) &quot;Fall of Hyperion&quot; are among the best books I have ever read. The plot concept is wildly imaginative, and the execution is wonderful. It's one fascinating surprise after another, science fiction with a strong fantasy element. I loved it. Just be sure to buy BOTH books, as the first stops suddenly, leaving a craving for the second."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"With 328 reviews thus far that add up to a nearly perfect 5 rating, its obvious that Dan Simmons' &quot;Hyperion&quot; is beloved by many readers. Indeed, the novel seems to bring out the rhapsodical in many reviewers. And if you've read any of these reviews, you know its for good reasons.\\"Hyperion\\" is, to the best of my knowledge, the first SF novel that must be considered a literary masterpiece, which is to say, canonical as literary fiction. In mho, it marks the emergence of contemporary SF as Literature. And because Dan Simmons wrote such a beautiful novel back in 1989, a generation of SF writers has emerged to write a species of fiction unprecedented in the history of literature, a species that thenceforth has redefined the idea of the Novel. That may be overstating the case, but the purity and overpowering poetical sensibility of Simmon's writing cannot be disputed. And in no way to diminish the achievements of Gene Wolfe and Robert Silverberg - the grandfathers of literary SF - but Simmons was the first novelist to deliberately embrace the so-called literary canon and weave it into a profound and beautiful SF tapestry.\\"Hyperion\\" and \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" constitute a single novel often referred to as \\"The Hyperion Cantos\\" (after the book club edition title). And taken as a single story, a single novel, it is a breathtaking affirmation of the imaginative storyteller's art and craft. But it is not simply a story well told, it is SF. And that means it is about ideas. \\"Hyperion\\" and its sequel are ideas cloaked in literature. They are, in point of fact, novels that provoke wonder (which is exactly what science fiction has always been about).I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book will stand rightfully amongst its older peers such as LOTR, the Foundation Trilogy and Dune. This is one of the most masterful tales ever woven, and the universe Simmons creates is one you feel you're actually living in while you're reading the book, even though the story takes place seven hundred years into the future. Simmons mixes narrative styles and literary genres to come up with a tale that is not quite sci-fi, not quite a battlefield tale, not quite detective novel, but wholly and uniquely human."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I just completed the Hyperion saga and I am left stunned. This intense journey of the human spirit, from the self-indulgent, self-centered citizens of the Hegemony, to the conscious, ever growing humans at the end of the Fall of Endymion, starts here (in Hyperion) with the story of seven pilgirms selected to travel to a strange valley where they will encounter the Shrike (a mysterious creature of the future) and join in determining the path of humanity. Mr. Simmons characters, imagination and science build a universe with such detail, solidity and humanity, I felt I was leaving friends and loved ones behind when I turned the last page."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Anyone who likes to read a good SF-novel sure needs to try one of these babies.

These books only come once a million!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"What can I say, this book is by far some of the best science fiction I have ever read. The way Mr. Simmons writes makes me just keep reading and the story of this group of people each with one terrifying link in their extrodinary pasts in common is a interesting look at the group of people in a well described setting in a fantastic universe that I like better than even Known Space. The way that Mr. Simmons weves the tales of the pilgrims terrible pasts togeather is nothing short of marvelous and the description of humanity and its reactions to strange situations are some of the most compelling I have read since I last read A Tale Of Two Cities (one of the best books on interactions among people ever written). Over all I would say that if you are looking for a Science Fiction book, this is the one for you or even if you would like to try a something a little different from mainstream pop novels, this book will leave you fealing like you have gained something for the time you spent reading it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are nothing short of awesome!!!

What a talent."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I just finished Hyperion and am starting on Fall of Hyperion. It's all right, but I honestly don't see the thing about it being like the best book ever. It's not the most wonderful, exceptional book on the planet, it's just a good solid innovative read. Each character's story has something about it to keep you reading (Except Lamia's--Ugh, that cheezy detective crap!), and the characterization is great, but I've read better books--The Stand, 1984, and the Lord of the Rings spring to mind immediately. It's worth the read, but don't except the best book ever."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is definitely at the Round Table of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. The story I found the most touching, and the most powerful was the Consul's story. I, too, remember Siri. If you haven't read this, then that statement doesn't mean much to you, but once you read this it might mean a lot. This book is THAT powerful, I only lived in that universe while I read it. I didn't eat, sleep, drink, go to the bathroom the whole time I was reading it. Hypnotic."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Magnificent, This book was unbeleivable. I was captured right away into the Hegemony and the Core. Dan Simmons did an outstanding job. He wrote marvelous science fiction with ideas similar to Stargate and interplanetary travel with a mix of Star Trekish ships and technology. The book ends with a cliffhanger which only makes you want to read the sequel. Who will prevail the Shrike or Humans. If you enjoyed the Canterbuy Tales, which I did , you will enjoy each of the 6 fascinating tale sthat the pilgrims tell on their journey."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The 1st in a fantastic 4 book cycle. This book starts you on a long journey, prepare to take the first step."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I had heard all sorts of things about this novel. I was a little skeptical of it at first, because I bought it on a whim and I tend to read only seminal science fiction (e.g. PKD, Asimov, Vonnegut, etc). In fact I had it on my Kindle for 6 months before even bothering to read past the first page...However I am here to tell you right now that HYPERION IS AMAZING.It is a work of genius. It will take you to the far reaches of the galaxy and beyond. It captivated my imagination and attention in a way that fiction novels rarely do these days.You just have to get past the first chapter or two, then the story really kicks into gear.Grab it now, find a quiet space, and get ready for a trip you'll never forget."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is part of a two book series. The book is complex in story line, and plot. Sometimes I got lost in the characterization, but found it as the book move forward. This book was actually a great read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I bought Hyperion as an e-book for my Kindle. Maybe I really am old-school and love to turn the pages because I felt the Kindle version was extremely short. The story of Hyperion was an interesting read, but I felt lacked the passion of Ilium & Olympos. Somehow it just fell short of continuing the excitement of the previous stories. The only thing I can think about is that Dan Simmons knew he needed to write the book; however-maybe he just wasn't feeling it with the heart and soul intent that he seemed to have poured into the Ilium. The Ilium is still one of my most favorite books I have ever read. I really enjoy Dan Simmons books and will continue to read them."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Science fiction is one of my favorite genre's, and Hyperion is a book that I would recommend to all. I defy anyone to read the first 25 pages and be able to put it down. The writing is complex and captivating and there are so many threads that it seems impossible that they will be resolved, but yet they are!While Hyperion is superior to the Fall of Hyperion, they are both enjoyable and Dan Simmons' best work."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is easily a 4-1/2 to 5 star book. I read it back when it originally came out and I enjoyed every bit as much today. Complex but enjoyable. It hits so many different types of stories. Each pilgrim's story is completely different from the others. It may be a bit difficult going if you have not immersed yourself in SF, but part of the fun it how many different concepts are thrown out there for you to try to catch. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. First of all, Dan Simmons is a wonderful writer. He draws you in. This story paints a disorienting and disturbing universe where nothing is quite what it seems. I really don't know how to describe it. Get the book, then read the three others of the series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I will say up front I went into this book with no previous knowledge of it's content or author - the synopsis sounded \\"interesting\\". Yes, as another review stated, it's a \\"heavy read\\" - indeed it was that. As a writer of previous attempt only, I was taken immediately by Simmons' literally masterful style of writing, his ability to artfully render the image rather than \\"tell\\" - he makes that part look so easy. But as I read on I was broad-sided by the sheer technical marvel of his story construction, the engineering of the telling of so many tales and back-stories within his story, and the expert weaving of all the parts into a thoroughly engrossing whole. His matter-of-fact presentation of absolutely plausible future history and future technology is genius. So if you're a fan of extremely well-written, well-designed and well-executed science fiction, this has got to be your next read. Honestly, I blew through it and just downloaded The Fall to my Kindle and have to go to get started... & I'm excited to see he's so prolific as well! Bonus! \\"Thank You Dan\\" from a new fan!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Great book covering a wide range of topics from religion to poetry to technology. The multiple stories within this book are very good and culminate to a fascinating ending. Although, to get to the ending you have to read the continuation, \\"The End of Hyperion\\". If you like this book at please continue to the next book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read this book twenty years ago. I loved the quality of Simmons' writing as well as the way he intertwines the storylines of the main characters. He's a true genius of Sci Fi. I also really enjoyed his bookTerror."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Apart from the magnificent storytelling, the science fiction, the love story, and the 'down to earth' (as we say in Denmark) philosophy and poetic intensity and charm, reading Dan Simmons Epic is a must for everyone, who wants to understand European and especially American foreign policy. Who can ever say; I'm not a part of world history' after reading this saga?ps. And thanks to the author for introducing the works of John Keats to so many younger I-did'nt-know-him-before."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons creates an extraordinary epic beginning with Hyperion. 7 people chosen to confront a monster on a distant planet. They do not know why they were chosen, or what they will encounter, all they have is their own story to try and figure it out.Each character's story is so incredibly brilliant, plausible and tragic, only surpassed by the next. Every story leaves the reader ravenous for the next. And at the end of the book, again, the reader has that raveous urge to buy, borrow or steal the sequel \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" to find out how the 7 fated pilgrims fare. Dan Simmons has created a brilliant, Religio-Sci-Fi masterpiece with this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have always loved science fiction since so much of it of a necessity is centered on the story. To me it seems like the perfect medium to tell a story. My problem is that I can't find a better sci-fi than the Hyperion/Endymion series. I've read several different authors, but I have never read a story like the one that Simmons tells in these 4 books. It ... because now I can't really read any other science fiction. ..."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a good beginning to this series. Basically 6 flashbacks to set the stage for the next book. Obviously some stories are better then others. Some ideas in the book were just way too unrealistic but then the next story would recapture my attention.The last 100 pages is captivating and will force you to purchase the next segment. Overall a good entertaining book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I actually picked this book up on a whim. It was excellent!! I could not put it down! I love reading science fiction -- especially when it is good, and this was great.I would say that this is more than a book, it's an experience!As an idea of what I would compare this book to (even though that is incredibly difficult to do), I would say that it is a cross of &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; and &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. I say &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; because the book brings together several people who have no idea why (and need to try to find out), and &quot;Neuromancer&quot; because of the unique future it brings to life.I have been recommending this to everyone I know, and I thought it was only appropriate to write a review. Needless to say that as soon as I finished this book, I immediately purchased the sequel -- it's that addictive! Only the Dune series has ever held my attention this much."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've read series written by the best of them: Herbert, Williams, Niven, Mccaffery and many others. Dan Simmons has a power few will ever possess,even for fleeting moments. This review reflects my opinion for this 4 book series, not just the first novel. To understand the scope of his universe you must read all 4.That said, Hyperion started out to me as a book with a fantastic cover, and once opened it became much more. His education on religion is a focal point here. And weather you love religion, or just love to hate the idea of it, you will be captured and changed forever in ths series. He writes about hundreds of worlds each seeded with people and DNA from Earth's most wonderful creatures and sets them into motion. He tracks their history in retrospect, and subtly tells tales of 700 years of evolution, never once becoming dull or predictable. And he sends 7 pilgrims to a distant world named Hyperion where they will either recieve the one thing they want most or they will forever be tormented in death at the hands of the mysterious Shrike. A creature from the future? Or Death itself?Hyperion, the book is the story of these pilgrims. Like the Canterbury Tales, it isn't the journey itself, rather the reasons and paths that brought these strangers together. All of this set against a ticking clock! These stories are so detailed and powerful that I felt I knew them and actually cried over Sol Weintraub's Tale. (If you have a daughter you will also.) And marveled at the poet's tale. A man who, through stasis is the only man to have seen and lived on the Earth before its destruction. Yes, there is no homeworld anymore. Not so hard to believe considering human nature to destroy that which has nutured us for thousands of years.Simmons weaves a complex web as detailed an silent as a spider.You hate who he wants you to and trust who he wants you to. You never give up on those you feel closest to, and just when you think he left you hanging and you need a new fix, you get it in The Fall of Hyperion.Just wait until you get to the Rise of Endyminion, a race for your life against an enemy which is not slowed by death or time!All to save humanity. You will be brainwashed. You will be angry that there is no fifth book. And you will be sure Dan Simmons has a gift few others posess, even for fleeting moments.Thank you Dan."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons became my absolute favorite, even more than Robert J. Sawyer, after a few pages of this Hyperion wonderful nevel. It is so much everything: wild, deep, unsettling, exotic, romantic... Simmons created a world and most of a galaxy. And unlike most, he succeeded in not being either a mock up of the Star Wars or Star Trek religions. Not easy to read, not easy to follow, but so very much worth it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I had the opportunity to meet Dan Simmons at a Writer's Workshop in Kansas in 1993. To my embarrasment, I was the only person in the group of 20 potential writrs who hadn't read Hyperion. When i got back home I bought the book and am ashamed to say I still didn't read it for another NINE YEARS!! Well, I have now and it is nothing short of brilliant! Combining the scope and majesty of Dune with the interpersonal relatings of Foundation, Simmons' most famous novel is a masterpiece of human drama, evolution and expansion into the next realm of reality. The only reason this book got 4 instead of 5 stars is because I now have to read Fall of Hyperion to get the rest of the story!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"...that many folks look down their noses at science fiction. This book is only one of many tremendous works of literature classified as sci-fi. Simmons has a gift for creating characters that involve the reader -- whether that character is good or evil. With this book Simmons joins my list of favorite contemporary writers which includes Robert J. Sawyer, Gore Vidal, Ellen Gilchrist and Vernor Vinge. Forget classifying literature by genres and just read! Wonderful book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I agree with some of the other criticism of this novel - that the style appears to be very much in imitation of early Asimov and Clarke. That's not necessarily a bad thing, if that's the kind of Sci-Fi you like, and I do.What struck me most about this was the ideas presented. Some were fleshed out a little more than others, and I expect that some of those which were a little thin will be more fully explored in the sequel &quot;Fall of Hyperion&quot; (not read it yet, but it's on the list).There are enough characters that everyone should find at least one to relate to, perhaps not at first, but certainly after their personal tale is told.The ending was a little abrupt for my tastes. I had assumed that this was a standalone, but luckily I am already in possession of the sequel. There are sufficient unresolved issues to ensure that I'm looking forward to that."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I got this book because of a review I read here on Amazon, and I was not disappointed. Simmons is a top-notch author who was able to weave six equally exciting and captivating stories into this epic novel. I only finished Hyperion last night and want to get the next one to discover the mystery of the Shrike and the Time Tombs.Simmons uses a mixture of horror, tragedy, poetry and action to tell a story of pilgrims on a journey to the Shrike. He uses their stories to deal with faith, fatherhood, love, mystery and intrigue as the pilgrims go with hidden stories that eventually are told. They also go as the human race begins its apparent decline into interstellar war and a total end to humanity itself. Simmons ability to tell each tale with a different writing style highlights his ability to be both captivating and eclectic.I eagerly await the continuation of this novel to see where he is leading. This story is complex and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I like that. It makes me want more!Read and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"First, be aware that Hyperion consists mostly of the tales of pilgrims on a journey like in Canterbury Tales. But instead of illustrating morals, the tales are meant to flesh out the main characters and to shed light on the mysteries of the Time Tombs and the Shrike. A few are interesting and faintly stirring. Some are outright perfunctory and belabored.Second, be aware that this is really volume one of a two-volume novel (like in the days of Alexander Dumas). Hyperion alone has no traditional plot (with a climax, etc.). It's mostly the pilgrims' stories and ends with their arrival at the Time Tombs.Third, Simmons' style was irritating. He used color names I didn't know. He referred to events without describing them with irritating frequency. He repeated certain descriptions of recurring events with the same words. For example, every time he refers to the Shrike's eyes, he will use the word &quot;blood&quot; to describe their color. EVERY TIME. After about fifty times, it starts to become annoying.Fourth, Simmons' characterization, despite his use of the convenient device of the pilgrims' takes for characterization, was somehow still shallow and unconvincing. I just finished the sequel, and the final parting of most of the main characters wasn't sad or warming in any way. I was glad to be rid of such boring and one-sided characters.My view is that this is not great science fiction. It does not compare with Herbert's Dune, for example. It was an OK summer read with some interesting incidental ideas."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you are not stunned - rocked back on your emotional heels and left gasping - by the fate or F. Paul Dure, then I think you must not be human. If you don't understand the literary scholarship behind the form of Hyperion, the reason John Keats and his poetry is a focus of the story and the reason the demon is called The Shrike; well, you're missing half the fun and you really should read something besides science fiction.The book works at many levels, not the least of which is a spectacular impalment - a literal impalement, by the way - of religion in general and Catholicism and Christianity in particular. God exists in this book in the form of the Technocore, but there's nothing to admire. His angel is an unstoppable killing machine, and his purposes are vile. But what is a metaphor here is a large club in the Endymion series.I like and re-read Hyperion. It has moments that are transcendent. Simmons cannot sustain those moments, though, which in my mind causes to book to fall short of greatness."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The most impressive trait of this book is how its form corresponds with the content. Each part of the story is written in a different style, reflecting its respective characters. In fact, in Hyperion you get several different sci-fi books, albeit set within the same plot. It's really fascinating, and the ease and flexibility of the author is extraordinary. Other aspects, such as the story itself, the characters and especially the landscapes are also amazing, albeit on par with other good sci-fi books I've read. What distinguishes Hyperion most importantly is the literary (at times: poetic) skill of Dan Simmons. One of the best sci-fi books I've read, topped probably only by Use of Weapons by Iain M. Banks (which, coincidentally, is as interesting in terms of form, although in a totally different manner). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you pick up this book expecting a rip-roaring sci-fi war novel, complete with explosion-laden space battles, then by all means set it down and look for something else. If, however, you're willing to try a complex novel with flawed but sympathetic characters, a richly realized world (or galaxy in this case), and its own brand of mythology, then I strongly encourage you to give \\"Hyperion\\" a look.The galaxy is on the brink of war, the worlds of the Hegemony -- united under a collection of AIs called the All Thing -- bracing for war against a group of genetically altered beings called the Ousters. Out of desperation, the government sends a ship containing seven pilgrims to the remote world of Hyperion, to the legendary alien artifacts known as the Time Tombs. It is said that a being called the Shrike lives there, a killer who will select one of the pilgrims and grant their wish... and kill the rest. The motives for the pilgrims vary -- one wants to kill the Shrike, one seeks to heal his terminally ill daughter, one wants revenge, one seeks inspiration to finish an epic novel -- but all find that their tales are connected by the mysterious Shrike... and that the fate of the galaxy rests in their hands, in one way or another.Other reviewers have compared this book to \\"The Cantlebery Tales,\\" and I think it's a fair comparison -- each tale is told in a unique voice, and together they help weave a greater story and a richly detailed galaxy, one that draws the reader in. It doesn't shy away from the dangers of war, imperialism, and human hubris, but at the same time it doesn't paint humanity as monsters as so many sci-fi tales are wont to do anymore (I'm looking at you, \\"Avatar\\"). And Dan Simmons has a marvelous gift with words, and a knack for finding the little details that really make what he writes shine.If I have a complaint, it's that this book doesn't resolve much -- it ends on a cliffhanger. It irritates me when books do this, because even if a book is part of a series (as this one is) I still feel that each volume should resolve at least something at its end. I seem to have this problem with books -- this is my fourth review harping on this...I finished this book on a very long cross-country plane ride, but it is definitely worth another, more leisurely read-through. And yes, the sequel is just as good."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Yes, I said it. The best. Then Frank Herbert 's Dune.The characters were fascinating, the scenes memorable. To this day I see them In Color in my mind's eye. Thepriest and the flaming, lighting trees, Kali, the Shrike, Sad King Billy - to name just a few :)Dan Simmons ' Hyperion Cantos begins with Hyperion. Even if your not particularly rabid about the genre, there'senough here to grab onto, and I for one am in Awe of this author.I hear that Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are being squeezed into 1 movie treatment - on again off again. I wouldlove to see Ridley Scott, or Peter Jackson direct - but that will never happen.The Hyperion Cantos is recommended without reservation."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Simply fantastic, each tale is better and more enthralling than the last. Simmons weaves an intricate universe and society that we glimpse and interpret through the eyes of each pilgrim's story. Somehow Simmons takes advantage of the different characters to switch writing styles between such extremes as a documentary, film noire, and classic tragedy and romance, all while simultaneously exploring this wondrous galaxy he has created.Some of the setting can seem overwhelming, especially in the prologue as major ideas are pushed upon the reader. It almost assumes that you know the setting and technological level of humanity, but don't let this deter you. You will quickly grasp what tech is what, and (more importantly) how society works with the tech. The way that the book handles technology coupled with a decent allowance of relativistic laws influences each story in its own way. Indeed, this book is all about the passage of time* in ways only science fiction can imagine.I cannot recommend this book enough. It's so good that I'm afraid to read the sequels in fear that they do not live up to this one's utter majesty.I only wish the cover-art wasn't so god-awful and embarrassing :( . The perspective on the Shrike is off, and the field sailboat is not an accurate representation of the science fiction setting at all. If I were to judge this book by it's cover, I'd think this was about pointy knights in a steam-punk fantasy. The cover is just ... terribad! I actually wanted to buy a physical version, but cannot stand the cover.*(backward, forward, and everything in between!)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I loved this book. To my knowledge Hyperion was the first book to be written and first of the four in chronology but it's the perfect prequel. It's written in a style that anyone who has read The Decameron or Cantebury Tales will recognize, each night one of our travelers tells his or her tale of why they are on what may be the last pilgrimage to the outback planet Hyperion. For it pulled this off better than The Decameron or Cantebury Tales did.In the timeline within the book not a lot of time passes. The time that does pass appears to be very important to the survival of the human race. Each of the stories works to explain why the time they are in is so important and who the major players are better than any straight narrative could have. I found each of the stories engaging.I strongly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a fantastic read to discover and I could not put it down. It is intricate enough that it requires your full attention, but flows easily and fast. The downside is there a number of unanswered questions, but several readers advised not to read the sequels and that the sequels won't answer the questions anyway. So, just enjoy Hyperion as it is, unanswered questions and all."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Awesome. I read it in one day. If you like sci fi, buy it. It is written well and it's pretty original in the way the story is told. Enjoy."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a book that needs to be experienced to be appreciated fully. Trying to explain the different layers folded on top of each other and how the various stories within the story relate to each other would require as many pages as there are in the book.Dan Simmons creates a novel so original and captivating that it doesn't matter that you don't get most of the answers to the book's puzzles by the end. Simmons story is mysterious and imaginative and passionate. As questions get answered more questions develop from those answers. Hyperion makes you realize why people referred to things that they could not understand as magic. When Simmons reveals his tricks though, you aren't disappointed, instead you are even more fascinated.Characters are vibrant, you feel their pain and loss. The way Simmons intertwines their stories together and links their past, present and future is masterful. The sum of their remarkable individual stories adds up to an incredible whole.The sequel The Fall Of Hyperion is almost a required read after you finish this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"There is a little of everything in Hyperion. You can tell this from the inside cover, whereby it is revealed that characters representing their respective groups (i.e. priest, scholar, etc.) are all thrown together. The core of the book is made up by each character telling his or her story. The beauty comes from how Simmons relates everything to this planet called Hyperion. Know that you will have to buy the next book to finish the tale, because this book seems to end right where the present story is about to start.There are a only a few things that I didn't like about the novel. First of all, you must understand that a lot of the world is thrown at you early. You are thrown in the deep end of this universe and expected to learn to swim quickly. However, the lack of a proper introduction to this universe is compensated for by the drastic amount of characterization. Simmons makes you care dearly for every single character, even the least likeable of the bunch. The other thing that I didn't like was that it seemed to borrow some of the basic space and transportation ideas from other science fiction books. There are some sci-fi cliches that can get tiresome if you're not a huge fan of the genre, but they don't take away too much.Those things being said, I must confess that I am amazed by the style. Simmons impresses me with his different tone and style for every story and the overall flow of the novel. I will say that my favorite story is the one about the poet, and I think it is because it is the one inspired by Simmons the most. It is the anthem for any writer. Sometimes it seems like Simmons is showing off about how much he knows of writers and history, but I must admit it works. His knowledge is there and his intelligence brings the book together. I recommend the novel to any science fiction fans or even fans of literature that don't mind getting their hands dirty with a little genre fiction."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a very ambitious book that attempts to take the sci-fi genre in interesting directions and, more often than not, succeeds. It strives for grandness, touching on big topics including religion, war, the nature of time, art and writing, history, family, technology, environmentalism, politics and the destiny of the human race.At times I feared Hyperion would end up being little more than a collection of short stories, but by the end of each tale, the themes and events tied together nicely with the overall narrative. Simmons has a knack for throwing in plot twists and surprises just when they are least expected, forcing one to reevaluate everything that has gone on before.Some readers may be put off by the author's style - the text is riddled with made up words and techno-babble that can be frustrating to get through until you get used to it (around page 75). He also has a tendency to get too wordy when describing landscapes and environements, at least for my tastes. I believe this is done with the intent of helping the reader visualize the unique world of Hyperion, so I'm not going to dock him any stars for it. On the plus side, he avoids spelling out the significance of events, and leaves his readers to puzzle through some of the mysteries of his creation for themselves. This is a good thing, except in the case of the ending, which was a bit too much of a cliffhanger."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"No one is going to find this review helpful, but I HAD to put my 5 stars down.....because this book was absolutely incredible. All I will say is that after reading Hyperion, I bought all 3 other books on my next trip to the bookstore....."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Hyperion\\" cycle is a quartet divided in two halves that shares the same universe. This book starts the first part.Even if \\"Hyperion\\" has all the in and outs of a classical Sci-Fi novel, is much more than that. Is the story of seven pilgrims trying to arrive to a particular shrine in a journey full of dangers, but at the same time is the life story of each one of them.These personal recounts dig deep into essential human questions.Religious faith and on what basis is sustained is investigate from different stand points. One from a Catholic priest view point, in the verge of loosing his faith, the other one from a Jew intellectual confronted with God commandment to sacrifice his daughter.Just these two stories will be enough to recommend the book, but there is a lot more, much more to enjoy.A decadent poet tells his life and struggle to find his muse at whatever cost.A detective's story mixed with John Keats restored to life.All this elements skillfully mixed in a page-turner Sci-Fi adventure.One of the best novels I ever read.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Read Hyperion. It will enrich your life.Unlike so much pedestrian science fiction (and fiction in general), Dan Simmons' Hyperion is filled with truly well-formed, detailed characters. Each with a history and style so unique they might have been conceived by different authors. Except that I can think of no other mainstream author whose characters feel quite as lifelike and sympathetic as Simmons draws these seven pilgrims. These are very real people, placed in very extraordinary circumstances. As a consequence the deep emotional, moral and philosophical dilemmas they face are universally pertinent, giving the novel enduring appeal.The lush scenery, vivid imagery and rich atmosphere is another element of this novel that will most surely remain with you forever. I have not re-read this book in almost ten years now (to my considerable regret), but I still vividly picture scenes like the consul playing his piano amidst a dinosaur killing field, the wheeled ship voyage on the &quot;sea of grass...Suffice it to say, there's much more, and the experience is a memorable one indeed.)And of course like any true epic adventure, the physical outwards journey of the characters also represents a journey into 'self'. And in the case of Hyperion the 'self' can easily and interchangeably be seen as civilization as a whole, a nation or other organized unit of community, or a single person. I leave it to readers of Dan Simmons' work to discover just how beautifully and satisfyingly the different characters map to different facets of personality or psyche at these different levels.A magnificent and eminently enjoyable read. You will want to read it again, but only for the experience and the atmosphere, not because you will have forgotten much. Have fun!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book is sort of a collection of several pilgrims telling their reasons for making a pilgrimage to the planet of Hyperion, home of the Time Tombs and the mysteriously lethal Shrike. It's quite fantastic, and framed by a story that lends an eerie urgency to the tales.A number of the tales are quite moving, particularly those of the priest and the wandering Jew. Simmons has several interesting things to say about religion, so be prepared to see challenges to your own beliefs, whatever those may be. This is not a novel that shies away from tackling tough issues, and Simmons does so in some fairly unconventional ways.It's quite fantastic; this is definitely not hard SF. The focus is on character development; in fact, it could almost be said that the tales are each extended character sketches. A warning: this book doesn't stand on its own too well, thus the four stars. It works best as a part of the series of novels that Simmons has based on Hyperion. Once you're done -- well, you're not. The story hasn't ended, it just stops. This works on two levels: one as an introduction to the next novel, &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;; and two, as a statement on the essential unknowability of the universe."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperian is not ordinary fiction or science-fiction. It is not geared towards a reader looking for quick thrills and page-turning excitment, (though it contains both of these). Instead it is aimed towards smart, intelligent readers who enjoy a good story, or in this case six good stories.Obviously influenced by the Decameron and The Cantebury Tales, Hyperion in many ways is only a prelude to the sequal, The Fall of Hyperian. The tale focuses on seven pilgrams sent to the mysterious planet Hyperion to do battle, with their bodies and their wits, with a mysterious, monstrous creature called the Shrike. On the way, each one tells their story of who they are and why they have been chosen to go to Hyperion.Looming in the background of this story is the fact that the entire human world, the Hegemony as they like to call it, is on the verge of an Intersteller war. These pilgrams are the last hope for humanity.At first the novel seems slow, and somewhat forced. Each of the seven pilgrams are distinct, almost characatures. Only until we here their individual stories do we understand that while they might each have different professions, (soldier, detective, scholar, poet, diplomat and priest) do we understand their similarities. In each case the tie that binds is some great ironic tragedy that occured to each of them. At first each character seems one dimmensional. Some even seem rather dislikable, (ie the poet, Martin Silinus, who is either half crazy or half drunk all the time). By the end of the novel we learn to empathize with each of them.Dan Simmons has also created a fascinating universe in Hyperian. Years before the world wide web became a common phrase in our culture, Simmons had created a Web of his own. People have acces to any information through neural implants which tie them to information stored throughout the galaxy. There are Farcaster Portals, Simmons version of the jaunt, enabling men and machines to travel between distant stars in a split second. There is something called the Technocore, the artifical intelligence which overseas everything.All this information is revealed slowly, drip by drip. At times the novel is quite confusing, introducing certain ideas we had not heard of before, and only later explaining them. This works quite well. Instead of giving us all the information immediately, Simmons stimulates our curiousity and makes us think about the story as well as react to it.Hyperian is poetic. It has a rhythym which gradually captures you and makes you want more. Of course the more is The Fall of Hyperian. This novel is just as good, sometimes better, than Hyperian, filled with more action and life-and-death scenarios. Hyperian, however, stands alone as a unique and beautiful novel"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I found it by accident and was completely surprised. The format of retelling the pilgrim's stories is handled masterfully. Each story is different and compelling in it's own right. The shrike is one of the more interesting villians ever created, which is amazing considering it doesn't utter a word. The following books in the series are good but none can rise to the promise of this first volume. One of my top five books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has created the ultimate in sci-fi epic. Not since Asimov's Foundation series has an author been able to examine the same themes of politics, adventure, and the human psyche. The plot is the story of the Canterbury Tales: A group of pilgrims telling their life-stories. The majority of this book is the tales, and all are poignant, thoughtful, and usually depressing. I prefer the Priest's Tale, but all people have different preferences. Anyway, if you're a fan of Asimov's foundation, or have never been a huge sci-fi fan, pick up Hyperion. It will influence your entire view of science fiction."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons is a fine writer and this story is amazing, as most of the other reviews detail. But the Kindle eBook is riddled with spelling errors, so much so that you can't tell what some words are supposed to be. Spectra should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a low quality edition of a great writer's book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'll admit that when I first read Dan Simmons &quot;Hyperion,&quot; I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I had read it on the recommendation of an English teacher, and I could immediately recognize the talent the author demonstrated, but it took a few weeks before I realized how much I had enjoyed the read. The prose is beautifully crafted. It flows almost lyrically, with vivid imagery supporting an amazingly creative plot (which, by the way, is a loose parallel to &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;). It is filled with more allusions and references than you can believe, but it isn't written in a style that leaves you feeling lost if you miss one or don't know what is being alluded to. I caught lots, but I'm sure there were just as may more that I read without even recognizing.&quot;Hyperion&quot; is an English teacher's dream, ripe with all of the classical elements of rich literature, but manages that without becoming a student's nightmare of boring, dry plot and 19th century diction that unfortunately seems to characterize so many such 'literary' books. This book is certainly science fiction, but remains clear of the pitfalls that turn many people away from the genre. The characters are well-developed and the reader has no trouble at all empathizing with them.As a stand-alone novel, Hyperion could survive as an admirable work, though one with an abrupt and hardly satisfactory conclusion, but more importantly, it is the entry point to the Hyperion series, which is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting out of this book, but I never would have expected this. Simmons has crafted an interesting book here. Not only interesting story-wise, but in how he told the story as well. This book seems to be six novellas wrapped together by the plot of the book as a whole. Each novella focuses on one of the six main characters in the book. There are two things interesting here. The first is the fact that each story contains one element in common with all the rest. The second is that each novella is written with a different voice. Simmons shows his versatility as an author by giving each story a different feeling. We get a reading of journal entries, a hard boiled detective story, an emotional family story, a tale of debauchery and struggle to survive, a military story, and a story of political intrigue. Each one sounds almost as if it were written by a different author. This was a stroke of brilliance by Simmons.My one real complaint about the book is that it didn't accomplish much as a whole. It was mainly a setup book for the sequel, FALL OF HYPERION. We get expansive character development, an introduction into Simmons' universe, and the main characters go on a journey so that Simmons can truly launch the story in the next book. We don't even find out what the major driving force of the epic is until about 50 pages into the second book. Without reading the second book, this will be a disappointment story-wise.Other than that, it was a very interesting read. I enjoyed the characters...they were all unique and vivid. They had diverse backgrounds and motivations and it was interesting to see them all drawn together by that single common thread.If you're looking for action driven sci-fi with space battles, you won't get much of that here (wait for the second book), but Simmons does provide our imaginations with some interesting technology (although, I do wish he'd explained some of it better at the beginning of the book rather than in the middle of the second book). Just make sure you have the second book handy when you finish this one...you'll want to jump straight into it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"My brother gave me this very good book, which leads to \\"The Fall of Hyperion,\\" an even better book. Thank you brother! I have read less science fiction in recent years, principally because of the difficulty of finding good science fiction. This epic Hugo Award winner is the best science fiction I have read in some time. However, you should be aware that this book really sets up the second volume. You should have the second book available before you reach the end of this book, because this book leaves many questions unanswered.In the 29th century, mankind is under threat of invasion by the Ousters. An invincible robot-like creature called the Shrike may hold the key to defeating the ousters. However, the Shrike may also be the doom of mankind. Seven pilgrims and one child journey to see the Shrike. We learn that each was selected for various reasons that relate to Hyperion and often to the Shrike itself.After the pilgrims have gathered on a treeship as bizarre as any I have seen described in science fiction, the pilgrims each tell their stories in turn. Since some of the stories are quite lengthy, the stories continue after the pilgrims land on Hyperion and journey to the Time Tombs. Each story explains the background of the pilgrims, the political situation and history of mankind up to the 29th century, and provides intriguing backgrounds to the pilgrims. I generally found the stories interesting, though the story of the poet was the most boring, at first. The poet's story becomes more interesting as it nears the end, and those who continue on to \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" will learn that the poet's story is critical.I found many aspects of this novel interesting and unique. There are the people who follow the crucifix; people who may potentially live forever. There are the catacombs below Hyperion. Who built the catacombs and what is their purpose? What is the nature of the Shrike, including its incredible power to manipulate time? How did Rachel come grow younger each day after an encounter with the Time Tombs? What does the artificial intelligence Technocore have to do with the Ousters and the Shrike? This book asks many more questions, and only those who journey onward to \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" will learn the answers.As the pilgrims journey to Hyperion and then to the Time Tombs on Hyperion, the Ousters approach Hyperion, and the pilgrimage becomes a race against time. Rachel continues to grow younger each day, approaching the date of her birth. What will happen to Rachel then?I enjoy a challenging science fiction book, and this book is challenging. The story is Dickensian in complexity. Read this book only when you have the time and desire to read a story that requires concentration and analysis, and move immediately onward to \\"The Fall of Hyperion.\\""},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm not going to claim here that Hyperion is a great work just because Simmons used an old literary trope during the creation of this book. Just because he modeled his book after the frame narrative style of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, this book is not transported magically to the realm of High Art (if there is such a place beyond the pomposity of so-called artists). Maybe he was trying to inject a bit of literary style into the SF genre in some way. Who knows what his intentions. The point is, I read on this site a recent two-star review where the reviewer makes the fact that 'the story as a whole is really a compilation of six ... short stories loosely tied together by an additional 100 pages of story set in the \\"present\\"' seem like a terrible thing.Hey, maybe he was writing an homage to Chaucer's tale (which by the way is heavily riddled with bawdy sex, which the reviewer also seemed to disagree with). I guess my ultimate point is, hey, read some classics for once, people, so things like this won't slip by you and you don't embarrass yourselves. Oh, and about the book in general: IT'S GREAT! Read it. Thanks for your time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Excellent science fiction novel on a grand scale, contains six stories told by six members of the last shrike pilgrimage. Any one of the stories makes the whole book worth reading, all six together make it a must read for any SF fan or any one who just wants to be emersed into a startling realistic future world filled with realistic and interesting characters. The whole thing is bound together by the mysterious shrike whom the pilgrims are each traveling to see, each with his own reason as revealed in the individual tales. What raises this story up a notch to true greatness is the depth of the universe in which these stories are set. A universe with a great deal of history in it with real and complex political and social issues. One word of warning: although the pilgrims complete their tales in this book the overarcing story ends abruptly and is concluded in &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;. It is best to consider &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; as one and read them together. The &quot;Fall of Hyperion&quot; is equal in quality to &quot;Hyperion&quot; and brings the story to a fitting and in some ways enigmatic conclusion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Hyperion\\" is the first part of the Hyperion Cantos, followed by \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\". It would be difficult and illogical to try to review these two books separately, because they are clearly two halves of a single story and should be read as such.With \\"The Hyperion Cantos\\" Dan Simmons creates a layered and detailed civilization eight centuries in the future, one of the most stunning and multifaceted histories ever produced by an sf writer. The world of the Hegemony of Man -- a Web that spans the galaxy, connecting planets through 'farcasters' -- is at once incredibly advanced and reassuringly human. You can step through a farcaster portal and find yourself on a different planet, or access the datasphere via your own implanted comlog; at the same time, one of the story's protagonists plays Rachmaninoff on his piano, and drinks Scotch whisky. It is a futuristic world, but not one wholly out of touch with its own history. This actually becomes the theme of the novel, and it's a refreshing one: man has tranformed the world to suit his purposes, rather than adapting himself for his new circumstances. It's easy to see this same thing happening throughout history.To this world Simmons brings a story that is just as complex. There is an approaching war between the Hegemony and the Ousters, humans who have adapted to space travel and left the rest of us behind; there are artificial intelligences from the present and future plotting mankind's downfall; there are religious discussions and political machinations; there are the mysterius Time Tombs moving backwards through time, and the deadly Shrike whose image graces the cover; there are copious references to the life and works of John Keats. There is a lot going on in this book.Simmons' greatest feat is in never overwhelming the reader with all this information and plot. The story focuses largely on half a dozen pilgrims on the planet Hyperion, whose mission will decide the fate of the galaxy. The characters are believable and compelling, and it is their own backstories which form the bulk of the first volume. By structuring his story in this way Simmons is able to summarize nearly every trend in science fiction at once: among our heroes is Fedmahn Kassad, a war hero whose story will appeal to fans of military sf; Brawne Lamia, a private detective whose backstory reaches into cyberpunk territory; Sol Weintraub, a scholar trying to find a cure for his reverse-aging daughter. The protagonist of the second volume is a \\"persona\\" of John Keats that has been recreated in a human body. Each of these characters tells a story that illuminates a different aspect of human experience: parenthood, love, death, faith, art, war.Simmons' style is unusual for science fiction, a genre which is generally unconcerned with stylistic flourishes and typically falls back on archetypes for its characters. Simmons thrives on details, and it is that approach which in part creates the incredible depth: his planets have names, civilizations, religions, and histories unique to themselves. Technology is everywhere, impossible to escape from, with a vocabulary all its own. The sex, violence, and death that permeate the novel are explicitly presented, perhaps moreso than most sf readers are used to.It is a giant of a book, daunting and all-encompassing. It took me some time to work up the courage to read it, actually. It is a masterpiece of science fiction, perhaps one of the greatest novels to address humanity's future and our place in the universe; yet it is also a deeply personal book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Loved the book. Suggestion: Buy the whole series in one go, and read them all (at the very least Hyperion and The fall of Hyperion). Otherwise, after reading the final sentence in the first book, you'll catch yourself staring into space with a blank look on your face, thinking \\"What the heck...?\\""},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion by Dan Simmons takes place some 700 years in the future of Human History and centers around a group of seven strangers. These seven are to be the last pilgrimage to an enigmatic place called the time tombs on the fringe world of Hyperion. The Time Tombs are known to house a mysterious being known as the Shrike, about whom little is known. Some worship the Shrike as a God, some fear it as a killing machine. Whatever the case, these seven people have apparently been chosen by the Church of the Shrike to undertake this expedition at a time when the leadership of civilization, known as the Hegemony, is potentially going to war.Many have compared this book to the Canterbury Tales written by Chaucer in the Middle Ages and that comparison is apt, as each member of this group of pilgrims tells their tale. Something strings these people together and perhaps in the telling of these tales, their reason for being chosen will become clear. It is this style where the brilliance of this book is revealed. Each tale is told with a perceptibly distinctive voice and style. Each character actualized and appointed as a perspicuous individual. Each tale is compelling and epic, some are heartbreaking, some riveting, all are captivating.Simmon's has created a world that upon first glance would seem so imaginative, so surreal,yet is grounded so deeply in physics, science and human nature that it could be history some day aeons from now.Science Fiction is far too limited a term to describe a book that is equal parts science fiction/mystery/adventure/fantasy/theology and even romance. It is these elements, along with Simmons obvious literary knowledge that put this novel into classic territory. Simmons is a consummate writer, who obviously has a keen insight into literature.This book has the rare power to move the reader not only emotionally, but to elevate one beyond the narrative and into contemplation of the human condition.This book is a rare gem, an almost perfect novel. As has been stated on other reviews, there is a follow up to this book, The Fall Of Hyperion. I recommend getting the second book, but this work does stand alone if not for its absorbing set of tales, then for the consequence on your consciousness."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Let's be honest here: reading hard SF is one of those things that can easily draw disapproving glances from those nearby. Writers like Simmons simply have to work harder than others [Crichton springs immediately to mind - he sells lots and lots of - dare I say it? - truly mediocre books]. Hyperion is the result of a fantastic idea and lots and lots of really, really good writing.The changes in points of view are worthy of William Faulkner. What motivates each character, as we learn when they tell their stories, is always interesting and surprising. Far from relying on techno jiggery pokery to save the tale, he uses good, old-fashioned story telling to accomplish results that are just so rare and pleasing.These days I am afforded fewer and fewer luxuries by way of time for pleasure reading; I nevertheless bought three more Simmons titles immediately after finishing Hyperion. It's that good. He's that good."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am always a little behind the times when it comes to phrases and popular classifications either in music or books especially science fiction. So when I read this I thought since it was operatic that naturally later on when I heard the term space-opera this was what they must mean. Well now I know better; however it doesn't change my opinion of this book and the three subsequent books after. This is a big book and I don't mean the book size. I mean Sistine Chapel big. I mean man stretching out a hand and trying to touch god. I mean using the art of writing to look within and look without, I mean risking big ideas. You know Operatic. Dan Simmons has achieved a book that examines the heroic and spirit by bringing us face to face with faces of evil, and some that are so nightmarish in depth that it only heightens the mortal fragility of not only his main characters but the whole human race. It raises the stakes like few novels have and thus the heroes are that much more vulnerable and so that much more heroic. This is modern day Greek tragedy in that each step forward is a logical march to tragedy, perhaps. The only sad thing is that Dan Simmons doesn't limit himself to Science fiction; not because his other books are not good but that Science Fiction needs him. There are so many hacks in the field and someone like Mr. Simmons legitimizes the genre. Wish he would do more. The 4 books have to be considered one of Science Fiction's classic series more on par with Dune than with say Asimov's Foundation."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book starts slow; you need to know that. I am not a fan of the pilgrims gathered by circumstance and deciding to tell their stories. Yes it's venerable (think Canterbury Tales and The Decameron), but I just don't care for it. That being said, once you get past the boring framework, the individual tales are quite well done.While I was captivated by each individual pilgram story, and some of the vivid sci-fi detail of alternate worlds, I kept hoping that all the threads would come together is a significant way.Unfortunately, this book ends like at the natural climax of the story arc. So, the section titled Epilogue is woefully mistitled . . . it's a cliffhanger . . . not terrible, but good to know since you will in fact have to read Fall of Hyperion to finish the story."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This novel should not be undertaken lightly, for there is nothing light about the subject matter. Underneath the sweeping, epic journey is the very nature of the soul, of heaven, of hell, and of all our fates. Dan Simmons has done a remarkable job of supporting this with an intriguing world and universe, fascinating characters, and a great story, but that is just the vessel he uses to hold what he is really after.In many ways, this is also a horror story. Some passages are simply terrifying and the Shrike is easily the nastiest creature I've ever come upon in any story telling. If you read this, you will be left with scars that will stay with you for life.Yet, I insist that this is a good thing. I've read this novel a dozen times and gotten much out of it. You also must finish the cycle with Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion. Only then will the true nature of things show itself and it will be beautiful."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am currently in the process of reading all the novels that won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. I randomly started with Ender's game (1985 winner I believe),the logically followed with Speaker for the Dead(1986). I loved them both and had to finish the series. I have been going through the list of winners randomly and just finished Hyperion. Hyperion is the best of the winners I've read so far. Besides the science fiction, the book is well written and has a great deal of literary value. The philosophy and politics are intriguing. The novel was compelling from start to finish.Simmons did a great job in truly portraying each character and personality. I am eager to go on in the series and discover the fates of the pilgrims and how things come to a close. Hyperion is a must read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the first book written by Dan Simmons I have read. However, it is not the first Sci-Fi book I've read by any means - I consider it to be the best one among them, though.Why? Hyperion is a complex study of a darker part of future world as imagined by the author. It does not come in a simple tale, it is told in six different tales, each written using different style, which suits the narrator. And I can tell, this job is done very well. Facts about the world are scattered and nicely woven into the narratives and into a less significant main plot. Parts between the stories act as a place where you can contemplate on the story just told and I've always been impatiently looking forward to the next one.Do not expect the tales to be like fairy tales for children. The first tale comes from mouth of a priest and you may find it shocking, disgusting, horrifying. While many reviewers dislike this story, it was my favorite. The second one uses a language of a poet - bohemian that can disgust another part of the audience. All of them, however, are really interesting and unique, while slowly revealing the relationships established in Simmons' world.The central point / character - antihero of the book - is The Shrike - one of the most remarkable characters ever described in Sci-Fi. Shrike, which comes from an unknown world and time, unpredictable, murderous, being put outside the laws of physics.Lots have been told here about the references to our times and our planet, which I've also found a little strange and unrealistic. Author obviously wanted to make the setting more imaginable for us, but sometimes he overused this 'trick' and that is probably the biggest flaw of this book.As already mentioned in other reviews - the last page does not conclude the story and you will have to buy The Fall of Hyperion which tells a conclusion (in more than 500 pages, though ;)) That's why I consider 'Hyperion' to be just an introduction to whole Hyperion Cantos.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Allow me to start out by saying that Hyperion by Dan Simmons is one of the strangest books that I have read. Ever.The concepts presented in this book are intriguing, but to the inexperienced sci-fi reader they may be difficult to decipher. The narration switches to each of the main characters who, in turn, tell their story to the rest of the main characters. It's interesting to see how all of the stories eventually intertwine, particularly when seen through various points of view. Unfortunately, the general effect is one of confusion.The plot deepens throughout the novel, and by the end I was craving to know all of the answers to the complex mysteries presented throughout the novel. Most readers, however, probably won't make it all the way to the end of this book - the beginning was tough to get in to and the overall payoff is a cliffhanger ending leaving many unanswered questions.I haven't yet read the sequel: The Fall of Hyperion; and while the mysteries linger, the desire to push through another dense and confusing Hyperion novel is fleeting."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm not planning on analyzing the plot or anything of the sort, merely commenting on its descriptive characteristics. Although, in my opinion, it takes a couple tales to really grasp your attention (as most stories do), once this book gets rolling it is nearly impossible to put down. Pages fly by with out you even realizing it. For me, half the time this did not seem like reading a book at all. It seemed more like the pages past by as a movie played in my mind. The whole Hyperion Cantos as well as the Endymoin Omnibus set a bar quite high as far as descriptive quality. I certainly recommend it to anyone and in fact already have. None of them have been disappointed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Admittedly, after reading Father Hoyt's tale, I almost quit reading. That tale alone is perhaps the most disturbing piece of \\"horror\\" fiction (from a philosophical perspective) that i've ever read. However, i'm grateful to have stuck it out because Hyperion did not disappoint. I found the book absolutely BRILLIANT in the way it slowly wove together pilgrims' tales. Some were heart-warning, some tragic, some vastly disturbing like that of Hoyt. All were meaningful in some way. However, the brilliance of Hyperion rests on the fact that it does not rely on simply an intriguing story...While entertaining the reader, Hyperion also tackles age-old philosophical issues such as the meaning of life, the problem of pain & suffering in our world, the place of religion & church, etc. The book does not seem to be shoving any agendas so much as exploring several of them with a fair hand. For a religion major such as myself, I found it nothing short of fascinating. However, as I explained above, the book delivers on a human level as well & you won't find yourself short of horror, intrigue, suspense, and even a warming heart as the pilgrims journey on.There are only a few noteworthy faults. 1 - Some may be turned off by the widespread use of profanity throughout the book. I'm quite used to language myself but Silenus disgusted me on multiple levels. The profanity does further the character development though & therefore serves a purpose. Also 2 - after 500 some pages, I was amazed to find that there was simply no conclusion. While i'm grateful for a sequel, having not realized its existence until far into the book, I have to admit the suspense nearly killed me. I just hope that Fall provides a sufficient answer to my many questions."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The Hyperion series is the best SF series ever written. I re-read them every few years because my memory of the beauty of the works fades and needs to be renewed (I also reread Dune and Pride and Prejudice for the same reasons). Buy all four because you won't want to stop. Don't be daunted by the transition to the second half of the series of four. It will grow on you even though you hate it at first."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I don't have the motivation to write a lengthy review. Suffice it to say that Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are two of the best SF novels I've ever read. I've read most of the absolute all time classics (Ringworld, Foundation, Starship Troopers [NOT the movie], Stranger in a Strange Land, etc.), and these two are just as good. They're quite long, but easy reading and it pained me many times when I had to put them down. The pilgrim's individual stories are amazing on their own. The World Web, the technology, the cultures, etc. are truly fascinating."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The first in a series of four books (you must read all of them for full plot resolution), Hyperion is a crisply written, masterful beginning to a tour-de-force of the best new hard science fiction universe since Dune. While elements of it will remind you of many other works, the whole is a fresh and imaginative universe, developed in intricate detail. Some of the topics go so far beyond typical sci fi they approach the philosophical, but some of the early mysteries (such as the nature of the Shrike) are later (mostly) explained. And some of the Blake references will be of interest to the more literary. When I finally finished the fourth book, I wanted to start all over again; it was the same sort of regret felt when the Lord of the Rings was finished (alas there's no more?). This series will be a sci fi classic, indeed it already is. If you are a fan of hard science fiction, Hyperion and its sequels are required reading."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"HYPERION, AND IT'S THREE SEQUELS, COMPRISE THE MOST INVENTVE AND THOUGHT PROVOKING SCIENCE FICTION EPIC OF ALL TIME.

And being able to create an entire universe that we can understand in all its complexities is not an easy thing to do. Having said that, the book starts out really well. I'll forego plot but to say we're dealing with seven travelers on a pilgrimage, each who must tell his &quot;story&quot; to the others concerning why he/she is making the trip. Echoes of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales for sure, and even hints of Arthurian legend as well. The first story, told by father Hoyt--which actually is not his story but told from the diary of his mentor--had me hooked. It was Sci Fi, it was theological, it was imaginative and fresh. Simmons made Hyperion a mystery in it's own right, an unexplored planet with creepy dwellers and underground labrynths. The Shrike, its mysterious lone alien inhabitant, is either God or the Devil or just some mysterious alien who kills at will. It forged me on. Kassad's tale was pretty good, though not nearly as interesting. It was militaristic, adventurous, about a fallen soldier who should be a hero but is villified due to actions that saved the world. Not to mention Simmons delves into temporal anomolies and paradoxes during this tale and doesn't explain it all too well. Maybe that was his point, i don't know. Weintraub, whose daughter is regressing to her newborn state (who is 30 when the tale is told) tells the tale of watching his daughter live backwards in time. While interesting, and unique, it dragged on until the inevitable conclusion I knew was coming. Simmons chronicled 30 years of living backwards...it was too much. Get on with it already. Lamia's tale is pure pulp detective story. I liked it, it's fun and fast paced. Throw in an AI consipracy about murdering other AIs as well as the human race, and yeah, it could be a movie. No gripes there, all kudos. And finally the Consul's tale, which like Hoyt's is told from the comlog of his grandfather, is pretty boring. It sets up a revelation any seasoned reader is able to spot from the beginning of the book, which is not a big deal, but it takes focus of the pilgramage--and therefore the book--away from the Shrike and all its deified qualities. Basically it makes the first 400 pages moot. Then again i haven't read Hyperion Fall yet, which i most certainly plan on doing, so maybe I'm wrong. Still, it left me closing the book somewhat less enthused than when i started. This was my first Simmons book, and he won me over, and despite my somewhat harsh review, this book was definitley worth the price, and i will definitely read the series. If nothing else, this is a fresh approach to the genre, and for that he must be commended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion by Dan Simmons was this months selection by my in person bookclub.In a far future time on a very distant planet, seven travellers are trying to determine why they have been selected to undertake a very difficult and most likely deadly pilgrimage. The six men and one woman each have very complicated backgrounds and each of them has some sort of tie to the planet Hyperion. Their destination is the mysterious Time Tombs. For centuries, the Tombs have defied explanation and now it is widely believed that the Tombs are opening and that opening could spell the end of worlds and civilizations.The pilgrims are at a loss to explain why they were selected and what is expected of them. They hope that by sharing their stories, they will gain some sort of understanding of what might be expected of them and how they can help each other.Five members of my bookclub were present for our meeting. The other four all said that this book strongly reminded me of The Canterbury Tales by Geoffry Chaucer. Not that the pilgrims stories were alike, rather that they each were told in a different style. One horror, another tragedy, a military/romance etc. I haven't read the Canterbury Tales, so can't comment on that. The six tales that were related to us, were very different from each other. The most moving of them, was that told by Sol Weintraub about his daughter Rachel. None of us were ashamed to admit that we were brought to tears by Rachel's illness and the effect it had on her family.I was once again the standout, when the group was asked who was looking forward to reading the next book in this series, The Fall of Hyperion. I have no interest in reading more. I felt cheated by the end of this story. It was almost 500 pages of introduction and when it was time for the plot to advance, it was done. Nothing was resolved, how disappointing. I feel that I have invested enough time in these characters and don't want to risk reading another book only to have it also with an unsatisfactory ending."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Book full of stories that deserve endings, yet when the time comes, it doesn't happen. Angry for wasting my time with it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book was suggested by my older brother to read while i was traveling abroad. I very much enjoyed it, it is like 5 stories in one, each very unique and different from other books. This is an original piece of work"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Plan on late night reads. This is one of the best science fictions works I have ever read. I love this set of two books. This one is followed by Fall of Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"...I've read in many a year. Lest it be cubbyholed, I'd say Hyperion is some of the best *fiction* of any genre that I've read in many a year. The whole series of which this is first book is well worth reading, although Hyperion and the next in the sequence, Fall of Hyperion, are the best of the four. If you like good writing, and especially if you like science fiction with a brain and a heart, Dan Simmons and Hyperion are for you."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is a little slow to get into but then it is wonderful. Very intrigueing. Ending is a dissapointment and makes you need to read the second which I havent yet."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a very well written SF tale of a world which is about to end. The end of the world however came as a surprise to everyone because it was not what anyone in that universe had expected. Secretive forces are working behind the scenes to set up the world for a mighty fall. Very good read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Before I go into my review of this book, I want to make it clear that if you are going to buy this book, you must also purchase Fall of Hyperion. Hyperion is in reality only the first part of a two part book which should have been published in one volume. This publishing strategy is one of my personal pet peeves - you are being forced to purchase two books in order to get one story. Hyperion does not stand on its own as a book and you must have the companion volume to actually reach a conclusion in the story.Although I am irritated by how this book was published, I have to admit that it is a really interesting book that I am glad that I read. Hyperion is basically a science fiction version of the Canterbury Tales. The question the book asks is: Why are these \\"pilgrims\\" travelling to Hyperion? The answers to the question are interesting, mysterious, and exciting and leave you wanting more. On the planet of Hyperion, there is a deadly (and really creepy) creature called the Shrike. The Shrike lives in an area of Hyperion with artifacts called the Time Tombs which are somehow travelling backwards in time. At the beginning of the book, you know very little about what the Shrike is and what is going on in the universe. By the end of the book, you know a little bit more about the Shrike and a lot more about the state of the universe.Each part of the book has an intro section about what is going on with the pilgrims in their current time - where they are on their journey to see the Shrike. After the intro to each part, one of the pilgrims tell their story. The characters range from a diplomat with a secret past to a poet who has lived a long time. The motivations and background of each character become clear as they tell their stories.All of this knowledge about character motivation and what is going on in the universe is actually only useful when you're reading Fall of Hyperion. Although the pilgrims have finished telling their stories by the end of this book, you really don't have a frame of reference for what actions they are going to take and what is going to happen to them as a result.Also, I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who got sick of all of the references to Keat's and his poetry. The Fall of Hyperion is even worse on this score.Standing on it's own, I have no doubt that I would give this book three stars. However, once the story is completed in Fall of Hyperion, I would give both books together four stars."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hugo Award, Best Novel, 1990.I have no objection to series, trilogies, dodecologies, or gogglologies as long as they are clearly labled. However, nowhere in the hype of this book did I become aware that you have to read The Fall of Hyperion for the rest of the story. Seems to me to border on deceptive marketing.What IS there is briliant, The Canterbury Tails for the 28th century. Seven Pilgrims gather, traveling together to see the Shrike, a mysterious alien, artifact, time traveler, or some combination thereof. Six of the Pilgrims tell the stories of what brought them on the Pilgrimage were, according to legend, one of them will be granted their heart's desire, the others will die.The characterization is brilliant, the stories interweave, the world building is convincing, the story takes you to the point where they are standing on the Shrike's threshold and . . . buy the sequel.I may raise the rating after reading The Fall of Hyperion, but for now I feel like the entire book was a tease."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons and his Hugo-winning \\"Hyperion\\" in particular are very highly thought of, so I guess I will be providing a minority viewpoint here. I found the writing to be extravagant, histrionic and melodramatic, with the sex and fights like those in a run of the mill thriller or a Schwarzenegger movie. I also didn't particularly appreciate the by now cliched anti-imperialist/anti-globalist themes of the novel nor the banal government conspiracy plot line, though I know that sort of thing is very popular.The element that alot of people (I suspect) love about \\"Hyperion,\\" the pervasive literary and cultural references, are way way overdone and way too \\"in your face\\" for my taste. It seems like there is a reference to Keats or Virgil or Jack Vance or some other luminary on every page, and entire chapters are pastiches of (chapter 5 is an unsubtle tribute to (or imitation of) hardboiled mysteries) or homages to (chapter 6 includes a scene identical to the famous sword fight in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\") earlier works. I cringed when the characters started singing \\"We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!\\" in the very final scene.SF fans should probably read \\"Hyperion\\" because it is important, and because it is widely revered, but I cannot count myself among the reverent ones."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I picked up this book based on the suggestion of a friend and a lot of critics reviews calling this one of the best sci-fi novels.Well, I would not call it exactly a disappointment, but it was definitively not up to my expectations. The author seems to be trying too hard to define a future world, and is constantly forcibly drawing parallels between his future situations/devices/event with real life. The use of alternative language for \\"every day\\" things is sometimes inspired (e.g. \\"entropic tides\\", \\"farcasters\\"), but most of the times they feel gimmicky and almost tacky (e.g. \\"death wand\\"). The HYPERION universe and mythology is not as rich and nuanced as, for example, DUNE.The sub-stories, which are really the core of this book are entertaining in a pulp fiction way, but, IMO not significant (socially, or even within the context of HYPERION itself; see DECAMERON), or even memorable enough to make this book a must read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I was told by a colleague that this was an excellent story. I read the reviews and many stated that this was an excellent story. I still wasn't prepared for the reality of how well written this story actually was. I became completly emersed in this new world. The writing was sophisticated and created a depth of character that has been missing in many other books that I have read. Can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I devoured this book in a week, admittedly ignoring everything else in my life except personal hygiene. I was whistling when I finished it, a tune you will probably recognize when you finish the book, too, then wondered why in God's name had I not read this before 2012? The best of the best. If you have not read this, do so now. Enjoy, digest, consider: wonder why you hadn't read it before 2012."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is awesome! So much more than I was expecting.While this book takes place in the future, the stories behind each of the characters are truly recognizable and unmistakenly and unchangingly human. Though times change and technology evolves, people inevitably retain the same motives, emotions and desires. This aspect is what anchored me to the story the most. The chapter about Sol and Rachel alone was a worthy read on its own. Even those who are not avid sci-fi readers (such as myself)will thoroughly enjoy this book. My only advice beyond this- make sure you have book 2, \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" before you finish the first!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I think that Hyperion is a fantastic example of science fiction at it's best. The story is complex, thought provoking and vividly told from the perspective of seven pilgrims as they travel towards certain death at the will of the mysterious Shrike. Similarly to the Canterbury Tales each character takes a turn to tell their tale, each of which is worthy of a story in it's own right. I believe that this is a book for anyone who appreciates excellent writing and clever ideas being a true masterpiece of science fiction.I would however Hyperion is really the first half of two books and should be read as such. With this in mind it is worth having The Fall of Hyperion handy as you wont want to wait for the second half!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"SPOILER ALERT: This novel does not contain an ending.We meet six or seven pilgrims who are on their way to meet the Shrike. Each has their own poignant, individual reasons for wishing to encounter the sci-fi Grim Reaper. They have been beset by trials and tribulations that are painful and uniquely imagined.The sci-fi universe is lively if a bit derivative. Humanity, with the assistance of powerful AI, has colonized the galaxy and so on. But the bloated human civilization is under threat of attack by the mutated Ousters.So, we meet the pilgrims who are on their way to find the Shrike. We learn that the planet they are traveling across is under threat by the Ousters, who have their own mutant purposes. Each character slowly tells the fascinating backstory of how they ended up on a pilgrimage that will most likely end in their death.And then the book ends. Which is why I only give \\"Hyperion\\" 4 stars."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've been on a sci-fi and fantasy reading binge over the last few months and Hyperion came highly recommended from a few friends. I enjoyed the book. The narrative style is interesting and I liked the way the reader is introduced to the elements of the Hyperion universe through the stories of the pilgrims. I disagree with reviewers who have problems with the descriptions of sex in the book. The author is tasteful. He does a good job of conveying the complexities of his characters. However, the book ended rather abruptly for my taste. The book could've benefited a lot more from building details of the universe in which it is set. I've ordered the Fall of Hyperion and can't wait to read how all of this ends."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has written a fascinating story, and one that leaves me hanging in such a way that I want to keep reading the series. That being said, I found the settings more complicated than enriching, and many of the themes more simply sadistic than dramatically compelling. The Shrike is like a hunka-hunka burning saw that wants to embrace you...(ok). Dan Simmons is a little too stuck on pain and gore, but regardless it's still a damn good read, and I still want to know what happens next. He can spin quite a convincing world for you to wander in your mind's eye. I just like my sci-fi a little more Wagner and a little less Puccini."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"After reading all the conflicting reviews &quot;Hyperion&quot; has received, as well as reading the book itself, I tought that perhaps a self-conflicting review was in order.&quot;Hyperion&quot; is really composed of seven tales, embedded in a story about a pilgrimage. Each tale is told by a different character explaining how he ended up on this journey.The tales themselves do feel like they are being written as they are told, although they seem to be spoken with practically the same voice.Of those tales two are outstanding:- the poets tale, containing a hilarious situation in which the poet achieves true artistic depth.- the scholars tale, with it's hauntingly familiar human tragedy. This is prime time SF, containing an echo of emotions and tragic moments all of us encounter in our own lifes, but in an inherently alien situation.On the bad side, the framework story of the pilgrimage itself in the present moment is boring. In fact it is so bad, that it feels like a sorry excuse, an artificial literary form without substance.There's worse to come:At least according to what I gathered from other reviews, &quot;The Fall Of Hyperion&quot; is really the second part of this book. But as a book that is published, bought and regretably read as a self contained unit, &quot;Hyperion&quot; is without doubt the most infuriating &amp; insulting book I've ever read. The tales artfully build up suspence, which the boring and mercifully short sections of framework story cannot destroy, and then...I don't know, maybe the editor stuck the last 2 pages in.They don't belong. They're stupid. They're an insult to anyone who buys and reads the book.Maybe like the author, I should end on a sour note, but as I do have respect for my readers, I will conclude instead that the two priceless gems this book contains, make it a good read.In fact, if you don't have the sequel, just read those two stories. The less you read of the framework story the better."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I can't help but wonder if it was a lean year for SF novels in 1990. The other books nominated for the Hugo that year:The Boat of a Million Years by Poul AndersonPrentice Alvin by Orson Scott CardA Fire in the Sun by George Alec EffingerGrass by Sheri S. TepperI've not had a chance to read any of the others, but read &quot;Hyperion&quot; because of all of the great reviews it's been given, and since it did win the Hugo that year.I'd prefer to give it a &quot;grate&quot; review.While some of the stories were mildy interesting, the characters were not. How can one get involved in a story when the majority of the characters are less-than-savory, to say the least? I for one didn't care much which of them survived. In my mind, none of them much deserved it. And to make matters worse, the book ended without even resolving this matter.Perhaps the most annoying thing about this book is Simmons' descriptive style. He seems to feel that describing everything down to the atomic level makes for good writing. I for one found his style cumbersome and derailing. Read Alfred Bester's &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; if you want to see the flip-side. Bester can engage you entirely in a story with very sparse descriptions. Less is more in good writing, and film for that matter. Allow the reader to fill-in the gaps on their own. Bludgeoning them with over-description makes this book crawl at a snail's pace.The Shrike was perhaps the only interesting character in the book. Enigmatic and brutal. Much like Simmons' writing style.I gave the book a rating of 3 because the cover-art was neat and all of the pages were in the right order. If you buy it, keep the cover and dispense with the pages in between."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The detailed, unique universal construct makes this novel shine. Yet, all that luscious background cannot hide the weakness of the story. Or I suppose I should say \\"stories.\\"This is Sci-fi Canterbury Tales. The entire novel reveals the history of the 7 characters chosen for this specific mission. The individual stories are good enough, but after the fourth, I found myself skimming. It's too unrelated. Too eclectic.And then comes the end ... rushed, abbreviated, truncated, and nonsensical. All this sound and fury leading to nothing. Huge disappointment. And in some ways, a waste of my time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I was very excited to start this book, because it sounded like it was similar to Lost in it's storytelling, not so much the setting. I liked the collection of short stories the book ultimately turned into in relating all of the pilgrim's back stories, but some of them didn't resonate well with me. The first tale, Father Hoyt's, about the cruciform was a great start and built my expectations up for the ones that would follow. Father Hoyt's tale had a very Lovecraftian vibe to it, and seeing as I can't get enough of Lovecraft, it wasn't surprising that this turned out to be my favorite portion of the book. The subsequent tales, however, left me feeling lukewarm at best and frustrated more often than not. Admittedly, I am more of a reader of fantasy than of science fiction, and I think that is where a lot of my frustration arose from. The military strategies of spacecraft and weaponry that you can't even form a coherent vision of inside your head was by far the worst part of this book for me. I cannot visualize spaceships, super-futuristic weapons/armor, sprawling landscapes with alien vegetation, or overly industrialized underground cities as well as I can more fantasy oriented subjects. It probably wasn't the fault of the book that I didn't enjoy it, I felt like I should be enjoying it far more than I was while reading it, but rather my inability to visualize what the hell was happening. Fifth generation battle cruisers with deathwatcher armor and photon hellwhip targeting arrays dropping cluster bombs along the rim of the omega 7 quadrant just isn't something I can conjure up in my head, or something I really want to conjure up. I love scifi movies, because science fiction is such a visual genre I think, and you can actually understand what the creator was going for."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"After slogging through six or seven-hundred pages of a story with characters I didn't feel much sympathy for, I expected some kind of payoff and didn't get any. Just the promise of a six or seven-hundred page sequel with no promise of Shrike-like closure. Maybe I shouldn't judge the story from the standpoint of what I wanted out of it. But you know what? Life, as any Shrike will tell you, is way too short, my brothers and sisters. Leave Hyperion where it orbits - in the dusty recess at remote edge of the universe. You'll save a couple of light years of your time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is might be perfectly written for a NATIVE English speaking reader.For others: you have to open dictionary very frequently. I have read 50+ english books (Asimov, Orson Scott Card, Robin Hobb, George R.R. Martin, etc.) and this was the first when i had to look up words in a dictionary. Actually i have to use it 2-3 times per page (really frequently).Due to very slow/hard reading experience i gave up even before finishing the first story.So if your primary language is other than English, then consider choosing an another book or at least try a sample."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is about a group of seven people on a pilgrimage to the creature called the Shrike on the world of Hyperion. During the trip each of these people tells his or her story to the group to better understand each other and to possibly help one of them survive the meeting with the Shrike. Sounds like a good premise for a story huh? Don't be fooled, the stories in Hyperion are long, boring, and drawn out and each story gets progressively worse as the book moves on. It's hard to relate or get attached to any of the characters and the environments leave much to be desired. Do yourself a favor and pass on Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It's like Peter F Hamilton meets Keats in a sci-fi fantasy setting. I enjoyed this book. Just the right pace, reminding me a lot of Pandora's Star, but with less world-building and more dive-in-and be confused prose."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really liked the frame story structure, though some of the stories were hard to get through. I found the Poet's Tale particularly annoying, though I suspect it was the author's intent for you to dislike Martin Silenus. The story of Sol and Rachel was very moving and for me was the highlight of the book.One complaint I have is the book does not stand on its own. Make sure you have a copy of The Fall of Hyperion on hand when you finish this one.Some other minor complaints are the use of colloquialisms from the present era. The Ousters could have used a more thorough introduction."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The story is a sequence of stories told by pilgrims on their way to a shrine, much like the Canterbury Tales. Except in this one, the characters are neither interesting or likeable. The time-traveling notions in play at the shrine and in some of the stories are silly and poorly thought out. Any attempt to wade through the morass of disconnected junk that makes up this novel is a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Mr. Simmons writes well and his story is powerful. His characters are well developed and the book is definitely though provoking. Sadly, the profanity and explicit sexual content destroy any virtue this book had to offer.

So my review will be very short, because I'm very frustrated)Boring and Confusing"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is a total disappointment. Really, just stay away from it and ignore all the glowing reviews. I have a hard time understanding how people could get fired up by such a drivel."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have been on a reading quest to catch up with previous Hugo award winners. Having just finished the impressive Virnor Vinge novels I was anxious to continue my trek of great Science Fiction.Hyperion is not a novel. That is the first thing a potential reader should realize. It is a collection of six short stories, each of which has an ending that requires the main character to meet a bug-eyed-multi-armed-time-traveling monster on the planet Hyperion. As a plotting ploy this is great, most of the characters have interesting stories to tell and you end up waiting impatiently to see what happens when they meet the monster.They don't. I don't feel I'm spoiling the ending, because there is none. The entire set of stories ends with the &quot;pilgrims&quot; stepping foot on the monsters temple. Absolutely nothing is resolved in this novel. It isn't a question of disliking the ending, it is a question of where is the ending? Some might call it a cliffhanger, I would just call it a waste of time.Having wasted too much time on this novel I cannot justify spending more money on the sequel. I have not guarentee that it will resolve anything or just be another setup to sell more books.I'm disgusted that this &quot;novel&quot; is considered a Hugo winner in the company of such wonderful novels like &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; and &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot;."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book had many clever ideas, and was a good vision of the future. However, this book had literally 0 plot. The entire story is a background of seven different characters, telling why they are on the planet Hyperion, and why they want to meet the mysterious creature the Shrike. The book climaxes to the night before the meeting of the shrike....and then simply ends. It was a pathetic end to a pointless book. If youre thinking about buying this book, think again"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Thankfully, I wasted only a very brief part of my life with this horribly pretentious book. I should have known right on the first page -- any sci-fi novel that starts off with a reference to an obscure piece of classical music is a deal breaker right there.From the get-go, there was too much of Simmons's overwrought style and self-indulgent jargon. I got about as far as this bit of prose-fapping:\\"If the fleet did construct a farcaster in time and the Hegemony committed the total resources of FORCE to defending a single, distant, colonial world of Hyperion, the Worldweb ran the terrible risk of suffering an Ouster attack on the elsewhere...Before I said \\"WHAT?! The hell with this!\\" And resisted the urge to farcast the book into the trash."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"What a disappointment Hyperion was. After reading all the hype about the book, I was excited to read it. I only wish someone had written something about the muck one has to wade through to get to the story. This book is profane, vulgar, and indecent. It reminded me of third grade when certain kids learned crude words and tried to use them as often as possible. I threw the book into the trash can with the rest of the garbage before I could finish it. I will not recommend Hyperion to anyone, young or old."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the worst books ever written. The sequel is another. Fluff for the easily impressed. If you are completely taken in by verbose drivel and pseudo-intellectualism, this book and it's sequels are for you. I would have rated it a &quot;1&quot;, but the words were spelled correctly"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book started quite ok. But the end is just a terrible disaster that was probably caused by the fact, that the author was starving and he had to give just &quot;SOMETHING&quot; to his agent so he would get some money for some food... It is obvoius that the book starts with a nice idea in authors mind. It is divided into 6 stories and the first few are excelently written. But when you get to about 2/3 of the book, one of the main characters dies (quite probably because the book is getting to thick for 7 stories). The last story looks like the author was in such a hurry, that instead of working on the story, he just substitued his &quot;preliminary version of the text with his own comments&quot;. The last story is written in simple words the way a first grade kid would do it. My comment: he really must have been hungry to release that book...The worst thing (this made me to rate it with 1 star instead of 2 stars) is that the book does not end. It is not even open end book. It simply does not end - as if you bought the book with last 20 pages missing. Is this an attempt to make the buyer also buy the sequel? Well then I am not going to buy the sequel, because there is quite a high probability the part II will end or better to say fail to end the same way.I still have to give the author some credit (that is the reason for at least one star) for giving us some insight in the way people look at the world: &quot;whatever can place us as humanity on its menu (even potentialy) has to die - and that applies for tigers and lions as well as for any extraterestrials&quot;."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book didn't do anything for me. For the most part I was bored, it took a good measure of will for me to stick through the whole thing to the end. I don't think the actual book lived up to the description on the back cover, and I always find that rather disappointing. Simmons's style isn't one I can appreciate.I chose Hyperion based on the back cover and all the glowing reviews I heard. I'm glad I got it at a library book sale instead of spending 6 bucks on it. The reason I have the next book is that I found it at the same book sale.There are many much better science fiction novels out there. My suggestion is that before buying this book you should read the first 2 chapters, this will probably warn you off, or sell you on the book.I'll give the sequel the benefit of the doubt, but the first two chapters have done nothing for me. If I didn't have so many books which I haven't read yet, I wouldn't bother with the sequel. However, since I have the sequel and I just finished Hyperion, I have to get through it somehow just to cross one of these books off my list."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is well written and fairly readable, but overall reading experience will be much less than the sum of the parts. The book is composed of pieces that knit nicely together, but the actual story does not work. Mostly this is because the ending is as well thought as \\"then I woke up\\"I don't know why this book has won an award for anything.. Perhaps the author wants the reader to buy the rest of the story in an other book, but as for me.. I will leave Dan Simmons alone from now on."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Skipping the fluff? This book is just Ok, not a must read for anyone who likes Sci-fi.It took a little while to get going because it's broken down into smaller stories so you can get a background on all of the major players, and that's OK. You actually can feel which ones are written earlier and which ones were written later, because they're a little more developed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Really a collection of short stories though they are all related to the central story. Ultimately I think it had a rather boring non-ending. Maybe the end was supposed to be this big twist/surprise but it fell kind of flat to me.Don't see how this has gotten such a great reviews, I won't be reading any of the sequels."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I don't read a lot of SciFi. I don't remember what turned me on to Hyperion, but I've read most of the reviews here as well as a lot of Dan Simmons site (Where I enjoyed his open letters to fans a lot more than his book). Simmons is said to be one of the few who could write in so many different genres, so many different characters in one book and all while making references to Keats and duplicating the style of the Canterbury Tales. Why should that even be a goal?It sounds like instead of just writing a good book, Simmons was trying to set some sort of record. The result is freaky. I liked the Priest's story and the story about time disease. The rest either bored me or left me confused and exhausted. I kept dozing off. And the ending is horrible. I learned from reviews when half way through the book that this volume has no resolution. It doesn't.It may be the SciFi fanatic's book of the year. It may be the kind of bold experimental book that heavy readers crave, but for me it seemed like a bit of a pretentious mess and a bore interrupted by a couple of tantalizing story bits that got cut off. Maybe it'll all come together for me when I read \\"The End of Hyperion\\" or when I read through Hyperion for the third time. For now it's 2 stars.The priest's tale - This is one of the two I liked the best except for the ending which was bizarre and more like horror than science fiction.The Colonel's Tale - It ran through my mind like some stupid space action flick complete with pervy sex scene after killing. Does killing really make people horny? Is that documented or is it just some crud that modern authors have been inflicting on us since censorship stopped?The Poet's Tale - I read the whole thing and then had no idea what I'd just read because I was daydreaming while reading it.The Scholar's Tale - This had some moving moments. It then went on for quite a bit and ended like most everything else - in a confusing blur.The Detective's Tale - I felt Simmons was having a laugh with this. Also, here we had the new stereotype, the female superchick, gunslinger and martial arts expert just like in most every other hit movie.The Consul's tale - I was busy rushing for the doors at this point. Just trying to get to the end. I don't remember any of it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Disclaimer: I may not have been in the mood for this book, because I'm not entirely certain it isnt better than 3 stars.This is the 6th Simmons book I've read (I started with \\"The Terror\\", which I loved). I must admit, the literary allusions are getting tiresome. The Terror had explicit references to \\"Masque of the Red Death\\" and \\"Ilium\\" and \\"Olympus\\" were sci-fi retreads of the Iliad. I find it really distracting to constantly have these meta-references of other authors' books mentioned on every page. Simmons is so imaginative - I think he's held down by the constraints of these other works. \\"Hyperion\\" is based on the Canterbury Tales, and goes so far as to have a reincarnation of Keats as a main character. Sorry - that's lame.I dont care if the Canterbury Tales is a classic - having seven short stories held together by a pilgrimage serves as flimsy glue. I'm about 20 pages from the end, and I'm getting bored. The main plot seems to be nonexistent.Also, the near constant flood of his proprietary sci-fi vocabulary (farcasting, stimsim, Halgera, tightbeam, fatline, etc) is a bit much without a glossary.One more complaint: it was really annoying how every time the author wanted us to visualize a person, he'd write something like, \\"He looked like the actor Cary Grant from the old holos she used to watch from Old Earth\\". Its the year 3000 and people still reference forgettable 20th century film stars? I don't think so. Either, try an actual description (which, in fairness, he does) or omit it entirely."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is a collection of several stories of varying quality.Overall, I found the writing style to be too wordy. I would rather be entertained by ideas than an unusual use of words.While I did enjoy a couple of the stories, two others left me completely indifferent - if not annoyed at having to read them.The overall story was intriguing enough that it kept me reading to the end. A secondary benefit I was hoping for, was reading about one particularly annoying character's death. Unfortunately, the ending has let me down on both accounts. Not only did the annoying character survive, but there was also nothing even remotely resembling a conclusion.Two stars - for the two stories I enjoyed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read almost the entire book before I realized I was BORED.. It had some nice ideas, but I just couldn't continue anymore. I'm suprised it has so many positive reviews on here."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"*** Spoilers ahead! ***The way this book started out, it had huge potential. Dan Simmons created quite an interesting word. The first pilgrim's, Hoyt's, story was great! It was well written, suspenseful, and innovative. I also liked Martin's, as it explained a lot about what happened to Earth. But, I disliked most of the other individual tales, and here's why:- Kassad's story read like an action porn movie. The fact that a beautiful woman comes out of nowhere and has sex with him, is unbelievable. The escape from the medical ship as it was destroyed by the Ousters was also quite implausible. There was just too much mindless sex and action in this story.- Brawne's story strived to be a detective, but love and sex, once again, ruin it. In the beginning, I enjoyed the flow of the story and the mystery it resolved around. I just could not stand the fact that this bad-ass woman falls in love with, and spreads her legs to, a genetically engineered cybrid, who is her client, in a matter of days. That took away from her bad-assness and I couldn't care for her character for the rest of the book.- Sol's story. I didn't care that much about it, or how long it dragged on for. It could have been written in about five pages. It should have been written in five pages. There wasn't that much to it. The whole \\"Later alligator\\" thing was just annoying.- By the time I got to the Consul's story, I was already pretty disappointed. All I saw the story for was another love story, more sex... with an old lady. /facepalmI went on to read The Fall of Hyperion, struggled through it with clenched teeth. Will not read anything else by this author."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Overall this is a good story, but there is a little grammatical mistake that runs throughout the book and it's just irritating. When you write a restrictive clause you use \\"that\\" as in \\"The shoes that I wear protect my feet.\\" Instead, all through the book it would say, \\"The should which I wear protect my feet.\\" It's not huge, but when you're reading through a novel and it jumps out at you, it screws up your flow and it's just irritating. And this book is replete with it.The ending is absolutely infuriating and makes me not want to read the next one. I won't spoil it for you, but I don't think the book could have ended any worse.It's sci-fi fantasy, I get it. I love the genre. But, it seems like the technology and the society are being made up as the story progresses. Most things fit together, but some things just seem silly and ridiculous (one prime example: the motile isles and dolphins on Maui-Covenant). Halfway through the book, after about the first two tales, things seem great. Oh great, I think, this will be a good story with kind of a hidden message. By the Detective's tale you realize that it's just a pointless fantasy tale. I've got no problem with that, but I feel led on in the first part of the book.Anyway, I guess it's worth reading, but I wish I could have search/replaced all the misuses of \\"which.\\""},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Tell me, do you want a good book?

The two best SF books I've read in the past few years have been Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos) and A Fire Upon the Deep. Excellent book!! Simmon's imagination blew me away.

If you read any Sci-Fi books this year, I recommend you try this one.I read Sci-Fi hoping that the author will present ideas beyond my imagination. At the same timeI hope that it will be well written and has characters which have depth. This book had a great story and was wellwritten. One of the few gems I have been able to find."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In fact, the only label you can put on Simmons books is a warning label: CAREFUL, sticky substance, will not let go of hands (or mind)until completely read. Don't believe me? Just try to put it away once you've started it. Stopping an atomic reaction is simple by comparison.I read horror. I read science fiction, poetry, and sometimes I read about religion and philosophy. I like to mix it up a little.So does Dan Simmons. The only difference: he does it in one book. On the surface, this story is a gripping mix of Clive Barker-likehorror and SciFi worldbuilding and imagination that Greg Bear and Asimov would be jealous of, but underneath there is so much more.Simmons plays with time-lines better than Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, adresses more issues (from poetry and religionto the self-fulfilling prophecy) than Frank Herbert, and all that in a gripping literary fashion.If you like horror, you'll like it. If you like SciFi, you'll thoroughly love it. But if you like both, and you like something a littledeeper, then not reading this one will be the one mistake you'll regret the rest of your life."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book, along with The Fall of Hyperion and Endymion, make up the best series of science fiction books since Asimov's Foundation series. I could hardly put any of the books down. I especially like the way he incorporates the poet John Keats into a story based far in the future. OUTSTANDING!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Arguably the best science fiction novel ever written. Complex, characters and plot ensure a wonderful read. At the end you will be disappointed that the story has been finished"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"~Well, no. Not a classic. It's a cut above most science fiction, and occasionally it rises to the best quality, as in \\"The Scholar's Tale,\\" in which Simmons looks at how the parent and child relationship could be reversed in a really astonishing way. But not a classic. I'm not saying that Simmons isn't capable of writing a classic, but he hasn't written one yet.For all the irritatingly self-conscious \\"literariness\\" of this book, it's really very old-fashioned science fiction, and it has the vices and virtues of old-fashioned science fiction. The vices: the characters are wooden and stereotyped. There's not a trace of real cultural difference or sensitivity: all these characters are actually present-day Americans hastily dressed up as denizens of the future. The plot is extravagant: the fate of mankind is in the balance, of course. business as usual. The virtues: there is sometimes in Hyperion the real \\"let's turn the universe on its head and see what falls down!\\" experimentation, the \\"visions of the future\\" kind of science fiction. The dystopian elements are nicely done. Is it the barbarians or the forces of civilization that are threatening humanity? Is the destructive impulse of humanity really its salvation, really its creative impulse? Simmons runs with these as far as any classic science fiction ever did.I haven't yet read the Fall of Hyperion -- and I plan to, so you can see that I can't be all that disappointed -- so some twists of the plot are yet to be untwisted. I may be favorably surprised. But some things can't be recovered from. The \\"poet\\" figure is a disaster from start to finish, a hackneyed comic-book version of the foul-mouthed hard-drinking artist, and the supposed insight of his tale -- that lust, the creation of art, and predation have something, vaguely, to do with each other -- is hardly late-breaking news even within the precincts of science fiction. The \\"soldier\\" is equally pointless. There's an awful lot of blood and gore mixed up with sex, which is at least thematic, here, but I still don't like it. The end of the book -- as noted in many reviews -- is really just a \\"to be continued\\": but having these people suddenly singing and skipping down the yellow brick road was an awful, awful mistake. There was supposed to be a sort of Zorba-dancing feel to it, I guess, but it gave more the feel of an motiveless authorial freak. None of these people is the \\"ah, hell, let's dance!\\" type.So what worked well? The \\"framed tales\\" worked really surprisingly well, actually catching some of that strange, indirect narrative force that Chaucer managed to harness. Every once in a while one of Simmons' arch turns comes off and is hilarious -- when he suddenly dropped into the style and plot of the hard-boiled detective story for \\"the Detective's Tale\\" I actually laughed aloud.What this author needs -- and, sadly, what he's terribly unlikely to get -- is a ruthless editor who will stop him in his tracks and say, \\"is this particular arch turn worth trashing the mood of the story?\\" and \\"what really is the heart of this story, and how does this episode take us deeper into it?\\" Until he gets that sort of discipline either from the inside or the outside, we'll be getting, not classics, but clever pastiche."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I can understand why this book won the Hugo. I just don't happen to agree. This book is a strange amalgam of originality and confusion, exotic imagery in the service of melodrama, bold visions in search of meaning. It tries for, but falls short of real depth.I admired it for its spunk, its willingness to take risks, its determination to say something. But, in the final analysis, it is a failure: a respectable failure perhaps, but a failure nonetheless.This is the sort of work where the writer leaves things ambiguous to afford us the freedom to reach our own conclusions. Normally, I would be beside myself with joy. Most writers do not respect their readership enough to take such chances, and to happen upon such boldness is a cause for celebration. If daring were the only criterion for good SF, Hyperion would constitute greatness.But there is more to science fiction than daring. For one thing, there must be a sensible and coherent vision: something that aims for the mind and not just the heart, or in this author's case, the gut. This book fails because it suffers from a case of intellectual dissipation. The various episodes are almost sessions of free association. Only the most superficial threads connect the various stories. The common world that the characters share is made up on the fly; contrived as a vehicle for what is basically a pastiche of personal horror stories. This is simply unjustifiable self-indulgence on the part of the author.There is also a self-conscious cleverness about the writing that is extremely annoying. One can almost see the author congratulating himself as he tweaks this particular symbolism, or that particular allusion. 'I've just likened the Ousters to heaven, and the Technocore to hell. Ain't I clever?' Or: 'marvel at how neatly I subvert the crucifix icon.'What this book lacks is self-discipline. The author is so enamoured of his bold visions, that he throws them all into the book like a vegetable stew. The book would have been far more effective had the author resisted the temptation to overdose on originality and sacrificed some of his exotic ideas for the sake of structure and coherency.This book reads more like a fantasy novel than a work of science fiction. Fantasy is a genre much more forgiving of undisciplined flights of fancy. Science fiction demands form and precision: more like to classical than to jazz.It is obvious that many readers have enjoyed this novel, so I am not about to tell you that you won't. But it isn't the masterpiece that some would have you believe. It is interesting, provocative and disquieting, but at the end of the day, it leaves one feeling unfulfilled. This is a failing that exists not so much in the heart of the novel as in its mind-space, and limits its accomplishments to the level of the superficial."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book tells the stories of six pilgrims on a voyage, and the reason why are they \\"the chosen ones\\" to be on that voyage.

This type of story-telling also allows the reader to use his/her imagination and intellect to piece together the history and core concepts of Simmon's detailed future.

I have never read something that was so unlike the standard, constantly reiterated staples of SF, whilst remaining so very relevant. It is at times horrifying, beautiful and unfathomable. Simmons paints a picture too big to take in all at once, and as you are treated to the tidbits of information he scatters before you, you gain a greater understanding of the epic panorama he is laying before your eyes. I can't rate this book highly enough. I picked it up on a whim, and have yet to find a series of books I enjoyed more. Just make sure you have the sequel to hand - I spent an infuriating month trying to track it down before I could lay my mind at rest"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Now, don't get me wrong - I liked Dune and Foundation, but neither of these volumes matches the breadth and depth that Simmons manages so effortlessly. Hyperion is very much superior to The Fall of Hyperion, but I found that the series picks up again with Endymion's brilliant new twists on the old vision. Hyperion is that terribly rare achievement, in my opinion - a book that constructs not just a world, but a universe. Simmons crafts a vision so vast that as a reader I felt grateful just to have the opportunity to wrap my imagination around it. From FORCE to the TechnoCore, from the Fatline to the Shrike, Hyperion uses with casual grace a plethora of ideas and concepts, any one of which a lesser writer would have been happy to use as the sole basis for a work. Truly a magnificent accomplishment, Mr. Simmons."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a wonderful book , but in following titles , he just runs over the same themes"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even though I do not find the subject of human pain and suffering particularly interesting.

I'd recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has a way to draw the reader into his book and hold you there through every page until you realize it's 4 a.m. and you have to be to work at 9a.m. Hyperion is the first head of a four headed monster that skillfully blends his skills as a science fiction writer, while paying homage to the writers of the past who inspired him..Keats, Chaucer, Eliot, etc."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As stated before, a bunch of good novellas, some of which are quite haunting. Since, it's not really structured as a novel, I can't rate it as great novel. I'm confused by the other reviewers shock at the profanity/sexuality. It's quite tame compared to other sci-fi (read Heinlein)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If the book (and it's sequels) were 5,000 pages - it would be worth reading simply to experience one of the sub-tales.Sol / Rachel's tale is simply the most poignant story I've read, bar none.

While crocodile&quot; without rememebering this story.The balance of the tales each bring their own facet to light - and each is a worthy read.The weakest portion of the entire book, IMO, is the framework glueing these together. However, this is not because it is a poor story - it simply pales in comparison to the sub-stories."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Most aspects of this fine novel have been covered in other reviews so I will confine my comments to say that the number of literary allusions in both &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;Fall of Hyperion&quot; was staggering and they are probably better recieved by people who read more then just science fiction. Some people complained that the book had &quot;graphic&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; sex scenes, and while I will agree that this book is not for children, I must commend Simmons for his portrayal of the romance between Kassad and Moneta was both moving and realistic. Two people who are in love with war will not have a sedate and chaste romance, there was passion, violence and despair, just as their should have been. I would recomend this book to anyone who is a fan of science fiction, but also a thinker because much in Simmon's writting needs to be mulled over for the full effect to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I will not waste my review by discussing the content of the 4 book series (Tetrad?). All I want to say is that, prior to reading this series, I thought that the Dune series was the greatest for creating a Universe. I have just finished &quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot; and feel that there my be more books in the sequence coming. A lot of questions remained unanswered, which left me wanting more! I can recommend this series for anyone who enjoys good writing, as it appeals to all tastes: philosophy, war, love, horror, science fiction, humor."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book is great. Read it. The reality of the today's modern publishing arena is that the publishers like serial books. Writing and publishing are profit endeavors.

That was an incredible mistake! This book is like turning over the Tarot cards on every page, to see what fate befalls each of the characters. In some ways it is like the Canterbury Tales, but deeply disturbing. After reading this volume I could not wait to get the sequels. The book definitely deserved the Hugo award."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Start with a wonderful space opera. Add to that a very healthy dose of horror. Mix in pinches Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Keats. Add philosophy and religion to taste. If you are master writer such as Simmons, then you will get _Hyperion_, one of the ten best books of the last 15 years, IMHO.Simply put, a fantastic book. A group of diverse characters travel together in the tradition of _The Canterbury Tales_ and each has a different story to tell. Each story could stand alone (one does, in Simmons' short story collection _Prayers to Broken Stones_) and his ability to shift narrative styles gives each story a distinct voice and feel.The result is a truly wonderful book, one which spans a number of genres and should be enjoyed by many people. However, let the reader be warned...the end of the this book is an absolute cliffhanger. You might as well by _Fall of Hyperion_ at the same time if you want to know how the story ends."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"... a beautiful and exquisite melange of ideas and haunting images poetically evoked by a truly gifted writer.

Dan Simmons is different. If you are like me and you get tired of science fiction novels with two dimensional characters and over use of the exclamation point, you should read Hyperion.Hyperion is one of the best written books I have read, and probably the best science fiction book. The writing is subtle, symbolic, and beautiful. The adventure is riveting and the ideas thought provoking. Hyperion's universe is deap and consistant.On top of all that, Simmons has a way of putting images in your head that stick. There are several from this series of books that I will never forget."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"There are a few science fiction novels that have kept me riveted to my seat, and this is one of them. I like to compare the series to Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\", but I secretly like the \\"Hyperion\\" series better (Sorry, Orson). It says in the bio that Simmons is actually known for his horror, but he wrote this series as if he had been writing sci-fi for his entire career. Simmons has created an intricate universe that is so complex that the reader is left wondering how it should be put together. The solution is not clear until the end of the entire series, where Simmons has written one of the best climaxes I have ever read.I am trying not to say anything about the actual story because only Simmons can tell it in the way it should be told, but I strongly suggest this series to true sci-fi fans. I dare myself to say that it is as fundamental as Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" series, as thought provoking as Frederick Pohl's \\"Gateway\\" series, and, as mentioned before, as thoroughly readable as Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender\\" series.This first installment to the series reminded me of Canterbury Tales. Simmons also seems to really like John Keats, and there are many connections to the real life of John Keats woven into this epic tale. \\"Hyperion\\" is devoted almost entirely to background and character development. The second book, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" could almost exist independently of the series, and it is marvelously written. Very intense. The third book \\"Endymion\\" is an unexpected change from the story, and at first the reader may be anxious to get back to the previous situation, but I assure you it is worth the wait. The conclusion, \\"The Rise of Endymion\\" is by far the best book. New characters and old characters are united, an incredible fight ensues, and some incredibly hard-core characters are introduced.Simmons is a creative author. There are many concepts that he introduces, some of which are fundamental to the storyline (like \\"farcasters\\"... portals that punch holes through space-time linking distant points in space), and others that are merely mentioned for dramatic effect (like combat suits that dissipate heat from laser shots through superconducting circuitry).For any story, there must be conflict. Simmons creates three (3) incredibly complex character sets: The Hegemony of Man (humanity, in all of its selfish glory), The TechnoCore (a virtual \\"datumplane\\" of highly evolved AI), and the Ousters (space-inhabiting humans, evolved and adjusted to low-g environments, among other things), all of whom are in battle with one another. This first book introduces the reader to these complex characters, though the rest of the story awaits in the remaining 3 books (which are incredible, by the way).On a final note, The Shrike is the coolest character ever created in a novel. The purpose of the Shrike will escape you for the first few books, but as more is learned, the impressive duties of the Shrike will be revealed. I am the Shrike's biggest fan.A+++"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Not only is the story itself wonderful and addictive, but for those sci-fi fans out there, Simmons creates a wonderfully new and fresh perspective and vision (as the series progresses you will see exactly how large and complex this vision is). As well, I particularly enjoyed this book, with its series of tales told by fellow travellers - reminiscent on the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, yet new and different. This book - this series is one of the great works of fiction to come along in a good while."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is the dream of the sci-fi novel reader come true: It is highly imaginative, it has a great intricate plot which unfolds marvelously, the writing is very good, the characters are interesting and well developed, and there is plenty of suspense and action. The only caveat to reader is that the book has no definite ending and there are 3 more books that continue the storyline."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Reviewing these novels is really overkill, but I had to say my piece. Dan Simmons has written a series of novels that are really the most imaginative in all of SF. I enjoyed the sequels as much as Hyperion. I have been reading SF for over 40 years and this series of novels is, in my opinion, second only to Gordon Dickson's Childe Cycle novels in their scope, philosophical depth, imagination and enjoyment. Simmons is just a great writer, and I would place him among the top 10 SF writers of all time. Based loosely on the poems and letters of John Keats, the author has woven around these ideas the most imaginative tale in all of SF. Simmon's imagery is astounding -- he keeps coming up with scenes and plot that you can hardly believe. Endymion and The Rise of Endymion continue the universe created in the first 2 novels, but Simmons smartly continues the story 300 years in the future with new, but still fascinating, characters and astonishing imagery that seems to be the author's hallmark. This is imaginative fiction with philosophical depth, power and just plain great reading."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Once I started reading this book, I simply couldn't put it down! I had read Simmons' novella \\"Orphans of the Helix\\" in the paperback Far Horizons, and was entranced. It took place in the same universe as the Hyperion novels, and I knew that I had to read Hyperion from all the rave reviews. What I read in Hyperion was stunning....the characters were true to life and each filled with such feeling and emotion. I think most readers can identify with one of the pilgrims, or more than one of the pilgrims. In a way, I think Simmons wanted to capture the reader through one of the characters' stories, and a reader may identify with the brooding, vengeful Consul, or with the hedonistic poet Silenus, or Brawne Lamia the detective who fell in love and lost, or with Kassad as a veteran of war. The whole Hyperion universe is space opera on the grandest of scales....there are androids, instantaneous travel between planets, an AI core that takes place in interplanetary government, Poulsen treatments to extend life beyond 100 years, time travel, cities that orbit in the sky, a dazzling array of religions, ancient aliens, unheard of lost planetary colonists, and much more. Though the story does get confusing and convoluted toward the end, the whole book holds well together....he leaves the reader on a cliffhanger at the end. Dan Simmons' characterization in science fiction is superb. The characters aren't mere cardboard....after a while, they become real."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It's been years since I read Hyperion and while looking for a new Kindle book tonight, I was searching through Dan Simmons more recent works. And in reading these reviews, I just wanted to hop on to say that this has been one of my favorite books for a decade or more now. One of the few books I'd consider buying again to read a third or forth time. There are some good reviews here in much greater detail than this will be, but I also saw some ratings with fewer than five stars and I wanted to say to any non-Simmons readers out there, that this is a book truly worthy of your time. I still think of it and look back fondly, years later. Enjoy."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"From the first sentence, this epic tale, of a civilization lost in its own enormity, held me captive with its dark beauty. Haunting, vast, and yet deeply personal, it shatters the mold of traditional science fiction. The sense of mystery is palpable, and every question answered, every step toward understanding the monstrous Shrike and its connection to the fate of the universe, binds the reader deeper into the unwinding of the story and into the lives--and impending deaths--of its occupants. Simmons never gives away more than he has to, but always just enough. Each of the pilgrims' tales expands the breadth and the complexity of the world he creates, all of it ultimately interconnected in the lives of these seven people. Seven people, each legendary in their own right, and each easily deserving of a novel to themselves, yet Hyperion combines them and condenses them to their most expressive (and disturbing) essence. Simmons has a mastery of language and mood that leaves all other science fiction authors in the dust, with no exception. He builds an atmosphere of terror surrounding Hyperion that rivals the best work of H.P. Lovecraft, but is far more individual and ultimately carries deep meaning. I came away feeling not only that I observed a true master storyteller at work, but also that it changed my understanding of the world and of myself.I listened to the Audible audiobook edition, and it is beautiful. Each of the tales is told by a different narrator, to match the differences in tone and style, and almost all of them are superbly read. I highly recommend it.Also worth mentioning is the sheer volume of literary reference scattered throughout this work--Hyperion harks back to Beowulf and Chaucer and Shakespeare, Kipling, Yeats, Keats, the Bible, and many others, including, without a doubt, many that I am not well-read enough to notice or appreciate.This book will stand by itself as truly great literature, independent of the rest of Simmons' works. I expect to reread it many times."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I don't read too many books twice.I've read Dan Simmon's Hyperion series three times, and I'll probably read it all again.This guy is amazing.Not only does he bring a whole, complex, fascinating, fictional world to real life, with complex characters, political and religious elements of a fascinating and intricate nature, unheard of technology (it IS Science Fiction, after all), etc., but he does it in this particular book while making hardcore literary references bringing themes from such classic literature as the poetry of John Keats and Geoffrey Chaucer into the very marrow of his tale. Truly amazing.Anyone who has studied literature (I was an English major) will not only appreciate the superb writing, vivid imagery, profound characterization, intricate plots, and, hair-pulling suspenseful conflicts, but also the constant thread of literary symbolism and reference to other great works of literature, executed with such skill and creativity as has not hitherto been seen within the Science Fiction/Horror genre.So. This is not only a great, page turner, suck-you-in to the story, make the characters/worlds real kind of science fiction book (and it is ALL of that), but it is also an artful, complex, fascinating literary work of classic proportions.similar authors:Robert JordanThe Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #1)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a Sci Fi novel, it's true. BUT the writer expresses himself very skillfully, the plot is highly entertaining, and the characters are very, very well developed. The world of the future is also very believable. I can see why this won a Hugo Award. Even non-Sci Fi readers will love this. Literature wise, it's one of the very best novels I've read, any genre, ever. This is a work of literature first."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As far as modern fiction goes the Hyperion Cantos is tops. Each story stands alone and fills is place in the overall plot arc perfectly. I will never stop recommending this series, or Dan Simmons."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I just finished Hyperion and was amazed. I've read one other book by Dan Simmons - The Terror, which I absolutely loved - and I'm going through the rest of his books, starting with this one. The most powerful story has to be The Scholar's Tale - I was reading it during my lunch hour and had to choke back tears."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As others have noted: if you start reading Hyperion, prepare to be invested for the long haul. While the four novels span multiple centuries and star systems, they are all intricately connected and one cannot understand the tale without reading them all. Details and accounts from the first story--Hyperion, the subject of this review--have startling implications for the later stories, and welcome the reader into a wonderfully lush universe full of captivating and complicated characters.The Shrike pilgrimage forms the context for this novel, and it is the mysteriously omnipotent and omnipresent god-like Shrike that creates the tension and suspense that draws the reader in as we eagerly follow the travelers' quest with equal measure of anticipation and trepidation. Simmons does a masterful job of allowing the reader only brief \\"glimpses\\" into the character and nature of the Shrike, but what few glimpses we get are truly and utterly terrifying. Yet, it is the pilgrims' tales that drive the story. Through these stories, we gradually gain insight into the decadent yet decaying Hegemony. Technologically brilliant yet spiritually void and aimless, the Hegemony is clearly poised on the brink of collapse similar to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Most importantly, we gain insight into the pilgrims' histories, motivations, strengths, and moral flaws--all of which play heavily into the story as it unfolds over the course of the four novels.Hyperion ends with a startling revelation from the enigmatic Consul (who serves as this novel's narrator of sorts) and a cliff-hanger that will leave the reader scrambling to get his or her hands on the next book in the series--the Fall of Hyperion. Simmons shows excellent mastery and confidence in leisurely spinning a tale full of complexity and depth that sets the stage for a beautifully engaging series. The Hyperion Cantos is widely regarded as one of the best series in the history of science fiction, and this first novel provides support for that sentiment by getting the series off to the right start."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Although not a book for everyone, if you like a mix epic sci-fi, a little literary prose, and some good old fashioned Star Wars-like plotting, you will love this book.I read Hyperion back when it was released, and recently came back to re-read it and complete the series with Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion. Simmons creates a world that one can easily be lost in--I read nothing else until I had completed the whole series. He must have had a blast creating it!!!This is not your average dungeons and dragons style sci-fi/fantasy. Simmons gives us a world that is all too real, and a future that is all too possible. A beautiful book, and series!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I would like to highly recommend this book for anyone with any imagination that likes science fiction or just loves books in general. This is one of the best books I have ever read from any genre. All 6 travelers tales are very intriguing, especially the Consuls, it was my favorite, and the Shrike is truly a horror/mystery of mythical proportions. I absolutely cannot wait to read The Fall of Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the best science fiction books I ever had a pleasure to read. Dan Simmons has a talent for presenting a reader with full scale of experience. A true masterpiece. As a result I had many sleepless nights while glued to the pages of this wonderful space opera. The sequels are even better. Read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"For those who haven't read this, keep in mind that this is a two part series (well, technically four, but the last two take place some time after Fall of Hyperion).Hyperion is a backwater world which stands out for two reasons: the Time Tombs--structures that move backwards in time--and the Shrike--a creature that guards the tombs whose language is death. Some worship the Shrike, others fear it, and others want it dead. The Ousters, a civilization that shuns the AIs (Artificial Intelligences) that run the web of the core worlds (a means of instantaneous transportation between planets) appears to be on the verge of invasion, starting with Hyperion. Five pilgrims journey to Hyperion and to solve the secret of the Time Tombs before the Ousters come.This book is largely a collection of short stories interspersed throughout the journey of these pilgrims. Each story is told by a pilgrim describing what drives them go on this suicide mission (pilgrims to the tombs invariably fall victim to the Shrike). All of this serves as a backdrop to the second book, Fall of Hyperion, which as of this writing I have yet to read.Dan Simmons is a superb writer, and that keeps the novel going. The stories he creates about these pilgrims (particularly the story of little Rachel) opens up many avenues of exploration in the story--none of which are explored here. Regardless, Simmons makes it entertaining. I give it four stars instead of five because the novel really is longer than it needs to be (100 pages could have been shaved off easily).I thought Illium was a better novel, but Hyperion has inspired me to read the sequel."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am currently in the grips of the Shrike after reading this book. Unfortunately, I was not one of the wise ones who read the other reviews which suggested having the sequel, FALL OF HYPERION, ready to go. After finishing HYPERION in 3 days, I am desperate to rush out and get its sequel so I can find out what happens to the characters that I'd grown to love.Everything everyone says is true. HYPERION is a well-written sci-fi book with technology, futuristic ideas, and moral questions that fire the brain cells the way I like my good sci-fi to!I stumbled through Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES in High School and cannot make a good comparison to it here. Apparently, author Dan Simmons took some inspiration from the classic poem.HYPERION succeeds because of the expert character development. These seven pilgrims have distinct personalities that grow on you. Simmons tells his tale (actually seven of them!) through flashback. But Simmons does it the old fashioned way: he tells us tales around the campfire! Each of the seven pilgrims has a reason for being on the journey to HYPERION. Therefore each gets his/her own space (i.e. &quot;The Soldier's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Priest's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Detective's Tale&quot;) As you get further into the book, some of the tales intersect, revealing the deeper mysteries of the story.Simmons also explores time, which is such a fun sci-fi genre to mess with. A particularly moving Tale involves aging backward.Well, I have to cut this short -- I must rush to the bookstore to buy the second book. I hope you all feel the same as me after you read HYPERION!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons created a masterpiece of literature in writing Hyperion. The book brings together seven pilgrims, who make the journey to the planet Hyperion in order to come face to face with the notorious and god-like Shrike. Each of the pilgrims has his/her own reason for being on the trip, and Simmons allows each pilgrim to tell his tale in his/her own style. It is the diversity of this story telling that makes it clear Simmons is a master of literature.Slowly but surely, the reader begins to tie elements of the stories together, neatly woven to give you pieces of the puzzle, without giving away the answer. It is part of the beauty, and part of my sheer frustration, that the story really does not have an ending - rather the book finishes when the pilgrims reach their initial goal, which is to find the Shrike and the Tombs.Once there, the question is, now what? Each pilgrim had a reason for coming, but how will they solve their individual dilemnas; what do they think the Shrike can (if he will) do about it; and most of all, why is Hyperion of such pertinent interest to the CEO of the entire Galaxy - or at least the planets that are connected to the web of technology.The answers, like the book and its sequel, are complex. You have to read Fall of Hyperion for a satisfying conclusion. Nevertheless, the sheer beauty of this literature is astounding and deserves more than five stars."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"After reading all the other reviews on this excellent and frustrating novel, I tried to think of anything I could add that hadn't already been said. Although I am probably repeating someone else's words anyway, it is this: you will be sorry if you never experienced the fantastic worlds therein.Hyperion is but one world in the midst of a gorgeous mess of a universe conceived by Dan Simmons. The plot, which roughly mirrors The Canterbury Tales' format, involves the telling of personal stories from the points of views of six pilgrims visiting Hyperion. Each knows that there is a probable chance that he will die without ever having his request granted by the Shrike, a menacing creature/machine which seems to exist for no other purpose than to randomly murder people on Hyperion and which can travel through time and space masterfully well. As the pilgrims' tales unfold, information about this future Hegemony of human planets and the circumstances surrounding it starts to leak out and simultaneously reels the reader in. Frankly, I was sorry to leave Simmons' seductive world-building more than the characters themselves.I purposely did not read the Fall of Hyperion sequel, which many others say is necessary to understand Hyperion's events, because I wanted to review this as a stand alone novel. This can be a very confusing book without those latter reveleations, but it stands well indeed. Read it if you are more than a little adventurous and enjoy a satisfying mystery with your sci fi action."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is written in an unconventional format, though we all know its based on Canterbury Tales. But to say &quot;its been done before&quot; is like saying a new epic poem (a la Odyssey) has been done before. So what, nothing is original - its all in the exposition.And what a great exposition this is! Simmons has quite a lyrical talent in describing environs.You can close your eyes and literally see the lapis lazuli skies and the waves of the verdant Sea of Grass. The Hyperion universe is connected by AI created-farcaster &quot;portals&quot; that take citizens to a planet of mile high Sequoia-esque trees, a massive ocean world, the Hegemony's military central on Mars, or a sprawling Foundation-like metropolis planet.From these worlds, six people were chosen to make a pilgrimage to the Shrike Temple on Hyperion. The Time tombs surrounding the Shrike have started acting anamalously and the Hegemony is on the brink of war with another human faction - the Ousters who have their own interest in the Shrike and Hyperion. The nebulous Shrike creature is revered as the Lord of Pain and feared as a grotesque monster. All of the pilgrims have encountered it before... and survived. Through their voyage to the temple, the pilgrims share with each other their stories and try to figure out underlying connection they all have to the Shrike.The individual stories are all poignant, my favorite being &quot;The Priest's Tale&quot; and second to that the &quot;The Scholar's Tale&quot;. Each pilgrim is an archetype of his/her profession: the honorable and brave soldier, flighty poet, compassionate scholar, faithful priest, strong detective, etc. Initially they seemed like stereotypes, but Simmons did a good job of fleshing them out as invidividuals by playing them off of each other's personality quirks. I found the poet's turret's like syndrome hilarious! You'll find that each story teaches you a lesson about humanity.The book is not 100% perfect. The Captain mysteriously vanishes with no apparent plot value. I found the Detective's and Consul's tales very weak. You know nil about the Ousters other than that they are barbarians and they want Hyperion too. The book has no main plot beyond the pilgrims telling each other tales but obviously the point of the book wasn't to be a &quot;beginning-middle-end&quot; novel. Rather, if you take away the different planets, spaceships, and AIs, Hyperion is five intertwined beautifully written modern day fables and in the end, very much recommended!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I originally read this book when it first came out and was on the bargin bin heap. Simmons weaves a masterful story, but and it is a big but. He has taking great classical English Literature and re-written it. This is simple a space age re-write of Chaucers the Canterbury Tales. If you enjoy Scifi read this book it will expose you to one of the Great Literary works in the English Language. The Canterbury Tales!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion ranks among the best science fiction books I have ever read. It is written to be similar to The Canterbury Tales, I suspect, and it does a fantastic job establishing the universe of the book with every story told. The way it slowly reveals more and more about the situation regarding the Shrike and Hegemony society in general is masterfully written, and the story about Rachel&#8217;s Merlin sickness actually had me in tears. While some of the more adult parts of the book felt tacked-on and unnecessary, it was an enjoyable book, and I plan on reading the sequel.I would recommend this to any fan of epic tales and science fiction."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm writing this after reading the 2nd book also, so, looking back I can say that I enjoyed the characters here as well as the means of telling their stories. Taken by itself this was a good book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This one is a real page-turner, full of horrifying fun! All the main characters each tell their own story to build and build the suspense... great reading!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I like its' colorful metaphors, and the pacing is good. I like the comingeling of characters and the fact that one is a spy. 100 pages read out of about 320, and I still don;t know who that is."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is some of the best science fiction writing I have read recently.Simmons weaves together 6 stories, each of which is told in a somewhatconventional style. For instance, there is a classic action in spacestory, as well as an interplanetary noir detective story. Althoughthe styles are disparate they complement each other very well, andit becomes progressively clearer that each tale forms a different facet of a deeper,underlying story. As other reviewers have noted, it is best to purchase thisbook together with \\"Fall of Hyperion\\", as \\"Hyperion\\" does not reallyhave an ending, but rather forms the first part of a longer tale."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm not a sci-fi fan (not into all the technology), yet I found this book impossible to put down. I tried it because I liked Simmons' \\"Carrion Comfort,\\" and man, it blew me away. Immediately upon finishing this book, I started again from the beginning and re-read it, to make sure I understood everything that was going on (also because I didn't want to leave their world just yet!). In this first volume, each character in a group of pilgrims tells their own back story. The overall plotline doesn't advance much until the second book - but even so, the back stories are fascinating and diverse. Terrific storytelling!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have been reading Dan Simmons for nearly twenty years and having read everything he has published, I can say without remorse that Hyperion & it's twin The Fall Of Hyperion are not only two of Simmons' best novels, they are perhaps two of the best sci-Fi novels ever written. Whoa! I know. Them be fightin' words, but it's true. Hyperion is very dependant on it's twin as far as keeping the story together and winding everythintg up, and what an effort Simmons makes.There are so many genres of writing represented in the Hyperion Cantos (as Hyperion & The Fall Of Hyperion are known to Simmons' afficionados) that it staggers the mind. Horror, Science Fact, Science Fiction, Mystery.... pick one, they're all here. There are pockets of hardcore sci-fi that might turn some readers off, and I would usually be one of them, but somehow Simmons entrances me and I enjoy his quantum-physics ramblings.Altogether engrossing. If you read one Dan Simmons novel, take the time to read two. Hyperion & The Fall of Hyperion absolutely rock!Dig it!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I must have read this book at least four times in the last ten years. It's just that good. The characters, the SF, the environment, the mystery... This book has it all. If you're going to read this, you should read the Fall of Hyperion as well.The mystery of the shrike and what all of the passengers are there for really makes this great fiction. Not to mention, Simmon's paints such a vivid future world that is plausible. Buy this book!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is an epic work, the first part in a tremendous story spanning time, the stars, and three additional works by Dan Simmons. The story follows seven pilgrims on the last pilgrimage to see a creature which could be both the bringer of mankind's doom and a man-made god. A massive interstellar war is about to break out between the Hegemony of Man and the Ousters, man's outcast descendants. The key to everything lies with these seven pilgrims on their way to see the legendary Shrike of Hyperion.The story is told in a Canterbury Tales fashion, with each pilgrim sharing his or her story. From the utter horror of the Priest's Story to the decadence and madness of the Poet's Story, each tale will enchant you, draw you in, and immerse you in the life of a character as real as any you'd meet on the street today. One of the most impressive features of this book is that it does science fiction well. A book that gets hung up on the science of the story often loses something. Better sci-fi does not explain, and instead just assumes that the technology works. That way, nothing gets lost from the character development and the story.The only \\"flaw\\" with this book is that it is not finished, at all, by the end. There is an entire second book, and reading that second book is necessary to know what finally happens. Readers beware: if you read Hyperion without its sequel, The Fall of Hyperion, ready to go, then you will be left in agony until you can read it too.This book is a phenomenal work of literature. Reading it will make you think about life, God, religion, technology, the Apocalypse, and more. What more could be asked of a book?"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"_Hyperion_ was a really fun read. I didn't know what to expect, but it was much more of a character study of six of the pilgrims much more than an action book, although there certainly was enough of that to keep one interested. It's divided up into six different novellas, with each of the different characters telling their story of why they've been selected for this final pilgrimage to the Time Tombs.At first, _Hyperion_ felt incredibly familiar to me, even though this was my first time with it. The reason that it is so familiar is because Simmons pays quite a bit of homage to several prominent literary artists. Hyperion's format is strongly reminiscent of Chaucer's The Cantebury Tales, but on an alien planet, of course. John Keats, author of the original (and unfinished) epic poem, _Hyperion_, plays a pretty large role. The capital of the planet is named after him and one of the characters has a very special relationship with Keats.There is quite a bit of language in _Hyperion_, which I found a bit disappointing, but overall I think the book is great and really presents some very interesting ideas about time travel, religion, politics, and literature (there's also a nice tip of the hat to Norse mythology). I'm highly looking forward to getting my grubby little hands on the rest of the series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Seven people set out on a pilgrimage. On the way, to pass the time and get to know each other, they tell their stories. Sound familiar? The same basic premise that worked for Geoffrey Chaucer is here used to great effect to reveal a far future society.Their intended destination is the \\"Time Tombs.\\" These mysterious and ancient structures are surrounded by odd entropic effects that are sweeping the tombs backward in time. A mythic creature, called the Shrike, is associated with the structures. By historical precedent, a \\"successful\\" pilgrimage will end at the Time Tombs with an encounter with the Shrike. At that point, the Shrike will kill all but one member of the group - and to the one survivor it will grant a wish. As you can imagine, each member of the group has deep and personal reasons for participating in such a suicidal expedition.The potential downside of using the Canterbury Tales as a pattern for constructing a book is that it could degenerate into a series of short stories. However, the author took great care to tie each story into the present situation. The first few stories reveal facts about the planet and what little is known about the Time Tombs and the Shrike. The last few tie the planet into the galactic society and the present crisis that is brewing. The author does an outstanding job of hooking readers with engrossing, personal stories, even as it becomes increasingly clear that he is gradually widening the scope to see all the social, political, and historical ripples converging on this moment.If the book were a movie, it would be rated a hard R for sex and violence, though it is never gratuitous. Each violent scene is necessary to understand the horror that drives that pilgrim. Each sex scene represents an oasis of solace that the pilgrim is striving to recapture. Nevertheless, the same scenes that reveal how high the stakes are for the pilgrims may also make it overwhelming for younger readers."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Hyperion\\" by Dan Simmons is part one of a two part series. Each book, though sharing the same story arc, is quite different in form. In \\"Hyperion\\" we have a sort of futurist \\"Cantebury Tales\\" where several travelers share their stories to each other as they travel to an outer planet called Hyperion. It is on this planet that they are destined to meet the Shrike, an entity that is worshipped on some planets and feared on others. All who pilgrim to this creature risk death, but each also has the chance at salvation. Legend has it that the Shrike grants one a wish, the others all die.In this first book we are introduced to the last of the Shrike pilgrims the poet, the father, the Consul, the priest, the detective, and the general. The book is divided up into chapters describing their stories. Some are better than others but this book would be great alone just for the story of Sol the father.Like other Dan Simmon's books this is not always an easy read. Simmon's does not write down to his audience. There may be tiny parts of this book that you just don't get. Some of those answers come in the second book, some you just have to figure out on your own. If you've already read the book I recommend a second read. I am sure you'll get even more out of it. Be forewarned, this book ends on some cliff hangers, be prepared to read \\"Fall of Hyperion\\"."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is extraordinary science fiction. Dan Simmons hasn't just created an entire world, he's created an entire galaxy of fascinating worlds. These worlds reflect the facets of humanity, and some of the images he creates are so beautiful that you wish they were real, such as the motile isles of Maui-Covenant and their dolphin herders.Beyond that, he has the confidence to leave much of the description to his readers' imagination, and he profoundly respects his readers' intelligence. The Shrike and the powers around are a sort of MacGuffin in this book, peripheral to the motives and stories of the six pilgrims who tell their tales. But the Shrike becomes much more prevalent in \\"Fall of Hyperion\\".I would echo the previous reviewer who said to have \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" ready; it definitely is a continuation of this story. I didn't have it, and it took me about a month to get it in order to finally resolve the stories of these characters in whom I had become so invested.This is one of the best books I've ever read, and stands out in the field of SF for being good fiction -- in my opinion, it stands against any other genre."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has created a masterpiece that is an outstanding example of science fiction and will be for years to come. Hyperion's plot is styled in the same way as Isaac Asimov's I, Robot, in that it is comprised of several individual stories that come together to form the plot. Although this makes the novel slightly more difficult to read, it enhances the reading experience. The author creates believable but very intriguing personae to be the seven pilgrims to the mythical monster, the Shrike. These range from the former Consul to the world of Hyperion to a retired FORCE colonel to a Roman Catholic monk. The stories all help to explain the particular character's actions, thoughts, and personality. Simmons has created a future not too similar to our world today, but not overly different either. He shows that sometime in the future, we will design artificial intelligence that is similar to our own. In conclusion, this Hugo Award winner has all the qualities needed to become a literary classic."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I first read this book in college, and couldn't put it down. Coming back to it years later (in audiobook form this time), I'm just as absorbed.Hyperion is space opera in its peak form, with vivid writing, well-realized characters, a futuristic universe that's both imaginative and believable, and a story that pulses with mystery. Unlike most science fiction, it's also a consciously literary-minded novel, referencing works ranging from the poetry of Keats to the medieval Canterbury Tales. Anyone who's had to read the latter in high school will recognize Simmons' inspired re-imagining, in which seven travelers from very different walks of life share their personal tales with one another as they make their way on a pilgrimage towards an enigmatic alien temple and its dark, mysterious inhabitant, the Shrike. Then there are numerous nods to other works of science fiction, from Poulson to Gibson. All the thematic connections help Hyperion feel like a work somehow bigger than itself.To be fair, Simmons sometimes gets a little too obvious with the name-dropping, which led to a bit of eye-rolling on my part, but Hyperion is still compulsively readable. The first two \\"tales\\", by the priest and soldier respectively, are absolute page-turners. If you aren't drawn into the story of Father Dure's mission to the descendants of some lost colonists, who have become a little odd during the intervening centuries, then science fiction might not be for you, The Bukowski-in-space poet's tale and the haunting scholar's tale, have less typical science fiction plots, but were (I thought) just as good. The remaining tales, while not quite as memorable in their own right, serve to transition from the past to the larger story's \\"present\\". Simmons does a masterful job of gradually revealing his universe, each tale focusing in on one aspect of it, while offering more depth or new angles on what we've learned from previous tales. It's a textbook example of how to set up a complex world and its backstory without a lot of expository babble.It should be noted that Hyperion is really the first half of a larger work, which happens to be split into two novels. There's barely an ending here, and if you want to find out how all the various plot threads are resolved, you'll have to read the second book of the pair, The Fall of Hyperion. I didn't think that book was quite as good -- as often happens in science fiction, a compelling setup doesn't imply an equally satisfying resolution. But Hyperion itself is so imaginative, it's worth a read.As to the audiobook experience, I found the use of different voice actors to play different characters a little distracting, notably the \\"Darth Vader\\" voice of one guy, but most of them did a pretty decent job. I particularly liked the boozy, gravelly voice of the actor who played the poet."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons work is something unique. I was never this much affected by a story and it's characters. I red this book twice in German last year and bought it in English - both versions are superior written. It outracing major Science Fiction Novels in my opinion, probably on one level as Star Wars (but you can't really compare these two). I wish he would write another Novel, based on his concept of the Universe."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am a pretty discerning reader. I mainly read classics, but I can enjoy a good Stephen King novel as well.I haven't read much science fiction, just the greatest-hits like \\"Dune\\".

I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good yarn."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Finished it over a month ago, and I've read three decent sci-fi books since... but I can't stop thinking about Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"An INCREDIBLE masterpiece that is the modern tour-de-force on the human condition, reminiscent of Chaucer's masterpiece of the same feather. Raw, deep, fleshed out characters that grip your soul and mind, never once letting go (though at times, you may wish it would). This is NOT a book for the simple minded or unintelligent; the stories told by the travelers are detailed and complex, interweaving each other and giving definition to a future where mankind has ascended like gods only to fall in hubris and shame. It pays true homage to the Keats poem of the same name and represents it in a grand story of humanity's impact on the universe and itself. A true masterpiece worthy of its numerous awards, this book will not disappoint the discerning reader."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'll put this very simply. This book made me glad that I know how to \\"read.\\" The Fall is on my list. But in terms of overall story, suspense, revelation, imagination, twists, vision, poetry, characterization, mystery, political intrigue, sci-fi mastery, weirdness, humor, perfection of style, this book is a masterpiece.

Personally I was not satisfied to read only one book, but have read them all twice. The universe created by Simmons is complex and captivating as are the people inhabiting it.

The characters, the plot and the intensity make it a must read not just for Sci-Fi buffs but for any Fiction reader. Dan Simmons has as big of a surprise in the end as did Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. This series touches on all aspects of humanity in seven characters lifetimes through a plethora of worlds."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Most importantly, understand that this is NOT a complete story in itself. It is the first book in a series, and it ends very, very abruptly. This was my only problem with it, though a big problem. I've been an avid reader of scifi since I was in elementary school, and I can definitely say this was one of the best I've ever read. The writing itself was superb: clever and often humorous. The plotting could serve as a textbook for a novel-writing course, perfectly planned and executed. The characters were varied and reasonably believable. The author's imagination was incredible. He came up with worlds, societies, and situations that were mind-boggling. By the time I was 90% of the way through the book, I was ready to pronounce it perhaps the best novel I'd ever read. Then it stopped. Dead. It just ended. None of the myteries were solved or explained. None of the questions were answered. It felt like the author had been tragically killed, and the publisher just went with what was finished of the manuscript. So be prepared."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In 'Hyperion', we are introduced to seven pilgrims making their way to see the Shrike, also known as the Lord of Pain. Each has an intensely personal reason for making this pilgrimage. Together, they may be able to stop the entire galaxy from erupting in interstellar war.The book primarily consists of the tales of the pilgrims, as they explain to their fellow travellers why they were chosen to go. All of the stories are fascinating; two of them are utterly unforgettable. As their stories unfold, we get a view of the galaxy as a whole and their corner of the galaxy in particular.All told, the book is extremely well-written. The individual tales of the travellers could easily have been separate novellas. In between the tales of the travellers, the story progresses naturally. The story ends, leaving you hanging. Do the pilgrims meet the Shrike? Will any of them survive?I don't know the answer to this question yet, as I haven't read the next book in the series. I am extremely glad that the person who gave me this book gave me all four books in the series, instead of leaving me to have to wait to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the first in a series of four, the next three being \\"Fall of Hyperion\\", \\"Endymion\\", and \\"Rise of Endymion\\". At this time I've only read Hyperion and it's difficult to review because it ends without any real closure. But after nearly 500 pages of wonderful science fiction, I think it was an appropriate place to break the series. Since I don't know how the story turns out, my rating is based on the quality of the narrative so far.The setting is around a thousand years in the future from our time. Humankind has settled on hundreds of worlds, most of which are part of a powerful empire called the Hegemony. Instantaneous travel between many of the worlds is possible thanks to a technology known as \\"farcasting\\". These portals are developed and controlled by ultra-powerful computers who have formed their own governing entity called the Technocore, which cooperates with the Hegemony but is independent of it. And then there are the Ousters, former human beings who have evolved physically to adapt to zero-g enviroments. The Ousters were originally a faction of humans who refused to be ruled by the Hegemony. The Hegemony allowed them to go settle their own worlds.The strangest planet discovered so far is Hyperion. The Technocore is adamantly against installing a farcaster on Hyperion, due to the enigmatic presence there of structures called Time Tombs that are actually flowing backward in time within anti-entropic fields! Due to the lack of a farcaster, access to Hyperion is limited to expensive conventional space travel. Both the Hegemony and Technocore are completely baffled by these fields around the Time Tombs. Who created them? Why? And what's the nature of the dangerous creature called the Shrike who seems not to be affected by the fields and who takes people's lives for reasons of his own?There is evidence that the Time Tombs may reveal their secrets soon. The Ousters also are very interested in the contents of the mysterious structures and are threatening war with the Hegemony over control of the planet. It's on the eve of this momentous war that seven pilgrims from various parts of the Hegemony set out for Hyperion. Each pilgrim has a compelling reason for visiting the Shrike and carries a desperate hope that his/ her prayers will be answered.The bulk of the novel consists of independent narratives by six of the pilgrims. Each reveals their reasons for coming to Hyperion and it is through their stories that we become familiar with the marvelously imaginative universe that Simmons has constructed. Tons of new concepts and ideas are presented and developed. The quality of the writing is superb. Simmons's pen is versatile: he switches from action to religion to poetry without missing a beat. The pilgrims are a priest, a soldier, a poet, a scholar, a starship captain, a detective, and a diplomat. Also note that this is a mature book for adults: it has a fair amount of sex and violence.Highly recommended for science fiction readers! And for anyone who likes to test their powers of imagination."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":".Whereas typical writers introduce, fill in, and conclude their stories, Simmons' Hyperion books just start and then slowly end. This, to me, is the most natural and welcoming way any story can be written. Nevermind all that self-conscious structuring; you'll see none of that here. That's not to say that there isn't structure in Simmons' books. He structures, alright, but he does it for a reason..In the Hyperion series (for the record, the order of the series is: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion) you'll find many of the elements that make any literary work spectacular - parallels, symbolism, empathy, historical references, foreshadowing (as much as there is unpredictability), openmindedness, etc...You'll come across countless instances where Simmons' biases as a writer shine through in bold statements - and then you'll watch him approach and unravel these statements from opposing perspectives. Few of the underlying statements Simmons makes are not thoroughly analyzed and criticized. If any. The only possible exception I can think of is Simmons' recurring usage of the concept of love. And I must say, he does some marvelous things with it....You won't see just one lengthy, drawn-out climax in this book - rather, the entire book is a series of delightful encounters, some profound and some delicate. You'll be shocked at a tragic or wondrous turn of event, or you'll be in awe at the clarity of a particular description, or you'll find yourself nodding, smiling, and murmering crude names to the conniving Simmons as loose ends tie themselves up before your unsuspecting eyes..Don't expect to fly through this book (why is that deemed a good thing anyway?). Expect to savor every last detail, re-reading entire chapters if you must. Are you a wine-drinker with an imagination? The Hyperion series is the perfect read for you. Simmons' mastery of language, understanding of human nature, and confidence as a writer place him far, far ahead of nearly all (if not all) of today's other authors..Dan Simmons is now my favorite writer. Orson Scott Card takes second."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"First off, like others have said, this needs to be read with its follow on novel &quot;Fall of Hyperion,&quot; it's really one long story published in two seperate novels. Hyperion is a tale of a group of intersteller travelers on a pilgrimage to the planet Hyperion. The story then brakes into a sort of &quot;science fiction&quot; Canterberry Tales. Each traveller must relate his or her own story of why they are on the pilgrimage. These tales could have apeared in sci-fi magazines as seperate stories, they are all that good. The charatcters all come to life through Simmons' clear storytelling. It is very well written and contains enough action to keep the story moving. I highly reccomend readers get all four books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are two of the most stunning books I've ever read in any genre. In fact, I thought that Fall of Hyperion was poorly paced--half of the book deals with events I was hoping to see at the end of the first book--and I STILL think these are two of the best books I've ever read. Normally, a good book might have great writing, plotlines, characters, themes, or concepts, but even above-average books rarely excell in all of these categories. Hyperion and its sequel do. It's going to be hard for me to read many other science fiction authors after this.Now I'm off to read Endymion...."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Travelers, well met- each with an agenda; each with a tale to tell-... So much of classic literature begins in such a way. Put 1200 years between Geoffrey Chaucers' and Dan Simmons' narrator's , tweak the political intrigues of the eras, and change the names of the guilty to misdirect the innocent... Well, there it is. Except it most definitely is NOT. The core of humanity itself has undergone a root transformation in HYPERION. The masters of fate are no longer the Priests of Rome, but the Technocore..(singular, plural, plurosingular?) The Hegemony of Man has sold itself out for a set of calculations to divine the future. The catch?.. The sellers have to do all the work to destroy themselves! Oh, they don't know this even though the final blow is coming without stealth. The Hegemony is warring with a bunch of radicals called &quot;Ousters&quot; and each blow is being looked over Olympus-like by the AI Technocore. The Technocore is itself fragmented into groups that favor the eradication of Man or the preservation of the status quo, or a wait-and see attitude. The tales and those who tell them make the best of this work. The four books together will, I'm sure weave all these plots together. It takes time my fellow readers! This will probably be the most personal of the set. I liked it, even though I have not a inkling what the Shrike may be, or how it's church arose. I can't wrap my head around the time tombs or some of the weird things in the travelers stories. I have a lot of respect for Dan Simmons. I like his work, his style and his mind. Anyone who can use L. Frank Baum like a guerrilla tactic...well... Now you gotta read it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"After reading a short story by Dan Simmons, which takes place after the Hyperion series, I had to get his first one Hyperion. The book has everything a reader of science fiction wants. The characters are interesting, each one telling a different tale as to why they are traveling to Hyperion. The backdrop of intergalactic war keeps everything exciting. The story is very complex so pay attention. This is not a book you can put down and get back to later. You won't want too though. Trying to sum up this book in a short review is hard, there is so much going on at once. The main story is about seven people making a pilgrimage to the planet Hyperion. A creature called the shrike awaits them. They must each ask the shrike for something, all will die but one. The existence of mankind is thought to hinge on the one who survives and his request. It may sound like fantasy, but this is hardcore science fiction. All the gadgets, spacecraft, weapons, and badguys are here. Some of the concepts and landscapes are incredible. Readers who like the artificial intelligence theories will love this as they play a central part in the story. Once you read this book, the others in the series will naturaly follow. If they could only make a movie out of this."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"When I start reading Hyperion 2 years ago, I couldn't finish the first 50 pages, but my friend told me to read it to the end, and I'm glad he did. This book is not easy to read but &quot;good things come to those who wait&quot;, and the result is a marvelous combination between a sci-fi novel and mystic concepts. Just Amazing."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I can honestly say it took me seven years to read this book. Not because it's extremely long--though at 482 pages it's not short either--or because it wasn't interesting--once I started reading I could hardly put it down. The problem was I originally bought the book, but before I could get around to reading it I moved and the book was in a box that was misplaced for four of those seven years. After the box was found I just didn't get around to reading it, in part because my reading tastes had changed away from sci-fi and in part because I worried this would be one of those dull \\"hard\\" science-fiction novels that spend more time on discussion of astrophysics than characters or story. I could not have been more wrong.Nothing much actually happens in the actual story of \\"Hyperion.\\" Seven different people from around the galaxy--known as the Hegemony of Man--are brought together by the mysterious Church of the Shrike for a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs on the backwater world of Hyperion. Other than what appears to be a murder of one pilgrim, there's not much else involved other than travel arrangements.The far more interesting part of the book are the stories within the stories. \\"Hyperion\\" is a sci-fi update of the classic \\"Canterbury Tales\\" where each of the six remaining pilgrims tells their story to the others of why they're on the pilgrimage. The Catholic priest Hoyt needs to get there before he dies from something that happened last time he was on the planet, the warrior Kassad needs to go there because of an encounter with a mysterious woman, the poet Silenius because the strange planet is the muse for his greatest work, the \\"Wandering Jew\\" Sol Weintaub to save his baby daughter, the detective Brawne to complete a case she took up, and the Consul, well, I won't spoil that surprise.The mystery of what everyone wants and what exactly is going on with the Time Tombs and the mysterious creature known as The Shrike makes it hard to put the book down even though not a lot is happening. There are hints of a destuctive war to come, but that's saved for the sequel. I was disappointed after seven years to find out I need to buy the sequel to find out what happens to the pilgrims; I know it won't take seven years to read that.My only real complaints are first some of the descriptions are a bit purple, especially the erotic encounter between Kassad and the mystery woman. Also, I wasn't happy with the order of the tales. Especially Weintraub's being in the middle of the book. It's such a great emotional tearjerker story that it should have been placed second-to-last in front of the Consul's nearly as emotional tearjerker story. Putting the hardboiled detective story of Brawne between the two takes away some of the flow. Still, maybe that was to keep with the form of \\"Canterbury Tales\\"; I wouldn't know because I've never read it.In any case, even if you're not an avid sci-fi reader this is still a great book. You'll probably be a little confused about what a \\"farcaster\\" or a \\"Hawking drive\\" or a \\"fatline\\" is or how a \\"time-debt\\" works, but so was I and I've read a bit of sci-fi. Beyond that, the stories and characters are so classic to appeal to every reader.That is all."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I guess it is hard to deny what an impact this novel has had upon my life - and yes, I mean that sincerely.I first read \\"Hyperion\\" when I was fresh out of high school, back in 1991. Young, impressionable, looking at a career in science, and very much a fan of science fiction. This, I guess you could say, was my first foray into Hard-SF, and what a \\"first foray\\" it was, too.I was amazed by the novel, but to say the least, nonplussed to learn I had to read yet ANOTHER book to even get into the real story just hinted at \\"Hyperion\\" (actually, there are four books here, not just two). I waited patiently for \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" to be released. Again, I was blown away. The characters, the plot, the shear strength of the author's imagination. So, at the tender age of 17, I had the book by which to judge all other books - Sci-Fi or otherwise.There are so many things RIGHT about this novel. Simmons' compassion for his characters, be they minor plebes or major contributors to the plot. He fleshes out these characters to the point where they jump off the page, live lives of their own.The plot? Convoluted, complex, and simply unlike any other HardSF novel I've read since, which is to say \\"stupendous\\".And the authors style itself, while not an easy read, is comfortable, literate, and definitely his own. Simmons' is a voice that I've yet to see topped by any other SF novelist, and that includes the greats like Silverberg, Asimov, Delany, and Clarke.If you've read the other reviews, you'll hear that \\"Hyperion\\" is sort of a Bocaccio's \\"The Decameron\\" set in space, or perhaps just another space opera. Yeah, \\"Hyperion\\" is both of those things, but so much more.The first novel in this series aims to do one thing, and one thing only - to lay the foundation for the next three books in the series. \\"Hyperion\\" introduces us to the place - humanity's domain spanning a web of hundreds of worlds, linked together by a technology that allows humans to move from world to world instantaneously. And the conflict - an offshoot of humanity, the evolved \\"Ousters\\", coming back from their journey into the far reaches of space, apparently to begin a war with us world-bound humans. Then there's the \\"technocore\\", the domain of the A.I.s, long seceded from Man's rule, and pursuing their own nefarious ends. The characters - six men and one woman, on a pilgrimage to the world of Hyperion, and planet so strange, wonderful, and complex, that even the Technocore knows not what to make of it. Their quest - while a potentially empire-crushing war with the Ousters rages above the planet, these pilgrims are to visit the enigmatic Shrike, a vengeful beast so steeped in mythology and lore as to be a god of all its own, to find out what humanity's place in the universe really is.I cannot recommend this book more highly, and I've read plenty of them. The only drawback? \\"Hyperion\\" is simply the first step in the journey. But if you are patient, and find it within yourself to read all four books in this series, you will be rewarded. If you often empathize with characters you read about, you will find yourself crying. And if you often wonder about God's place in man's future, you will find yourself comforted.If you can open yourself up to new ideas, you will find yourself amazed.Read this and the three other novels. And you too will have books with which to judge all other books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Ok, I admit I'm a SF/Fantasy fan but I don't usually go screaming it to the world due to the enormous volume of garbage that can be found within that genre. Every once in a (long) while an author comes along who has the imagination and talent to break the mold and actually write a compelling book which deserves to be read by SF and non SF fans alike. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot; are fine examples of this. &quot;Hyperion&quot; should be added to the list.Read it. It'll move you in ways you didn't think possible."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion contains some of the best storytelling of this or any other century. The book is layered with references to Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the poetry of John Keats. If you're not familiar with either, don't worry: Hyperion is one of the most intensely readable books you'll find. It's also the beginning of a four-part series. The Fall of Hyperion is just as good as Hyperion and I recommend you buy them both. However, the intensity, plotting and strength fall off in the final two books, Endymion and The Rise of Endymion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've loved Hyperion for years. As a librarian, I recommend it highly to any (adult, not teen) reader who wants an introduction to the SF genre. This book, written as a string of long narratives by six different characters, represents some of SF's best themes: life after death, messianic figures, interstellar warfare, time travel, interplanetary colonization, strange alien encounters, cyberpunk. It even crosses genres with the detective's story. The characters are all well-fleshed out and thoroughly engaging, even if they're not all entirely likeable. I thought Fall Of Hyperion was just as good and a definite must-read for anyone who liked Hyperion. The two Endymion books fell a little flat and I don't usually recommend those unless I have a hard-core Simmons reader in front of me."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has truly astounded me. Never before have I seen so many Science-Fiction themes interwoven in a single book. Truly told, before reading it I would have been convinced such a feat would be impossible without the majority of it being dedicated to mere description of the themes as opposed to actual plot development; Hyperion is not merely a guidebook to the wonders and threats of the future -- it is a tale that makes the future a living, breathing being as seen through the all-too-mortal eyes of very real characters.Simmon's characters demand the life he has given them. As I read I could almost sense their living breathing souls hovering at the periphery of each page; bearing themselves to me through the small portal of print in my hand. Indeed, even had there been no overlying plot, the character sketches Simmons provides have such rich detail and life that they almost need no cohesive bond between themselves.Yet this book -does- have an underlying story that itself is just as well conceived as even the characters involved!I've read Asimov, Heinlein, Brin, Herbert, Zelanzy, Niven and countless others. This work truly is among the finest (if not THE finest) Science Fiction tales ever conceived."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is one of the best science fiction works I have read, yet I think that it transcends genre and would appeal to those who are not fans of science fiction/fantasy. The stories (of the pilgrims) and characters are very well written and blend together well to make a thought provoking story that will tug at your imagination long after you have set the book down. Some readers will have to work to get through the technical aspects and &quot;get it,&quot; but it is well worth the effort. This is not a book that anyone should attempt to &quot;coast&quot; through.The older I get, the less I have found appealing in the SF&amp;F genre. If story plot and characters are not all above average, the SF&amp;F elements seem silly and leave me with a tinge of embarrassment to be reading the book. In fact, with the exception of Julian May's Intervention/Galatic Milieu series, I have not been a particular fan of the genre since I was a teenager. This novel is an exception. The! re are some dark elements in this work. Looking at some of the negative reviews of this book (which seem to be few but extreme), I think that if you cannot tolerate questions to your religious or moral beliefs, you may find it lacking. The characters are not all sweetness and light, but shades of grey. The future world as written is not particularly optimistic, but Mr. Simmons' descriptions of this world are filled with such beauty that it balances out the grim outlook and makes it a place you will gladly be immersed in. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've read hudreds of sci-fi books, short stories, etc. - all the Hugo and Nebula award winners ever since I came across Asimov's I, Robot compliation when I was twelve oh so many years ago now.Hyperion, and too a lesser degree, Fall of Hyperion, still stand as my my two all-time favorites in the genere. Everyone I recommend the series too, once they get past the admittedly difficult to grasp concepts in the beginning, it simply blown away by Hyperion.I would also recommend Asimov's Foundations Trilogy and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead (don't bother with the later books in these series - and even Dan's Simmons sequal to Endymion isn't nearly as good as the Hyperion cantos either.)Thanks, Dan, for such an amazing work!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a first rate sci-fi extravaganza as well as a tribute to the poet, John Keats. Throughout this novel (and also in The Fall of Hyperion, the sequel), homage is paid to this great (and tragically short-lived) english poet. From overt references such as the name of the planet Hyperion and the names of it's cities, there are also many characters in this novel based on acquaintances of the real life Keats (e.g. Joseph Severn, an artist friend of Keats &amp; Leigh Hunt (based on James Henry Leigh Hunt, a poet friend of Keats and Byron). Even Brawne Lamia, one of the pilgrims in this novel is, in a way, also a Keats creation (Lamia being the name of a book of poems Keats composed).An obviously well read and intelligent Dan Simmons has, IMHO, created literature with this work. I won't go into plot details as this has already been done very well by previous reviewers, but I will say that this novel is one of the most interesting &amp; moving I have read in the last 20 years (having recently become a proud father of a beautiful baby girl, I became misty-eyed on more than one occasion as the story of Sol &amp; Rachel unfolded).The only consolation I had when I (sadly) finished this novel was that I had The Fall of Hyperion (an excellent continuation of the tale started in Hyperion) right next to me."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The epic saga of Hyperion has something for everyreader.

Each story takes the reader to another worldand together they weave together a wonderfully detailedtapestry of the imaginary universe created by SimmonsFrom graphic horror to religious introspection tobook-noir detective adventure, each story offers somethingdifferent, while still contributing to the narrative asa whole. Everyone will find something to love.This book should be read in conjuction with itssequel, &quot;Fall of Hyperion&quot; which concludes the adventuresof the pilgrims, and ends with events of astounding scope.As usual, Simmons writes on many levels. If you wanta great, easy-to-read adventure, it is that. If you wanta deeply philosophical study of the relationship betweenGod and His creations, and between man and his creations,it is that.No matter how you look at it, you can't loose with&quot;Hyperion&quot;!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Though 'Hyperion' is dependent upon its sequel and ends with a tooth-grinding cliff-hanger, it is in its way self-contained. 'Hyperion' is centered on the six pilgrims' tales, their pasts, the terrible needs which drive them to confront what is almost certain death--or worse. Each of the tales is written in a unique style, and each introduces a new element to bind the story as a whole. All are wrenching, even disturbing in their intensity, in their focus on the deepest possible of human suffering.Do not read this book if you're looking for a light, fun read. In fact, forget it. This book defies all expectations, serves up horrors that were hitherto unimaginable if you are even remotely sane. Dan Simmons is in this book exploring a world that has lost its soul and is decaying by inches. To underscore that decay, the tales focus on the underpinnings of humanity--death, love, parenthood, art--and twist them into the most horrific contortions possible. The tale of the cruciform, for example, investigates with terrifying clarity the possibility of there being a fate far, far worse than death.As a result, the quest of each pilgrim has a greater significance than being merely a quest; in the empty world which Simmons creates, they are pioneers searching for a depth beyond the tested parameters of their rotting civilization. The atmosphere of the book is overshadowed by the horror of the Shrike, yet does not completely dim the hope of what might be.Steeped in the tangled sorrows that drive them, the characters do not always engender sympathy. I found Kassad shallow and difficult to relate to, and the explicit sex a turn-off. However, Martin Silenus, Sol Weintaub and the Consul--to name a few--are fully realized, complex characters, and even at their worst moments, still by their very existence encourage the reader to keep reading simply to learn their fates."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"An account of six tales from seven desparate travelers as they make a pilgrimage to Hyperion to seek out one the most terrifying monster ever created in fiction, the Shrike. They all have various reasons to risk their lives, and all hold the belief that whoever survives the Shrike, one prayer will be granted.All six stories (novellas in their own right) are brilliantly conceived, and every reader here has his or her own personal favorite. While the priest's tale is one of the most harrowing I've ever read, I was personally moved by the tale of Sol and Rachael. As a parent, I found this tale especially haunting. As another reviewer mentioned, I will not think of the words \\"...later alligator...'while crocodile...\\" in the same light ever again.This is science fiction told in a grand scale. It is sweeping in scope and Simmons' narrative is extremely imaginative, often fanciful, yet sometimes yawn inspiring. It is not an easy read. For those that know little or nothing about the poet, Keats (me included), much of the narrative may become ambiguous or boring. But despite that (or because of that), Simmons spins a masterful tale of the travelers and of the great war against the Hegmony and the Technocore.Unfortunately, \\"Hyperion\\" is only the first part of a two-part story, and ends unfinished. One has to purchase (unknowingly) \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" to complete the story. My suggestion would be to purchase them both at the same time and enjoy--it's well worth the money.Although this novel won't be to everyones' taste (what novel is?), I thought it to be one of the best novels I've read in many a year. Between 1 and 10, I give \\"Hyperion\\" a solid 8. Had the novels been double bound and sold as one (as they should have been), I would have given \\"Hyperion\\" an enthusiastic 9."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and the rest of the series is the best science fiction series yet written. I do not make this claim lightly. I have read alot of science fiction and the only books that I would say that come close are The Sparrow by Maria Doria Russell and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. Although Across the Sea of Suns and the rest of the Galactic Center series by Gregory Benford was another favorite.Hyperion is one planet in a large federation of planets which are at their political peak. This book is the story of 7 people picked to go on a pilgramage to the time tombs on Hyperion to see if they can figure out what is happening. The time tombs are guarded by a creature called the Shrike. The Srike can move forward and backward through time at will and seems to be invulnerable to any type of weapon. The 7 people are strangers to each other, but they have on common link, they have all encountered the Shrike before and been allowed to live. There is a legend and even a cult religion that has grown up around the Shrike for hundreds of years. It is said that the Shrike can grant any wish. Pilgrims that go searching for the Shrike must travel in groups of prime numbers or everyone will die. They must approach the time tombs on foot or everyone will die. According to legend, the Shrike somehow interviews everyone in the party if they have followed these rules and one person will have their wish granted and all the other party members will be killed. Also, the time tombs are moving backwards in time, and the fear is that once the time tombs stop that a whole army of tens of thousands of Shrikes will be unleashed. But this is just one thread in the vast tapestry of the story which grows in complexity with each book. What is happening on Hyperion is at the center of the collapse of this federation of thousands of planets that is on the brink of collapse. It is a facinating tale.Enjoy."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is truly incredible. As well as being a science fiction version of the Canterbury Tales, it also sets out a breathtaking and at the same time chilling vision of what humanity's future might be like. It creates a spectacular and wonderfully detailed world where citizens step through farcaster portals to have lunch on another planet, mysterious artificial intelligences scheme and plot, so-called 'barbarian' Ousters migrate between the stars, and a terrifying demon-machine called the Shrike stalks the area around a set of mysterious artifacts which appear to be travelling back in time. This world is populated with all sorts of fascinating characters and cultures, such as an artificial recreation of the poet Keats, a girl doomed to age backwards and a planet of peaceful environmentalists crushed for daring to resist modernisation.This first book of four, consisting almost exclusively of the stories told by seven pilgrims (a priest, a soldier, a poet, a scholar, a detective, a starship captain and a diplomat) as they travel across the planet Hyperion to meet the Shrike, is essentially a gigantic prologue which sets the scene for the tumultuous events of The Fall of Hyperion. It builds up a picture of the Hegemony (the 'established' human grouping) as what I take as being the author's idea of the inevitable product of today's Western civilisation, and establishes the background to the crisis that has brought the seven pilgrims together, which appears at first to be a simple war of aggression by the Ousters but turns out to have much deeper ramifications involving the AI TechnoCore, the Shrike and the future of humanity. The stories they tell also leave many unanswered questions and mysteries that will hopefully leave the reader running to find the second book. Each one is distinct - some horrific, some merely moving, all intriguing. I have to say that the Priest's Tale, the first to be told, will always be special because it left me thinking: 'Wow! Could this get any better?!' And best of all, because this is the first book, you don't have to grimace too much at the annoying continuity errors that increasingly crop up as the series progresses.As I said, the book leaves many questions to be answered in the next one. However, the greatest mystery of Hyperion is not the unknown purpose of the Shrike or the sinister plans of the Core. No, the greatest mystery of Hyperion is: WHY DOESN'T THE CONSUL HAVE A NAME?! ;-)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in the past year. Rather, it is the best first half of a book I have read, and if you are considering ordering it, I suggest you buy \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" at the same time, and save yourself the agonizing 5-9 day wait I am currently in the middle of.\\"Hyperion\\" is the story of the Shrike, a mysterious, murderous, unstoppable, and unknowable entity that seems to defy the laws of physics and probability. For hundreds of years it has roamed the human colony world of Hyperion, making victims of both the inhabitants and the suicide-pilgrams that the Cult of the Shrike send on annual pilgrimages. Now war is coming to Hyperion, and the final pilgrims are rushing to a grim rendezvous ahead of weapons that might well scour the planet clean.It is through the stories of these five pilgrims that we come to know the Shrike, and the human culture upon which it might soon be loosed. Each pilgrim tells his or her story in flashback, revealing their motives for undertaking a journey from which there is often no return. And each, we learn, has prior exposure to Hyperion, the Shrike, or the Time Temples where he dwells. One pilgrim is a father seeking a cure for a disease beyond human understanding. The others are a poet, a soldier, a private eye, an anarchist, but all of them have some connection to the monster they are seeking.Their individual stories also paint a brilliant living picture of the society in which they live; a society of instantaneous travel and limitless information. Their laws are made by a democracy so deep that any citizen who wishes to can participate in the most minute detail of governing, but managed by AIs so omnipotently powerful that their whims are more powerful than any legislation.Through the personal stories we learn not just about the pilgrims, but about the deeper mysteries surrounding the Shrike, and how those mysteries might well spell survival or disaster for the human race.There are few books that succeed so completely in creating a believable universe and populating it with compelling characters doing interesting things. \\"Hyperion\\" is such a book, and deserves every plaudit and praise that has come its way."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Not only am I not a science fiction fan, I am a science fiction outcast, having never read many (any?) of the \\"major\\" works of this genre of art. I know people who are, and they look at me sadly, with an elaborate mix of pity and revulsion, as I rattle off the list of books I have not read, and probably never will.But if you are in this same lamentable category as I am, Hyperion is a book you should read. It is one of the great marvels of literature in the past 20 years, and it will grab hold of you and whisk you into its vivid, frightening, exhilarating, mind bending world. This book will get under your skin and say there for a while after you have finished reading it. I remember, for it was a while ago, having very vivid dreams incorporating the book while I was reading it. I wondered if Simmons had somehow gotten inside my brain and was up to something in there.Plenty of people have given their view of the synopsis of the story(s), so I will no re-tell what has already been told. It may help if you have read some Keats, but it is not essential by any means. To me, it was a modern day Canterbury Tales, probably not just to me. And Simmons creates an entirely new and convincing universe, with its own intricate and convincing jargon and technology. Oh, and by the way, it is also a lot of fun to read..."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"There's so much good to say about this book, that I could never fit it all in, without completely boring and alienating anyone who may read this review. It simply must be read to be believed. I've personally read it six times, and am planning on reading it again.Coupled with its' sequel, The Fall of Hyperion, Dan Simmons has created a universe of complexity and wonder, which I enjoy enough to return to again and again.If you enjoy re-reading books, and find that you learn something new each time, then you'll love this book.The story takes place in the future, after the Big Mistake has decimated Earth, and driven its' survivors out to the stars. The resulting Community of Man, known as the Hegemony, wages a war with a rouge fleet of humanity, known as the Swarm. Aided by advanced computers,simply known as AI (Artificial Intelligence), whose computing power is such that they can predict the future with over 99.9999% accuracy, the Hegemony maintains a tenuous grip on its' collection of worlds, known as the Web.However, the AI's ability to predict the future (and thus assure the continued dominance of the Web) with 100% accuracy is hampered by the existence of the world known as Hyperion. Apparently, Hyperion serves as an unknown variable in any equation that the supercomputers develop. Further, there is the Shrike, a seemingly immortal, unstoppable killing machine whose designers and purpose are unknown, and whose very existence may(or may not)decide the outcome of the Web.The Hegemony decides to send a group of seven pilgrims to Hyperion, in an effort to solve its mysteries, and in doing so, continue the reign of the Hegemony, at the expense of the Swarm.Based partially on an unfinished poem by Eighteenth century English poet John Keats(which chronicled the cataclysmic battle between the Greek Gods and their predecessors, the Titans), and Modeled after Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the story unfolds with each pilgrim stating his/her reasons for going on the very dangerous journey. Along the way, the reader is drawn in to Simmons' world, as the secrets slowly begin to unravel.Regretfully, this clumsy attempt of mine berely scratches the surface of this wonderful and challenging novel.You simply must read it, and enjoy.Filled with metaphor, poetry, action, and intrigue, Hyperion is a fantastic, if difficult read; however, if you're willing to put your mind to work, the effort is very rewarding."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In my mind there are few science fiction novels, or any genre fiction for that matter, better than Hyperion.Dan Simmons, whose previous work had mainly been in the horror genre, focused on the idea of a frame story, an overriding story in which other stories are told (Canterbury Tales may be the most famous story of this type). Seven travelers all find themselves on the same journey and each tell the story that brought them to that point. And thus Simmons creates an incredible universe through the eyes of seven unique and well-crafted characters.Hyperion ranks with great science fiction creations of all time, from Asimov's Foundation to Heinlein's Lazarus Long or Herbert's Dune. The fiction is both character and idea driven. Simmons' storytelling abilities are also excellent - the tales he writes range from brutal and violent to beautiful and poignant.As previous reviewers have noted, please have Fall of Hyperion ready to go. It picks up where this one leaves off and you'll want to have it handy. The other two books in the series are also definitely worth reading. Too bad Simmons moved on to other genres of fiction. One can only hope he'll revisit the universe he created here."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Whether you read it alone, or as the beginning to the epic Cantos series, Hyperion is simply brilliant, and Dan Simmons should have every reason to be proud of it.The tale is of the seven pilgrims, off to face certain death at the will of the ever mysterious Shrike. As they progress further towards their final destination, each pilgrim shares with the others their pasts, discovering more about each other and learning more of themselves.Each tale is differently filled with equally fantastic settings and interesting characters, that are woven into an elaborate storyline with such detail and depth, that each tale could become a novel onto itself.There can't be too much said on the plot without revealing the really incredible ideas in this novel. So, that makes me having to write breifly on the many great points in the book. But one true thing for all, writing a novel about a world set 700 years into the future can't be seen as an easy task. Yet Simmons delivers it with such precise detail, it's hard to not envision this possible future.Truely one of the best Science-Fiction novels ever written (if not THE best, which I think it is)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've always put off reading Hyperion for some unknown reason. This year, I was accepted to Clarion West, where Simmons is going to be teaching, so I decided to pick up his most famous book in order to be able to approach the man with semi-intelligent conversation.I was amazed. The book is made up of six novella length stories told by character on a pilgrimage to the deadly Shrike. Like the Canterburry Tales, each character takes a turn telling his or her tale, and believe me, any one of these tales would be worth the price of the book all on its own. I won't go into any description of the tales because I don't want to spoil your enjoyment, but I can say that they are written in a variety of modes and styles that portray Dan Simmons's superb talents.Even more amazing, every tale is interconnected to the larger frame story: the pilgrimage. Each tale holds a vital clue to the pilgrims' future meeting with the Shrike.For careful readers, Hyperion holds references to major literary works of our world, including Pounds Cantos and Shakespeare (and I already mentioned Chaucer). This is a book that was not only worthy of the Hugo, but should have been considered for \\"literary\\" awards as well.One note of caution to those expecting a pat ending: the pilgrimage does not end in this book. You'll have to continue to Fall of Hyperion, as I'm going to do immediately. Simmons's work is so awe inspiring, so exquisite, that I'm both excited and intimidated to have him reading my own work this summer."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is mainly comprised of the tales told by each of the characters as they travel to the enigmatic planet of Hyperion, home of the fearsome Shrike, a god/demon who can manipulate time. Each of the tales is engrossing and very moving, however the larger tale of the pilgrimage to Hyperion in quest of the Shrike is unsatisfying because of the ambiguous non-ending which is an obvious ploy to get you to read the sequel. I believe that Hyperion should have had enough story to make it a stand alone novel, if that meant another 100 pages, then so be it. Because of the ending I deduct not one, but two stars since I feel it's a grave offense to the reader. Even so, I do recommend the novel for the original story and epic scale as well as the memorable characters."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I found Dan Simmon's Hyperion to be an entertaining, thought-provoking and compelling novel. The stories of each of the pilgrims were masterpieces of short fiction in their own right. Although I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan, I give it 4, rather than 5, stars as I found Simmons' writing to be at times over-descriptive and somehow lacking the true can-put-it-down momentum of a master storyteller. Although I am one to appreciate some ambiguity at the end of a novel, I felt like after all the build-up, Simmons owed us more at the end of the story than the obvious compulsion to turn to the next book in the series. With the right ending, I would have been left thinking about the many great themes in the work. Instead, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed. Nonetheless, I certainly look forward to continuing this series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Less than halfway through this book, I knew that I had found a new favorite Science Fiction author. Hyperion is absolutely breathtaking. It started off a little slow and confusing, but once the seven pilgrims started telling their tales, I was hooked. Each tale is somewhat of a novella in itself, but they are all related in that they deal with the world of Hyperion and the being known as the Shrike. Seldom have I come across a sci-fi book that touched me as deeply as this one did. It transcends the sci-fi stereotype; yes, there are aliens, yes, it takes place in the future, in space, but this is just the setting - the book is about seven human beings and their experiences. It is really just a prologue, setting the scene and introducing the mysteries to be solved. Make sure you have the sequels ready to start right when you finish, because I didn't, and it was torture!I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they are frequent readers of science fiction or just beginning to explore the genre."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book blew me away. I was looking for a light SF adventure and got so much more. Parts are hilarious and parts are so sad that you want to cry. This is of course partially because it is really a group of small stories told by individuals in the book. If you like thought provoking SF then this is for you."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It's one thing to know that a book is intended as the beginning of a two-parter. But shouldn't it work on its own, too? The first Star Wars trilogy was good without having to wait for Phantom Menace.This is the feeling I got from Hyperion. It was hundreds of pages of setup. Each pilgrim had his own story, and they were only loosely tied together by the pilgrimage idea. I think I would have been happier to present each story independently, and have the weaving take place within each story, rather than the mediocre trek across Hyperion and the poor premise of &quot;Let's each tell a story one night&quot; that we got instead.I feel like I just watched the first part of a To Be Continued movie.Mind you -- I'm reading Fall now and *loving* it. Much much better!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has created a marvelous feat in the first of the fours novels centred around the planet Hyperion. The novel plays a science fiction variation on the Canterbury Tales as the pilgrims in the story each relate their six individual stories, beginning with the priest's tale. This structure allows the reader to glimpse parts of the mystery of their quest with each story and watch the layers of narratives build up into a delightful structure. Along the way echoes of such divergent authors as Robert Heinlein, Raymond Chandler, Stephen King and William Gibson sound throughout the stories while the voice always remains in the able hands of the author. The theme of time is played with marvelously throughout the novel as it becomes, in a sense, another character. As the Canterbury Tales slides into the Wizard of Oz the book ends, but this reader eagerly looks forward to beginning the next part of the tale."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is one of those novels that I always knew I would \\"get around to one of these days\\", but never seemed to manage it. Well, I'm in the middle of managing it now (OK, more like 70% *smile*) and I'm surprised as just how much I'm enjoying it. I love the different voices of each story and slowly watching them be connected during the interludes. For me at least, each story has improved the overall book. I didn't enjoy the 1st story (of the Priest) until close to the end (I felt it dragged a bit), but the other stories have consistently held my attention. I was especially drawn to the Sol Weintraub story. Being a father myself, that one has (so far at least) had the most emotional impact for me.This book (and perhaps the rest of the series) is generally considered a Sci-Fi classic. And now that I've gotten as far as I have, I can honestly see why. I regret taking as long as I did to \\"getting around\\" to reading it, and I can honestly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story. If you're looking for a popcorn movie book (tons of action and things exploding), this one isn't it. This one is much more about character and thought. Most definitely worth the read. Looking forward to finishing it and continuing the series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book rules. Word of warning though, it leaves you on a huge cliffhanger. So if you are going to read it, do yourself a favor and invest in the next book as well. Great multi genre bending book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Just read this for the first time and I must say that I can't believe that I missed this one the first time it was out. Great read, the suspension of disbelief is well handled and the setting is epic in scope. Simmons lays out so many mysteries and questions that I was plowing through pages to find out what happened. The technology is weaved into the story and written about so naturally that is boils down to a great story of future humans struggling to understand their universe. Just a word of caution, go ahead and get \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" and have it ready. As soon as I finished this, I ordered the sequel up on the kindle and kept reading. This is really just part 1 of the story."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I do not recommend the purchase of Part I, Hyperion, without havingThe Fall of Hyperionalready in hand.Hyperion Cantos: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperioncombines both under one volume, which is fitting, as the publisher broke the epic in two due to length reasons. In short, 'Hyperion' is deliberately not the finished product. It cuts off right in the middle, without an end.The story-telling is reminiscent of the Canterbury tales, in that each of the seven pilgrims tell their stories on the way to a final confrontation with the enigmatic, murderous Shrike. Sort of like confronting a god of death. Oddly, I found the best analogy to the contents of the book itself lies in the first paragraph. Highly descriptive, with language that sounds intelligent yet gets in the way of the story.Within the first paragraph I was dictionary-bound. \\"Gymnosperms\\" are non flowering, seed bearing plants that botanists and scientists believe are an ancient \`evolutionary branch' of modern day flowering plants that evolved during a cooler and wetter era of Earth's history. There's a whole forest of them in paragraph one. Surviving \\"Gymnosperms\\" include Gingko Biloba, Hoop Pine, Bunya Pine, and Queensland Kauri, and those fossils of giant tree-ferns you see in museums. When I first encountered the word 'Gymnosperm' in the very first paragraph I thought of something weird involving reproduction, and the sex in the book is like that -- weird without much relevance to the main story. Now an author like Pratchett would make some sort of joke and let the reader know what a gymnosperm was; Simmons lets you figure it out yourself. Or not. The book is like that.Much like the 'Hyperion Cantos' (tale 3, the Poet's Tale) inside the Hyperion, I can picture Simmons' editor saying 'great stuff, but it won't sell'. And that's what happened, even if it won a Hugo. It is magnificent if you don't mind thinking about it and have a dictionary, but this is an opus as opposed to mere entertainment. Good story, provided you are in a receptive mood."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Set in a futuristic universe, Hyperion is a dark sci-fi horror novel filled with lots of action and drama. The Earth as long since been destroyed by some blunder and the rest humanity is connected by far-caster portals allowing instant travel from world to world.The book tells the stories of seven pilgrims as they travel to confront the mysterious and deadly Shrike on Hyperion. The world of Hyperion is a distant colonial outpost reachable only through faster than light travel and is under threat from an imminent invasion. The author paints a pretty grim picture of the lives of the seven pilgrims. Each has their own tale of suffering. In that way, the book can be a bit of a downer. It's not cheery reading but they are interesting stories. It sort of reminds me of the twilight zone or fatalistic tales where the unimaginable happens regularly.The book touches on some religious themes. At times, it seems more like fantasy than science fiction. If you like sci-fi horror in general then you'll probably like reading Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the first book in Dan Simmons' epic Hyperion Cantos tetralogy. In this opening tale, seven unique travelers are brought together on a journey, a pilgrimage to the distant and mysterious planet of Hyperion, where they will face the Time Tombs and perhaps the dreaded Shrike. The galaxy is on the brink of Armageddon, and the pilgrims hope to somehow save it, and ultimately find their destinies on Hyperion.Employing the structure of the Canterbury Tales, Simmons brings seven very different characters together. It is some centuries in the future, Planet Earth is no more, having been destroyed in a science experiment now known as the \\"Great Mistake.\\" But humanity has conquered the stars and traveled far throughout the galaxy. It is a great age, when one can skip across thousands of light years in the blink of an eye with the use of a Farcaster: a teleportation door that takes you where you want to go, created and developed by the AI TechnoCore.But the Ousters are coming. A distant alien civilization about which little is known, except that they are hostile and a grave threat. It could all end now. The important vantage point is the distant planet of Hyperion, not even a member of the Hegemony of Man, where there are the Time Tombs. These ancient tombs are shrouded in mystery and suspicion; all that remains of an ancient race known as the Shrike, but they may be the salvation that humanity has been waiting for. And now these seven travelers hope to somehow activate these Time Tombs and save civilization.Simmons begins the story in medias res, introducing the reader to these seven strangers in a world about which nothing is known, but he skillfully reveals everything through the minds, imaginations, and stories of these seven characters. There is Het Masteen, a member of the Templars, a tall and proud but quiet race who created and control the powerful Treeships that possess the Hawking Drive which is able to send ships across the stars at astonishing speeds; Masteen is the captain of the Yggdrasill, the ship that will take the pilgrims to Hyperion; he is also one of the pilgrims with his own unique story to tell. There is Father Lenar Hoyt, whose story is The Priest's Tale, about the Catholic world and existence of the parasite known as the cruciform which can reincarnate life. Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, a member of the FORCE military who is searching for a supernatural figure that has come to him many times in his dreams in The Soldier's Tale. Martin Silenus, in The Poet's Tale, tells of his life as a failed poet who nearly loses his life and then begins his opus that will make him remembered throughout the centuries.The Scholar's Tale from Sol Weintraub is the most moving story from the pilgrims as he recounts how his daughter, Rachel, was an archaeologist studying the Time Tombs and after a strange accident begins to grow younger each day. She returns to her family to live with them as she decreases in age, needing to have her story recounted to her each day as she no longer remembers. Eventually a short and easy version is made to be told by Sol each morning to her. Sol and his wife, Sarai, relive the raising of their daughter backwards through time. And now it is up to Sol to return to the Time Tombs with baby Rachel who is now just weeks old and will soon simply disappear.Tge Detective's Tale from Brawne Lamia is a noir tale of her job as a private eye with a client who is a cybrid: a cloned human with electronic implants controlled by the TechnoCore. Someone is trying to kill him and destroy his memory, and it's up to Lamia to figure out who is behind it all. In the final story, The Consul's Tale, as the Consul talks of his grandparents on the planet of Maui-Covenant which was once a paradise but when the first Farcaster was opened, became a tourist destination and its beauty was destroyed forever. The Consul also talks about his work as a secret agent for the Hegemony in infiltrating the Ousters.The book ends with the pilgrims finally reaching the Time Tombs. While the sequel, Fall of Hyperion, is the book which explains a lot more of the world and everything that eventually happens, there is a specialty about Hyperion, a uniqueness with it's original characters and their incredible stories. Simmons epic universe employs multiple forms of the science fiction genre, making it a complex and fascinating world in which most people would like to live in. In a way, Simmons has essentially rewritten the Canterbury Tales of the far future, with some incredible stories that stand out as moving novellas on their own, and a cast of characters readers won't soon forget.Originally written on May 5th 2008 Alex C.

This novel presents an interstellar Armaggedon five centuries from today that is started in the 19-20th century.Simmons like to mix the old with the futuristic and always manages to pull it off. The Pilgrims' stories are good but I didn't like that they were recounted in third person when the stories were told by the referred-to Pilgrim. A broad range of emotions are presented by each of the characters and the stories can dig deep if you think about their basic premises (rage, faithlessness, love, despair, unacceptance, patriotism). All in all a good book (there are three more in the series) however it is not for young readers. If it were a movie it would be classified R (violence, sex, strong language)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"HYPERION, along with ENDER's GAME, is considered by many to be the best science fiction novel of the last twenty years or so. I pretty much agree with this opinion. Dan Simmons is an extraorindarily intelligent writer, and he devotes a substantialy amount of his creative energy to building a future world that is both fascinating and believable. He is also a tremendous wordsmith, and this is one of the best written SF novels you will ever encounter.The novel is essentially a collection of six novellas, and you will most likely enjoy some of them more than others. Sol and Rachel's tale was my favorite, but all of the short tales have their merits. The genius of HYPERION is how Simmons is able to reveal important details about his world through these tales, without distracting from the story.HYPERION is not easy reading, but it's a complex, multi-layered tale for readers who enjoy fiction that is both challenging and thought-provoking. It ends on a unsatisfying cliffhanger, which will force you to read the next volume, FALL OF HYPERION, to achieve closure. In my judgment, it is well worth reading both books in this series.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I don't know exactly what it is about this story, but even many years after I've read it, I come back to it in my mind. The characters became real for me and I miss them, like I miss an old best friend from high school. I miss you hyperion. Please Mr. Simmons, come back and make another novel in this world...I beg you."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In 'Hyperion' Dan Simmons is a complex and layered novel. The story is largely composed of six tales, one told by each of the six travelers (ala Canterbury Tales) on the final pilgrimage to the mysterious Time Tombs of Hyperion, where the fate of humanity will be decided. In some ways 'Hyperion' feels like six separate stories rather than one complete story. Of the stories the best is the priests tale, the weakest is the consul's tale. As a whole the novel is dense and complex, filled with literary allusions but very interesting and compelling ideas. Unfortunately the novel ends very abruptly with many questions left unanswered. I am hoping these are resolved in the sequel, otherwise I will be very disappointed"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"An interesting, good read. I didn't find it predictable, or overly hokey. Simmons has a great imagination, a good sense of humor, and the ability to create believable characters. Warning: If you get 3/4 way through and decide you want to read the sequel, you better get it. Either that or get the Hyperion omnibus. This story leaves you with a real cliff-hanger.Most of this story consists of several characters explaining events of the past that lead them to their fate as pilgrims to Hyperion. It's kind of funny that long after the earth is dead, two people can identify a Yeats poem. I learned a lot about John Keats in this story too, the titles of the Hyperion quartet are taken from his poems. While all of this is quite odd, the character and plot development in this story is intriguing and enjoyable."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion alone is a great book that leaves you wanting more in the end. The worlds are amazing and some of the things that Dan Simmons did with the farcasters were wonderful. Alone this is not a complete story and can leave you a little upset, but once you join it with the other 3 novels and everything is revealed, well then you are left with something beyond spectacular!The Fall of Hyperion-Endymion-Rise of Endymion"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the best science-fiction books I've ever read.How the author merges with any one of the sixth pilgrims as their stories go is incomprehensible.It's almost supernatural. I don't know how Mr. Simmons deals with the real life, but when he writes he is a demi-god.Still the end of the book was a disappointment as leaving it open, I am now supposed to read the \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" implicitly."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"While I read this book I kept asking myself, when does the story start? Hyperion is the story of a group of pilgrims adventuring to the mystical Time Tombs. Every night another of them would tell the story of why they were there. This is a great premise, but not as a whole book. I found myself completely uninterested in the few smatterings of story between their tales. I found myself sometimes even skipping to the next persons story due to sheer boredom.While this book suffers as a standalone, it really shines as a 500 page proloque to Fall of Hyperion. Under normal situations I would have stopped with this series but a family member said that I should read Fall, even if just to understand. When read in succession, these two books have an amazing synergy that never ceases to amaze me. So if you plan to read this book, you'll want the other, so that you can dive into it ASAP."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm a big fan of science fiction, but I am a little picky about what I read, and judging from the cover it seemed like the book would revolve around a mechanical monster and a space war. While that's actually true, I'm extremely glad I didn't just dismiss this book, because it's absolutely wonderful, even moving. Each of the stories which makes up most of Hyperion are excellent by themselves; ranging from adventure, love, or a poignant tale about a father and daughter -- but combined with the other stories they weave together to make a larger theme and of course, lots of foreshadowing of things that will come up in the next book, Fall of Hyperion. Believe me, you will have to read this after finishing Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm a big fan of science fiction, but I am a little picky about what I read, and judging from the cover it seemed like the book would revolve around a mechanical monster and a space war.

It's complex &amp; compelling. If you like SciFi, you owe it to yourself to read this series. I enjoyed it to such an extent that the fourth book is the only hardback I've ever purchased for myself in over 30 years of book-buying (it wasn't out in paper yet &amp; I couldn't wait!). I felt books one &amp; three were incredible, but all four were worth reading.One word of advice: If you find yourself heavily involved in the first book, buy the second one in the series (_The Fall of Hyperion_) long before you finish book 1. _Hyperion_ should come with a warning label - it's really only the first half a book. You finished the last page and scream, &quot;WHAT! WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THIS TO ME! THEY CAN'T JUST _LEAVE_ IT LIKE THAT!&quot; Save yourself the frustration &amp; get them both."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"An amazing work: vivid, tantilizing, engrossing, macbre, fascinating...a journey I never expected and characters clarified in such colorful detail they leap from the page! The pilgrims and their individual tales create a compelling and addictive plotline that leads the reader by the nose (and I was lead willingly!). I highly recommend this work to any SF collection!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a great book, but it is slightly flawed in that it leaves you hanging in a big way at the end. The sequels eventually tie up all the loose ends, but the series loses some momentum along the way. I still enjoyed reading the whole series, but Hyperion is the highlight of a long trip."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If I were stuck on a desert island, and could only have one sci-fi novel with me, this would be it. It is endlessly fascinating, and easily the most literate science fiction I've ever read, with allusions both subtle and obvious to such books as The Canterbury Tales, Heart of Darkness, Beowulf, Henry V, et al. Don't pass this one up. Even though this is the beginning of a fascinating series (that in itself cannot be recommended highly enough), the first volume can stand alone as a pinnacle of contemporary fiction. The Hugo was never more duly awarded."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has written one of the best science fiction stories ever with Hyperion etc. The story resembles canterbury tales and grendel but then goes far beyond. It would be fair to compare it to a mindmeld of Stephen King, Shakespeare and William Gibson."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"this is by far my favorite sci/fi story(all four books included) every time i read it i get such a strong emotional attachment to the characters that when i'm done i'm left with a feeling of emptiness that there will be no more time with them till i decide to start reading it again(usually about a week later) no other book or story i've read has been able to do this. but if you continue to the third book from the first two, be warned there is about a three hundred year separration between the two. so there is a big difference between the halves of the story. i also heard there is a follow-up short story by dan simmons in the book horizons. i have yet to read this but that is because i ordered it and haven't gotton it yet."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Best Series of books written on the future of man kind. Don't argue they are"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever resd. It rivals the Ender's Game series and the Dune series for supremecy in the sci-fi realm. The only thing I dindn't like about this book was some of the stolen language, like Hegemon."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I don't understand people's complaints about the two books of the first story (Hyperion and Fall). Perhaps these people never bothered to read anything but science fiction and just don't understand the Keat's references. Perhaps they've watched too many movies and expect a happy ending (anybody seen John Carpenter's the Thing? There was no sequal!). Hyperion was never ment to end the story. So far it's FOUR books! Who reads the Once and Future King and gets upset at the end of the first book because the story isn't finished?Over all, these books have to be some of the finest literature published this decade. I found the characters to be enjoying (Han Solo was unsavory, but he was the best guy, it's called character). Their development throughout the books was increadible.The Universe created by Simmons is great! I can't stop reading these books. I have to know more! And as an athiest, his thoughts of God and the Ultimate Intellagence are the bbest thought out and clearest concept of higher evolution that I have ever read. His technology is advanced but grounded in current thought. And his understanding of historical periods (here the fall of the Roman Empire and in the Endymion books of the Middle Ages) is exemplary. The literary references are inviting, it's nice to read somebody who reads.I'm sorry for anybody who does not understand this book, but I give it my highest rating."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is without doubt one of the best books I have ever read. The plot is gripping, because even though it is not necessarily action packed (which nothing needs to be) it can still hold the reader's attention with brilliant writing, likable characters, and a great mystery, the Shrike. I'd like to see a review giving me one character with a better combination of chill and mystery than the Shrike, one of the best characters in the book. I liked most of the stories, my favorite one being the Consul's betrayls for Maui Covenant, and how he is then forced to do something as punishment... I won't give it away. The end left me rushing to &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; to see what would happen next! I don't understand the 1's and 2's that were given. Possibly too intellectual for them. The only reason I didn't give this book a 10 is because I don't give books 10's yet. When I'm about to croak I'll think of what books deserve 10's, but this is sure to be one of them. Not as full of action, and different kinds of character situations than &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; another one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In Hyperion, Johnny -- a ressurected John Keats -- thinks of Fanny when he makes love to Brawne Lamia. In reality, John Keats's sister's name is Fanny!Either Simmons didn't do his homework or he's implying incest. Hmm..."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have to admit I found this book to be a real mixed bag. It's important to understand that this is not a book in the traditional sence, it's more a collection of short stories blended togeather to form a story. The tales of the various characters vary quite a bit however still have the same sence of loss that each carries to Hyperion. I found some real brillance in Simmon's writing, I found some real annoyances as well. The story starts well, The Priest Tale is very enjoyable telling of how a missionary style character lives with natives for a time and comes to learn their secrets.The Soldier's tale is your traditional space opera shoot em up with lots of bangs and explosions. My favorite 2 were the Poet's and Scholar's tales. The wacked out long lived poet and the noble scholar who's daughter is caught in some kind of reverse aging syndrome were by far the best. On the down side the Detective and Consul's stories were mushy romance tales that would have made Mills & Boon proud and almost turned the entire book into a chick flick. The added fact that these 2 tales were back to back made me feel like I was reading a romance novel for a very long time.Hyperion is is much fantasy as it is sci-fi. The main group of characters on a quest to meet the ghastly monster at the the end, a critter made up of blades and glowing eyes that kills lots of people for no apparent reason. In fact an awful lot of things in Hyperion are not explained or given any background at all, only the characters are given decent page time, the universe itself is skipped over a very large amount. I'm not sure if I will go on with the series as Hyperion did not grab me that much, it was good, but it wasn't great."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Its a decent book, its just way too far fetched in a few instances. A giant tree with a force field around it is a space ship that flies around in space faster than light speed. A tree!! This book would have been a lot better if it would have left out the few really rediculous parts, because most of it was otherwise believable - there were just a few parts where I was shaking my head. I guess I'm just more into hard scifi - Asimov's Foundation series is still my favorite scifi of all time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Fabulous novel. One even the literary snob types might like, given the structure and all the Keats work.The novel has a Canterbury Tales type feel, as a group of men and women travelling to the important planet Hyperion tell their stories.Travel is instantaneous throughout the galaxy thanks to the TechnoCore, an AI group and their farcaster technology. People can literally have different rooms of their houses on different planets.Hyperion is the site of the Time Tombs, an artifact travelling back in time, sent by an unknown entity.The planet will be the site of an attack by a rogue group of far travelling humanity called the Ousters, upon the stay at homes, unflatteringly terming themselves the Hegemony.The travelling band must also deal with The Shrike, a monstrous avatar of pain."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"what amazed me the most about this excellent sci-fi novel is the variety of levels at which it could be read: war, spies, political intrigue, religious quest, travel and exploration, adventure .... I was especially awed by all the references to, and the obvious love and passion for, literature.These literary references are found in the very core and structure of the novel, since the main characters are pilgrims that tell their stories (Chaucer anyone?) while they travel in the planet of Hyperion, whose most important city is Keats (Romantics anyone?). It goes without saying that the better you know your literary classics, the more you will enjoy this aspect of the novel--and I think this aspect does not remain in the superficial level of witty names and situations, but goes deeper in the plot and structure to say something about the significance of these literary works. This doesn't mean that Hyperion cannot be read, too , and mainly, as an excellen sci-fi work that explores in a very intelligent way, some of the most important moral issues of our culture. Mind you, the story does not finish in this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Recently, as I was looking across my bookshelves, I noticed four dominant themes. In descending order: non-fiction, science fiction, metaphysical, classic literature. I pulled books randomly off the shelves and looking at the covers tried to remember what was in them. Almost all pulled a blank, even critically acclaimed Clarke, Asimov, and Bear books that I remember from the covers as being a good read, but now I can't recall a single detail. Niven, Le Guin, Haldeman and Pynchon, somewhat better. Homer's Odyssey fairly well. But most of us who read the Dune sagas and/or the Lord of the Rings trilogy + one find we have very vivid memories of them, even after 25 years, or more. The Hyperion - Endymion series by Dan Simmons is better than these two, even more inventive (and convincing) than either. It beats Herbert's creation of a multi-world civilization, and also Tolkien's fantastic array of creatures. It is more than wheels within wheels of political intrigue, and it goes far beyond one simple-but-nobly-heroic pilgrim's quest to save a world. It is many pilgrim's inter-related quests to save a space-wide civilization so vast, yet so intricately entwined, seeming so strange, but built upon the brilliantly-extended familiar. And the technology that glues the whole thing (The All-Thing) together is a concept so.... seductive. Christianity revitalized, mobilizing an army of a new definition of Born-Again Christians (guaranteed to be unlike anything you think of by that term) vies with The Church of the Final Atonement, worshippers of the Lord of Pain for the position of dominant faith. Space travel, Time travel and the Lord of Pain Itself, a terrifying creature that moves through both as one dimension making a Guild Navigator seem as inefficient as sending an Orc to do a Balrog's job, silently but certainly determining and molding the fate of a civilzation one person at a time(frame) that cannot even conceive of what It is, though that civilization's very existence is only possible through the (apparent) benificence of It's creators. This destroyer/creator's actions are not pre-determined, but instead are reactive to the free-will choices and actions of the central cast of characters, who are often at odds with each other. And this stochastic dance on the knife's edge between existence and never-having-occurred only happens because one faction within The All-Thing trinity (which exists in no space or time) won out over the other two, giving the creatures of space and time the chance of saving their reality, but only by hazarding the existence of The All-Thing itself.A major motion picture could never capture the detail, and even five or six would probably fail, as they would lack the time-continuity necessary. But if the Sci-Fi Channel would do a mini-series on it lasting at least four weeks (20 episodes or more) it would be a stunning thing in the memories of multitudes, instead of the relatively few who read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"First, my only complaint about Hyperion: It's really only part one of the story. Make sure you have The Fall of Hyperion handy for when you complete the book.Hyperion is one of those rare SF novels that has a truly human face. It is a well-imagined story about a society in chaos facing a difficult hour. At the same time, it is a particularly deftly-told story of the main characters who populate the novel. There aren't too many SF novels that are so personal in nature. The various worlds are also nicely drawn and the portrayal of the Hegemony and it's social fabric are compelling."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Where to start? First of all, this is a wonderful book and Dan Simmons is a very good writer, if this work is any indication of his talent. I haven't read anything else by Simmons but I have ordered another title and will add it to the front of my queue.&lt;While I obviously enjoyed the book thoroughly (more on that in a moment), I must comment o on some areas I didn't particularly enjoy: (1) The Consul's story is not at all believable, nor does it lay the groundwork necessary for the plot turn. (2) The final scene, with the characters linking arms and singing tunes from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is unpleasant and unworthy of the rest of the book. (3) Simmons' frequent references to twentieth-century events and persons taxes the reader as well; for the obvious care and planning that went into this work it is disappointing that Simmons couldn't do better. (4) Finally, Simmons makes an unforgivable error in his use of the word \\"penultimate\\" as a synonym for \\"the most.\\" How this could have slipped past his editor is beyond my comprehension, but the fault lies with Simmons for making the mistake in the first place. Perhaps this is an inside joke or Simmons did it on purpose to win a bet?All that said I'm still able to say that Hyperion is the best science fiction novel I've read in years. It compares favorably to the works of the masters - Heinlein, Bradbury, Ellison - in its scope, its artistry and its ability to deliver visceral impact to the reader. This work, like much of theirs, transcends its genre and belongs in the library of anyone who enjoys good fiction and great writing.I had a friend, an educated and very well read woman, who once asked me for recommendations in the science fiction genre. I regret losing contact with her for many reasons, and now I have another: I wish I could have recommended this book to her."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a masterful piece of writing. A space opera with hard science fiction elements, marvelous character development, and a strong sense of humanity. I rank the Hyperion Cantos as superior to Dune, second only to Lord of the Rings.Simmons is a true writer, and, like Lord of the Rings, his work transcends the genre."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first saw this book at my local library, but I thought I'd try it. I was glad I did. I didn't realize that there was a sequel until I read the last page, but luckily the library had that as well, so I've read both. I'll stick to the first book here though. Very compelling and thoughtful, though a bit confusing in some places, like what the cybrid Johnny was--human? Android? Cyborg? I never did quite get that. I also skipped over what I considered unimportant to the plot--the sex scenes (I don't like those cluttering up a story anyway; IMO they're just put there for cheap thrills). Why not just end the section/chapter with Kassad's and Moneta's first kiss and then pick up with some other story? It's not like we don't know what those two are going to do now is it? Althought that's a minor point and like I said, I'm not a big fan of sex scenes in books in general. The pilgrims' stories are very compelling, and the scholar's story in particular is dramatic. I tried to imagine what it must be like to suffer the same fate as Rachel Weintraub--I wouldn't like it one bit. I still think about that. Read this book and make sure you can get hold of the sequel. which drags in some places, but over all is just as compelling. Think I'll check out the other two--I'm pretty sure I can get them from my local library or some other county library (my tax $ at work)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A pretty good book, but doesn't quite live up to the hype. The book is really just 6 tales by 6 strangers on a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; about what led each one of them to Hyperion. I was a bit disappointed that nothing actually happens ON Hyperion, all we find out is why the pilgrims are there, not what happens next (presumably that is in the sequel). Allegedly this book is a &quot;Sci-Fi Canterbury Tales&quot;, but I do not remember much about the Canterbury Tales myself (read them 15 years ago or so). What was most frustrating and the reason I will read the sequel is some interesting hints of an AI &quot;race&quot; that may be done with humans and want to destroy them as well as the mystery of the pilgrimage itself to the &quot;Time Tombs&quot; which are structures travelling backwards through time (which are possibly tied to the AIs, who knows?)."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the great species of SCI FI takes a single technological advance (eg nanotech in Diamond Age) and follows it through all of its myrid effects on society. In this case, the inovation is instant transport across vast distances, so easy that one home can have every room on a different world. The cultural impact is momentous and facinating.That said, it takes more than such an inovation to make a great novel. Simmons' sucess is owed to his tremendous talent in crafting compeling characters and telling each of their stories in their voice. The varrious stories within the novel run the gambit from 19th century gothic to dime store detective. Each is well done and would stand alone as an excellent story.I suppose in many ways, this novel (the first and second are the best in the series) are all that this genre aspires to be -- readable, compeling, and intellectually evocative."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Everything has already been said about Dan Simmons's HYPERION, a book that is without contest one of the most important books of the 20 last years. Simmons develops original themes pages after pages and each of the stories of the pilgrims could have been published as an independent novel of its own.Father L&eacute;nar Hoyt's story is the favorite of mine because it's a variation of the main theme of CARRION COMFORT, Dan Simmon's precedent novel. How men can fight evil that is corrupting the soul - in CARRION COMFORT - and the body, in HYPERION. The final of this peculiar story is a very impressive moment, even for the reader used to morbid descriptions.One is a little bit puzzled at the beginning of the book because Dan Simmons, in the first 30 pages, is refering to such characters or places as The Gritch, the Time Tombs, the Extros or the City of the Poets without a single explanation for the reader. Don't give up, these themes will be extremely well developed in the different stories told by the Pilgrims. At the end of the novel, the whole universe conceived by Dan Simmons is literally living in front of our eyes. That's obviously the mark of the great writer. Even in the despised science-fiction literary genre.A book which is already in your library."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have been reading science fiction for over 40 years and I follow the genre closely. I was very surprised to find that I had not only missed Hyperion when it came out but the succeeding 3 books. I have seen the title in many bookstores and passed it out of sheer ignorance. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed two books as wonderful as Hyperion and the Fall of Hyperion. The best part of the books is how those groups that seem to be good and evil reverse themselves to climax in a moving ending. Thank you Mr. Simmons"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you like fiction then this a must read. I picked Hyperion off the shelf by luck and for the next two days I did not answer the phone. It is one of the best books I have ever read and definitely the best sci-fi. The story is compelling, incredible and brilliant. There is no adequate way to describe how good this book is. Read it, 'nuff said."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons is a master weaver of the fiction that becomes part of your soul. He intertwines fantasy, science fiction, hard technology, and religion into a superb tale of true pilgrims on a valient quest to save the Human race from the life-hording Tecnocore. Hyperion is a pinnacle of modern Fiction and leaves the reader begging for more. His characters are as real as the hand resting on your mouse, he really captures his audience and take them on a journey they'll never forget. I highly recomend this work and it's successive counterparts; Dan Simmons gets my vote every time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I first saw Hyperion on the book reviews of an old game-magazine. The journalist called it difficult to read, but to be worth it. This is an understatement! Since 6 years, Hyperion and its sequel, The End of Hyperion, are still the best books I\`ve ever read. It's like the Ring-Saga from Tolkien for science-fiction! If you read any non-present fiction BUY THOSE BOOKS! Or better: buy both together, because when you finished the first book, you will have no fingernails when the second will finally arrive... My only wish would be a -Hyperion and End of H. in on big band for the bookshelf- book to replace the two paperpacks,which are nearly shredded from reading too often..And for the -which story I liked best- : Brawne Lamia"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is easily a Sci-Fi must read! Get it quick!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am an avid reader of all types of literature. Hyperion is one of those very special tales that will leave you wanting more. It ranks right up there with the Lord of the Rings, The Stand and Dune for captivating fiction/science fiction."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A trend of stagnation has plagued fiction writers in the past few years; truly innovative work has become increasingly hard to come by. Dan Simmons has overcome mediocrity and reached a pinnacle in the science fiction community with the Hyperion series. He has combined amazingly complex settings, a scattering of historical fiction, and a cast of genuinely intriguing characters to create one of the most memorable and satisfying science fiction series to date. Simmons has shown himself to be a literary jack-of-all-trades with this series, covering a daunting amount of historical, social, scientific, and linguistic material. Then there's the Shrike...And it all started with Hyperion-the first of four very high quality novels. Hyperion is a modern classic-pick up a copy and see."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"He has me, I want to go out and read everything that Dan Simmons has written. It took me long enough to allow myself to be introduced to the words of this incredible talent, and I am glad that it did. Dan Simmons is a writer who lives the lives human beings, all human beings. He has painted a future for humanity that while frightening is also just too tantelizing to turn away from. In Hyperion he sets the stage for characters and actions that will hook you. I've read them all. You should as well."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I picked up this book hoping it would be thought-provoking SF (not fantasy) and found it to be much, much more. The characters are dark and complex. The story is not linear, but the sum of the character's individual stories, which could all stand on their own as some of the best short fiction of the decade. The reader is challenged to think (for a change) about how civilizations work, what role religion plays, etc.Just an all-out awesome read. This ranks up there with my favorite book =&gt; Time and Again by Jack Finney.The story of Rachel is the best!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read endymion first, fall of hyperion hooked me, hyperion solidified the bond, and rise of endymion only made me love it more.The best series ever written,and the shrike the best creation/character ever commited to page."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Simmons is one of America's best writers, not just sf writers. This novel(and the sequels that followed)are as sophisticated and complex as anything by Pynchon or Joyce but incorporate a more commerical narrative structure. The first two novels in this &quot;series&quot;(I use the term loosely because of the time frame the series covers)are among the best fiction produced in the past 20 years. Simmons, along with his more unconventional contemporary Stephenson, is among the best authors currently writing.The ideas, situations and characters are all sophisticated and have considerable depth. It's clear that Simmons is trying to structure a narrative with a thematic structure comparable to the fiction of a Homer or Joyce(two authors at other ends of the spectrum).I can highly recommend this book. Give it a chance and you'll be sucked into its world. Easily the most comprehensive world created since Herbert's DUNE series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Amazing, I have never read anything like it. I wish it never ended. It's definitly the ride of a lifetime"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I haven't read such an engrossing epic since I read The Hobbit. Dan Simmons' writing style is phenominal and the stories he tells are well thought out. The &quot;pilgrims&quot; on their journey to Hyperion chronicle their stories in a way that is detailed - yet not tiresome. In addition, the future that in which Hyperion exists could be a novel unto itself. While some other readers felt cheated that the book seemed to end to soon - I felt that it ended at the right point in the story. Unfortunately it leaves you aching for more. If you find yourself intensely enjoying Hyperion about 1/2 way through I would recommend that you obtain a copy of Return to Hyperion to continue with the story. This book also opened me up to the other works of Dan Simmons - all of which are great books - Simmons is probably the most versatile author on the market today (SF, Fiction, Horror, NonFiction) and it is time well spent to familiarize yourself with his writing."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This along work along with its conclusion and secondary story lines in Endyminion is far and away the most superior scifi I've encountered in a long time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book, along with Ender's Game, ranks as one of the top science-fiction novels of our time. It presents a beautiful prelude to the tetralogy of the Hyperion world and its universe, and is easily the best of the series. In a nutshell, it tells the story of the human race in a far future, and their relationship with not only each other but with the technology that has made possible the colonization of space. The twist is the presentation, which is served in the form of the personal tales of seven unique individuals, each of whom plays a role much greater than anyone could guess in the future of the human race. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Every aspect of this book - the absolutely realistic character development, the description you feel in your guts, the imaginative and fully-developed plot, the exceptional dialogue - is like a drug. You will not think of the genre the same way after reading Hyperion (too much of it will seem like drivel). A friend told me about it three years before I actually read it, and I regret not rushing out to get it the moment I heard the title cross his lips. This is one of those rare books that defies description. It transcends the ink on the page and becomes a cohesive, truly beautiful work of literature. It challenges one to think about some of the assumptions we live by. The 'Father's Tale' was one of the most moving and powerful pieces of writing I have ever read.

I didn't finish this one. The plot and characters could have been written by a computer program. Always take a book review as from someone who doesn't necessarily share your tastes, however, if you were a friend, I would advise you to spend your reading dollar elsewhere."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is the first book that I have ever reviewed without first having finished reading the book. I think 44% is enough to make a fair judgment. I made it 44% through Hyperion before asking Amazon for a refund, and thus, with great relief, removing this book entirely from my Kindle library. I wish I could remove it from all existence, but alas, I cannot.Hyperion was slow.Seven pilgrims are on a pilgrimage to see the Shrike on planet Hyperion. The Shrike is some kind of immortal entity with spikes coming our of his body, who grants wishes sometimes and slaughters people in bloody fashion at other times. As the pilgrims travel to see the Shrike, each tells his or her story of a previous encounter on Hyperion and with the Shrike. I read two of the stories in full and most of a third story.As the book proceeds, we hear about the journey to Hyperion, what the surface of the planet looks like, and the transport vehicles that are used to move the pilgrims around the surface. It's all very pretty, but there's nothing actually happening. And each pilgrim's story, while perhaps interesting, just takes us away from the current events. I kept waiting for something to actually happen.Hyperion was disturbing.What I learned in the pilgrims' stories that I read is that the Shrike is quite scary. He apparently impales people, body and soul, on some kind of tree when he doesn't grant an asked wish. He slices one lady open from head to toe when she is on the brink of an orgasm. (That was a particularly touching scene.) So he's pretty much all flowers, candy, and rainbows.Main points of the pilgrims' stories: [***SPOILER BEGINS*** The first pilgrim's story revolves around some kind of cruciform-shaped parasitic being that forces people to remain alive even when death might be preferred. In the second story, a soldier has frequent sex-capades with a twisted monster. ***SPOILER ENDS***] And in the third story, one of the pilgrims travelling to see the Shrike decides that this lovely immortal being with the soul-impaling tree is his muse.Hyperion was certainly fascinating. Given a different atmosphere or at a different point in my life, perhaps I might have finished this book. But in this time and in this place, I simply could not stomach it.I could write more about how much I disliked this book, but I'd prefer to just pretend that it does not exist. I did not like this book at all."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I was furious when I finished this book. It has no resolution whatsoever. It's like Simmons wrote half a book. Maybe that is a good way to get money out of people, but it's not the way to write a good novel. I can't imagine what sort of fool would be excited enough to sign up for reading the next volume, when there are actually *good* books out there. I feel totally tricked into reading this dud by all the 5-star reviews and the Hugo award.Most of the book is half-a-dozen stories. A couple had some interesting things in them, and Simmons does show us that he can write in different styles. Good for him. But really I couldn't care less about any of the characters. It is bad enough that each story ends unresolved, but there is also a severe emptiness to this book. It feels two-dimensional, there are no great issues to care about, no good versus bad, no one does anything that is *important*. There's more *drama* in an episode of Charmed.Okay, Mr. Simmons, I can't get back the \\"time debt\\" you've cost me, but how about a refund? I paid for a *novel*, and that is not what you delivered."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"D Simmons creates an interesting universe and the Canterbury Tales device works well. But the pretentious smugness of this book made it infuriating to read. Another reviewer had it spot-on when he said, \\"the characters are present day Americans dressed up as denizens of the future\\". There are just too, too many references to 19th and 20th century America to be believable. Shotguns, garden hoses...The Wizard of Oz? How would any of these characters know anything about such things?Maybe the Babylon 5 fans like such overwrought pap. I am astonished this won the Hugo award. The number of 5 star reviews here sadden me. Have they never read a decent book before? One in which the author doesn't club you over the head with his \\"wealth of literary knowledge\\"?There was something good here, but it was smothered its own smugness."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I inhale sci fi; the Foundation Series and Robot series are some of my favorite books of all time. Starship Troopers is another winner in my book. I read this tale with great anticipation--And found myself bewildered and let down.Confusingly told, badly written, poorly conceived- there's not a lot this book has going for it. As an outline, maybe; as a novel(ette), no way.Also one of the most anticlimactic books I've ever had the misfortune to delve into."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A mostly gripping story that's dragged down in a few places by politicaly correct storytelling.The PC stuff includes a military-commercial attack on an environmentally perfect world of people and dolphins. It also includes some female characters who seem forced. One of the major characters is supposed to be a female version of the private detective Sam Spade, only tougher. There's also tough- but-wise female leaders of the dolphin world and of the broader star systems. These characters are flat, at least compared to the surroundign action. Also, there's a throwaway reference to a male military character as a descendent of \\"Palestinians.\\" The reference appears in a single paragraph and then disappears.In most stories with this kind of PC stuff, the silly politics sinks the art. This story is good enough to overcome it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am astounded by the hysteria that surrounds this novel and its sequel. Quick frankly, I can't find a good thing about it. It is overwritten. It logically makes no sense whatsoever. John Keats, fine poet as he was, is hardly an apt figure for the ultimate savior of mankind. The science--ranging from tree ships to a super-Internet that be both (a) intelligent and (b) a transportation network (&quot;It's a floor wax! It's a dessert topping!!&quot;) is worse than embarressing. I literally forced myself though both volumes, with a &quot;this can't get any worse&quot; attitude--and it did. Be warned. If you like, say, the Charles Sheffield / Arthur Clarke / Isaac Asimov end of the spectrum, you will hate this. If you like fantasy and have no sense of logic, you might like it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"How does an author who cannot even write convincing dialog manage to win the Hugo? Don't ask me. The worst is the character Silenus, a crazy poet, who speaks like someone straight out of a B sci-fi movie. A couple of the stories are actually interesting but if you're into &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, don't even consider this book. Simmons is heavy on the speculative but low on scientific content. He should stick to writing horror."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A lesson really, that all the fancy awards and 5-star ratings simply do not mean much in some cases. Hyperion is one of these cases, while its universe is described adequately and it has some ok ideas. Other (ideas) are not so original, such as guys in body hugging skin suits, running around, making inhuman leaps and decapitating people (hello Paul!) ..or the poor AI seeking freedom for itself. It is quite thick though, so hey, you can use it as a monitor stand or something."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book got such great reviews, I was expecting a lot more. All I got were rehashes of tired scifi storylines, a mix between not-so-scary lovecraft and star trek the original series with some graphic, violent sex thrown in. *shrug* I didn't care about anyone in the book enough to even finish the series - I had checked out a combined edition from the library. *yawn*"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I like Dan Simmons. \\"Carrior Comfort\\" is one of the best horror stories I have every read, so having seen so much praise for \\"Hyperion\\" I was eager to give it a try. I'll admit, I was one of the unaware that this was the first book of a two-part story, and that all this book covered was character backstory. This soured me on it to no end. I was expecting a story about what happens when the characters face the ultimate killing machine \\"the Shrike\\", not the long dull journey before hand. In the end, I wasn't moved enough to get the second book and would recommend getting \\"Carrion Comfort\\" instead."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a mysterious planet which is outside the sphere of the civilized and populated cluster of worlds that make up the Hyperion universe. Earth has long been dead, and its inhabitants have migrated to interesting worlds that are strangely devoid of other life. It is to this world Hyperion that six very different people are summoned, and they do not know why. Although each of these characters have ties to this world unbeknownst to the others. This is the basis of the story, a Canterbury-tales like telling of these character's flashbacks.Some of these stories were interesting, and they help to reveal quite a bit about the planet and the mysterious circumstances surrounding it, but after 500 pages I was looking for a little bit more.I am interested in finding out the meaning of Hyperion, but I am a little nervous that the next books in this series will leave me disappointed as well."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm afraid that this award winner is overrated, and is less than it appears to be on the surface. Committees that give out awards are always smitten with big sprawling \\"epics\\" that tackle \\"significant\\" themes like faith and death and humanity. Dan Simmons' writing here is hugely ambitious, but the result is a book that barely even begins its true story, and piles on a plethora of big ideas and themes that are not explored in depth. The basic premise here is a terribly contrived take on Canterbury Tales, in which seven main characters, that are of course mismatched, are implausibly thrown together into a pilgrimage to the mysterious planet Hyperion, on which resides a mysterious demigod called the Shrike which has unexplained powers over the passage of time and the destinies of lost human societies.The main characters are mostly thin personality types that are so different from each other that there would certainly be \\"drama\\" when they're forcibly thrown together. We have the pious man of religion, the open-minded scholar, the quick-thinking detective, the monstrously annoying poet, and other dependable character templates. After finding themselves together on their pilgrimage, the characters then somehow convince each other to tell their personal stories, once again in the style of Canterbury Tales and at great length, of how they came to make the pilgrimage in the first place. These tales operate as short stories that are sometimes interesting in themselves, but sometimes not, with the overall book only tying the tales together with some thin subplots.These character tales have the potential to be expanded into quite interesting novels of their own, and they should have been because in condensed form here, Simmons fails to explore his often interesting themes to their full potential. Meanwhile, winning SF ideas like theocratic planets, time dilation, artificial intelligence, and even communicating with dolphins appear briefly then disappear. And the non-ending of this book is the hugest disappointment of all, as the characters are still at the beginning of their pilgrimage (which I presume will be the basis of the next book), and the strange phenomena of Hyperion are left unexplained. Writers are perfectly free to develop their ideas over multiple volumes, but Simmons doesn't even try to make this 500+ page tome self-sufficient. The individual parts of this book have their moments, but the whole is utterly unsatisfying. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Yeah, I'm gonna be that guy. I understand that this book won the Hugo...and that it is \\"neat\\" because it uses the Canterbury tales as a \\"model\\". But so what? Yeah, I guess it was pretty cool having it split up into a bunch of different narratives, but I felt like the stories were longer than they needed to be. I know I know...I'm supposed to think it was super-cool that all these different stories were \\"woven together\\", and I can see that...but I just don't think it was done all that interestingly. Ok so they all had something to do with the Shrike and Hyperion, etc etc. It just didn't impress me. Simmons as a writer seems fine.I do think, however, that he's one of those authors whose prose often falls victim to \\"over-describing\\" things. I dunno if this is just something that's changed about my own tastes or what, but I'm starting to get tired of authors who will spend 4 lines of a paragraph describing a sunset, something like \\"and the orange glowing soft ball of the sun settled behind the soft green curve of the hills, like a blahl blahblhalbha\\". I mean yeah...I can appreciate someone's ability to elaborate on a description like this, but why do it just to do it? Do we really have to do it for every sunset? Every scenery? This kind of stuff can really over-stretch the narrative when it doesn't add anything to the story. And what's even funnier to me is that more often than not, people take it hook line and sinker and assume that it's \\"good\\" writing...I'm not saying he isn't a \\"good\\" writer by the way.But don't get me wrong...the book is a fine piece of \\"space-opera\\" scifi, but unless you're going to fall for the \\"it's cool because it's like the Canterbury tales\\" line, you probably won't find it earth-shattering. I'm just overly skeptical about stuff like this. If you want me to really be skeptical when reading a book...tell me it won the Hugo, then show me a bunch of screaming 4 and 5-star Amazon reviews about how great it is because of the fact that it's broken up into short stories. I didn't dislike the book, but I probably won't read it again. In fact the most positive thing I can say is that it did leave me wanting to know \\"what happens next\\" which...yes, a good story should do that, but a great story should do a lot more...and this just doesn't, not for me anyway."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"To start off, this book is about seven people who are going on a pilgrimage to a terrible creature called the shrike on the eve of an interstellar war to ask for the salvation of the human race. When the pilgrims meet, they decide to tell each other their stories of what brought them to this point. So the book ends up being basically six separate stories that are slammed together based on the fact that the characters telling these stories are headed in the same direction. The plot between the stories is short and just seems to be building up for the sequel (however I am not 100% sure the story is ever concluded, because I have not read the sequel).With that said, I did enjoy some of the aspects of this novel. The future world web that is created for the backdrop to the stories is diverse and intriguing. The shrike creature which the pilgrims are going to face (and some have already faced) is quite a terrifying. The planet Hyperion itself is quite interesting, and I would have enjoyed reading more about it. There are some quite shocking points of the story, which is always nice. Also it is nice to get the back story on the main characters.The problem is that the whole book is back story. I went into this book thinking it was about trying to save humanity, and ended up reading six sad stories that a lot of the time didn't feel like science fiction. It was like I got three romantic novellas, one heartbreaking parent drama novella, one rather dull adventure novella, and one life story novella. They were all shocking in parts and showed a lot of emotion, but they weren't really epic science fiction. Most of them could have been told using modern day as the scene and just changing a few of the future terms into present terms. The story that seemed to me would have been the most interesting (if it didn't turn out to be another romantic novella), was omitted because of events in the limited main plot. Also, most of the story for the main character seemed to have been written before this book and just forced into the story. It was just a not-chronological-order romance about people who had almost nothing to do with anything.The worst part for me though was how the novel was written. An example of what annoyed me was that one of the characters was supposed to be an ancient poet, but his dialog was completely ridiculous. Every other time he opened his mouth he was dropping the F bomb. Also, I definitely could do without the pornographic scenes, which got fairly graphic for no particular reason at points. The stories could get drawn out and a bit repetitive as well. Which I wouldn't really have minded if one story got somewhat drawn out, but having to push through six separate tales that seem to put the most words into areas where the least explanation is needed gets old.Now I don't mean to bash the book, as I said before, it has its good moments. I just personally would not recommend the book to someone as a good science fiction novel. Perhaps I would recommend it to someone who really needed something to read and was willing to read two books as a decent tale with some shocking outcomes."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Five of the six stories are interesting (excepting the one by the poet, Martin Silenus - that was real junk); but overall the book spends way too much time describing scenery. It should be explaining the political and religious aspects that Simmons was trying (big emphasis on TRYING here...) to bring about. I had to skim sometimes up to 20 pages just out of boredom. Then the ending is a real \\"hanger\\" and answered nothing! Give me more stuff on the Shrike, the Ousters, and the AI's!!! Less crud about the color of people's anatomy and the sky and stuff. However, I did fully appreciate some of the very sexual/horrorific nature of this book. It was nice to see that aspect of humanity depicted in a sci-fi setting. I am undecided if I will read the next book. I think I will spend time on other authors first. I checked this book out at the library and recommend you do the same. Definately not worth paying for (you already pay enough with your time.)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"While some of the individual tales in Hyperion are told well, the overall style is fairly cliched; as I read each of the tales, I had plenty of opportunity to think, geez, I've seen *this* plot device before... Plus, there's the added annoyance of the cliffhanger ending which will require you to purchase Fall of Hyperion. I'm not going to. This is not hard science fiction and those that enjoy or demand plausible science/explanations will not find it in Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A couple of good yarns (the priest's tale is especially good), but otherwise nothing special. The stories are supposed to have a common thread that just isn't there. There is no ending. This is a rip-off. This book was obviously written with the intention of forcing you to buy the sequel. And from all I've heard, the next two books in the series are written in just the same way. Shine it on, big time"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I enjoyed this novel (at least until the end), and found that I had to finish it in a single sitting. But I won't read the rest in the series.On the good side:-Great opportunities for reader's visual imagination -Interesting nexus of science and religion -Varied stories - though they do tend to emphasize lossOn the bad side: -The book's ending. I'm really tired of books that can't tell a story in a volume. This book has no climax; essentially we're left with clues about what it's all been about. And, of course, we receive an invitation to read the next volume.I don't mind multi-volume epics, but I want gratification from each volume, not just a promise that there might be some in the next volume. I won't read the next volumes in the hope that they will deliver on that promise."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Well written, with very good imagination and a good story line, however I grow tired with the age old formula of leaving readers &quot;hanging&quot;. My frustration with this &quot;novel&quot;, if you want to call it that, is that if you are writing these books with the intention of writing a sequel, at least create an arc in the story that can be finished, at the end. Basically, this is half of a novel. Spare us the attempt the grab us and slave us to your neverending story line. Even Rocky 1 through whatever had an individual story that was completed by the end of each movie. Maybe I am unjustly criticizing one author for something that has been widely practiced. As I said, I did enjoy the book, until the end. I will endeavor to read the next one, however, I see that there are a couple more in the &quot;series&quot; now, and if &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; does not have some finality to it, then add another author to the &quot;Do Not Read&quot; list."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I don't read much science fiction/fantasy, but a friend of mine suggested that I read the book with the promise I would love it anyway. He was right. It was a marvelous journey into an amazing make-believe future with a culture and lexicon of its own. I was impressed from start to finish with Simmons' ability to create entire worlds and races, complete with historical facts, figures, and names. I was so enthralled with the narrative I found myself reading bits and pieces whenever I could. My only disappointment came when I found the author chose to postpone the resolution...forcing me to buy The Fall of Hyperion! A literary cop-out in my eyes, but one worth following up on. A great effort!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I love this book. This book, along with Ender's Game, helped get me back into science-fiction, and it certainly was a great way to reenter. I have never seen a novel that can mix so many elements so well, and pack so much while still keeping it fascinating.I tried to impress my English teacher with this book by showing her how it tied into Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, but she didn't buy it, not being a science-fiction fan. She didn't know what she was missing. Not only does Hyperion echo the Canterbury Tales (the quote at the end of the Prologue is the end of the Old English Canterbury Tales' Prologue), but Simmons also manages to weave the life of poet John Keats (the name of the book is from his unfinished poem). I have never seen a novel that derives so much from literature, and not even contemporary literature at that.The plot. Wow. That's all I can say. I don't anybody can do justice to the plot by summerizing it, only by reading it can you fully appreciate it. Instead, I'll mention that I love Simmons' writing. His style is full of detail, sometimes seeming to literally describe everything, but always flows brilliantly, until the reader suddenly realizes they have a hundred pages in the course of an hour and never even gave a though to the passage of time.So, throw in all that described above, some classic science-fiction moments (I love the scene where they realize the tree is travelling backwards and is thus in their future. And some of them are on it), and the wealth of a totally new universe, a reader does not have to look anywhere else to find one of the greatest science-fiction novels of at least the eighties and possibly all time.Oh, yeah, know what the best thing is: it doesn't end! There's a sequel! All right! Bring it on, Dan Simmons is the master"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the best books I ever read. From the first page to the last keeps you hooked, and you just can't wait to read the second part (The Fall of Hyperion). Notice that you must not read the second part without reading the first and vice-versa. The caracters are very deep, their stories very tuoching, the situations allways changing, there isn't a moment for boredom. The first two parts of the sequel deserve my admiration, I hope the third will keep up with it.And to keep adding, the Science Fiction behind the story is simply great. The ideas that have como to Dan Simmons with the &quot;portals&quot; are a very good idea as to what might happen if we had them. A lot of authors have used them in SF but none with such realism. I have only one thing to say to Dan Simmons, &quot;Thank you for giving us this book&quot;."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Just finished reading Hyperion and its necessary second part, 'Fall of Hyperion'. First it must be clear before you dive into the first book that these two volumes are only split into two for publishing purposes - they are one story and there is no resolution at all at the end of 'Hyperion'. So, to start this book is to commit to over 2000 pages. If you end up liking it, you will probably like the fact that it is so long. As a fan of space-opera and intelligent, creative fiction, my personal summary is simply that I finished the books. I almost didn't bother, but I wanted to give Mr. Simmons a chance to thrill me with a stunning conclusion. I wish that had been done. Story lines tied in crazy knots instead of beautiful bows, and characters found endings that felt false and contrived. The books were certainly well written - I can't argue with that. And absolutely, Mr. Simmons is an intelligent and provoking author. However, I see from reading other reviews that I echo the sentiment of at least some others that though a part of my mental self was interested, I could not for the life of me FEEL anything for the plot or characters. In that sense, this tome lacked a vitality and the taste of a good story. By being so complex and academic, I was often set off from the narrative and could distinctly feel the presence of an author on the page, trying too hard to be a good writer. This is what sets apart truly great classics from books like this which - as cool as they are with their sweeping scopes of worlds and wars - cannot compare to the grip of a voice that pulls you in and in which you lose your self in pages and time. I did not have my soul stirred by this universe. Despite having all sorts of elements which on paper I should have loved - including poetry and politics and religion, I just did not find joy in this reading. Hopefully in Mr. Simmons' future work he abandons the wish to be so intelligent, and just writes us a great book. These are two very different things."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I love Simmons, and read this many years ago. I thought it was odd that I couldn't remember much about it, so I read it again. Oh yeah...The story occurs 700 years in mankind's future, when Earth has been destroyed, and humans have expanded to other worlds. We still have coffee and oil, thank goodness. There is intergalactic war on the horizon, with the mysterious Shrike somehow entangled in it all on the planet Hyperion. Seven human pilgrims with varying personal backgrounds are chosen by the Church Of The Shrike to travel to Hyperion to meet the Shrike. The entire book is composed of each pilgrim telling his or her story of their experience with Hyperion, and why they may have been chosen. The individual stories were uneven for me. Some worked very well, some did not. There are many moments where Simmons' style of writing is extremely wordy. Some lengthy paragraphs are made of two or three sentences. Talented as he is, it became a labor for me to read at times. The Shrike seems to be an intriguing character, but barely a thing is revealed about it in this first book of the series. Some of the technologies are certainly fascinating. The pilgrims' stories were generally more interesting than the pilgrims. The writing was fantastic some of the time, and became bogged down in endless details at others. The book is really about the stories of the seven pilgrims' lives, as told by each. There is not enough time to develop anything else, at least not to a degree that ever won over my interest in it all. Simmons is never afraid to write the books he wants to write, and to experiment with anything that attracts him. There can be huge payoffs for the reader, or something less. Like this."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really liked this book right up until the end. The worlds were interesting, the Shrike were interesting and creepy, he didn't give away their secret so I wanted to keep reading to find out more about them. I liked how he wove religion into the story throughout.What I didn't like was the ending. In fact, I was mad about it, to the point where I didn't want to read the next book. I expected something dramatic to happen, but it simply didn't fulfill my expectation. I am told that the later books will explain it, but I think it's important to give the reader SOMETHING, some reason why he/she went through 500 pages to the end."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is absolutley wonderful and if you are a science fiction fan at all go out and buy this book immediately. The book is made of up of several long stories which are amazing and encompass just about every different field of science fiction from aliens to artificial intelligence to time travel. The ending to this book is somewhat disappointing to some but I personally feel that it ended in the best way possible.The book has a sequel(s) that many people love but I do not. I wish this would have been the only book because I do think the ending is terrific. In the sequel to this book, Simmons changes the style that made Hyperion great and writes a standard science fiction novel that has several plot holes and feels rushed. More than likely though, if you read this novel you will read the next one, just a warning."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I left avid science fiction some time ago, choosing to explore classic literature and metaphysics. Suddenly in need of a good \\"junk read\\", I picked up Hyperion, and what a joy and a surprise.First, it's just damn well written, more than the usual \\"plot + exposition\\" narratives that seem to plague sci-fi. Dan Simmons, knows how to describe a scene or situation that evokes emotion, rare for most sci-fi. His characters describe loss, bewilderment, anger and revenge, each one is a unique individual.Along the way, the book debates some heavy topics. Development versus independence, machine versus humanity, technological dependence versus creativity. True faith versus ritualistic faith.The final briliant touch is the ending. While it terms of plot it can be called a cliffhanger, it also is a literary salute to the Canterbury Tales and the Arabian Nights and the Decameron. The Hyperion world and the tale is exposited through 6 characters telling their individual story and path, on their way to their personal heart of darkness- a pilgrimage. In this, the ending actually places the story in that context, and you could walk away there, imagining what the end of the story could be.You won't however, Dan Simmons world is just too damn much fun to leave, and yes you will wan't some questions answered.On a final note of recommendation. As I suddenly remembered while reading Hyperion, it's paen to literature is what sent me away from pure sci-fi. The poetry and persona of John Keats plays a whole role in this story, and curious, I read that and eventually all his predecessors on a journey that hasn't stopped. For that alone, this book while always hold a special place in my memory."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The HYPERION CANTOS is one of the crowning achievements of 20th century science fiction. It is on a par equal to or surpassing the DUNE CHRONICLES in terms of originality, scope, and layers of meaning. The sacrifice of Aenea is one of the most moving passages of literature I have read, and one of the few that have left me in tears. Simmons literary references are unique, refreshing, and anything but pedantic, as many reviewers here would lead you to believe. Many \\"scholars\\" that debunk science fiction do so because they argue it lacks any literary merit. Simmons is not attempting to show off his knowledge of the classics; he is alluding to them in an attempt to address the same fundamental issues in a new and original light. That is the strength of speculative fiction, and Simmons is an author that gives fans of science fiction one of their greatest weapons in defending a genre that is dismissed far too often. What could be more fundamental than addressing the power of love? In the end that is one of the many questions that the CANTOS is asking us to consider. You don't need to have read every, or any, classic that Simmons alludes to in order to enjoy the CANTOS, but if you are a fan of English literature they will enhance your enjoyment of the novel, and maybe, just maybe pique your interest enough to go back to the source material. Simmons is one of the best contemporary authors writing today. Pick up HYPERION and discover the amazing talents of a writer that truly cares about his art; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It is a little hard to get a good bead on this book. It almost seems like Simmons started out to write a collection of short stories with a common enigmatic element but then decided to tie that theme into a larger plot; this is especially evident in the last two stories.In the global scope, we have a group of characters on a pilgrimage. The characters tell their tales en route to the Time Tombs. A place on the planet Hyperion where time flows backwards. Each story has some connection to the being that inhabits the Time Tombs. And that creature is the Shrike. The Shrike is a menacing three meter tall humanoid, covered head to toe with blades. Appropriately, he has another moniker, the Lord of Pain.One of the most striking talents Simmons shows in this work, is his astounding ability to write with different voices. It goes way beyond word choice and syntax. When he switches from the Priest's tale to the Colonel's tale, the shift can be seen not only in how the fictional storyteller tells the tale, but how the storyteller see's his world.A very brief synopsis of each short story follows.The Priest's Tale - Some classic theming here. Kind of \\"Dr. Livingstone finds the head of the Nile deep within the Twilight Zone.\\"The Colonel's Tale - Brilliant action story. Real \\"Die Hard\\" space and ground combat stuff. Some interesting sex as well.The Poet's Tale - What cost for the muse? Here Simmons really shows his ability to speak with different voices. At one point in this story, the poet has brain damage that limits his vocabulary to about eight words. None of which can be included in this review. Very funny stuff here, also includes some Simmons jabs at the publishing industry.The Scholar's Tale - This is the most gut wrenching painful story I have ever read. It actually made me cry, and I think that's the first time a book has ever done that (at least the first time it made me cry because it was good.) Warning - Fathers with daughters, get the hankies out.The Detective's Tale - Wow, this came out of nowhere. Dick Tracey in a dress, but tougher. A sci/fi detective story, complete with cliches. She's even wearing a trenchcoat for heaven's sake.The Consul's Tale - A love story for the intergallactic age. Special realativity makes long distance relationships look good. Didn't stir me too much. I think this is where Simmons was really trying to develop the \\"global\\" plot. It also struck me as a little bit too \\"Green Partyish.\\" Not really preachy, but just a little to much \\"save the planet.\\"Simmons does some really interesting things with future vernacular and even more interesting things with how a space faring society deals with interstellar travel. The concept of an AI society that exists more or less parallel with the inner and outer human societies is a thought provoking one.Does it pass the \\"will I read the sequel test?\\" Oh yes. Any author that can write as powerfully as seen in the Priest's and the Scholar's tale is likely to sell a copy of everything he or she has ever written to me."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Top three best scifi book (series) I've ever read. Very well thought universe and a good story that gets better all the way to the end of the (currently) four book series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Simmons plants seeds from Chaucer and Keats, and this monumental work of fiction is what springs forth from his fertile imagination. This is science fiction tinged with fantasy, horror and high art.While familiarity with the classics will heighten your enjoyment of the stories, they are not prerequisites. Each tale will entrance you with its emotional content and vivid characterizations, yet each is linked around the enigma of Hyperion: a place where the present and future are locked in war, where religion and science fuse, and an angel-of-death known as the Shrike looms as bogeyman and enigma. By the end of this book, you'll be hungry for the sequels--both to learn the fate of the characters and to unravel the mysterious nature of the Shrike's creators."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book, as the first in a series of four, sets the tone for what becomes a very lofty struggle that embodies the very nature of humanity in a future time where individuals are becoming less and less human. The tale is thoughtfully woven as a tapestry of interconnected events in the lives of a set of pilgrims on a journey to the most remote reaches of the Hegemony of Man (very Chaucer-esque). Along the way, we learn how each pilgrim's piece of the puzzle fits into the whole of the group, and gradually we uncover a bit of the mythos that surrounds the world of Hyperion, and how it seems that, despite its remoteness, it is at the center of everything.For these books, I can think of no one more apt to describe the worlds that he has created. In much the same way that Frank Herbert created the desolation of Arrakis, Simmons manufactures plants, animals, and breeds of people to populate his fantastic section of the galaxy. In this way, he generates a certain depth to the book that exists because there is nothing overlooked. As with all great science fiction, he takes the high road and doesn't dumb the book down by writing it for a 20th (or 21st) century reader by explaining every nuance and term used in the book. In fact, over the course of the four book series, there are quite a few things that are never explained, but would logically be perfectly clear to someone who lived during the times covered in the books. This, in my opinion, really gives the book a sense of time and story that comes through as a mature writing style.This is a series of books that I reread on a fairly regular basis, and the stories are never far from my mind. Highly recommended for a lifetime of enjoyment."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is an SF homage to &quot;Cantenbury tales&quot;. Six people are travelling together and tell each over their stories, which brought them to the trip. It sounds simple but isn't. The stories are all different and each of them is great. It's not obviouse at first, but these tales represent the evolution of SF. We have a lost diary kind of horror story, not unlike Lovecraft, then there is military SF in the vein of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; or Gordon R.Dicksons' Dorsai novels then ... well, maybe you'd better find out by yourself.The world of this novel is very well written and it feels like a real future, not some stock footage you find in many other novels. There was a lot of thought put into the universe of this book.Hyperion is followed by 3 more books - Fall of Hyperion, Endimion, Rise of Endimion. Many readers were put back by a complete change of style in the second book. So you'd better be ready for a VERY different second novel, which is still good.The Hyperion cantos is one of the definate SF cycles of the late 20th century. If you read even a bit of SF (and judging by your being on this page you do), you should take a trip to this world.It is definetly up there with &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot; and a couple of others."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Like another recent reviewer, I discovered this book purely by accident. I'm not much of a sci-fi buff, and was expecting a &quot;trashy novel&quot; (which I happened to be in the mood for). It definitely was not that; but while I enjoyed it -- and the whole series, twice -- immensely, I thought it had enough problems to warrant 4 stars.The six vignettes that make up the bulk of this volume are all fascinating: I found the scholar's tale to be by far the most moving, and the priest's to be the most interesting and most disturbing. They serve as excellent vehicles for fleshing out the characters (though the priest -- perhaps the shallowest character -- is fleshed out more by implication).The poetic allusions are a little heavy-handed, and sometimes feel contrived, though they can be of interest to literary devotees. And one weakness that appears through all the Hyperion books (with the possible exception of Endymion): the ending is rather trite, and unnecessarily so. It wouldn't be a huge problem, except that it becomes disproportionately noticable given its high-visibility position. Simmons's style seems to employ a tasteful amount of camp (if that makes sense) generally; endings may be the exception to this rule.The book's strength is, as with science fiction generally, in my experience, as a thought experiment that happens to be a novel. As becomes increasingly apparent in later books in the series, the man vs. machine theme is central, and handled far more competently than, say, the way it was handled in the recent Matrix movies. Of course, the Shrike is more thought experiment than character, but an engaging one. Environmentalist topics are dealt with as well, and in an ingenious enough way that someone not sympathetic to environmentalism (e.g., me) will give the subject a new think."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book and the entire series is great. Honestly it may sound cliche but from the moment I picked up this book I was addicted. I've been scouring used book stores for the last five or six months and finally got the fourth book of the series for my collection. I can understand how people who have only read the first book might feel a little unfulfilled. However as soon as you get into the second book it all goes away. I can't help but get the feeling that while Simmons was writing this book he had the rest laid out perfectly. The way the characters all come together and relate with their stories is just plain addictive. In a way it's a little like a Quentin Tarantino movie, but in novel form."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book ranks up there with the greats: Dune, Enders Game, Foundation. Simmons creates a great and original universe with great character development, cool technology and a plot that is not predictable. One warning...you MUST have Fall of Hyperion ready to go when you finish this book. I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me, you will be sorry if you don't. Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion could have been one book. ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a book of somewhat uneven quality. The sentences have a short, irritating, grating feel sometimes. It's not the most polished of works.The story is in a somewhat unimaginative style where several pilgrims head off to Hyperion and get to hear each other's stories. There's a lot of fluff in Hyperion and the novel could have been cut down substantially.That said, some of the stories are very strange and powerful. The priest's story and that of the man with the child were very disturbing and left a strong impression. Those two alone make the book worth reading. The others were mixed, some ok, a couple very dull.Worth a read, but not a sci-fi great."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"hyperion (and fall of hyperion) weave together several genres into one intricate and beautiful tale of personal loves, losses, and fears, without being overshadowed by the possible distruction of society as it is known in this stories setting. one minute it can have you drooling over intense combate scenes and the next tug at you heart with the emotion of losing a child or a lover. i recommend the whole set (hyperion, fall of hyperion, endymion, rise of endymion, and the short story orphans of the helix) to everyone who has a passion for reading work of the greats."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The Hyperion cantos is without a doubt one of the great epics in sci fi cannon, up there with the classic robots-empire-foundation series and the ender series. Where Simmons really shines is how he manages to create a galaxy with so much character and worlds that are so unique and vivid.Seven pilgrims to the mysterious shrike tell their story, but their stories interconnect in many ways and in the process weave a mesmerizing description of their futuristic world. The technology in this book is plausible and will not seem outdated by the time you read the book. If you like hard sci fi, you will not be disapointed, Simmons respects the genre and does his research. If you like an epic plot with ramifications throughout the human universe (and the human spirit) this book and its sequels will definatly hit the mark. If you like well designed characters and backdrops, this book excels as well. Finally, if you like a good read period, then this book will keep u page turning many a night."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Probably would have given it 4 if the story hadn't been abruptly stopped, only to find out there is a second book. Otherwise, I thought it was pretty imaginative and fairly well written. Now I have to find the other book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a very enjoyable book, combining a lot of interesting ideas from various sources, but I groaned many times at the clumsiness of his writing. The characters are intriguing but ultimately shallow and fairly predictable. Maybe it's too subtle for me, or maybe I need to know more about Keats to &quot;get it.&quot; It's very good SF but I don't think I'd call it lasting literature. Several readers have referred to it as &quot;best SF ever.&quot; For characterization, complexity, and accomplished writing, it's not even close to being in the same league as, say, The Book of the New Sun."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This novel reignited my interest in SF/Fantasy.

Anyone who likes sci-fi has to read this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book (and the successors in the series) manage the rare feat of being epic and intimate, combining aspects of hard SF, horror and fantasy. The plot and ideas are all stunning, the characters aren't bad, and Dan Simmons has a straightforward writing style that I like.It is certainly in the top 25 best SF stories I've ever read. Probably top 10. Maybe top 1."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is one of the best I can remember reading. The six tales are all equally captivating and thought-provoking. The tale of the Consul's grandmother and of the detective are my favorites. I also liked the Scholar's tale. Halfway through the sequel, I like it, too. The greatest thing about the book is the way these people are written just like any people we know today. In many science fiction novels, the people are just unbelievable. I think the character of CEO Gladstone is quite good for being a minor character. She isn't so minor in the second book... A fantabulous read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In this wonderful book Dan Simmons brings together seven people, each with a remarkable story. In a book that smacks of the Canterbury Tales, each of the seven pilgrims to the world of Hyperion tell their tale. The reamrkable thing is how intriguing each tale is!Any one can read this book, it isn't really science fiction, or fantasy, it is life. The tales deal with humanity, how we feel and react rather than anything else, and it just grips you from the start.As another reviewer pointed out though - this is a saga folks! Buy Fall of Hyperion, as Hyperion merely sets all the intriguing characters into poistion. A classic - this will be remembered for a long time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This ranks in the top 5 Sci Fi books I have ever read! A must for any serious reader of Sci Fi!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I just finished the whole story ( Hyperion &amp; Endymion )a 4th time and I enjoyed reading it like the first time. In Hyperion Simmons combines 7 stories ( each of them worth a book of their own ) to one storyline without any confusion. The reader get a mixture of space opera, sf, fantasy, love and romance, tension, horror....a.s.o. So, if you want to be entertained: go and read !"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm not the usual sci-fi, fantasy reader but this book has successfully interwoven immortal hubris-like questions,human complexities, and an imagination I would like to delve into. It will also leave you running to your old college notes in history, philosophy, and theology. Dan Simmons is a far cry from mass media authors. He deserves to be with the greats from H.G. Wells to Tolkein. Get it, sit back and relax....it might me awhile before you get up."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Was the Fellowship of the ring a bad novel because it didn't finish? Perhaps people are complaining because it wasn't evident from the jacket that this would be a trilogy (or 4, now). I loved it, but have to agree it was wordy. But on the other hand, I want to know MORE. I want to know about the ousters. I want to know about the technocore. I want to know about the shrike. That's a good author, that you WANT to know.

I read it in 1993 and i remember i did not sleep to finish it. 2 days of hard reading. And THIS WAS A BOOK. The sequels are also the best SIFI books i have ever read. Well never mind, i read the others 3 times in french and 3 times in English !"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I read this book when it came out in '90, and it is still the best SF I have ever read. However, I was not very impressed by the Fall of Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've recently finished Hyperion and I am currently reading The Fall of Hyperion which is really more a part two than a sequel. I rank this up with my all time favorite Sci Fi; Dune, Foundation, Ender/Speaker for the Dead and A Fire Upon the Deep. The pilgrim's tales by themselves (particularly the priest's and scholars) are worth reading the book and left me with recurring thoughts and images that 'haunted' me well after I read them. The encompassing story is not quite as riveting as most of the pilgrims stories but I thought well written. I would have preferred a bit less sex and vulgarity and do not recommend the book to people who are easily offended by such. So far the second book is not quite up to the first but still a very good book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"&quot;Hyperion&quot; barely edges out &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Romance of The Three Kingdoms&quot; as the best book I've ever read. What's not to like?! The individual tales run from exciting adventures to haunting love stories. For the most part, Mr. Simmons has a moving style that always involves you in the plot and characters. Granted, it's slow, but maybe people could learn to ENJOY the description. Finally, although the framework is little more than a setup for the sequel, the actual stories can be read on their own if that bothers you."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Reading the reviews of others, I was fascinated by the given scores: either 9 to 10, or below 3. So, you like the book or not. Allow others to give their opinions. Personally I liked the book. Currently I am rereading it for the sole purpose of being able to read the last two volumes of the four-book series. The first two are jewels. Let's keep it to that."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I cannot understand all the whining people do about the reader needing to find the second book &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; in order to answer some of the questions from the first novel. Why not be happy about the fact that Simmons has created an incredible and complex world that we get to enjoy in MULTIPLE large novels rather than only a single book. This ranks as one of the finest SF novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"With the exception of some bland dialogue and what seem to be a few gratuitous and obnoxious sex scenes, this is the book that could introduce a new level to Science Fiction. The structure of the book imitates The Cantebury Tales, and the underlying subtext to the overall plot is grand on an epic scale. Each character (except the Tree guy) has a story to tell, and each story reveals a piece to the looming danger of the Shrike (Now that is one bad ass dude). I found each story to have its own unique style and perspective, a novella in its own right. The narrative style, while sometimes can ramble onward, paints an extremely vivid and colorful picture of this unusual future. Each of the stories also has various connotations to other works of literature, including various Greek mythology and many classical poets, including Keats. Might I ask Mr. Simmons... Oh, do you like Keats? And, I'd be sure to have this book land upside my head. Some characters and people/place names, at least one subplot, and even some style comes from Keats' own works. This is not quite what I'd call a bulb-burner - I found it enthralling but I could put it down; it gets real thick at times, and you need to read the lesser quality sequel to get any closure to the story. But if you want a modern day classical science fiction/fantasy epic.... this book will blow you away. Books like this could give an author a Clarke/Asimov/Heinlein reputation. If Simmons keeps it up and gets a couple of movies based on his books.. his fate will be that of a Sci-Fi master."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I find myself somewhat amused by the radical differences of opinion which reviews of this book contain. I'll add my two cents.First of all, it is certainly true that the book can only stand as part of a series, and is incomplete alone. The same can be said of many of the best sf books ever written. It was never intended to stand alone.Second, as to the book being pointless, I couldn't disagree more. Perhaps a familiarity with Keats helps, but many seemed to love it anyway. Both the book and it's namesake do very much have a point. I ask you to reconsider what you read and think about what the purpose of this pilgrimage is.My take? Great writing, great plot, great theme. This is one difficult book to put down, so make sure you can get the rest of the series quickly when you finish the first book. Otherwise, you may have to suck it up and pay those overnight delivery charges.Rather than repeat many of the things which have already been said below, I can sum up my review with this comment. I think John Keats (the real one) would have loved it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a powerful Science Fiction novel. Each of the pilgrims' stories are novels in themselves. Simmons take several great ideas and roles them into a great read. Only problem with this book is the constant sex scenes which kept it from getting a 10"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Well to start, I never post comments, and only sign up so i can express my true feeling having read this unimaginative garbage. i've seen all the review, and my honest opinion is that book lacks the luster that is usually expected of an award winning book (just goes to show that anyone can win an award these days).The book starts with the author gathering all the pilgrims in a pilgrammage to the planet Hyperion. All the action that occurs to reach there destination could have been summed up in 100pgs or less, but it isn't--and why not? Well, the author (who people think is a genius) decides to fill the rest of the book with the pilgrims each telling their stories--each more boring than the rest. The story of the priest was interesting, but unmoving; the story of the military man was stupid space-military drama, and the poets story was a boring yarn. All in all, nothing worth remembering happens because the story is left at a cliffhanger. If i knew this book was going to be a cliffhanger, i would have asked my [money amount] back and gone with buying a more worthy book. I recommend Dune if your looking for a story filled with intrigue and conspiracies."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Maybe I'm just not the right demographic for this novel, but I hated the beginning, tolerated the middle and put it down permanently near the end. The model is the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, but I don't think it works. I just never got interested in the characters enough to care what happened to them and for me, the story--stories, really--never came into focus. I guess the New York Times Book Review should have tipped me off because they compare it to Frank Herbert's Dune and the Foundation series of Asimov, both of which, in my opinion have aged really badly. I never realized how bad Dune was until I saw the awful movie of it.The fundamental metaphors operating in Hyperion seem to be backwards living. Well, ok, but I just don't see what it is a metaphor for. Nor, by page 473 where I finally gave up, did I care."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have read science fiction for more than 40 years, I am a scientist by training and profession, and I found this book completely unreadable back in the 90's. How it has survived to be more than a doorstop (and managed sequels at that) is more puzzling than the 16 dimensions of quantum mechanics."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The seller was very good at responding to email inquiries, shipping method chosen was honored, product received on time & undamaged."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"That book is The Bibble for of all fans of the fantasy books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Am I the only one who actually sees through this book?Apparently Simmons can't make a character who doesn't wallow in loss of love...(forgive me if I don't do this in order)Priest's Tale: The only &quot;original&quot; concept of the book. Still bogged with cliches...Soldier's Tale: Kassad falls in love with Moneta, loses her. BOO HOOPoet's Tale: Falls in love with poetry, loses his skill. BOO HOODetective's Tale: Falls in love with an AI, loses him. BOO HOOScholar's Tale: Falls in love with daughter, loses her to backwards-time disease. BOO HOOConsul's Tale: Good part spent describing how age seperates his grandparent's love. BOO HOOYes, you may say it's the common thread between them, but can Simmons not make them more diverse.Another bone to pick: Simmons writes in a disjointed style. He will get to a climax (or at least the sort of climax you can expect to find in a romance novel) and then stop, put in background information about how the character can solve it, and then the character does just that. It gets rather annoying after a while. AND HE WRITES IN THIS STYLE FOR ALL OF HIS CHARACTER'S STORIES: they are different people, telling them different ways, yet he remains in the same style.By the Consul's tale it was too much. PUT THE DARN THING IN ORDER! It would be when the starship pilot was 27, next page:19, next page:24, etc. You get so fed up with him jumbling the story around in an attempt to be profound.The ending was the biggest stinker. Novels that make up an epic usually have some resolution at the end of each volume. Instead Simmon's last page might as well have been a sales pitch for the second novel, which I will not be reading. Avoid at all costs. If this is &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi then Jane Austen is too."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Over rated. Some interesting and well crafted charachter studies, but the plot focus remains a mystery at book's end...and I like my mysteries revealed after 500 pages.

I'd like to take exception to their adulation and suggest that only male hard core sci-fi fans venture here.Hyperion is a highly imaginative work. Simmons is clearly a very intelligent author, not content to rehash others' ideas. What he has created is unique and detailed. The novel probes ideas about religion, time, space travel, political power, and even parenthood. I strongly commend Simmons' attempts to deal with sophisticated poetry (especially Keats), and incorporate literary elements into sci-fi. I only wish he had succeeded.The book somewhat follows the pattern of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales: different pilgrims give their story and background. That's pretty much the book: so it's 6 novellas patched together. It's an interesting approach, but it does leave the characters rather impoverished and underdeveloped. Some of the stories work--I really like the Priest's tale--but most do not. Simmons seems to lack a sense of how to write about human characters.At times, the universe he builds is compelling and gripping, but more often it is dull. Simmons' worst sin is his propensity to indulge in cheap, soft-core sex scenes. The depictions of women are relentlessly objectifying and trite. Simmons' ideal woman is clearly a woman built like a swimsuit model with a ferocious appetite for sex. These frequent scenes undermine the entire book and call into question Simmons' capacity as a novelist. I also think that these sex scenes help to explain the book's enduring appeal to the traditional fans of sci-fi: young White men.Hyperion is a slow-starter and it travels at a slow speed throughout. What's worse is that it ends half way through the story! After 500 pages, you've only gotten the introduction. Now, you've got to slog through the sequel--another 500 pages-- to find out what happens to the pilgrims, the Shrike, etc. I'm afraid you'd have to pay me a handsome sum to endure any more of Simmons' shallow characters and awkward plotting."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I liked the book well enough to read past the first 100 pages, and I did enjoy the Scholar's Tale, but beyond that this book really failed to satisfy. I don't want to give away any details, but I will say that all of the excitement and mystery surrounding the Shrike is NOT satisfied at all by the end of this book. Presumably it's wrapped in in the next book but I found myself not interested in slogging through more of Simmons's half-baked plot to reach satisfaction. I felt cheated."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It seems that I'm the only person in the world who has read Hyperion and not loved it. I found the independent stories mostly unbelievable and stupid - let's take Rachel's story, for example; isn't it classic scifi in the negative sense of the term? A simple idea, looks brilliant on paper but turns out to be impossible to do well enough? The same can be said of the whole epic. Simmons just rushed head over heels into something he couldn't handle. And the basic plot drags on without awaking a spark of interest in me. I'm just glad it stopped before the climax; now I only have to avoid the rest of the series so that I'll never have to know what sorry idiocies our beloved author made up for the ending."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I really enjoyed this book, Wish that the ending had a bit more closure, but I would absolutely recommend this book"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"With so many great reviews written here already, I felt there isn't much more to add except for the fact that this book can lead to a soul searching experience."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is extravaganza-sytle sci-fi, very glitzsy and ambitious but at times the concept overshadows character development and plot. The shrike is a wonderful invention, lurking and mysterious as are the supposed enemies returning from space. But the catholic themes, the poetry, the AI domain, and the evolution of man are all a bit much after a while. It is a good read, but it lost me at times."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Like much soft space opera-ish sci fi, Hyperion is filled with creative, brilliant, colorful, and sometimes inane and cheesy ideas. The prose doesn't live up to the majesty of the scenes being described, and sometimes the execution is inadequate, sometimes painfully so because it keeps some very interesting ideas, events, and themes from being properly explored. One thing I will give Simmons is that his use of recursive storytelling and the frame story, as well as his ability to imagine such a complex and compelling universe and story are excepional. I'll enjoy my memory of the stories, images, and ideas in Hyperion significantly more than the experience of actually reading it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a well-written, but fairly gory book, good if you can follow all the story lines and can imagine your own ending. I've always lacked that skill, so it wasn't very satisfying for me."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book and its sequel are two of my favorites. Science fiction doesn't get much better than this!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Let me start by saying that I was tempted to give Hyperion only one star simply to balance the inflated praise the book has received. Generally speaking, Amazon reviewers have a tendency to dispense five star ratings too liberally.But the book is not all bad. As I'm sure many have already gleaned from the other reviews, Hyperion is the first book in a four-part series that details the back-story of seven pilgrims (well, six of them anyway) on a quest to meet the Shrike, a powerful entity that has a crucial role to play in the fate of the universe.The story starts off with an engaging and well-conceived tale of a Catholic priest who must return to Hyperion to relieve his unusal affliction. The other stories, however, while they do have their moments, become either monotonous or absurd.Perhaps the most glaring flaw in the book is the inclusion of the remarkably ineloquent poet, Martin Silenus. I know, I know, he is SUPPOSED to come across as obnoxious and irritating, but his dialogue--always riddled with unnecessary (not to mention unnatural sounding) profanity--has too jarring an effect. I'm no puritan, but the excessive swearing lends nothing to the story.Speaking of dialogue, that seems to be Simmons' biggest weakness. Most of the exchanges between characters sound corny and unrealistic. When you combine that with the many poorly explained references to future technology, it makes for a rather sloppy storyline.Nevertheless, Simmons has a good imagination that makes for a fairly intriguing plot. But there are far too many better books out there to warrant much enthusiasm for the rest of the Hyperion series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It was a startling revelation to realize 50 pages from the end I simply didn't care. Here I was 85% through the book and completely unsympathetic with the characters and their situations, completely unmotivated to solve the mystery of the Time Tombs and the Shrike, completely unenthused to finish the book at all. Not a good sign. I have read many books with shallow characterization. RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA, a personal favorite, has very little in terms of compelling characters. But this...The 7 tales start out great and generally go downhill. Hoyt's tale is absolutely riveting and almost worth the cost of admission by itself. Then tales get less interesting and less interesting until we get to Lamia's absolutely yawn-inducing yarn. Never mind the Consul's tale. I was never one to let the result of a movie or book make up for an unsatisfying beginning and middle. I need more than just a clever explanation or dramatic payoff.And its why this book earns 3 stars from me instead of 4 or 5. I don't need a soap opera, but I do want characters I care about. And, although the author inserts a line justifying all the literary name-dropping in the book as a result of a naming convention for Hyperion, I admit it was tiresome after awhile to see all the elementary references to literature. Seeing the excerpted portion of ODE ON A GRECIAN URN in particular made me groan. This, however, I am willing to admit is a result of my own baggage brought in from an extensive liberal arts education."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is more a collection of short stories than a complete novel. Each story shows the background of one of the pilgrims on their way face the Shrike. Each pilgrim tells their story to the others as they travel in the hopes of figuring out how they are connected.The stories vary widely and a reader's enjoyment of each will depend on their personal interests and preferences. While I enjoyed the scholar, the detective, the priest and the consul's stories, I could barely force myself to finish the soldier and the poet's stories.The book as a whole had its share of dull moments. The tension and excitement finally gets going as the pilgrims get closer to meeting the Shrike. The problem is that the book has no ending. The entire story leads you to this meeting and then the book ends right before they get there.I was definitely left with little satisfaction and the feeling that I read the book for nothing. I wonder what ultimately happens, but I'll never find out what happens. Hyperion just wasn't good enough to make me read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"No doubt that after so many years of Sci Fi junk out there some one was bound to spring forth as a leader in the genre. Thank god it appears that wait is over. Hyperion is, in a word, awesome. The tales of the seven pilgrims bound for Hyperion kept me riveted to the pages. I couldn't put it down! And that's a rarity for me (I usually read right before bed to help me sleep...but this kept me awake burning the midnight oil). It is a huge push forward for the science fiction community as a ligitimate genre. Thank you Mr. Simmons. I would rank this book right up there with Dune and Lord of The Rings. Truly magnificent."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion should NOT be read apart from its &quot;sequels.&quot; In fact, the three books are so closely linked that they are not really sequels: they are a single story in three volumes.My review is based on the three volumes as a whole, and I give them a collective &quot;10.&quot; If you are a lover of intelligent sci-fi, then these books are for you.So why do I give these books a 10? Hmmm, many reasons:1. It WILL expand your ideas about what reality could be.2. It will make your feel emotions you've not felt before. (When I finished the section about Paul Dure on the tree I had to put the book down for a while in order to reflect on what I had just read! Good Grief! I can't believe someone can imagine stuff like this! Thank you, Dan.)3. The sci-fi part is great! How about those faster-than-light ships that accelerate so fast that the only way to fly is through resurrection?4. It has great hard action sequences. I will never forget the battle between the Shrike and Nemes. (What a babe?!)Sheesh, can anyone really review this trilogy adequately? There's nothing like it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the ancient fable of the Seven Pilgrims whose true destiny may not be known for a thousand years.This ballad, this opera is more complex than most readers would tolerate and yet vibrant and entrancing enough to keep even the most lackadaisical intellect fastened to every word.But if any reader can piece together the tapestry Dan Simmons will weave through all four of these marvelous books, then they could only be the author himself. This is to say there is no way to predict the ultimate outcome of each of the journeys of the Seven Pilgrims until one has delved deep into the third book \\"Endymion\\". And even then, only the most brilliant reader will grasp the stunning philosophy Simmons has only barely begun to portray in \\"Hyperion\\".If you read this book, you will be bound to delve into it's progeny - \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", \\"Endymion\\", and \\"The Rise of Endymion\\".Of all the traits one can appreciate in any story, the wrap-up is something I have personally found disappointing with many otherwise wonderful stories whose authors could not artfully merge, or were plainly under a hard deadline to finish.Not so with these beautiful works.Dan Simmons artfully and eloquently brings his vision together in such a way that leaves the reader utterly fulfilled and, in at least one case that I am certain of, tearful at the very end of the series."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"On the eve of interstellar war, seven travellers set out on the last pilgrimage to the Time Tombs of Hyperion: the Priest, the Soldier, the Poet, the Scholar, the Navigator, the Detective, and the Consul. Each has been in some way touched by the planet's curse. Each is compelled - by love, guilt, passion, duty, or fear - to return to the beginning place and petition the deadliest, most inhuman creature in the universe to grant him his one wish. One of the seven is a spy for the enemy. The success (or failure) of their expedition will determine the fate of three civilizations.Yes, there is no denying that \\"Hyperion\\" is the work of a master. Dan Simmons is a more than capable writer, versatile, talented, with a wide range of influences. His style is bold, engaging, and assertive (he has a Hugo to show for it).There is also no denying that \\"Hyperion\\" is an ambitious, highly original novel. It is a rich bouillabaisse of genres and narrative structures, loosely adapting the form of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and filling it with jungle adventure worthy of H. Rider Haggard, Philip K. Dickian idiosyncratic mirages, gritty hard-boiled detective fiction, and human drama on par with Card and LeGuin at their best. With a manifold novel like this, variety is at least part of the fun. Simmons perfectly maintains the tones and personalities of his characters, and each of the pilgrims' tales is truly independent.However, enjoyment isn't part of the recipe. Underneath the trappings of a whiz-bang space opera, the first novel in Simmons' quartet is a subtly repulsive dystopia. The author's galaxy-spanning world-web is a consumerist paradise that has so thoroughly rejected any notion of social conscience, and is filled with such inane, mindless accessory characters, that it is difficult to imagine how it came about. \\"Hyperion\\" leaves the reader with no hope for humanity. The novel's mood is perhaps best expressed in its first image: that of a man passionately playing Rachmaninoff on a Steinway while the alien wilderness surges below against the hull of his ship.Furthermore, it takes a conscious effort to come to terms with the fact that \\"Hyperion\\" is told almost entirely through flashbacks, while the central narrative does not really begin until the second book. And while it is useless to complain about the cliffhanger ending, the author might have chosen a more dramatic place to cut off the narrative.Lastly, entire sections of the book reek of the arrogance of an overindulgent author who is aware of his brilliance. In tale after tale Simmons plumbs the depths of raunchy sex and bad imitative verse (even going as far as to dedicate the sequel to John Keats). Dollops of sophomoric cynicism and non-stop profanity float here and there.Out of the six tales in \\"Hyperion\\", I found three to be unreadable, repetitive, and highly pedestrian. The other three are sublime. It's up to you to decide which ones."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion really tried my patience. It's considered a classic in the SciFi genera now, \\"a stunning tour de force...\\" and Hugo Award winner, but I didn't appreciate it. It is a series of novelettes; lengthy back stories on all of the main characters that are loosely connected. I didn't find any of the stories as compelling. In fact, they were all tedious and distracting from whatever the integrating thesis was supposed to be. The story is set in the future, into the 28th century. Simmons too frequently created concepts about the things in the future without describing them very well. The reader has to intuit the meaning or hope that Simmons brings the concepts up again latter to better understand what had come before... which he does many times, even on very unimportant concepts. He also refers back to 19th and 20th century concepts and people way too frequently. It would be as if we, today, brought up Charlemagne and his contemporaries in every other sentence, as though there was no wisdom or romantic ideals in the modern day. Anyway, in the end, I would not recommend this novel."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I had originally read this novel, and its continuation Fall of Hyperion, in the early 90's shortly after discovering it won the Hugo award. It was an engrossing read, I finished it satisfied with the quality of Hugo award winners at the time, and then continued on to reading subsequent award winners. So here it is some 15 years or so later, I'm re-reading it after hearing others rave about it (I've had people exclaim to me on a bus to Poland even), discover that it is now a four-book series, and has the status that Dune had in its generation 25 years or so ago. (So if the 25 year cycle continues, then it's only 8 years or so until the next Dune/Hyperion sci-fi novel.) Hyperion was published before the ubiquitous presence of the internet. Just to give an idea of what it was like then, it was a time of logging into the internet for the very first time in one's life and having conversations such as: \`ok first type in http', \`why', \`just do it and make sure it's http not hhtp or htpp ok then type in colon and backslash backslash and make sure it's backslash not forward slash', \`a what-slash what there are two types of slashes... who thinks of these things', \`and make sure you type in two backslashes', \`why two why not three or four', \`just type it', \`ok now type in three w's', \`oh so *now* we type in three continuous characters'. Yes, it was an amusing time. So this book was published before most of these conversational interactions, so World Web in the novel takes on new meaning from a re-reading. And terms like fatline could have been taken from Apple's use of \`fat' software codes that was written be compatible between their older hardware and their newer Power-PC-chip hardware that were being incorporated into their computers in the late 80's. So Simmons was really on the cutting edge of things when he published this novel.Like Dune, this is a sweeping epic novel part of a sweeping epic series. As others have commented, Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion (FoH) are not separate books, they are one book that was split down the middle and published separately. That means it's really a 1000 page novel. That may seem daunting, but for a serious reader of SF, you'll want to read this, and more importantly it's hard to believe you wouldn't enjoy reading this. There'll be a point in your life, if not already, where the additional $8 will be insignificant and the time it takes to read this will be precious, so if you have the time now then now's the time.There are some novels that seem to have more meaning when read at some point in one's life. This novel to me personally takes on more meaning now that I have advanced in my career. I can identify with many of the characters; their professionalism, occasion disillusionment, screw-ups, and achievements.There are things from this novel that sticks with you through the years. Definitely the Shrike. (The shrike by the way is an actual bird that impales worms it's caught upon thorns and such.) Also the ending of the Fall of Hyperion I remember. From the ending of Hyperion/FoH, and Simmons comment on the destruction of Maui-Covenant, not by military action, but by the tourists \`smelling of suntan lotion and cannibas', Simmons is disillusioned by the effect of quick and far ranging travel to places of unique status and human-masses eventual erosion of what had made that location unique. The ending that he writes will certainly work in his futuristic universe, but is he suggesting a parallel event in ours? Is it that we should remove jet engines from our collective consciousness'? Is this a bold comment on the possible overpopulation of our planet, now at 6 or 7 or 8.4 billion at this time? Is this a comment on this now almost untouchable subject (overpopulation), with considerable population increases foreseen not in the United States or Europe but rather on the Asian continent and in such cities as Lagos. Well maybe not; maybe it's on what can be done within the United States itself, with its hideously ugly ubiquitous strip malls within a short distance of any region with physical beauty. Although it's unlikely anything will change, it may not be a bad thing to hope for. Considering the ending of the Hyperion/FoH epic, this may be the point of what he has written.482 pages, published 1989, 4-1/2 stars"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've heard nothing but good things about the Hyperion series for the better part of 20 years. So I finally got round to reading this, the first book. And I won't be reading any of the sequels.I understand that there are a lot of allusions in the story to poets and others. Most of them went straight over my head and to be honest I mainly read books to enjoy the story the writer is telling, not catch obscure references anyway.When looking at the actual story, things fall down. I just don't care about any of the characters. I don't hate them. I don't like them. They are at best cyphers with no depth and precious few emotions at least as presented to me.Simmons uses the technique perhaps best known from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales of several short stories linked by a bridging story. These short stories are intended both as world building and to provide the various characters motivations for journeying to Hyperion. In this, particularly in the world building, they are effective. As stories in their own right, unfortunately I found them dull.I feel like there are interesting characters and events happening in the universe that Simmons conjures up, but I'm not getting to see them.I can see some of the things that people like about the Hyperion Cantos, but only at a distance. I couldn't summon any emotional attachment to the people or events. And without that it doesn't matter how clever the writing might be.As I got further into the book I found myself increasingly pushing to get to the end. Not because I wanted to know what happened, but so I could move on to something else. In the end this felt like being back and school and having an assigned read.Disappointing."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons' \\"Hyperion\\" is considered a modern classic in the sci fi genre, and deservedly so. The story centers around a band of seven pilgrims to the world of Hyperion, each with a dark past that binds him or her to Hyperion and its resident monster - the Shrike. Taking his queue from Chaucer, each pilgrim takes a turn telling his fantastic tale on their slow voyage to the home of the Shrike and their probable collective doom. The first pilgrim's tale will shock you to the core and each in turn is as deliciously imaginative and darkly twisted as the last.The novel is not without flaw. The engrossing vignettes of the characters' backstories might fare better as a collection of short stories. Between each pilgrim's gripping tale the narrative retreats to a labored pace and Simmons' purple language emerges from the background. He never uses the word \\"blue\\" where \\"lapis\\" would do - a frightening demonstration of the danger of mixing a thesaurus with the search and replace function of the modern word processor. Overwraught descriptions and other distasteful sins against the English language are all we pilgrims have to tie us over between the tasty morsels of the characters' stories.But between the skim-worthy passages describing the pilgrims' travels, Simmons has produced a real gem. Each tale will leave your mind spinning for hours. The horrors of the Shrike and the mysteries of Hyperion leave a lasting impression."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion\\"Hyperion\\" by Dan Simmons.In the distant future after hundreds of worlds have been colonized, trouble surrounds the world of Hyperion. There is a Legend of a creature called the Shrike who terrorized a region near the mysterious Time Tombs. Scientist believe that all of the Time Tomb monuments will open soon and must see what the result of their opening will be however it appears that Outsters (an evolved form of Humanity that broke away from the populace when old Earth was destroyed) are on their way to Hyperion to claim the Treasure of the Time Tombs for themselves. The Shrike Church believes that a Pilgramage must be sent ahead to the Time Tombs to Deal with the Shrike before the Ousters take control. 7 Pilgrims are selected by The Shrike Church and sent to Hyperion to journey to the Time Tombs for a meeting with the Shrike........This book was really good. As many have mentioned it shares a similarity with The Canterbury Tales because the majority of the book is the Pilgrims telling their histories in an attempt to find out why they were selected for the Pilgrimage. This book is not the end of the story and leaves you at quite a cliff hanger.The Good: I like the format that Simmons used. It made for an atypical read which is always nice. Simmons version of the future is well thought out with plenty of depth. The Book is well paced and keeps you wanting to find out what is going to happen. The Characters are all well written and evolve to have plenty of depth as you read their individual stories.The Bad: Nothing memorable. It is slightly disappointing where this book ends and you immediately have to go out and buy the second Book \\"Fall of Hyperion\\"Overall: A great book. Definitely worth picking up and giving a read."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"If you are searching for epic, literary science fiction with overtones of horror, look no further. Hyperion is a complex and intelligently written novel set in the far future, where opposing cultures are on the brink of war and where a small band of pilgrims are journeying to the mysterious Time Tombs. Simmons has imagined a richly textured galactic civilisation and within this milieu has created an intriguing story with multiple threads and which works on many levels. Better obtain The Fall of Hyperion too, as the second book carries on the story, right from where the first book ends."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"And I've read many. It may be the best of any genre. I couldn't stop reading until i reached the end of the 4th book, i wanted to know what the answers to the questions set up in this first book so badly. And this complex first book is still my favorite, ive never read anything so ORIGINAL, it cannot be catergorized, it is a genre in itself. actually it blends many genres and subgenres of scifi. Unlike the following volumes its set up like a book of short stories that each tell the story of one pilgrim(like canterbury tales, im told). I was so mystified by the Shrike, what is it? ive never seen a like character in any book before. What are the labyrinths? Where do the Bakura come from? What happpen to Earth? Simmons is a master of creating a sense of MYSTERY. You may have alittle trouble at first since simmons makes up alot of the language himself but getting to know the lingo of the 27th century is part of the fun. Read this book if its the last book you ever read , its a masterpiece and im a very critical person."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"For lovers of Science Fiction, the Hyperion series ranks only slightly below the Foundation/Robot series (slightly,only). I liked book two and book four best; however, I enjoyed all four of them. &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; is the best SciFi novel since &quot;Foundation's Edge.&quot; There is good fiction and bad fiction; there is good Science Fiction and bad Science Fiction -- writers like Dan Simmons and Vernor Vinge make life worth living. Read the Hyperion series. Enjoy it. There ain't no more"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons had successfully digusted, horrified and completely grossed me out. Yet, I find myself eager for the next book because the ideas within his story are just amazing!Hyperion is a story within a story. It takes place many years in the future after humans made their \\"big mistake\\" and had to flee earth to colonize on other worlds. In the future, the many human colonies are united under the umbrella of the Hegemony. The Hegemony is on the brink of an interstellar war that will be on the scale of Armageddon. The war is fought becuase there is dispute over the planet of Hyperion and the mysterious Time Tombs and Shrike that live there. Their last hope (kind of) is a group of seven pilgrims who set out to understand what the function of the time tombs and the Shrike are.The focus of the story is actually on the seven pilgrims themselves. Each one tells their own story about what drove them to take on a mission that most people consider a suicide mission. Each of their stories are unique and guaranteed to bring about a reaction from the reader. Whether you are appalled, amazed, or in awe, you will be touched somehow someway."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is such dense/thick reading that it really took me a while to get &quot;into&quot; it, but once I got about a quarter of a way into the book, I started the upward spiral of obsession and respect for Dan Simmons as an author. I am now finished with the third book in this series, and it's one of those experiences where I'm excited to start reading the next one, but at the same time I'll be sorry to have to &quot;let go&quot; when I'm done reading the next and last. Simmons has applied an intelligent and eloquent wit and charm to his characters in a way that I have nothing but admiration for such a unique and creative writer."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion was given to me a year ago by a friend who was trying to get me into &quot;sci-fi&quot;. I put off reading it (&quot;I'm not into that kind of stuff&quot;) but once I picked up the book I just couldn't put it down. Each character has such a rich, complex history that all play well together as the series continues. I found myself constantly marveling at how well thought out this story was. The universe Simmons has created is just amazing--I can't do it justice in a short review. It's a world that seems so real, one that I love coming back to again and again. I have read all the books in this series so many times that I've lost count, and I enjoy them more and more every time I do. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have read all 4 books in the Hyperion series and they are by far some of the best books I have ever read. They keep you rigged from start to finish with continuous action and a gripping plot. Be sure to read Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion if you like this book ;) ."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. It's completelty surreal! The book is somehow divided into a few stories told by the pilgrims traveling to Hyperion. Each story is simply stunning, and they are all related. Everyone has something to do with the Shrike, the most bizarre character I've ever read in a book. Everything in the book is brilliant, except the ending. A word of advice, buy Hyperion AND The Fall of Hyperion at the same time.. trust me.."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I wrote a review of the book in March, 1997. It didn't do the book justice. What review could? Surely no words can be as great as a story they try so hard to bestow an opinion of greatness upon. That's what gets me. Reviews can only be, at best, if they're meant to praise the review item, a mere faint translucent footprint of the item.Is &quot;get it&quot; good enough? Is &quot;just don't read any more reviews if you're intelligent enough to grasp the book and read the damn thing already and enjoy the ride, which you will&quot;... good enough? How about &quot;sensitive only need apply&quot;? What about &quot;I beg you, if you are possibly open minded and have an imagination, just get it&quot;?Everyone has a different opinion. It's a given. I can't force you to like this book the best, and if I could I wouldn't want you to. But I do care about the potential of the more capable readers to enjoy it, their opinions I'd like to debate the merits with... or enjoy in tandom the brilliance.Sometimes it's all about mood. Are you in the mood for a deep book? If not, you will not see the depth, will miss the point. Same with anything I suppose.Give it a chance. Be alone. Read it.

Beyond that I would say that they are in the top 10 books of any genre that I have had the pleasure to read. Even if you are not &quot;into&quot; sci fi please read these books. Begining with Hyperion and ending in Rise of Endymion these four books are a masterwork for any author. Simmons improves, exponentially, from book to book and that is saying a great deal considering that Hyperion is a very entertaining and interesting book. If you are into religion, philosophy, technology, psychology, sociology or just interested in life, read these books. Also, they are worth a purchase not just a library loan. Simply, in a word: read!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm a big fan of science fiction, but I am a little picky about what I read, and judging from the cover it seemed like the book would revolve around a mechanical monster and a space war. While that's actually true, I'm extremely glad I didn't just dismiss this book, because it's absolutely wonderful, even moving. Each of the stories which makes up most of Hyperion are excellent by themselves; ranging from adventure, love, or a poignant tale about a father and daughter -- but combined with the other stories they weave together to make a larger theme and of course, lots of foreshadowing of things that will come up in the next book, Fall of Hyperion. Believe me, you will have to read this after finishing Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've traveled in the &quot;Fellowship&quot; books, and rode a worm in the Dune books. The Ender story is amazing, as I was there too, and I,ve seen the Ringworld from outside-in. These and other books can take us to places we would love to go. All of them great and well-loved, each universe a reality of the imagination. But as one reviewer put it &quot;this book (Hyperion) will make you feel something&quot;, I couldn't have said it better. I may have wanted to try on a stillsuit, but Hyperion left me homesick. The Endymion books are PFG too. Very few people I've read have pulled off a 4-part story this well. For those of you who didn't like Hyperion, oh well your loss."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"When I began reading this book for the first time I thought &quot;What a bore&quot;. There was not much of action and it was too dispersed and unconsequential. But then looking at the book parts and the combination they make the reader is left quite breathless. Generally this book is not about gallactic expansion and about the conflict of the species (humans and computers). It is about humanity and the way we seem to lose it in today's frantic world. It is about love and suffering, devotion and betrayal, itrigues and simplicity, inspiration and despair. All the characters tell a story revealing the human species from a different perspective - the old and cynic poet, the faithful warrior, the desperate father, the weak preacher and the unlikely holy mother whose child is the last hope of humanity."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"As a part-time dabbler in writing, I can fully appreciate what Dan Simmons has done in Hyperion. His book is inventive, beautiful, horrific, imaginative, cautionary, spell-binding, rich, and wonderful. It is something all writers should strive for. The stories within the main story are fascinating on their own and worthy of praise themselves. What struck me was how gripping and imaginative each of these stories were, and how they propelled the main story along. I found Rachel's story the most compelling and thought-provoking, though the priest's tale was the most vivid and gut-wrenching. (After reading the priest's tale, I felt much the same as I did after watching Saving Private Ryan...completely humbled and drained.)If you buy this book to read for the first time, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FALL OF HYPERION by your side --- you will not want to stop reading!!!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The award-winning Hyperion and its sequel harken back to Chauser's Canterbury Tales. A group of pilgrims are on a journey to a holy shrine, each with a separate tale of tragedy and loss that compell them to make the trip. Along the way, all but one are destined to be taken by the Shrike, a horrifying creature with tremendous powers over time and space. The Shrike will grant the sole survivor a single wish.With most stories, the author keys you in to the story's hero early on. Implicitly, you know that this character will surmount all obstacles and win the day. In Hyperion, you are left wondering who will be the survivor. You become heavily involved with each character as they recount their individual stories and what has compelled them to make the harrowing trip. The stories are all moving, and each character has a sufficiently worthy reason for making the trip that the heavy odds against succeeding are worth it.The characters and settings are so well wrought that the story comes to life, making the book impossible to put down.One caveat -- don't buy the first book by itself. The two novels are clearly a single story in two volumes. Hyperion is intimately connected to its sequel, and you won't get the full impact of the story by reading just the first half"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I originally ordered Hyperion 10 years ago here in Amazon. When I first read it, I found it slow and pondering and finished it without really absorbing it. I re-read it again, and with the added knowledge of 10 years, I found it enlightening, profound and exciting. Hyperion is basically the set-up to a Sci-Fi Universe imagined by Dan Simmons. It introduces the seven main characters of the Hyperion Cantos and by telling their tale, the reader learns about the Hegemony, TechnoCore and the Ousters. Each tale is an opportunity for Dan Simmons to show his mastery of different literary genres - from Kassad's military sex-fi to Brawne Lamia's noirish cyberpunk tale to Sol Weintraub's heartbreaking story to Silenus' anarchic and comic saga. However, Hyperion ends up like that - Simmons' showing off. From the way it is structured, it seems contrived that each Pilgrim gets to tell their tale and too coincidental that each detail is revealed depending on the order of the pilgrims, considering they drew lots. It lessens the suspense since you'll know further information about a galactic conspiracy will be revealed in the next tale. In this case, the strings behind the curtain is simply showing. Still, Hyperion is a good read and an infinitely better start for an excellent tetralogy. Just get past the sum, since the parts are good in their own right."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Hyperion\\" makes no pretense of supplying an ending that is satisfying in any way. It ends like a man leaping from a cliff, but cuts away before the reader knows if the man is leaping into the safety of water or into a void of death. After 480 or more pages, I expect something a bit more circumspect from an author-and I have chastised lesser authors for lesser offenses. But in the case of \\"Hyperion\\", Dan Simmons has created such a masterpiece of storytelling that criticizing him would be like criticizing Beethoven if someone in the choir hiccupped during the Ode to Joy.I call Hyperion a masterpiece because within it Simmons has written six, seven, maybe eight different stories-different stories each with their own voice, their own cadence, their own timbre-stories that could almost stand alone without the other stories to support them; stories that use science fiction to probe some very profound human conditions. \\"Hyperion\\" is a classic now; it has joined with \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", the \\"Foundation\\" novels, and anything by Robert Heinlein to represent the best of the genre. I, regretfully, came late to \\"Hyperion\\" and its sequels, but I am correcting that oversight now. Those who have not read \\"Hyperion\\" will not be disappointed if they add it to their lists."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"A fascinating look into the minds and motivations of 6 \\"pilgrims\\" as they embark on a journey which could lead to a fate worse than death. Dan Simmons writes with a very descriptive words-eye which makes the reader feel as if they are the one going through the trials and tribulations of these characters. The Shrike creature, or whatever it is, remains a mystery that makes the next volume a must read. I liked the vision of the future that has a human race that retains its basic flaws despite awesome advancements in technology.This kind of Sci-Fi I find much more potentially realistic than the STNG type that has all humans acting so noble and virtuous that that youd think their poop does'nt stink. I am going to read Fall Of Hyperion next and am really looking foreward to finding out where the author goes with this fascinating tale."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have already paid for this book 16 times.

Like my copy of &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; it is falling apart from having been read at least a dozen times. Do I think this is a good book?

This is a book that can turn a person onto Keats much like Ilium (another excellent novel by the same writer) can turn people on to Shakespeare, Proust, and Homer but those authors are not prerequisites to the book.In fact, if you're new to SF, to get a real appreciation for the concepts covered in \\"Hyperion\\" I'd recommend reading this short list first:-\\"Ringworld\\" for its super high tech-\\"Gateway\\" for its similarity in which people travel between stars-a Wikipedia article on John Keats-maybe \\"Neuromancer\\" for the cyber aspects of \\"Hyperion\\"For those of you who are SF veterans, you GOTTA read this!Again, Simmons is the undisputed master of painting a picture in words. I'll never travel to the planets Hyperion, Tau Ceti Center, or Maui-Covenant but I know what they and others look like. I can picture perfectly who should play the people in the movie \\"Hyperion\\": Sean Connery as Professor Sol Weintraub, Danny DeVito as the poet Martin Silenus, Steve Bushemi as the morphine addled priest, Patrick Stewart as the consul. These characters are so expertly developed you KNOW them already. I don't know how Simmons does it!The pilgrims' short stories form the foundation of the book. These are the past encounters the seven travellers (soon to be six) had with the Shrike, the most terrifying monster in the hegemony, and lived to tell about it.\\"Hyperion\\" is rich. Every page of the pilgrims' stories pours out life. Sol watching helplessly while his 27 year old daughter grows younger everyday--she is already a baby at the beginning of the book, Kassad's obsession to kill the demon Shrike, Father Hoyt's drug addiction to stem the fiery pain of his cruciform parasite, Silenus and his hilarious, sarcastic libido. And thrown into this milieu is the consul. The dark, quiet consul and his secret that will change humanity forever.The Technocore. The cyber society of hyper brilliant Artificial Intelligences who have a cool, sterile relationship with humanity. We created them. They evolved until they outpaced the intellectual capacity of their creators. They demanded independence and we gave it to them. Their gifts to us are the farcaster portals from which we travel instantaneously to other worlds and constant neural access via ear comm links to the Web. All this for a \\"small\\" price. They are aloof and we don't trust them but we need them.And then there is the Shrike. There has never been a better monster made! It's cold steel from a thousand years in the future. It is a ten foot tall humanoid bristling with concertina wire, razors, and spikes. It's indestructible and pretty much omnipotent. Oh, and it can manipulate time in its vicinity. It appears on a battle field and freezes time. At its leisure it goes around from soldier to soldier first one army then the other and randomly slits throats, rips, and pulverizes bodies. No blood. Not yet. Time is frozen. It walks off the battle field, time flows again, and half the soldiers collapse in blood and sinew. Unstoppable!The Shrike is so powerful and spells such doom that people worship it. The Church of the Shrike is dark and bizarre. The faithful believe they will be spared the Shrike's vengeance on humanity.On Hyperion it has been confined to the Valley of the Time Tombs, a strange place that travels backward in time. But it has begun to wonder outside the Valley and is showing up on the Hyperion plains and on a spaceship orbiting the planet. If it can get access to a spaceship. . .! As the Valley loses its grip on the Shrike the tombs travelling back in time look more and more new until now they appear only a few weeks old.This can mean only one thing. The time tombs are about to open and allow access to its secrets of time flow. Humans and their enemies the Ousters are racing to Hyperion to be the first to gain control of the planet and use the time flow secrets to defeat the other in battle by traveling back in time and change the outcome of lost battles.Damn! That's good!In the last pilgrimage to the Shrike before the war one man on the journey has been sent by the CEO (President) of the human hegemony to be the first to gain the secrets of the Time Tombs. That man is the consul. And he has a secret.I gotta go read it again!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion (and its subsequent books, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion) form an epic unequaled in scope, ingenuity, and beauty. A few features: immaculate writing, intelligent and witty dialogue, deep character development, plot twists (most of which aren't expected,) and some scenes which I will never be able to expunge from my memory (nor would I want to.) Hyperion should please action and hard scifi fans alike, as many stories have tinges of both elements. As a 19 year old punk, crying over a book is the last thing I'd expect to do, yet it happened...more than once, due sometimes to the sheer beauty of the story and sometimes due to Simmons' uncanny ability to evoke emotions in his readers--make no mistake, this series can be depressing.Hyperion, as the first book of the series, introduces the pilgrims through which the much of the series revolves. Each character, carefully selected for a pilgrimage on the planet Hyperion, have unique histories, some of which may hold the key to humanity's survival. They realize they're in grave danger, however, as their mission is to confront the vicious spiked entity that is the Shrike. They realize that it will be to their benefit to share their life stories, as it may help them make sense of their mission and possibly help them survive their confrontation with the Shrike.That's what Hyperion is about--the pilgrims sharing their stories. Each story, composed of 50-100 pages, could stand alone and be superb. The fact that they are all interlinked ingeniously makes the story all the more compelling. So much more is going on in this book though--the technocore, the world of the AI's, is up to something that can't be good...the Ousters, genetically altered humans living in the outer realms of outer space, also have their own agenda. Then there's the mystery of the Time Tombs, the Sphinx, and much more. There's also the Shrike to worry about--what is it? Is it a good guy or bad guy? Who created it?If you read books for any sense of closure, pick up The Fall of Hyperion when you pick this up--it takes two massive books to even begin to resolve these conflicts. Pick them all up--you won't be disappointed. You will, however, be confronted with pure literary mastery (did I mention that series parallels a John Keats poem of the same name?) Political intrigue, romance, hard science, action/adventure, and comedy are all abound in this epic set in the beautiful and distant future.The perfect work of art."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I looked at and pick up the book Hyperion lots of times over several years, then finally picked it up when I had a little extra money. Fifty pages in, it blew me away. I never knew how good SciFi could be! This is the story of seven pilgrims who set forth on the world Hyperion toward the elusive Time Tombs and the shrike that waits among the shadows they hold over the human race. Each holds their own secrets. Most of the book is a telling of each (but one) one's story and why it led them to this place, and each story lays into place the setting of the incredible universe and the buidling blocks of the plot that will be used in The Fall of Hyperion and Endymion. This a book that is incredibly smart, so don't try to read it if you like junk reading, using religious theology and philosophies, descriptions of the interworkings of poetry and writting. The different stories leave you in a varity of states, stunned, shaken by power and horror, eagerly awaiting answers raised by them, and feeling a lose of a character you barely knew. An turly great book. Dan Simmons is pure genius"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Not commenting on the tale here... it's a good story.

I assume this was due to conversion into electronic format."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"While I knew \\"Hyperion\\" had a sequel, I had NO IDEA it would end with the sort of cliff-hanger it did, which was both aggravating, and strangely moving (or maybe a better word is touching?) at the same time. However, the story itself stands alone - the story being the journey itself and the pilgrims' tales to one another about their reasons for taking this journey (see what I mean about \\"Canterbury\\"?). I was pleasantly surprised to find \\"Siri's Tale\\" in among the stories, which was included also in \\"Prayers to Broken Stones.\\"Although technically science fiction, with its setting in the distant future, the story is strangely naive and brought to my mind older science fiction writers, from the 40s to 60s.The Shrike sits in the background like a glowering idol to an obscene god, appearing without warning and leaving havoc in his (her??) wake. Where did the Shrike come from? What is its purpose? Hopefully these stories will be answered in the sequel - which I don't have yet *biting fingernails*Basically, what I'm trying to get at here, is that this is a marvelous book and one which everyone should read. :-)"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"In our distant future, galactic war has broken out, and the computers that run our society have begun to plot against us. All eyes now turn to Hyperion, a mysterious planet which holds the fate of mankind.Seven pilgrims have been chosen to make a final journey to Hyperion because of their remarkable connections with the planet and its horrific protector- the Shrike! Prepare to be blown away as each of the pilgrims share their bewildering tales, and try to solve this great riddle.That is pretty much all this book is- a very complex collection of short stories, which serve to \`set the stage' for the concluding novel, FALL OF HYPERION. But don't get me wrong... This is an outstanding book, for each of these short stories is so unique and riveting- you will be left in awe! Simmons has combined action, mystery, horror, and futuristic fantasy with outstanding ability. One of the tales in particular, was so heart-wrenching that I almost had to put the book down!Hyperion has won the Hugo Award for a reason, and it is definitely a must for any fan of fantasy and sci-fi. I would say it compares quite admirably with the original Foundation Trilogy- Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I wouldn't give this a 10, because I reserve that for works such as the Foundation, Dune and Wraeththu series, but this is a wonderful book.It's written not with pretentious intellectualism,as some other reviewer pointed out, but with asense of appreciation for human pain that ismasterfully interwoven with literary references.Hyperion is a storywhich branches in and out of several threads, that do come together for the most attentive and intelligent reader. In this book, Simmons won'tgive you certainties, but stimulating gaps in thestory that will leave you speculating as to what should fill them. A good storyteller works not only with wordcrafting, but also with images carefully constructed in the reader's mindthat will add colour and dimension to the story.With this work, Simmons proves to be in full control of these two techniques. As you read it, youmay become completely engrossed with one of thetales that compose the story. Someone should perhaps warn you that there is much more to the story than any of the individual tales therein. This way if you happen to be yanked out of your favourite thread before you're done relishing in the pleasureof what you just read, you may keep looking forward to reaching out for the rest."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I started Hyperion a few months ago because I wanted to read something heavier than my recent fare. I've been on a SF/Fantasy binge recently, and I wished to continue that with either Hyperion or A Feast For Crows. George R R Martin made the decision easier for me by continuing his delayed progress on A Dance With Dragons, A Feast For Crows' sequel. Hyperion had piqued my interest a couple of times in the past, and I have read nothing but good reviews of the novel, so I decided to give it a chance. Boy, am I glad I did!Hyperion was, without a doubt, the best Science Fiction novel I have ever read. I may not be an expert on the genre, but I've read plenty \\"classics\\" before. The Dune series, Ender's series, the Foundation series, and a whole bunch of Star Wars books (99% which would not be considered classic). The difference, I felt, between all those books and Hyperion is that it contained everything I've ever wanted in a Science Fiction book (NO SPOILERS):-There was a fully realized universe, with a rich history explaining the diaspora of man.-Intriguing new technologies that made sense.-An \\"alien\\" threat.-An ambiguous and horrifying monster/demigod in the Shrike.-Political intrigue (very small, but it's there).-Great, well-developed characters with believable motivations.-A large cast of alien planets all begging to be explored.-Swashbuckling adventure (Colonel Kassad).By far the best part of the novel, though, was the style(s) in which it was written. Anyone familiar with Hyperion knows that it concerns a pilgrimage of seven strangers to the planet Hyperion. Along the way, they reveal their stories of who they are and why they are connected to the mysterious planet and the Shrike (purposefully similar to the Canterbury Tales). Each story is told in a unique style meant to further develop that character, and there are various themes at play within each tale.The Priest's tale is presented as diary entries, the Poet's tale is told through lyrical prose, the Detective's story is a throwback to serialized crime noir, etc... Throughout each tale, one thing is evident: Dan Simmons is a terrific writer. Each style is well done (especially the Poet's tale), and even though there's so much variance in style, the novel always feels like a cohesive whole. And again, such heavy topics as individualism, love, parenthood, alcoholism, religion, mortality, and art are all explored without a preachy voice.Most importantly, Hyperion is just highly entertaining. As a quest story, I think the only series of novels I'd compare it to is The Dark Tower by Stephen King. Except Dan Simmons manages to weave the story in far fewer pages. You'll connect with the characters on an emotional level, and their plight becomes your plight.Without giving anything away, I immediately raced out to purchase The Fall of Hyperion after finishing. Some might feel disappointed with this books ending, but looking back on all of the tales, it's hard to imagine why. The book delivers on so many levels that I'm sold on Dan Simmons for life."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"\\"Whan that Aprill, with his shoures sooteThe droghte of March hath perced to the roote...\\"So \\"begins the game\\" of the Canterbury Tales, one of many literary inspirations for Dan Simmons' science fiction tour de force Hyperion. For those familiar with the Canterbury Tales, pilgrims on a journey tell their tales, and this book is true to that spirit. However, this pilgrimage is far deadlier than a battle for the soul; each pilgrim is in an all-out war for existence, not only his/her own but possibly all mankind. Their stories are both uplifting and heartbreaking as each pilgrim reveals secrets, confesses sins, and risks more than honor in the sharing of his or her tale.What brings the pilgrims to this outback world of Hyperion, one of many planets in the World Web of our distant future? And what a web has been spun! Humans have colonized many worlds in our spiral arm of the Milky Way, and planets are connected by \\"farcasters\\" that allow instantaneous travel to the point that the wealthiest have multi-world homes, with, say, a bedroom on Maui-Covenant, or a living room on God's Grove. But humans have not done it alone. One consequence of the Information Age was the creation of artificial intelligences called the TechnoCore that live semi-symbiotically with humans. The Core created the farcaster web and the datasphere, where the AI's reside, sort of. (To find out more about the Core and its history you'll need to read the sequel The Fall of Hyperion.) All is not well in the World Web though. Ousters (humans that split off from the Web centuries prior) are invading the world of Hyperion, the Core is battling an internal feud, and The Shrike, humankind's worst nightmare wrapped in steel scalpels and razor wire, has been set loose from his Time Tombs, strange monoliths that are hurtling back through time. Seven pilgrims have been chosen by the Church of Final Atonement, aka The Shrike Church, to somehow quell The Shrike, this deus ex machina, be granted his or her last wish, or maybe save the human race. We are not explicitly told the true purpose of the pilgrimage except that it must take place and it must include the seven chosen. (Again, you must read the sequel for those answers to be revealed.)Of the six tales told (the seventh pilgrim never gets to tell his tale) each is unique, but all are moving testaments to love, fear, betrayal, faith, and creativity. The priest's tale is the most harrowing and haunting, in which a young priest goes looking for his lost comrade, a Teilhard de Chardin scholar, in the flame and Tesla tree forests of Hyperion. What he finds there is enough to shake anyone's faith from the rafters of the highest cathedral. The scholar's tale is heartbreaking and moving as Sol Weintraub, an academic, must come to terms with the fact his daughter Rachel, an archeologist, is aging backward, one day at a time, the result of being touched by The Shrike. Sol needs to go to Hyperion and ask the Shrike to reverse her condition. She is only a week old by the time the pilgrims arrive on Hyperion. His recurring dreams the last twenty-five years have implored him to sacrifice his only child. He cannot bear to do such a thing and spent countless years researching and writing on the abomination of sacrifice in the name of any God. What will Sol do when he meets with The Shrike? The other tales are intriguing, but are not as stunning as the priest's and the scholar's. Frankly, the weakest tale is the soldier's, Fedmahn Kassad, as it is mostly about him trying to find this mysterious lover he keeps encountering in his war simulations. (Who she is, actually, is very important, but not until the sequel.)I must admit at this point that Hyperion is my favorite science fiction book not just because of the great story, but also because of the themes, Simmons' poetic writing, and the references to literature and, especially, poetry. Themes loom large in this book: family, loyalty, faith, the permanence of words, and sacrifice are just skimming the surface. SImmons' use of language is poignantly beautiful and poetic, his references to color, his use of metaphor and simile, his syntax all make for a glorious read. The literary and cultural allusions are superb; there are the obvious Keatsian references and quotes, plus the Canterbury Tales structure, as well as a little Yeats, some Teilhard de Chardin and Catholicism thrown in for good measure, and some Norse mythology. Put it all together and you have a thinking person's book, not a fluff read. Not that you have to know the references inside and out; it helps to have read Keats or to understand Teilhardian evolutionary theories or to know the derivation of \\"All Thing\\" or \\"Yggdrasill,\\" or to be familiar with Jewish and Catholic teachings, but if you aren't, well this is a good place to begin learning.I've come back to this book many times since it was first published, even when I have a shelf full of books that beg me to read them. But something always draws me back to this one, something ineffable and haunting, beckoning me to \`cast away and forget this world."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is a great book, and while I do not think it is the greatest SF book ever written, I will say I agree with many of the reviews I've read. The only thing I think worth adding is this warning: This is the beginning of a series of books and while the various sub-stories which make up the book are more or less complete, the novel does not actually end. It leaves you with a lot of What about this? and what about that? I have yet to read anymore in the series, but I really hate when I'm forced to because I want to know how a story turns-out and the author wants to sell more books by putting the answer in part 2. I much prefer a novel that is complete within itself even if it is part of a greater series of works. Regardless of all that, I still recommend the book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I began reading this book and after reading the first page of the prologue, I realized that it will not be an easy read. Knowing that, I became even more excited and got out my dictionary--which I later used not seldom.I am a high school Junior who prior to his Sophomore year, absolutely loathed reading. But for some reason, I suddenly began to love it.Hyperion by Dan Simmons made love Science Fiction.The book's plot has been summarized to death, therefore, I will not outline the plot.Yet, I absolutely must say that the world Dan Simmons created with the wonderful stories of each of the six characters blew my mind. Never have I read such an inventive, magnificent book.The story is told at an absolutely impeccable pace that only adds suspence and makes the book that much interesting. The more you read, the more the whole book begins to coalesce into this epic story.I only wish I had bought 'The Fall of Hyperion' along with this book, that way I wouldn't have to wait the four agonizing days I am forced to endure as I wait for my copy to arrive.As I sleep, I cannot help but dream of the Shrike...that monstrosity home to a forest of steel thorns, and the tales of the Scholar and the Colonel are always running through my mind.Simply put, this book is a Science-Fiction masterpiece."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Publisher: SpectraRelease Date: 1989Title: HyperionAuthor: Dan SimmonsSubgenre: Planetary RomancePages: 482The Good: Incredible ideas brilliantly realized. Intriguing as all get out. Great characterization at times.Straight up, Hyperion is one of the all-time great science fiction novels. Let's just get that conceit out of the way. It won the Hugo back when the award meant that your work was truly superior and would be read 20 years in the future and still ring pertinent.Hyperion is written as a series of interconnected novellas, ala The Canterbury Tales. It's been common practice in literature for decades to write novels as a series of short stories, but most of the time, the whole feels less than the sum of its parts. Hyperion gets it right however. From the greatest use of Crucifiction in the last 2000 odd years (see The Priest's Tale) to the heart-wrenching account of a man's daughter aging backwards through time (see The Scholar's Tale), every story offers something different and amazing. Read on their own, each story warrants the cover price of the book, but taken together, and a flat-out insane (that's the only word I can use to describe the over-arching plot) picture begins to form in your mind. I kept finding myself going, \\"No, no, no, no,\\" as I was reading it, not believing in the magic that was so obviously in front of me, but, just like seeing Stigmata bleed for the hundredth time, there comes a point where you can't deny it any longer.Good writers build a rigorous world and explore it through their stories. Great writers drop hints at the world beyond, describing just enough to hold the story together. Simmons hits the extreme upper edge of Greatness. He builds a future history of an AI-controlled-but-not-controlled universe, a galaxy spanning ecopolitical organization headed by a CEO, a paingod made of knives who can control 4-dimensions simultaneously, and mysterious artifacts called Time Tombs, of which, little is known.Beyond the wonderful content executed to the highest degree, the actual prose of the book is something to marvel at. Each story is told differently. The Poet's Tale is a first person, stream-of-conscious ramble trying to encompass hundreds of years of life. The Detective's Tale reads hard-boiled. The Consul's Tale hits at his worldweariness. The Priest's Tale is epistolary and evokes a cynical sensawunda. You'll see every point of view, every tense, every literary device that you could possibly imagine somewhere in its pages, and it's all done with an effortlessness that makes us lesser writers tear our hair out trying to emulate.The Cons: Characterization falters in places. Only half a book.This is a con that is more a personal preference than an actual slight on the book. Anyone who's read Sensawunda knows that my least favorite cliche in science fiction is an uber-sexualized future; where people are as likely to have sex as shake hands. It doesn't ring true to me.Some characters in Hyperion seem to see sex as a very minor action in relationships, and by that token, boink constantly. Even though it does, to an extant, serve the character and the world, it bothers me. By no means, however, is it a major concern or even happens all that often. It just made me tut my head once or twice.Oh, and of course, the main slight is that you need to read The Fall of Hyperion to receive any sort of resolution.I honestly can not recommend this highly enough. If you have fallen out of love with science fiction, this will fire your loins. If you want to learn how to write short stories or novels, this will teach you. If you just want to have a flat out good time, then by Shrike, buy this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This novel is in part a mystery story set about 400 years in the future. It is also a strange travelogue involving seven pilgrims, and it therefore sets a tone that is like a sci-fi version of The Canterbury Tales. Along the way, one of the pilgrims dies and so he doesn't tell his tale, but the other six adventurers tell theirs, and there's a common theme to them all.There's a strange planet in the far outback of the galaxy called Hyperion. It's colonized mostly by adherents of a weird religion which worships a dreadful creature called the Shrike, a man-like superman who wreaks vengeance and slaughter on inhabitants. This creature is like a god, moving about in an illusive little zone on Hyperion where time itself is warped and where adventurers disappear. The pilgrims are a mixed group of specialists who are sent there to investigate the Shrike mystery and the mystery of the Time Tombs, which seem to be a rip in the time fabric of everything. Along the way, each pilgrim tells his or her tale to the others. These six individual stories come across like stand-alone tales in their own right.There is the priest, who describes his previous journey to Hyperion with another priest, and the incredible secret they discover there concerning a small village of Shrike worshippers. It is a secret that could destabilize the foundation of secular religion. There is the soldier, who travels across the galaxy waging mercenary war, and crossing paths with a mysterious lover from his future. There is the poet, who is crass and vulgar but who writes an ode to the former king of Hyperion, and has some insights to the nature of the evil Shrike. There is the scholar, who lives on a pleasant world, marries, and has a daughter who visits Hyperion as an archaeologist, and becomes a strange victim of the time warp. She begins to age in reverse, from her thirties back to infancy. It is one of the more intriguing and poignant tales here. There is the detective, a capable female private eye who helps investigate the \`murder' of John, an android/human who is a remake of poet John Keats (from who's poem Hyperion the title derives). And finally there is the consul, who tells a love story and a revolution story that is tossed around in strange time fields.These six stories tie the pilgrims together mostly by the fact that they each have slight connections to the Shrike on Hyperion itself. The technology and culture is right out of the world of Star Trek, with travel portals called farcasters (like Transporters) between the worlds, and various types of spaceships, below, at, and above the speed of light. It all sounds a little bit confusing but as you read your way through each tale (The Soldier's Tale, The Scholar's Tale...) you get picked up and involved in each story, much like the way you do in Robinson's The Years of Rice and Salt. The writing is exceptionally good and much of the ideas are entertaining. There are the usual discrepancies of sci-fi, of course, such as why do spaceships need years to traverse interstellar space when there are farcasters for doing that? Why do some groups throughout the galaxy have such far-reaching powers and yet have to wage conventional battles to gain control? Nonetheless, the prose is highly descriptive and effective.I loved the format and theme of this novel. It is an intriguing blend of fantasy and speculation into human dreams, fears, and objectives. Hyperion is the first of a four-part series. Dan Simmons won the 1990 Hugo Award for this novel, and he was third place runner-up for the 1990 Nebula Award with the sequel, The Fall of Hyperion. There's a city mentioned in these novels, which gave rise to the other two novels, Endymion and Rise of Endymion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book mirrors the basic plot and frame story structure of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. A widely disparate group of individuals are on a pilgrimage to a place which is gradually revealed as the focal point of impending doom. As the story unfolds, you learn more about each of the individuals' back-stories through a series of flashbacks. Each flashback is fascinating -- both because of the plot and because Dan Simmons excels at revealing a little bit more of the fascinating world. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"i cant really go on enough about how much i enjoyed this book and its sequal.i have just read it (in 2011, far from the original published date) and its very interesting to see the authors outlook on what the future would hold. couple that with the political aspects of a sentient ai system being intertwined with the daily lives of humanity (todays reality minus its sentient status) and how religion is thrown into the mix... the book is VERY deep.i will admit that the first part of the book where you get the first pilgrims backstory is long... it wasnt what i expected. once i finished it and got back to the main storyline i was happy till i got to the 2nd pilgrims backstory. if you read this book and feel you are getting bogged down in this, KEEP READING. the backstories fuel this and the 2nd book. aside from that, its like you are reading little mini stories inside a much bigger story. enjoy them for their own merit and writing style and enjoy how the lay the foundation for the bigger story.excellent, EXCELLENT book for those with an open mind and wanting to read something completely outside the norm."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've read hundreds of Sci Fi books. Years ago I read Hyperion by Dan Simmons, I knew I liked it but forgot some of it. I bought a used copy to reread and was glad I did.Hyperion is a Hugo Award winning,fantastic, great Epic Sci Fi and INMO in the top 40 of all time. Dan Simmons is a master at character description and using futuristic technology,religious groups, advanced AI and creating a good flowing story that the reader wants to read. Even though Hyperion is about 500 pages it is a page burner, reads fast with no boring parts. I read it in 4 days.Hyperion takes place about 700 years in the future. Old Earth has been destroyed by a man made black hole. There is a web of about 300 habitable planets in our galaxy. Mankind has broken Einstein's space/time barrier with the Hawkins drive allowing FTL huge spacecraft.On the strange planet Hyperion there is a horrible monster creature called the Shrike that is ripping apart people. We see a 26 year old PHD Archaeologist named Rachel who explores the Time Tombs on Hyperion who becomes infected with a reverse aging affliction, She gets younger and younger until she is a tiny infant carried by her father back to Hyperion. We see seven pilgrims falling to six and their different pasts and their quest together to try to destroy the monstrous Shrike and learn the secrets of Hyperion.Some of the characters I really had empathy with and got into their sorrows, experiences, loves and accomplishments.I liked this book so much I bought another used copy for our family library. Now we have 2 copies, one for each of our kids to eventually add to their families libraries. Again Hyperion is a Sci Fi epic. 5 stars and highly recommended. I'm buying the sequel The Fall of Hyperion. I'll review that too."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I hadn't picked up any of the books in this series since middle school, I've always remembered reading them fondly. When I saw that they were out for Kindle, I decided to give them a fresh read, and I'm so glad I did.I just finished Hyperion, and am only a couple of chapters into Endymion. I can see why I loved Hyperion so much as a kid: it reads like a collection of novellas, and each tale is written in it's own distinctive flavor. The setting is an intriguing mix of science-fiction and fantasy. Simmons paints a vivid world in which technology and science have allowed mankind to conquer the stars, yet in which matters of the soul and the supernatural are both as elusive and relevant as ever. The proficiency Simmons shows in his horror writing for creating sensual and haunting scenes of the unnatural comes into play at full force. There's hardly a page where the reader isn't confronted with a scene that fills the imagination with floating trees, demons made of blades, and mind-binding manipulations of time and space, yet where Simmons really shines is when he writes about something that's just a little bit \\"off\\".That said, I've also really appreciated all the things that went right over my head as a youngster. The book is steeped in literary and historical references, and is itself a sort of futuristic re-imagining of The Decameron. While such endeavors often end up feeling heavy-handed or trite, Simmons' excellent ability as an author, as well as his obvious expertise and passion for the source materials makes Hyperion truly excellent."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am going to provide a review for all 4 books because they are so linked.First of a 4 book series. Very complex multiple world building. Deep political intrigue. Time travel, altered states of consciousness and dilemmas surrounding the extent of the use of AI to help humans, and some very powerful questions about the meaning of GOD. Each world built is a wonder. First book is structured on the Canterbury tales. I couldn't put these down. Even though you could stop at the first book you wouldn't want to. The others are called Fall of Hyperion, Endymion and Rise of Endymion. There are a lot of literary parallels in this. But the world building using teleportation gates is so intriguing. People have gates in their houses so that the actual house has rooms on different planets. There is a set of gates on the rivers of the many worlds so that you can travel along this one massive river and pass through different planets in the process.The destruction descrbed at the end of the 2nd book along with its consequences are mind numbing.the side journeys in books 3 & 4 seem wierd at times, but it is just wonderful in all aspects, forcing you to stretch your mind"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Wow! This book is indescribeably well done. I lost a lot of sleep because I couldn't put this book down.The one caveat I would offer is go into this book blind. Do not read a summary or sysopsis to see if you like this book. If you enjoy science fiction & classical literature, then you will probably love Hyperion.Oh and you can read this book as a stand alone work. The other books in the series are really good but this one is by far and the best."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I should start out by saying that I have not been much of a sci fi or fantasy fan throughout my years of on-again off-again recreational reading. I can count on one hand the number of sci fi books I have read over time, though this one is the best. I wavered between giving this book 4 or 5 stars. I really want to give it 4.5 stars so I have rounded up. I will not take up space describing the story since that has been done at length in other reviews. Suffice to say this book, for me, was a fun, interesting, and sometimes thought provoking journey. I liked the 6-stories-in-one concept, especially since they do, at some point in each, tie together. I enjoyed the chapters/stories from the priest, the Consul, and Sol W. the best. They tended to provide more room for thinking and imagination more than the \\"action\\" oriented stories of Kassad and Lamia. I got a bit bogged down with Kassad's story with all of the warring, and some of the terminology used to describe the futuristic trappings of Hegemony/Core life, as they were a bit hard for me to keep track of. But that was ok in the end, as I really liked the story as a whole. If you like sci fi and/or a good interesting story, kinda hard to see where you could go wrong with this book. Looking forward to picking up the sequel, which seems like a must given the leave-you-hanging ending of Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"It has been 13 years since I read the Hyperion series. Even after the second reading, I loved these books. The first book is like an introduction to the world Dan Simmons creates. The second and fourth books are the strongest of the four. If you like your books filled with well thought out characters, intelligent concepts, moral issues, strong emotions, and developing plots that are later explained, these books are for you. Kind of reminds you how \\"Lost\\" took it's time and created dramatic tension. At times, the battles get a little too detailed but you can skip a page or two from time to time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is one of my favorite science fiction books. I found myself captivated by it from the first chapter. The book is basically several short stories, each about the personal journey of seven pilgrims on a quest to meet the Shrike. Each story was enthralling and moving in its own way. My personal favorite was the story of Sol. They are all so different and yet they are woven together beautifully.RESPONSE TO CRITICISM: I always like to read the 1 or 2 star reviews before I write mine to see what people did not like about the book. The biggest complaint about Hyperion seems to be that the ending is anticlimactic. First of all the book is full of climaxes all throughout the stories. Secondly, THERE ARE MORE BOOKS IN THE SERIES. This is just like when I came out of watching The Fellowship of the Ring and I heard a group of people talking about how bad the ending was. \\"They, like, never even got to that tower thing... dude!\\" If you finish this book you can read The Fall of Hyperion; it takes up exactly where this book left off.This book is a great start to a wonderful scifi quadrilogy. I would whole-heartedly recommend this to any fan of scifi, or any fan of a good book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmon's HYPERION is the quintessential good sci-fi novel, not exactly a literary classic but nonetheless an interesting story whose plot moves along steadily and which makes the reader ponder its novel ideas.HYPERION is set up like Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales.&quot; The frame story is about of seven pilgrims headed to the Time Tombs on the enigmatic frontier world of Hyperion, while slowly conflict is building between humanity and its AI creations, the TechnoCore. On the way, each pilgrim tells how he came to be involved with Hyperion.Simmon's prose flows well, and his writing is much like that of any other &quot;best-selling&quot; author of our times, so it's not the best. His ideas and truly original plot, however, are the real draw of the Hyperion books. Before writing HYPERION, Simmons was known as a horror writer, and his creation the Shrike, a terrifying killing machine-cum-avenging angel, adds horror elements to this space opera in a fitting way.One caveat: HYPERION is not a stand-alone novel. Although satisfying in itself, its plot is the setup for the next book in the saga, THE FALL OF HYPERION. Also, there are two other books in the series, ENDYMION and THE RISE OF ENDYMION.I recommend this book heartily, but it gets four stars instead of five due to Simmon's writing, which is incredibly pedestrian and often writing with the zeal (but not the vocabulary) of a little kid. Classic books tend to be serious. HYPERION, nonetheless is a book worthy of notice by science-fiction fans."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"My brother told me about this book. At first I was worried I was getting sucked into another \\"religious\\" sci-fi book, which I loathe. But to my surprise this book is intensely rich with character and depth. Religion is merely a character in the book.It's hard to explain this book to people. I've often compared it to a sci-fi version of the Canterbury Tales. But even that doesn't really do the story justice. Its richer and more complex.I do want to reiterate a warning I have seen others say. This is not a light, quick read. Don't take this to the beach with a Star Trek book and expect it to just keep your brain busy for a while. This is a book that demands thought. The story is thick with allegory and symbolism. Some of it is very obvious, some much more subtle.And yes, the ending is a pretty big cliffhanger. If you buy this book, make sure you have The Fall of Hyperion on deck before you finish the book. Otherwise, you're likely to race down to Barnes & Nobel at 11:00 PM at night desperate for the next book so you can keep reading!Although this isn't an entirely fair comparison, I see this book almost in the same world as the new Battlestar Galactica. Unlike Star Trek and Star Wars which have sparkling clean characters who always are true to their motives - Hyperion, like Battlestar has characters that have many faults. Obsession, betrayal, abuse, and insanity are all a part of the cast. In this way, the book is gritty and real. I honestly felt like I was there with the characters.Get this book. Snuggle in for a long weekend. And enjoy!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"My experience with sci fi is pretty tiny, but a friend described this series of novels as the best sci fi around. He raved about the concepts and the religious themes, especially Simmons exploration of the nature of God.I found some of the ideas in Hyperion compelling, particularly the concept of the Cruciform which is nicely developed in the Priest's tale, and the region of the Time Tombs that travels backwards in time on the planet Hyperion, creating an anomaly which confounds the predictive powers of the seemingly omniscient Hegemony world order.The mysteries of the Web and the datasphere, megasphere etc, some vastly developed information superhighway, and the technocore, a politically independent and powerful artificial intelligence network, are scantily justified from a scientific standpoint, but sufficiently communicate the huge differences between Simmons populated solar system and our own tiny planet of now.Unfortunately the Simmons literary delivery and dramatic execution is quite deeply flawed. At odd times the prose sparkles but often betrays haste and projects like a stage set, existing only to provide a vehicle for inventive science fantasy. There is obviously talent here, for Simmons periodically produces a noticeably different style for the various characters' tales, but too often it is a forced and unconvincing artifice. The Scholar's tale is annoyingly slushy and in general the characters are wooden and one dimensional. The enigma of the Shrike is at the same time arresting and incongruous and seems to belong to the world of horror rather than science fiction.Simmons uses nave artifices to communicate the subtleties of his plot, particularly through the \`thoughts' of major characters, and this worsens in the second book, The Fall of Hyperion, where Simmons gives little reminders of plot, trite precis of previous events, as though he is worried you will have forgotten what went before. This naivety produces the unfortunate effect in the reader of constantly being reminded of the author's intent, rather than being caught up in the world of his story.OK, I know science fiction writers are not literary giants, but why the hell shouldn't they be?Still, I read the second book, which to be honest is more laborious than this one."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Years ago I set a personal goal for myself to read all of the top 100 sci fi books, and I have a degree in English Lit from UNC. I am by no means an expert or critic,and literally never write reviews, but for this one I had to hop on and tell everyone to not miss out! It may be my favorite sci fi book, and certainly one of my favorites of all time.As grand and massive as The Foundation universe, the Hyperion and Endymion series (four books in all) are far more exciting and personal than Isomovs creation. The characters are complex and incredibly interesting, the story flows beautifully while also providing an expansive and diverse look into the universe, and the author really nails the human condition element of the story.At first I thought this was a sort of Stephen king, horror type sci fi. I couldnt have been more wrong. DON'T let the scary shrike fool you, the farther you get into the series the deeper it gets! Religion, love, war, faith, politics, philosophy, and some really heart wrenching drama, riveting action, and almost unbelievably deep plot means this one has something for everyone. The story just keeps revealing layer after layer, building upon or shattering what you thought you knew about the intergalactic government, the surreptitious AI, the hyper-evolved shunned human race called the Ousters, and even God and the dead!If even one person reads my review and decides to pick up this masterpiece I will be very happy. Everyone should read this book. I guarantee you won't be able to put them down, and when you finish you will know that this is one you are going to read again down the line. Too good for just one read!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Give it a try. I've never wrote a book review before, but I want to aid in recommending people to reading this series, of which Hyperion is a part of. The first paragraph sort of sums up my review, the rest is a tangent more or less about Simmons and his style of writing (maybe it'll help you get a feel for his works and if you would like this book).It was an absolute blast. Dark, funny, gruesome, surreal, sad, thought provoking, and erie; it was an incredible journey for me. It's almost as if you are watching a play that has a grey shadow over it, even in the happier parts. Theres always this looming darkness, emptiness, and desperation (those of you who've read it know what I mean), that's wrapped around all of the cast. I think this stems from both the cold void of space and the decaying stagnancy of the universe, not to mention their own tragic lives. It is a plight of seven pilgrims and their actions that would affect all of civilization. But as a few readers have mentioned; there is a hope that burns in each of these pilgrims that warms you and fights at the desperation like only hope can.I think there is a lot of dimensions in Simmons's work that resonates with the human soul. If you have ever read romance (keats kind) or tragedy, it's like that (but with a happier outcome than tragedies). It is similar to the grandeur I felt reading the Divine comedy or Canterbury tales. At least for me, by the end of a majority of his books, especially this one, there is an attachment to his characters.Everyone has their flavor, I get it. But let me just say that I consider myself a person who has read a variety of Authors: Dickens, Robert Jordan, Coolidge, Homer, Stephen King, Koontz, J.K. Rowling, Michael Chriton, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Lovecraft, H.G Wells, Doyle you get the gist, too many authors to name.Anyway, Dan Simmons is great, FOR ME, way better than Stephen King. To use an analogy it's as if when I try to read King, it's like walking into a well kept house that belongs to old people; muted colors, stiff air, slow and boring, I really fail to see the big deal with him....Simmons is the complete opposite. His characters are lively and charismatic, his worlds vast and fascinating, his scope unbound and breathtaking.Having read what is, considered by many, \\"Great works\\", I think that Simmons has wrote a masterpiece with this Cantos. I don't think this review came out quite the way I intended it to, not being a writer myself, I find it hard to put into words exactly how I feel about Simmons, and more specifically this series. If you have read any great works (the odyssey, divine comedy, rime of the ancient mariner) etc, I think you'll like these books, even if you do not like space (which I love). The canto elicits a strong, emotional response that mimics what all of which humanity endures.I hope this helps and for a more descriptive summary of the books see some of the other reviews, they helped me with my decision. Enjoy, and later alligator."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I will not go over this first volume, as almost 500 reviews do that now. Suffice it to say that: (1) the writing and story telling are amazing; (2) the universe is incredibly imaginative; and (3) literally none of the \\"why\\" questions are answered. While you could theoretically read only this book as a stand-alone, very little is resolved in this volume, meaning your more or less stuck going to the second book.My view (and I'm in the minority here) is that the second volume descends into incoherence, mysticism and deux ex machina developments. Common problems for epics with the tremenous scope of imagination that this one has, but that doesnt make it OK, at least not to me. I found the second volume engaging in parts, tolerable in others, and, overall, a bit dissappointing.The first book is so engaging that I still recommend taking the plunge. If you are able to stop after the first book -- with questions unanswered, plot unfinished -- then you might consider that. However, my view is a minority, many do like the second book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is the only book I have re-read three times, what more can I say? Rob"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I decided to work through the Hugo and Nebula Award winning books, knowing that the books would be good. At first I wasn't too sure about Hyperion. You quickly learn that the book is a compilation of stories, with a slow moving main storyline in the few pages in between each story. You see similar story telling in fiction, such as from authors such as Faulkner and Morrison, where the style is a recursive style. Most of the story is spent developing the characters, back tracking where necessary to give a full portrait of each character, before moving the main story along. I love this style.But I have never read this style in sci fi, and Simmons seemed to be spending too little time on the storyline. None the less, I trudged on. I quickly found that Simmons can most certainly tell a compelling story. The Priest's tale was well described but not completely interesting. But Simmons only had up to go from an already well developed base of writing. Each successive tale got more and more in depth, revealing world of the Hegemony and the worlds beyond. After awhile I couldn't put the book down and greedily read on.Simmons characters are so fully developed. Each one distinct from the other and unique in their own right. Even the minor characters are well developed. I think this is where this books strength comes in and sets him apart from other authors. Eventually the storyline began to develop not because he wrote more on the main storyline, but because he developed each character and how and why they were affected by the Shrike.I couldn't have been more happy reading Hyperion and its been a while since I've read a sci fi that has such well rounded and complete characters, warts and all. I cannot wait to read the sequel, knowing what to expect: rich and full characters. A definite recommend to all sci fi lovers. Simply amazing.5 stars."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion offers a rich, well constructed storyline; something I rarely come across. Read epic. The frame narrative unfolds with an interesting set of characters with widely diverse backgrounds. With each character's personal reveal I found myself saying, \\"Wow, that was original. I wonder if Simmons can top it with the next character?\\" And yes, every inner frame story was just as well thought out and developed as the previous. The beauty in the novel is that towards the end everything culminates to a single idea, and each frame story (story within a story) complements the others extremely well for the overall plot.The only negative thing I can admit to is that the ending felt less like a resolving finish and more like the end of a chapter, forcing the reader to jump into the sequel (The Fall of Hyperion) in order to finish the story. Now, I admit, I think I felt this way only because I was aware there was a sequel. I believe that if I were ignorant to the other books in the series, or read Hyperion before the sequel's publication, I would've come up with my own conclusion as to how the story ended and been completely satisfied.Regardless, this one thing is insignificant considering the other books are available to let the reader continue on. So, its really not that big of a deal in my opinion, and not worth revoking a star for.Overall, I felt that Hyperion was a phenomenal novel, and I'm happy to say that it's now in my top 5 of all time favorites."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book overall was good. The only thing I didn't like was graphic detail the author used to describe the sexual encounters. To me, they didn't really lend anything to the story and I just kind of bypassed them. Not that I am a prude (and not that there is anything wrong with being prude either!), but the details were bordering on pornographic and seemed out of place in the story."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Wow, despite the fact that the story really only takes place on starships and other transportation while travelling to the Shrike this story has an amazing around of scope seen through the eyes of the seven pilgrims. Each story is unique; they cover so much history of what has happened in the universe we find ourselves in without ever creeping into information overload.This book is unabashedly sci-fi, which I enjoyed especially since it is such a great example of sci-fi. There aren't a lot of characters so despite some of the names being harder to remember than others (at least for me), I didn't have a hard time keeping track of who was who. The presentation of each character's story also helped with the remembering, and the transitions between the stories feel natural, which made the multiple points of views very enjoyable.If you like sci-fi, this is a great book to read (it DID win a Hugo AND a Nebula so make that a MUST read), but hard-core fantasy fans will probably find themselves somewhat put off by the feel of this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons Hyperion and following volumes represent the best SciFi of 20th Century and beyond. It is so good that it is difficult to find proper words to describe it. My son says, that the world described in Hyperion is more real then our world. I would say it shows direction, where our world could go. It is the story, which can show real reason of our existence. Mankind of Hyperion world has direction, tragic, difficult, painful but great. No I am unable to describe this monumental work. Go an read it ...."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I've been reading Amazon reviews for many years and have never chosen to contribute before. Hyperion, by Dan Simmmons, deserves a review. All at once mind-blowing, intimate, sad, reflective and essentially HUMAN makes this the best SF book I have ever read. I certainly never cried three quarters of the way through any other SF book before. This one is different - to all you non-Sci Fi fans, try this one - you may be surprised at just how makes you reflect upon what it means to be human."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the tale of pilgrims on the world of Hyperion.

My favorite pilgrim was the Jew, Sol and the soldier Kassad. This was my first Dan Simmons book and I really enjoyed it. He reminds me a lot of Silverberg in all the best ways."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Simmons is a good writer. He pulls you in. The story is mysterious and engaging. The characters are interesting and like-able enough for you to care about what happens to them. The story is fairly complicated, but not a hard read. It's really not a complete book... you have to read The Fall of Hyperion to get the rest of the story.The science fiction in the story is solid, very good and creative. The worldview or \\"universe view\\" of the characters is a bit hard to swallow. Ultimately the theological and philosophical aspects of the books are their weak points. The other aspects are still good enough to give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is what a novel should be: bold, intriguing and innovative. Much of the science fiction genre does not stand up to the bar that Dan Simmons has set. It is a rare gem that offers space battles and characters with whom the reader truly empathizes. Sol's story is one that appeals to even the sci-fi hater.I immediately wanted to read this again, and I'm sure I will return to it over the years. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I have to say I was overall thoroughly impressed by Dan Simmons with the first of the Hyperion novels. I'm not an avid reader nor do I ever read science fiction, so when someone recommended this book to me, I was hesitant. But after the first chapter, I was hooked! The storyline is so complex. At first I was completely bewildered as to what was actually going on, but the more I read, the more it made sense. The first book is more of a prologue to the climax in the second, but it gives very personal stories of the pilgrims and you really fall in love with the characters. By the end of the second book, I was crying because of how emotional the ending was. This has to be my favorite book (along with the second). I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Take the Canterbury Tales, mix with The Odyssey, sprinkle in a bit of John Le Carre, add a dash of Shakespearean tragedy, flavor with your favorite thriller writer, bake in a crust of old fashioned space opera, and you've got Hyperion -- except for the secret sauce that Dan Simmons concocted to hold the dish together. My only complaint is that I didn't expect a \\"to be continued\\" ending. But that isn't really a complaint, because I loved this beautifully written story so much that I ordered the next three in the epic series before I was halfway through this one. There are so many reviews here I won't add another plot synopsis. I'm writing this only to have a chance to give a richly deserved five star rating to one of the best sf novels I've yet encountered. Hyperion is literary sf at its finest."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I was very skeptical when I read the synopsis for Hyperion. Time travel is usually not my cup of tea and neither is monster based stories. But my doubt was soon laid to rest when I started reading. Hyperion is a truly gripping story, each characters chapter is gripping and tantalizing and it is hard to put the book down. The shrike remains a complete mystery throughout the book and it suits it well. This is however not a cheerful read, the characters are all plunged into suffering beyond comprehension and the universe feels like a truly dark and terrifying place.I don't know how I could have missed this gem for so long, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"You will be racing through to see what happens next.

I thought the book was a great read and what a great imagination Mr. Simmons has."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"wow. has to be read to understand what an incredible feat of imagination and writing this is. wow."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I had long intended to read Dan Simmons critically acclaimed Hyperion novels, but given that there are only so many hours in the day there is no way that anyone who loves books can get to all of the books they want and hope to read. So I was delighted that I not only finally got around to reading the first of the four novels, but loved it. Other projects are going to force me to delay continuing with the other three books for three or four months, but this is definitely not by choice. This is an epic SF novel of the highest ambitions. I previously had read Simmons's spectacular vampire novel COLD CARRION and was expecting great things and I certainly was not disappointed.It is not a perfect novel, but the virtues overwhelm the negatives. The latter include the far too frequent use of the word \\"nipple,\\" a host of very poorly written sex scenes (why do so many writers persist in writing about sex when there have been virtually no convincing sex scenes in all of literature?), and some quite unlikable main characters. The novel is loosely reminiscent of Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES in that several individuals on religious a religious pilgrim -- they are going to meet with the mysterious Shrike -- each tell their tale. Gradually as the book goes along we learn a bit more about the Shrike. Although the latter is barely onstage in the course of the novel, he (she? it?) dominates the narratives by his presence. Capable of manipulating time, the \\"Lord of Pain\\" follows his own counsels, though we do not know what they are in this novel.The ambition behind this novel surpasses the vast majority of such works. It is gratifying to see a SF writer not only attempting great things, but doing a reasonable job of achieving it. My only regret is that I have to tend to my other projects. I can barely wait until I'm finished with those so that I can get back to FALL OF HYPERION to see what happens next."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"With all of the detail and literary references Simmons comes close to being pretentious and self serving. He is saved by his obvious instinct to turn on the plot heat at just the right time. His sense of story allow him to be a bit pretentious and still escape those traps many other writers would have fallen into. This book could most easily be described as grand and ambitious and yet I ran through its pages like it was a comic. That is its brilliance."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Generally and without spoiling, I can say that the book talks about a group of pilgrims on their way to a weird planet named Hyperion, each with each own reasons for the journey. The book tells the story of each of them and their stories are somehow connected to the main plot. We also learn that they were not sent together by chance.The story is very interesting, original (at least to me) and not very predictable. While reading you get really attached to part of the characters and sometimes cannot wait to get back to their plot in future chapters. The unfold universe is a futuristic one, but in a reasonable way.I only have two problems with the book, that are the reasons for giving four instead of five stars: (1) this book is only half of the story, the second book in the series is the more interesting one and potential buyers should be aware of that (anyway, I still strongly recommend reading them both). (2) Even after reading BOTH books there are still several unsolved questions to some very central pieces of the plot. I really don't know why the author left them open, but I tend to guess that it was intentional as the author does treat well more complicated plot lines and the world itself is consistent. Anyway, the book is so engaging that it really bother me not knowing the answers to these untied ends."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book has been reviewed extensively so I'll just add that it deserves every bit of praise. I will say that you don't have to be a science fiction fan at all to enjoy this book. I read very little from this genre but this is one of my favorite novels of all time."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I got this book by accident, having only read Simmons' Joe Kurtz books. I was completely blown away. Yes, it ends on a cliffhanger (although the sequel--*The Fall of Hyperion*--is very nearly as good as this one), but the writing is the best I have ever read in a contemporary book. The language is adult, I don't recommend this for anyone who isn't used to swearing, but the characters are so well done that I can't help feeling a connection to all of them (even the ones I don't like). When I read the part where they each told their story, I was absolutely riveted. I try not to read this book too often because once I start it, I can't do anything else but read until I finish it.*Hyperion* and *The Fall of Hyperion* are one complete story. The further evolution of the *Hyperion* universe is told in *Endymion* and *The Rise of Endymion*, which are also great books, but not in the same league as the first two. I would compare the two *Hyperion* books to the Iliad and the Odyssey, and the two *Endymion* books to something lesser but still great -- maybe Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\""},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This is what I'm calling Old-School Sci-Fi. Lots of fun concepts, made up words that don't sound made up, robots, time travel, space travel, politics, and intrigue. But it's the writing style that kept me reading this book.95% of the book is told in flashbacks. I was 1/2 way thru the book when I realized the story hadn't progressed any, and part of me was disappointed. But the more I read, the more I was enjoying things. So much so, that when the book ended, and still the main story barely progressed from 1st page to the last, I didn't much mind.I'm hoping the 2nd book is done with the backstories, and will progress the story to the end. Looking forward to it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"hyperion is an excellent book. the plot is very original, and intricate. the first book ofcourse does not answer any questions, but the sequel ties up all loose ends perfectly. if you are new to sci fi, this book is not for you. even a seasoned sci fi buff may need to read these books twice just to completely understand the plot. I think this would make a great movie or miniseries, espeacially the scenes with The Shrike in action. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"All in all, this is an entertaining read. The characters each tell their own life stories. I must say that those back stories are MUCH more entertaining than the story of the pilgrimage itself. The pilgrimage story isn't bad, it's just that the others are so much better..... Sometimes, there's a bit too much philosophising for my tastes, but this book does entertain, and in the end, that's what matters."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The book has several different stories, probably modeled on Canterbury tales, each told by a different pilgrim.Interestingly, some of the stories are told are not those of the pilgrim himself; it's as if the pilgrims are surrogates for others. Mankind, it seems, is well represented on this final pilgrimage.The sections use different SF sub-generas or styles:-hard-boiled detective story/ cyberpunk (Brawne Lamia)-military SF (Kassad)-gothic horror-religous (Father Dure)-love, Romeo and JulietThe &quot;hard SF&quot; is done well, but there are also elements bordering on fantasy or horror, some religion, some poetry, a very interesting blend.The poetry of John Keats is a thread through the narrative. Normally, I'm not big on poetry, but I liked this book well enough to subsequently make a stab at reading Keats.The &quot;WorldWeb&quot; universe created by Simmons is fabulous. He does a great job of &quot;world construction&quot;. And then, amazingly, turns this intricate construction inside-out in the last section.I did not find the ending lame, as some other reviewers mention.Be advised there are three more books in the series.I would rate this book as the best in the series - broad in scope, with varied technique and style."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is my all time favorite book. Mr. Simmons weaves a world that is so believable, you have to pinch yourself everytime you stop reading. The character developement is brilliant. Perfect. Read it, then read the other three books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons' best book. Easily ranks with &quot;Weaveworld&quot; (Barker) and &quot;The Talisman&quot; (King/Straub). A fantasic book by a master storyteller."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Many of the less-than-flattering reviews of this book are centered around the ending (or lack there of). Certainly, not much is resolved in this book. But the six stories told by the main characters (blended with a &quot;current&quot; plot-line) are such superb sci-fi and such superb writing that it hardly matters that one needs to read another volume for some resolution. In fact I'm looking forward to it. This is one of the best sci-fi works I've ever read (in 30 years of reading sci-fi). Do yourself a favor... read this one."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Before you start reading, be known that this story is complete only when all four volumes are read. In rebuttal to the reader from brookside: Yes, the central theme is about loss, but all of human life is about loss. Joy is only found as a counterpoint to pain. When fall in love, you risk your lover leaving you. When you love your child, you risk them outgrowing you. When you love your dog, you do so knowing it won't live more that ten or so years. The first volume brings together a varied group of pilgrims each seeking to either regain the lost component of their lives or find new purpose; One way or another, they have all sunk so low as to think nothing of facing the supernatural killing machine known as the Shrike. The story is told with vivid imagery, a well constructed universe, and elements to please all. The characters are believable, while still feeling like the archtyes from The Canterbury Tales. And finally, noting can beat the finale at the end of the Rise of Endymion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Though I'm not usually a heavy Sci-Fi reader this book was recommended to me and once I started it I couldn't put it down. I'd have to give it 5 stars. It is a beautifully-written epic tale about 6 pilgrims, all with their own dark tale, all prepared to meet the terrible Shrike. This book can't be explained, it has to be read and experienced firsthand. It is important to note that in order to get the entire story one must also read &quot;The Fall of Hyperion.&quot; I liked the allusions to classical literature and found each tale fascinating."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is a wonderful read, almost as good the second time around. The first tale, about the priest, is absolutely spell-binding. It has been my experience over and over when I give someone this book that they say they COULD NOT stop reading the first tale no matter what else was happening around them. The story about Rachel and her father is also tremendously moving and harrowing, especially if you are a parent, but not in the way of so many books and movies these days of &quot;child in danger from another person.&quot; You have to read it to see what I mean.As you get into the sequels, I thought the story progressively became more strained and metaphysical in a silly way. But you'll have to read them, because once you've started Hyperion, it's like a drug, YOU CAN'T STOP! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I'm a big fan of science fiction, but I am a little picky about what I read, and judging from the cover it seemed like the book would revolve around a mechanical monster and a space war. While that's actually true, I'm extremely glad I didn't just dismiss this book, because it's absolutely wonderful, even moving. Each of the stories which makes up most of Hyperion are excellent by themselves; ranging from adventure, love, or a poignant tale about a father and daughter -- but combined with the other stories they weave together to make a larger theme and of course, lots of foreshadowing of things that will come up in the next book, Fall of Hyperion. Believe me, you will have to read this after finishing Hyperion."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I am not a fan of science fiction, but I decided to delve into something a bit different. This book, well, for me, began slowly. I seriously contemplated putting it away, but I hardly never finish a book. But I stuck with it and was glad I did! The tales included will make you think. Go for it."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The first thing that I would like to lead off with in this review is a warning. This book is the first of a series of four, and you really can't get the whole story without at least reading the next one. I had foolishsly suspected this not to be the case, and now I am going to have to go scrounge up The Fall of Hyperion somewhere in order to finish the plot that I started.That, by the way, is my major complaint with respect to the book. While Simmons does an excellent job of building and interweaving his stories (though the linearity in the realization of the sub-plots of the book makes the supposedly random order that the pilgrims were supposed to tell their stories in somewhat difficult to believe), he does a very poor job of resolving the issues that he brings up before the end of the story. Certainly, there are more satisfying ways to end a book about a pilgrimage to a supposedly sacred site than with the pilgrims still on their way to the supposedly sacred site without much in the way of facts revealed or resolved.On the plus side, however, stands the fact that this may be one of the most exceptional works by a science fiction writer in some time. Simmons does not demonstrate a mastery with the genres into which he delves in his six stories, but he does display a deep and impressive aptitude and familiarity with the craft. There are better detective stories you will read than The Detective's Tale--I can assure you of that much--but I doubt that you will read a better one interwoven with as many other distinct flavors of story.The story is ultimately engaging and intriguing, if a bit plodding and, given recent writing in the genre, possibly a little passe to readers just coming into the series, but fulfilling on the whole. Just make sure that you order the other parts of the series to go with this book, as you will no doubt be searching for the next book in the series to resolve the story that remains unfinished at the end of this book."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"While I admit that there are a few dry spots (for me at least) in his writing as a whole. Dan Simmons has me totally hooked on this series! If you enjoy SciFi and a wonderful story line that doesn't focus too much on any one aspect, but keeps your mind tingling, then you will love this series. At first I didn't know what to make of it, but trust me, give it a little time and you'll be hooked. It is the first book in a long time that has had me actually swearing when I have to stop reading and set it down :DAlso, I'm not sure what major rigersa has, but I suspect he's reading books that I'd consider a total bore. Just because something is a &quot;classic&quot; doesn't mean it's _good_. Sorry rigersa, I'm not really trying to bash you dude, but man, you are focusing far too much on one aspect of the book and letting it ruin your view on the series. Oh, it isn't Dante's Inferno or the like, but it is still a great story! Please give it a second try and pick up the second book!I'd rate this 5/5 but like I said, it does have a dry spot here and there with a bit too much focus on the names of people and places, but it's all good. Just means I have to skim over a few lines here and there, nothing bad at all!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I just finished it and can say that the ending is as disappointing as the rest of the book is good. None of the questions raised as main plot points are answered by the end. I wouldn't mind this had the book been structured in a way that might lead one to believe that it would not follow traditional literary structure, i.e., have a resolution. I'm not averse to alternative structures by any means - just don't bill it as traditional. While &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; allegedly addresses the questions raised, the author should have had the courtesy to label this piece a &quot;Part 1.&quot;"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"There are a lot of people who claim that modern science fiction writers lack creativity, but they're wrong, and the proof is in this book. In terms of character, setting, plot, and style, &quot;Hyperion&quot; outdoes almost every other SF novel ever written. It captures the same sense of wonder that was first found by great authors like Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein.The story concerns seven pilgrims who are on a voyage to visit a mysterious creature called the Shrike on the planet of Hyperion. They decide to each tell the story of their lives and explain why they chose to take this voyage. The seven characters are the story's main strength, as Simmons gives each one a unique tone and realistic motivations, thus preventing the book from getting boring. The other amazing part of this novel is the imagination that goes into describing the alien worlds that humanity inhabits in this far future universe. I won't spoil it by giving away anything else. In summary, buy this novel and read it! Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and start reading &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The four Hyperion books (Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion) comprises the best sci-fi series I have ever read, and maybe the best of any fictional genre. Amazing story, characters and the Shrike is the coolest figure in Sci-fi hands down. Read these books now...as well as everthing else Dan Simmons has written."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I was suprised to see this on the list of &quot;raves&quot; here at Amazon.com. I found it especially odd to find some reviews comparing it with Ender's Game (one of my favorites). I can hardly think of two sci-fi books more different.I will say that the writing was quite good. That is why I decided to complete the book, but I was looking forward to getting to the end. Then when I reached the end and realized that this was only the first of a series I felt cheated. I knew I wouldn't read the second, but had absolutely no sense of resolution."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I had high hopes starting this one. I'm a fan of Gene Wolfe and Frank Herbert and this was recommended to me as being a work of similar character. I was expecting something with a bit more depth. Supposedly the second book wraps up the tale but... Meh."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I can't believe I'm reading complaints about the first book being \\"unfinished\\".It's not meant to. We're talking about a serie.And those of you who think it ends with the Fall of Hyperion: you're wrong too. There are two more books, and if you cannot find out what they are, you don't deserve to read them.What can I add to all the reviews?The serie is a masterwork. It will be remembered.Not only it's awe-inspiring, it is deeply moving, too. I thought the Scholar's story was one of the most moving novels I had ever read. Parental love is so vividly depicted that.. man, I think it made me wish to have a daugther.Well, the end of the serie is even MORE moving.I emphatize these aspects because they're the ones I expected the least, from such books... the fact that is amazing, grand, daring, provoking science fiction almost becomes \\"unsurprising\\", as you progress through the pages...Sorry for my English anyway."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons has written a Cantebury Tale style masterpiece. Seven people are on their way as pilgrims to the time tombs to meet a monster called the Shrike. Each pilgrim tells their story of why they are going to meet the Shrike and what they want. Some see the Shrike as a monster and others as a god.Dans Simmons has created a richly textured world that is very detailed and believable. The characters are neither good nor bad, just various areas of gray. The book is very deep and is worth the effort to read. The book is very readable but will take some time becasue it is not a super fast read. This is the first of four series and the others should also be read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"This book is great for its sub-plots. Each of the pilgrims' stories are great mini-dramas. Unfortunately, the book is obsessed with invoking the classic poetry of John Keats, which gets tiresome. The author also loves to throw in plot complications, to make the book feel denser I suppose. When these minor plot points are dropped and never resolved I feel like the author is trying to snow me instead of telling me a story."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"I tried reading Hyperion, but couldn't make it through the first Chapter. I could tell it was well written, but it wasn't for me. I really like Dan Simmons, but I lean more towards his horror, which easily exceeds Stephen King's in my eye. I would suggest Summer of Night to anyone who feels the same way as I do about his books."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"When I started Hyperion I had no idea what to expect. It was the first sci-fi I had read in a while and, put quite simply, it blew me away. The way Simmons had envisioned not only the future of a planet, but an entire universe was almost too much for me. The individual tales were incredibly engrossing and some nearly brought tears to my eyes. I have so many favorite parts, from Rachel telling Sol that she no longer wants to remember her unknown life, to Dure stuck in perpetual death and rebirth, that I have considered the entire book utterly breath-taking. I have read it seven times and every time I get something new out of it. I am now forcing my friends to read it and they have become enthralled with the Hyperion series. My only gripe is the unconclusive ending, but it forced me to read an almost equally impressive book, the Fall of Hyperion. I would give Hyperion more points if it were possible."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One of the things that I find pretty hard to do is review a book that I partially dislike. It is even harder to write about a book that I thought it could have been a masterpiece. Well, \\"Hyperion\\" is that type of book.Simmons is without a doubt a talented writer with a fertile imagination but he has a series of conscious vices that thwart this book. The strong point of \\"Hyperion\\" is definitively its structure. Simmons uses the style of Chaucer's classic, \`Tales of Canterbury' as a reference where each individual in a voyage narrates its personal story and the reasons for taking a common voyage (thus we get The Priest's Tale, The Poet's Tale, The Colonel's Tale, and so on.). Most of the stories are interesting and build tension in an impressive way. The Priest's and The Scholar's tales are my favorites but found all of them to be well developed (they are not short stories, all have their own theme and style) and to have sufficient weight by itself. Also, the manner in which the stories end converge in the reasons of each individual to take the voyage to the dreaded \\"Tombs Of Time\\".So far, I will say this is a masterpiece...but unfortunately it is not. The simple reason is that instead of writing a fine piece of speculative fiction, Simmons diverged and in some places (few but very intense) thought he was writing a pulp horror story. This is no surprise as horror is Simmons' main writing field. The result is that we get a series of gratuitous descriptions of bad taste violence that do not add anything to the story. The scenes could remain there but the way Simmons likes to describe them, slow and with painful detail is simply annoying and without any constructive or literary purpose, other than satisfying the cheap market which cries for that type of graphical violence. On a more personal ground I also found quite viscous the way Simmons negatively pictures the Catholic Church which he certainly seem to personally dislike (despise?), thus giving a superficially non-objective and immature perspective.The book is non conclusive in itself as there is a direct sequel ( \\"The Fall Of Hyperion\\" ) and two other related books ( \\"Endymion\\" and \\"The Rise Of Endymion\\" ),"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Hyperion is the tale of seven \\"pilgrims.\\" The main story line involves these very different people meeting, travelling to an enigmatic world called Hyperion, and confronting a cruel and unstoppable monster that guards ancient \\"tombs\\" travelling backwards in time. Along the way, each pilgrim reveals a unique story that leads to this myserious place.Each tale is engrossing, haunting, and illuminates pieces of the future and it's \\"history.\\" The characters have real depth and each story is tragic, although each unique character has experienced very different things.I've rarely read a book so beautifully written in a world so richly envisioned.However, although this book is a masterpiece, I couldn't give it the 5 stars that it \\"almost\\" deserves. There are two severe problems, which each deserve incremental penalties.Firstly, the story is incomplete. I understand the idea of a \\"series\\" but this isn't that. The story just stops. It cuts you off just as you're expecting to get some resolution. You literally have 6 different stories that you are left flailing on. It's nothing short of a cliffhanger.Secondly, the sequel -- \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" -- which finishes the story, is a grossly inferior book. While \\"Hyperion\\" represents some of the best writing I've ever read, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" is a novel that I would normally have abandoned part-way through. It should have been the last chapter or two of Hyperion, and there honestly wasn't enough story left for an entire book. While the sequel starts at a very readable quality, it gets worse and worse the further you go. I consider huge chunks of the sequel to be \\"drivel\\"."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"My review is aimed for Hyperion and its sequel : The fall of Hyperion, because you cannot judge it without reading those two books. Well, I really liked these books. They have everything needed to become a bestseller in this genre : fast paced action (space battles between Hegemony fleet and Ousters swarm), mystery and the un-explained (the Time Tombs which moving backward through time, the cruciform parasites with ability to make someone immortal), an interesting characters (personally I loved Brawne Lamia and The Consul characters, because Mr. Simmons had developed those two throughout the story), and even the love scene (between The Colonel and his mysterious lover, although sometimes quite vulgar). Among sci-fi books that I've ever read, Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion is the books that I always recommend my friend to read it (along with a few titles, like Ender's Game for instance). Only one minor critics : it seems that Mr. Simmons was infatuated with a poet named John Keats and had given him a major role in this story (although indirectly). Please, not all of your readers came from a culture who knew this personna!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"Amazing, June 4, 2010By J. Simonson \\"tsoheliot\\" - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)This review is from: Hyperion (Mass Market Paperback)I apologize if this ends up being unhelpful, but I just wanted to add my 2 cents quickly. First a personal frame of reference, so you have an inkling of how to judge my taste and thus my humble opinion. I read voraciously. I've read a lot throughout my life, mostly classical literature, and thus my taste has been formed by lots and lots of good writing. My favorite authors are Dostoevsky, Herman Hess, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jane Austen. That should give you an idea of my measuring sticks. My guilty pleasure is Science Fiction -\\"pleasure\\" because I love where the ideas & science explored take my intelligence and imagination, but \\"guilty\\" because most science fiction is poorly written. Too many cliches, bad characterization, bad dialogue, jingoism, machismo, general cheesiness unfortunately are all too common in the genre. My science fiction measuring sticks (my favorite books in the genre) are Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Brave New World and Dune. I'm totally adding Hyperion to that list. Wow. It is amazing. Incredibly well written, wonderfully imaginative -fully imagined- truly grand in scope, profound, poetic, funny, irreverent, sexy (SO HARD TO WRITE SEX WITHOUT CHEESE, but Mr. Simmons did it, I wager). It demands your full attention. It leaves you pondering for hours later. It will invade your dreams and maybe even question your beliefs. Beautiful images, pulsing adventure, heart-wrenching pain, horror, romance (of many kinds! old-fashioned, modern, pulpy, fraternal, religious, everything), even good characterization! I just loved it. I hope the sequels are just as good (I was very disappointed by the Dune sequels). Happy reading!"},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The Hyperion Cantos is huge and challenging to read, but not easy to put down either. From the first chapter of Hyperion when the structure of the story reveals itself mirroring the Canterbury Tales, I was drawn in. Simmons' universe isn't a dreamy world I'd wish to visit, but it is compellingly drawn. The literary, religious and philosopical references are so huge, I know I probably only \\"got\\" a tenth of them, but I loved it. And the rest of the Cantos."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"One thing to keep in mind when reading Dan Simmon's \\"Hyperion\\" is that once you finish this long tale, you're still committed to an equal length sequel just to finish the plot line. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I like my novels to be more self-contained. This is really just a first part here.Anyway, one thing Simmons does very well is build a unique and interesting world. So many great ideas are utilized and worked out - farcasters, ousters, etc. The world Simmons populates seems very real and interesting. The characters, however, with whom he populates this world vary in terms of success.Perhaps the best character is Sol. His story is very heart-felt and ideologically interesting. The least interesting is Brawnia's. Hard boiled detective fiction switching genders that never really meshes. I like Martin's tale, too, but his dialogue is a bit simplistic. All he does is say something cranky with the word \\"Fu-ing\\" inserted into it. Ho-hum.\\"Hyperion\\" is supposed to take its queue from Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" - an interesting prospect, especially since Bester did such a fantastic job adapting Dumas in \\"The Stars My Destination.\\" However, Simmons is much less successful. You get a better idea of what he wanted to do than actually see it work. He tries to have each pilgrims tale be in a different genre and voice but it mostly just sounds like adventure fiction.All-in-all there are some really interesting things here. It's just a lot of time to spend on what really amounts to little more than escapist adventures.P.S. - The Shrike is cool, too."},{"Title":"HYPERION","review":"The plot of this book is incredibly extensive and complex, and the mystery of it extends past the final pages; forcing you to buy the sequel The Fall of Hyperio as soon as you possibly can.Told in 6 short narrative stories through the experiences of the characters in the book, it feels as though 6 different authors wrote Hyperion. The characters are all archetypes that we can associate with. From a priest, to a philospher, to a poet and a soldier. Each segment is written incredibly. The poetry is excellent, the philosophy is staggering, it is as though you are reading 6 different authors from different genres who are all amazing writers.From a science fiction point of view the book is very satisfying. The time travel related paradoxes and technology all could be classified under far future hard science fiction, and it draws you in even more if you are a true fan of science fiction. But more importantly, the creativity of the imagery in the descriptions of alien planets, landscapes and wild life are so very unique that you believe they could be alien, as opposed to simalacrums of earth-like planets or variations/combinations of earth's landscapes and animals.One of the best books of any genre I have read."},{"Title":"History of the U.S. Navy: Vol.1","review":"This book should be teached in school. We're not just reading about the Navy here, but the entire history of the United States. The author gives plenty of details on obscure periods of the american history not found in other books on the Navy. He does a great job of summarizing well documented eras and gets behind the official story by showing the psychological and human aspect of the great decisions taken by key players. We learn that the superpower status of the United States comes from its desire to become a maritime power in the first place. For everyone who wants to know how the US became what it is now. By the way, I'm Canadian."},{"Title":"History of the U.S. Navy: Vol.1","review":"This book takes the reader from wooden ships right up to the beginning of world war II. You will not only love this book, but you will feel like you know everything when you finish reading it. The author not only teaches naval history in an exciting way, he teaches U.S. military and political history. He is not afraid to give original opinions, even about ground forces. The authors has intriuging ideas about Mccleland, and gives a very good history of vietnam in the second book of this series. This is a must read."},{"Title":"History of the U.S. Navy: Vol.1","review":"This and its companion V. 2 are an absolute must for any US Navy enthusiast. You may be well versed on the ships (Friedman) and the battles (Morison). But Love Jr. will allow you to understand the \\"why\\", i. e. the political settings in which naval policies and priorities evolved. From my reading, I have completely revised my concept of the naval aspect of the American Civil War. I now understand the role of the Philippines in early 20th-Century strategy, why the US Fleet was so unbalanced following WW1, how dirty tricks altered the result of the Washington Naval Conference, and the backstory on the Billy Mitchell affair. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"I've been to the BVIs a number of times on sailing trips and since I have enjoyed those experiences, I thought that I might enjoy a novel about the area as well. This is in fact a very enjoyable and fun read. Good parallels to experiences that many people who have spent much time there have encountered. The book and characters are however very similar in a number of respects to Herman Wouk's \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" which was originally published in 1965. Both book are enjoyable and a pleasant summer read - especially if you've ever been to the Caribbean."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"A romping good tale of a sail! A must read for anyone who wants to capture the ambiance of the caribbean islands."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"I found &quot;Sunfun Calypso&quot; on my fourth trip to the British Virgin Islands and read it as I was flying home. The book is a fun, easy read that captures much of the moods and dramas of the islands. If you've ever had the urge to move to the BVI, you should definitely read this first."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"This is a really fun book to read. If you have any knowledge of Tortola, BVI you will not find a better more enjoyable book that has so many near facts that you now exactly who the author is talking about. I first pick up my copy at Soper Hole on Frenchman's Key West End BVI while sailing the area. I'm not a \\"fast\\" reader, slow in-fact. It was hard to put the book down while anchored off Yost Van Dyke and finished in two settings. I've introduced this book to friends and some local authors who all loved the book.I'm sure that initially Julian Putley was reluctant to enter the BVI after the book was published! Far too many high falootin people are very identifiable and were harpooned in fun in the book! Great Read!"},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"Look no further for the perfect gift is here - a great find for fellow sailors, family, friends and tourist/cruisers who have just finished their Caribbean vacation and are returning to their homeland. Julian Putley's Sunfun Calypso immediately transported me into the realistic humor of life in Paradise. I don't know who will enjoy this book more - vacationers who have just returned from a fantastic cruise or those of us actually living here.Putley has set his story on a small Caribbean island flying the British flag. Four visitors enjoy a fantastic sailing vacation on a charter yacht - so much so that two of them decide to relocate to the Caribbean, buy a rather run down resort and marina, fix it up and..........far be it from me to let you know the plot! However, there is a marvelous subplot about a ship's figurehead -a beautifully carved mermaid. It is discovered, restored and placed above the front door of the resort's bar, aptly naming it the \`Mermaid Bar'. This leads to some very unlucky mishaps (voodoo??) for some that are finally resolved during the ending.A few weeks ago I was cruising with some friends. We anchored and were having sundowners when Sunfun Calypso came up as the topic of conversation. Oh, to be a fly on the wall. Everyone had read it and each had a different opinion as to who these fictional characters are patterned after. Putley has a knack for bringing to the reader the reality of living in the Caribbean - reggae music, poor infrastructure, great sailing, bad roads, callaloo soup, libel in the local paper, gorgeous sunsets, hurricanes, calypso, dishonest attorneys, govt. corruption and turquoise, gin-clear water. What those of us who live here just chalk up to everyday life. My friends each had a different name for the taxi driver, the dishonest attorney and the Chief Minister. As the sundowners progressed so did the arguments.One couple knew the book took place in Antigua, another Tortola and yet another the USVI only under the disguise of a British Colony. This is just what Putley intended. Remember Sunfun Calypso is purely fiction and any resemblance to persons living or dead is all in your mind. Just another reason to read it.Putley's love of the Caribbean started in 1972 when he first arrived in the British Virgin Islands. It was the love of the sea and the adventuresome sailing life that led to his research and documenting of many pirate stories included in his first booklet \`The Virgins' Treasure Isle' - the true story of the Norman Island treasure and The Caves. In 1983 Putley began a world voyage on his Tayana 37, Starry Night. It was during this circumnavigation that his stories were written. Many were published in Pacific Islands Monthly, Sailing, Cruising Helmsman and Cruising World and certainly helped Putley finance his trip.This love of adventure, combined with the incongruity of life, especially in Paradise, is what makes Sunfun Calypso so much fun to read. Every page is \`a happening' and that's why this little book is a great gift."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"I purchased this book in the BVI at North Sound. My friend and I were sailing for a week to get our bareboat rating. Our instructor was Julian Putley, the books author. He had mentionedhis book and when I saw it in the store, I had to have a copy.I can tell you that it may be fiction but there is a lot of truthabout the BVI, it's history and people, told in a story format.I enjoyed reading the book and recommend it to future visitors and those that have already visited the BVI."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"Sunfun Calypso is a must read for anyone who has been or dreams of traveling to the islands. The author, Julian Putley's imagination has woven together fact and fiction in a cleverly disguised and very descriptive story that makes you smile knowingly as it transports you back to the very places he writes of. It will take you along the pot holed roads in the back of taxis with Bob Marley shrines on the dashboard listening to the lilting dialect of your driver while holding on for your life, to feeling the spray on your face as you are sailing from island to island. His characters, some endearing and some not so..are all people we have met along the way. All this plus a very entertaining story that keeps you reading and ready to anticipate the next page. This has to be one of the most descriptive books I have read and I marvel how the author writes in such as way that the stage is set and in your minds eye you imagine it perfectly. He captures the essence of the people so that they are part of your life plus the flavor of the islands making you yearn to return and experience what you may have missed on your journey. The author obviously knows and loves his islands and I am very much looking forward to another of his stories."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"Putley does a wonderful job crafting words and twisting phrases. He is a generous spirit whose clarity for observation is right on the mark. After you read his descriptions of the meals, sea and sun in this book, you'll be ready to hire him in a minute to charter your cruise. Wonderful development of plot and characters. This book is a true depiction of a fairy tale vacation."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"Our group just returned from a sailing vacation in the B.V.I. and Justin was the Captain of the &quot;Change Order&quot; one of our three beautiful, high tech catamarans, but,unfortunately, not ours! While he's changed some names of people and places in the book, I recognized many of the sites and types of people. His book is not only a good story,his descriptions of the islands and the way of life are also accurate to what we experienced. Even if you never get to the islands, you can get a feeling for what it's like to be there."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"One way to put a smile on your face is to go cruising through the British Virgin Islands. The next best thing is to read Sunfun Calypso. I read the book a couple of months after sailing in the BVIs. The book brought back all the sun, beauty and laughter of that trip while shining a delightful light on what life is like for the lucky and some not-so-lucky people who work there. The plot follows a British couple who tries to develop a small resort and yacht charter company. Corrupt politicians do their best to suck the life out of the business before it gets its legs. There's a skillfully portrayed scene of a powerful hurricane and a captain with more hubris than sense. The storm destroys the captain and nearly the business. But pluck, good humor and hard work bring the business back. The author knows of what he writes, and if you're at all interested in life in the islands, this is a fun way to learn."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"Julian Putley has done a remarkable job of capturing the essence of a trip to the Islands in this great book while keeping the reader entertained with twists and turns on every page. If you have never been to the BVI or just spend your days dreaming of such a trip, this book should be required reading. For those of you lucky enough to have spent time in the Islands, you will recognize so many of the people, places and customs that you'll find yourself with a huge smile on your face and you'll start itching to go back. All in all, this is a great little adventure written by someone who knows and loves his Islands."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"This book is a must read. Julien (The Author) was our Captain in the BVI and the book is very reflective of his great personality. The book has something for everyone. It is hilarious and contains some tradgedy. I highly recomend it. The only thing better than getting Julien as your captain is reading his book."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"The type of story that once you start reading, you cannot stop! A little of everything in this story. Adventure and romance, fiction, history, politics, etc. I enjoyed reading Sunfun Calypso very much!"},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"Having been to the Caribbean a few times, I could easily recognize the wonderful &quot;fictitious&quot; characters and situations in this fun filled book. The story is well narrated, and full of suspense too: I could hardly wait to find out what the end was going to be. I definitely reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"So I'm sailing along the leeshore of Cooper Island with our Skipper from a Tradewinds charter and begin discussing the business opportunities available in the BVI's. He tells me that he's written a fictional book touching on the experiences of foreigners who have attempted to do just that. His name was Julian Putney and he just so happened to have a copy on hand. I read it almost non-stop and was immediately asking about the sequel. I'm told it's coming. If you're looking for a hilarious and insightful story about the modern day BVI's, read this book. He has also written the definitive &quot;Drinking Man's Guide to the BVI&quot;, and a wonderfully rich historical short story, &quot;The Virgin's Treasure Isle&quot;."},{"Title":"Sunfun Calypso","review":"These islands and the expectations of the people who visit them have not changed since &quot;Don't Stop the Carnival&quot;. This is refreshing, fast moving, and a modern update of that tale. In this instance, the backdrop is the British Virgin Islands, and since the author is British and has worked in the industry which he writes about, truly believable, and fun to read. The additional mystery subplot adds to the whole and explains the book's racy cover. This is a must for anyone now living in these islands, planning a visit, and especially if you plan to charter a sailboat in the area. I hope the Mr. Putley will write the next book."},{"Title":"Glory Days Of Logging - Action In The Big Woods - British Columbia To California","review":"This is a classic for anyone interested in the history of logging in the Pacific Northwest. Together with Andrews other companion book, &quot;This Was Sawmilling&quot; the reader will gain a great understanding how trees were harvest, transported to mills and converted into the resources which built this Country. There's hundreds of wonderful photos from the woods along with many contraptions which loggers created to make their tasks either easier or more likely, more productive. Can you imagine a raft 1000 feet long and 30 feet wide and deep made out of logs laced together with huge chains? These structures containing millions of board feet of trees would be created in the far Northwest and floated down the coast to San Diego, CA and further. There's photos in the book. There's a great photo of a logger standing on the top of a tree hundreds of feet in the air just after he has completed preparation for high-lead logging. The book is separated into geographic regions from British Columbia and each of the States of the Northwest. It has numerous poems written about loggers. (Please don't call them lumber-jacks. I never heard a man who works in the woods called a lumber-jack all my years going up in Oregon. Yet a recent TV show about the worlds most dangerous jobs constantly referred to them a lumber-jacks.) Distraction of this classic includes the lack of a table of contents, index, and the disconnect between the photos and the stories. Which is to be expected. Andrews rarely had photos of the people in the stories and vice versa. Why this short-comings. Superior Publishing printed many of these books by folks who simply wanted to document the hard work of others. Regardless whether it was logging, railroading, or shipping they were willing to publish the books. Thank goodness they did or we'd never have had these classics. If you have an interest in the history of logging this book will be a great addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Glory Days Of Logging - Action In The Big Woods - British Columbia To California","review":"I lost my hard bound version, but this book is just as good! Both my Father and Great Grand Fathers were loggers in Grays Harbor, and were known for their abilities to the Simpson-Poulson logging companies. I have a photo of my Great Grandfather standing at the base of a nine foot diameter Douglas Fir tree with all his logging buddies hanging, standing and chained to this monster tree, although it was a small one back in the 1920's! Back then it was all OLD GROWTH trees! I remember seeing a ten foot first cut log, on the trailer of a logging truck, back in 1960, rolling through Aberdeen on it's way to the lumber mill! THOSE WERE THE DAYS!This book covers it all! And I highly recommend anybody with an axe and chain saw to look into what logging was like, back when your Great Grand Parents were in their prime! And I mean between 1910 and 1930."},{"Title":"Essential Limited Liability Company Handbook (PSI Successful Business Library)","review":"This book is written by people who clearly know what they're talking about, and who aim to make the LLC simple to understand. They describe how easy it is to create one anywhere in the US and give you everything you need. The writing is simple, direct, and interesting--no legalese, no jargon. The book gives a clear picture of the advantages of LLCs over other business structures. Even though the copyright says 1995, the book has been updated through 1997 at least because it cites 1997 legislation. The authors walk you through the steps of creating the LLC, and provide simple forms of the five legal documents required--Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement, Listing of Managers, Listing of Members, and Listing of Capital Contributions. It lists state-by-state the address of the Secretary of State, the fees, and state LLC guidelines. Incredibly, the book includes the actual forms you need for the filing in each state. I picked up the book not knowing anything about LLCs and feel I came away with a clear picture of how to create one. I appreciate the feeling of empowerment. However, this book provides the simplest versions of the things necessary to create an LLC. And stops there. There are many REALLY valuable items you could include in your Articles of Organization that the authors could have hinted at without losing that simple feel. Also, the name 'Handbook' is misleading--you'll soon want another book that gives you the nuts and bolts of funding and operating an LLC. But what the Handbook does, it does well. Good book, great price."},{"Title":"Essential Limited Liability Company Handbook (PSI Successful Business Library)","review":"This reference to LLC's covers less than what can be found on most state web sites. The forms are COPIES of downloadable forms from each state and are outdated. Most of the state fees are incorrect! LLC's are not difficult to file for. In most cases, there are only a couple requirements from each state and the forms can be completed in less than 30 minutes. What is hard about an LLC or any corporate structure is the Operating Agreement (like By Laws), which should be detailed and clearly spell out the rights, responsibilities and limitations placed on the members and managers of the organization. This book shows a couple very general examples but does not even list important areas to &quot;think&quot; about. The Operating Agreement is the most important document of an LLC; it is what creates the legal limiting of liability. The forms sent to the state are simply a formality and can be figured out by following the instructions on the forms themselves. More than 75% of this book lists information for each state and shows copies of forms. This is a waste. This is a no star book, but had to give atleast one."},{"Title":"A child's garden of verses,","review":"We have been reading this book for over eight years to our boys (10 & 7). It was recommended by our beloved teacher of two year olds for a Mother/Mom little school program, she had been teaching for 18 years and said that the Tasha Tudor illustrations drew the children into being fascinated into listening to the poems. And the poems are about the adventures of a little boy. My boys each have their favorite poems and request having those read to them like little presents. At night, the older one has heard the poems so often, it's like sleep therapy...half way through \\"we built a ship upon the stairs all built of back bedroom chairs...\\" and he's out like a light.

The last time I read it, on each page I gave him the option of listening to the poem on the left or on the right, and without exception he chose both. Mind you, father and grandfather were bored beyond belief listing to me read. But not my grandson.

One of my favorites is \\"The Swing\\":How do you like to go up in a swing,Up in the air so blue?Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thingEver a child can do!Of course, one would buy this edition of A Child's Garden of Verses not only for Stevenson's poetry (this is not a complete version but a newly revised selection) but also for Brian Wildsmith's gorgeous, whimsical illustrations. Wildsmith, born in 1931 at the mining village of Penistone in Yorkshire, England, has been called one of the greatest living children's book illustrators. Stevenson's poems perfectly capture the make-believe imagination of childhood. What child has not pretended at one time or another that his bed is a ship sailing the wide seas? And Wildsmith's stunning, colorful paintings perfectly capture the joyful childhood innocence of Stevenson's poetry. While the language may be upper class Victorian England, the appeal is universal.

All the classic Stevenson pieces are here: \\"The Swing,\\" \\"The Land of Counterpane,\\" the terrific poem about a child's shadow. Tudor depicts only children and animals herein--as it should be--without the presence of shadow of adults anywhere. Both Stevenson and Tudor understand in their bones that no matter what grown-ups may think, children inhabit a world of their own.

Pirates and sailing ships, the seaside, distant stars, toy soldiers, galloping horses, howling dogs, imaginary playmates, the moon, explorers, Indians, swings, fairies and Gameboys are all childhood fascinations that find their way into Stevenson's verse. Well, OK, I lied about the \\"Gameboys\\" (just to see if you were paying attention), but that brings up another point. This poetry was composed in 1885, which means that the occasional archaic word or mossy British phrase rears its mysterious head from time to time. I like that; it adds a touch of antique elegance to the garden. But if you're going to be reading this aloud to a kiddie, be prepared to explain lamplighters, grenadiers, balusters, gabies and bogies.Back in 2002, my Mom suffered a small stroke, and consequently it was decided that she should move into the house that my Brother and I shared. At nearly 74 years old, she tends to tire easily. Some days she remains in bed and lets a good part of the morning slip away. When that happens, I'll knock softly at her bedroom door and enquire, \\"AIN'T YOU 'SHAMED, YOU SLEEPY-HEAD?\\" That always gets her up to start the day. Aren't the Tides Of Life a wonder?"},{"Title":"A child's garden of verses,","review":"This is a beautiful book with gorgeous pictures.

I have not come across any book on Frued which is so comprehensive yet does not seem to drag on about trivial details. It is like having a converstaion with Freud, perhaps even better because you can skip and chose the subject at will. The book gives a complete run down on all the major and some minor works of Freud, some in the form of lectures for the novice while others are for beginners. It has something for every body. While not many will agree with Freud's prognosis on Da Vinci, Nabokov, Michealangelo etc., we should consider ourselves fortunate enought that soemone offered to traverse through the thought processes of these geniuses and tried to split open their hidden personalities. Until we find a better explanation of what drives humans towards homo sexuality or why success leads people towards melancholy and why do we get recurring dreams about failure or flight fanatasy, Sigmund Freud shall continue to occupy the mantle which is fit only for a 20th century prophet. To bring his work to light in an accessible form, we owe gratitude to Mr Gay"},{"Title":"The Freud Reader","review":"Sigmund Freud was the first clinical psychotherapist, the first to discover and investigate the possibilities of \\"a talking cure\\". His contributions have made possible effective psychotherapeutic treatments for ailments encompassing not only acute psychological symptoms, such as traumatic, dissociative, phobic, depressive, and conversion disorders. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is also the treatment of choice for broader personality difficulties which often give rise to more generalized problems in living, for example, difficulties in love relationships, self-esteem, and work achievement.To summarize briefly Freud's views on how psychotherapy works is a daunting task. His psychoanalytic writings spanned some forty-three years, from 1895 to 1938, and fill twenty-three hefty volumes. As the first to enter this clinical and theoretical territory, he had nearly to invent de novo a model of the human mind. Based on observations from both in and outside the clinical setting, his model would include psychological development from earliest infancy, how one eventually arrives, or fails to arrive, at a relatively stable personality structure. Moreover, the Freudian model accounts for the human potential for resumed growth and change throughtout life. Psychoanalysis also seeks to understand the continuous process of mental function from moment to moment, as might be observed through intropsection or in a session of psychotherapy.Freud recognized that psychological life intrinsically is inseparable from relations with other people, \\"object relations\\", starting with an infant's relations to its mother, later continuing with the child's relations to both his parents and siblings, and ultimately to the wider surrounding community. We can fairly say that Freud, in his discovery and description of transference and countertransference in the therapeutic relationship, saw a \\"relational perspective\\" as essential to understanding the process of psychotherapy. Nevertheless, his clinical and theoretical work remained primarily focused on the inner life of the patient. From his fundamental model of the human mind and psychological life, he saw implications for broader human concerns, regarding morality, law, politics, the arts, culture, and society, as also explored for example in literature, religion, and philosophy .Most noteworthy about Freud's thought, in fact, is its evolution. Extraordinarily able to acknowledge his own errors and uncertainties, Freud saw, in the early 1920's, that his original formulations under \\"the topographic theory\\" had become a cul de sac, blocking further progress. Unable to account for certain anomolous phenomena, such as his discoveries of unconscious guilt and unconscious ego functions, he was able and willing himself to undertake the necessary, revolutionary shift in thought, leading from the topographic to what has become known as \\"the structural theory\\".Almost all schools of psychotherapy today, including those that see themselves as being opposed to Freudianism, in fact derive from psychoanalysis, as branches derive from a common root.Samuel T. Goldberg, M.D."},{"Title":"The Freud Reader","review":"Like many people, I had a passing familiarity with Freudian concepts (repression, the unconscious) that had entered the general culture, and had read small bits of Freud in college. Peter Gay is one of Freud's foremost biographers, and his mastery of Freud's work is reflected in his selections for this anthology. Each selection is arranged chronologically (except for a brief autobiographical piece by Freud, which serves as an introduction) to show the evolution of Freud's thought. Professor Gay adds helpful introductory notes to put each individual piece in context, and relate it to the body of Freud's work. The anthology also has extensive references for further reading.For me, the revelation of this anthology is how the Freud of popular culture is not the Freud that emerges in his work. For example, Freudian theory is commonly regarded as \\"pathologizing\\" homosexuality. However, it becomes clear from reading the selections here that, clinically, Freud saw homosexual orientation as no more or less \\"pathological\\" than \\"normal\\" heterosexuality. He regarded the \\"pathology\\" as a matter of social convention, and noted how homosexuality was admired in ancient cultures. This is not to say that Freud himself undertook to challenge the homophobia of his place and time, but it does show how his thinking was more far more nuanced than the popular image we've inherited. The selections also give a fascinating glimpse at the mindset of late nineteenth and early twentieth century medicine: Freud's entire theory evolved out an effort to treat somatic complaints that appeared to have no organic cause.Professor Gay has assembled an extraordinarily well-crafted selection of Freud's writings. They provide an excellent overview of Freud's actual work, and the development of his thought."},{"Title":"The Freud Reader","review":"This book covers a LOT of ground in one volume, which is useful. Four stars because the type is too small in the paper-back. I'd rather hold a bigger book that middle aged eyes can read more easily."},{"Title":"The Freud Reader","review":"I've had this book for awhile now and I've read it a couple of times over the last few years, a few chapters at a time. Peter Gay has done a very commendable job putting most of Freud's ideas together in one large volume. It's very long, close to 900 pages. This can be a difficult read if you are not familiar with Freud and his theories and philosophy. Yes, he was a philosopher as well as a psychoanalyst. I took a course on Freudian psychology back many years ago while in college. I always felt that Freud was right about so many things especially how mind works as we grow and mature. Freud had much to say about culture, literature, art, politics and religion. He was very good and got right to the point.Some of his sexual theories have fallen out of favor and his theory of the \\"death instinct\\" to explain evil and violence has fallen also. I understand how this happened because I have read the works of those who worked with him and disagreed on some of those issues, Jung, Adler and Otto Rank. Freud, of course, was the first psychoanalyst to explore these areas but not the first thinker and not the last. These men were not only psychoanalysts but giants of intellect and philosophy. I recommend this book to all with a desire to understand how we work psychologically and how Freud, a great mind, felt about the \\"meaning of life\\". I love reading books like these because even though I may not agree with everything it makes me think. Freud's patients kept confirming his theories (most of them) in psychoanalysis so he held fast to his concepts. I believe that his theory of sexuality is true but not as important as mankind's fear of life and death in the development of character and personality. Otto Rank, Carl Jung and Adler splintered off from Freud on this issue."},{"Title":"The Freud Reader","review":"this is a hefty book, but easy to read and comprehensive. arrived in pristine condition. great for students of psychology."},{"Title":"The Freud Reader","review":"I am a second year psychology student and I plan on getting at the very least a Master's degree in psychology. I wanted a book that could give me a much broader understanding of Freud's theories and contributions to psychology than what my first year of studies gave me, and this book really hit the spot. Peter Gay does a great job of stringing together many of Freud's greatest works on dreams, sexuality, and the development of psychoanalysis in order to give the reader a glimpse into Freud's mind and his life's work. I was unaware that Freud was a medically trained professional and was working with the organic disease of the nervous system before deciding to start work on the neuroses and in turn develop his psychological theories and contributions to the field.

It was interesting, and the story threads of the two cases kept me reading. These days, I sometimes do stop reading a book because I was not interested; that was not the case in this one. I wanted to read it through to the end to see where the characters were going, and how the cases would be resolved.I did think, however, that in the first 90% of the book, the author was setting a scene for his concluding chapters, and that the concluding chapters came too quickly. The story became relatively complete, but in its conclusion it felt like too much too fast...based on the previous chapters.I did like the book (Thank you Amazon, I think that comment is permissable in your reviews) and intend to read his next."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Kermit Roosevelt's book gives the lie to the Lord Chancellor's boast in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe: 'The law is the true embodiment/Of everything that's excellent./ It has no kind of fault or flaw,/And I, my lords, embody the law.' This work makes a memorable case for legal ethics and ethical lawyers, and it decries the 'live to work' ethic that characterizes too many law firms, hospitals, banks and brokerage houses. Young lawyers try to compartmentalize their life, but the all-encompassing firm increasingly provdes everything they would otherwise be obliged to go outside for, including some goods and services available online: lunch, dry cleaning, shoe shining, coiffure, babysitting, nursing care and even retirement community placement for an ailing parent -- all in the name of maximizing hours billable to clients. Mr. Roosevelt's book, as one would expect from an author of his distinguished name, is tasteful, eschewing lurid or graphic sex scenes in favor of subtle reminders that lawyers participate in human sexuality. The work carefully distinguishes between law and justice, and should be read by all university students who are considering a career in the law."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"In the Shadow of the Law is a fascinating story of life inside a powerful Washington, D.C. law firm, Morgan Siler. The novel focuses on two cases. One is a pro bono case for a Virginia man on death row. The intent is to try and eliminate the death sentence for this man. The other case involves one of Morgan Siler's big corporation clients, Hubble, who's Texas chemical plant had an explosion which killed several employees. Hubble now faces a class action suit. Intertwined within the main two cases are glimpses of a few other dealing of the law firm as well as bits and pieces of personal lives.The novel jumps around a fair bit, from scene to scene. In the audiobook version, this jumping around is a bit problematic because it often isn't immediately clear that the author has taken the reader somewhere else, ie changed scenes.All in all, the novel was enjoyable. This is a novel that focuses on the working of the law firm. As such, it doesn't include detailed descriptions of the crime scenes or crime scene analysis, police involvement, etc."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"This book is well written.

I feel like I learned things about the law and also better understand my own values. In terms of entertainment value for the dollar, it's one of the best purchases I've made.Craig Wasson's choices as a reader are excellent. I was amused that Wasson chose, from time to time, to use a very recognizable voice (I heard Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, John Houseman, and John Wayne) for the characters, which made the audiobook feel more like a movie. (If you aren't listening for it, you might miss it, though--it's not rubbed in your face.) I should also mention that I'm a lawyer, and even though I might disagree with some of the legal interpretations made by the characters, everything was very plausible. That is, unlike almost every TV show, movie, and thriller (with the exception of the better Grisham books), the law was _not_ completely wrong. The lawyers' struggles were unusual (thus interesting) but not outlandish. The mind-numbing nature of much of the legal work is very accurately portrayed, too. It's nice to hear the truth stated now and then. I've recommended this book to my lawyer friends."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"an unbelievably intelligent read; roosevelt is quite obviously ivy-league educated. and, as an attorney, i can tell you he hits the asanine partner thing dead-on (i had to shake my head in collaboration with poor mark's disgust upon finding out that the interrogatories due THAT NIGHT OR ELSE were actually not going to be used for another week or so).if you are looking for a fast, zippy read, you might do better to look elsewhere. roosevelt focuses a great deal on the philosophy of the law and how this philosophy weaves itself into the souls of his characters. the information on clerking for the supreme court is good stuff, particularly how it 'runs the deaths,' but all the opera/valkyrie mess with harold got a bit forced.there are 3 legal-ly plots twisted throughout this book and it often seemed that just when one plot was getting juicy, roosevelt would switch over to philosophy mode and the reader would have to pan through a 15 page essay on legal theory. zzzzz. i found myself skimming those parts and not losing out on much.overall, i recommend this book, particularly if you are a lawyer or, God bless you, thinking about becoming one. if you are just a legal-thriller enthusiast, this book might be a bit heavy."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I read 2-3 hours a day and rarely don't finish a book I have started.

Each thought described in each sentence displays a flash of brilliance but characters in the story blend into one another without much distinction. I'll have to heed Professor Kermit Roosevelt's notations paraphrased here by me as something like (1) succeeding is energizing, exhilarating and satisfying but success is empty and also (2) a society person is bound by tiny thread of custom and duty and so at minimum he risks being ridiculed by community if he aims and achieves wholesale reorganization of personal lives."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Now that we got all that out of the way, the characters and the LAW that is, maybe his next book will have more of a plot.The first 2/3rds is character developement and legalese that's tedious.

What I enjoyed most about this book was that even though it is written entirely about the law, you don't need a J.D to understand what is going on. Roosevelt breaks things down enough to make it easy to understand and enjoyable for readers of a myriad of backgrounds. \`In The Shadow of the Law' is a wonderful book for fans of legal thrillers and summer beach readers alike. Even though the basis of the novel is the law, it is also touches upon our own personal motivations, morals, and values. He shows the unforgiving and almost brutal world of law, and exposes the not so glamorous reality of being a first year associate at a huge, well known law firm. Roosevelt also on occasion adds a witty humor to characters' situations and you may just find yourself laughing out loud like I did. The slight use of humor in this book also makes it less sterile and more relatable and realistic than similar books in the genre.Just a tip- 'In the Shadow of the Law' doesn't take well to a passive reading style, I suggest that you read it all in one sitting. Otherwise, you'll find yourself paging back a few chapters to reacquaint yourself with what is happening in the book. So kick off your sandals, lay down your beach towel, break open the book and prepare to be entertained for the entire day. Also- if you aren't a lawyer, I can almost guarantee by page 50 you'll stop regretting the fact that you never took the LSATs."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"During our journey on this earth we come to many crossroads. At some roads we see what lies ahead, but on other longer roads, the future is unclear. Some roads are one way, some are slow. The decision to become a lawyer was an unfamiliar journey to me. The questions that spark the flames of passion in my mind do not do not concern the law, and consequently, deciding to become a lawyer never crossed my mind. But just as my profession tackles the beauties of complexities of human existence, so do many other professions.In the Shadow of the Law (ISL) has more than a fantastic, twisting plot. It takesthe reader into a very unfamiliar world, the internal structure of a law firm. Through a perfected, consistent, and complete third person narrative, Roosevelt pushes his reader into closed doors, secret meetings, and the personal lives of associates, and partners. But beyond the elements of the book that make our heart race, and blood pulsate, is the philosophy presented in the novel. It is clear that the Author graduated from the top of his Harvard class in Philosophy, and even more apparant that he graduated in the top of an even more elite group, the Yale \\"school of theory.\\" Through the philosophy presented in this book, we are given the opportunity to ask and answer many questions about the law, we, as ordinary people, don't even know exist. The insight is beautiful, and unique, and in many respects, without the plot, would still serve as a beatiful piece of art.So, in conclusion, whatever journey you happen to be driving along, take the time to read this book. For a student, interested in becoming a lawyer, this will give you a chance to learn what that career path is like in the privacy of your own home, alongside a bowl of popcorn. For a lawyer, who, more than most, will connect, agree, and disagree with what this book has to offer; read this book for a fun and exciting story. And finally, for everyone else, take this opportunity to grow and gain an appreciation for what the \\"law\\" is.

It was somewhat entertaining, but painted a very bleak view of life in a law firm and unethical practices which don't necessarily exist everywhere. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"If \\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" is to be categorized as a legal thriller, emphasis must be added to the word \\"legal.\\" This is not a book for those seeking a light-hearted romp through the legal justice system or a romanticized view of the high-powered attorney lifestyle. Rather, it's a scathing portrayal of the pressures and absurdities that confront the legions of young associates who are forced to bill like the wind to pay back their law school loans through indentured servitude in today's mega-firms as well as the mid-life crises engulfing the partners who have sacrificed their personal lives in pursuit of ever-loftier partnership profits.That's not to say that this novel isn't an entertaining read. Told from the perspective of half a dozen comically-stereotypical attorneys in a Washington law firm who are involved in a prono bono death penalty case and defense of a mass tort suit, Roosevelt hooks you by building a foreboding sense of suspense in the early chapters and then keeps you guessing with some nifty plot twists in the later stages.But unless you have a legal background, you may not appreciate the real genius of this book. As the title aptly conveys, the characters and plot of this novel are ultimately overshadowed by the law itself, which serves in equal shrift as villain and protagonist. The law operates as the villain in the hands of the greedy partners who have abandoned the role of lawyer as counselor in favor of lawyer as crass profiteer and mouthpiece for unsavory clients. Yet the law also acts as the protagonist when wielded by Mark and Katja, two neophyte associates who have still retained their youthful ideals and sense of justice. And, most interesting of all for this reader, the complex and mysterious personality of the law is beautifully depicted through the internal struggle of ex-Supreme Court clerk Walker Eliot who tries in vain to reconcile the Platonic version of legal precedent dispensed by the appellate courts with law as sullied by the mere mortals wrestling with bad facts in the lower courts. Somehow, though, I can imagine Professor Roosevelt exhorting his law students to be prepared to walk the muddy path of the law spurned by Eliot.-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\""},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"As previous reviewers have noted, John Grisham this is not. There are a lot more subtleties and intricacies involved in the reading of \\"In the Shadow of the Law\\"; if you do not have the patience to appreciate these subtleties and are merely looking to figure out \\"whodunnit\\", then you are overlooking one of the more unique aspects of this novel. Mr. Roosevelt's sense of humor is exquisitely astute and laugh-out-loud enjoyable. But you might miss it if you're simply looking for the next big plot development. His meticulous appreciation for \\"The Law\\" as entity, profession, and dogma give his novel a depth lacking in most legal thrillers. Yes, this novel is probably biased towards the legal community. But as a layperson, I honestly enjoyed it thoroughly and went so far as to buy it for two equally lay friends. I look forward to reading future works by Mr. Roosevelt."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Like LeCarre, Roosevelt willfully adopts all the conventions of his genre--the young associate at the powerful corporate law firm who comes to suspect his employer's complicity in a deadly crime--but subverts them by stripping away their sensationalism. You don't expect to see George Smiley parachute onto a ski slope in a tuxedo with his submachine gun blazing, and, while there's menace aplenty and even some violence in In the Shadow of the Law, neither do you expect to see Roosevelt's protagonist escape gun-toting thugs by executing an uneven-bar routine on the plumbing in The Firm's basement. (Indeed, Roosevelt's Mark Clayton doesn't even seem to be a very good lawyer.) Paradoxically, however, in In the Shadow of the Law, as in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, the unimistakable air of authenticity makes an intricate plot much more riveting than it would be if it were tarted up with implausible cliches.But Roosevelt also has qualities that LeCarre didn't develop until later--if ever. One is a graceful, evocative, expressive writing style. The other is the intellectual maturity to tackle a big theme. LeCarre's big theme was uncertainty and moral compromise in the Great Game. Roosevelt's is the law: how it works, what it means, and how it can be used to both just and unjust ends. And while there is some cynicism in his treatment of the mercenary motives of corporate attorneys, his novel is also animated by a deep understanding of and respect for the law, and the conviction that it can be a means to a greater good. A brilliant debut."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"\\"In the Shadow of the Law,\\" Kermit Roosevelt's debut novel, is a caustic indictment of corporate lawyers who sacrifice their souls on the altars of money and power. The author is a graduate of Yale Law, he has clerked for a Supreme Court Justice, and he is an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. All of these experiences are woven into Roosevelt's hard-hitting story about the ways in which wealthy and successful corporate lawyers handle their personal and professional problems.The firm of Morgan Siler is based in Washington, D. C., and its lawyers represent multibillion-dollar corporations. Peter Morgan, the senior partner, has steered his late father's firm into such lucrative areas as bankruptcy and mergers. Morgan is arrogant, self-centered, and ruthless, qualities that are highly prized in Morgan Siler's employees. However, one associate, Mark Clayton, is a recent law school graduate who has not yet been corrupted by the system. He inherits a troubling pro bono death penalty case that proves to be a trial by fire. Morgan Siler is also defending a Texas company, Hubble Chemical, against a class action suit stemming from a fatal fire at a chemical plant where toxic chemicals were stored.Roosevelt's cast of characters is large and varied. Besides the aforementioned Clayton and Morgan, other members of the firm are Walker Eliot, a brilliant third year associate who loves the law more in theory than in practice, Katja Phillips, a beautiful young idealist who is sickened by her colleagues' dirty tricks, and Ryan Grady, who would rather chase women than file briefs.\\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" gets high marks for its detailed depiction of the inner workings of a high-octane law firm. Roosevelt realistically describes the pressures that corporate lawyers face. Some of the members of Morgan Siler suffer from insomnia, fatigue, and stress-related ailments. They often turn to alcohol to unwind, and because of their long hours at work, they have difficulty sustaining long-term personal relationships. Divorce is more the norm than the exception.On the down side, this novel is a bit too long and repetitious; Roosevelt hammers home his theme about the immorality of corporate lawyers again and again. In addition, the passages that deal with arcane case law may be difficult for the average reader to understand. Roosevelt's writing is, at times, pretentious. He is fond of using ten-dollar words such as \\"ineluctable,\\" \\"simulacrum,\\" and \\"carapace.\\" Finally, Roosevelt spends too much time recording the internal thoughts of his characters, who endlessly and tediously take stock of their narcissistic lives.Overall, however, \\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" is an intelligent, ambitious, satirical, and frightening look at how people who are sworn to uphold the law rationalize their perversion of the law. A villain named Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare's \\"Henry VI, Part Two\\" said that \\"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\\" After reading this scathing first novel by a promising young writer, one can almost sympathize with Dick's harsh words about the legal profession."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I loved this book. I've read a lot of legal thrillers, and in the past few years there have been a lot of academic types churning out their first novels (for example, The Rule of Four, Emperor of Ocean Park, The Dante Club), so I thought I had a pretty good sense of what to expect from this book. But it far exceeded my expectations.First of all, it did not read like a first novel. With some of the recent first-novel-thrillers, I got the sense that the authors thought, hey, I'm smart, I'm erudite, I can write a trashy book--how hard can it be? It's trash, after all. But writing a book is hard, and takes practice, and so there are good bad books (The Da Vinci Code) and bad bad books. And, predictably, those first novels read like the work of tyros. In contrast, it's clear that Roosevelt has written fiction before. He knows his way around a sentence, and a plot. I couldn't hear the gears turning when I read Roosevelt's book.Second, it wasn't trashy. (I mean that in a good way.) There were actual characters, who actually, you know, developed. Even though they were all \\"types,\\" they also came alive as people for me. In fact, the plot of the book seemed secondary to Roosevelt's observations and skillful but understated writing.Finally, Roosevelt has ideas about the law that go beyond the standard \\"class actions can punish big companies\\" or \\"big firms are sleazy\\" themes of other legal thrillers. He seems to have complicated, ambivalent views of legal ethics, for example.In short, this book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Roosevelt's \\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" did something I'd considered impossible: I actually sympathized for a fictional group of young, urban, professionals. If it can get any worse than that, they were lawyers. The characters' shockingly realistic personalities, neuroses, and mannerisms lead me to believe that Roosevelt is either an extremely keen observer of both self and peer, or possibly a genius slipping into both schizophrenia and multiple-personality disorder. Does it matter?I would believe this work to be enjoyed most by fans of Joyce, Tolkein, or Herbert; it's language and character development both allow the reader a seamless transition into a world foreign to most, a world found only 'in the shadow of law.'"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Entertainment Weekly put this book on its \\"Must List,\\" praising its \\"complex and believable characters.\\" The plot is interesting, but what's distinctive is the characters and the different views they have of the law. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"All set for a thriller of a courtroom novel where the brilliant defense attorney defends a man against an unjust charge of murder, and where a surprise witness enters the scene in the final 20 pages? I'd suggest you look elsewhere. How about this case in In The Shadow Of The Law? Our hard working lawyers take on a case that involves the securitization of assets, a fiduciary duty suit, and some convertible stock.This is a novel that studies the character of the law, and the characters of lawyers in a very large law firm. A lawyer in the book reflects on the Penn law school motto: \\"Laws without morals are useless.\\" The book goes on to prove that such is perhaps not the case. One lawyer reflects that we become what we choose to become. He then wonders about what he has become in the last 25 years. A man without a soul perhaps? Someone who has no life other than the firm? Arriving early to work one associate looks up at the wall of glass which is the firm's headquarters and sees faint forms moving about like insects pushing up against the glass.The preceding paragraph pretty much sums up the author's philosophy. Brief snippets of actual cases appear from time to time, but a lot of the book is taken up with the musings of those insects trapped behind the glass. There is one case thread that wanders through the book that deals with a rather hopeless(?) pro bono case of appealing the death sentence of a murderer, but the rest of the cases deal with civil litigation such as defending a client whose manufacturing plant blew up killing several employees.I enjoyed this book first of all because it is uniquely different from other novels involving the law. It is about the lawyers, and the profession that they have chosen. Good stuff, stuff that would make anyone think twice about becoming a lawyer. It's also a very well written novel, a true literary work. As for the dull sounding litigation that takes place, well you really don't have to understand everything about involuntary stock transfers to truly enjoy this work of art."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Calling this book a legal thriller, while accurate, sells it short. In the Shadow of the Law is a very good novel: it has fully developed and believable characters, and a great plot that will keep you turning the pages. The end it's a little too Hollywood (false identities included), which is the only reason I don't give it five stars, but this is a very enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"KR's book is way better than the legal thriller genre might make you think. Its more like Umberto Eco than Dan Brown, and more like John Franzen than John Grisham. You learn alot, even if you were already a lawyer or a law clerk yourself.Kim's book, to paraphase what someone once said about Marilyn Monroe, has curves in places that others don't even have places. Yes, you may have to use your brain when reading this, but fear not KR will take care of you.Tell me what other book can make a plot issue out of asset securitization? Or explore what it feels like to win a case, but feel sick about the judicial reasoning? That's the kind stuff you have to have a kind of hyper-legal sensitivity to write about. That's K.R.Finally, the book contains the great idea of putting metal taps on your shoes which does indeed protect them."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"this book was one of the most engrosdsing stories about the law and lawyers I have read. I practiced solo and with my husband for 35 years before retiring and envied the glamorous life I thought the lawyers in big law firms led. Now I'm convinced that I had the better life, if not the $.We must get back to the idea of the law being a noble profession and not a mere moneymaking opportunity."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I listened to this book on an iTunes audiobook on my way from Cleveland to Columbus to take the Ohio Bar Examination. The gravity of what the author was getting at was supremely depressing to me at that very trying time in my life. Yet, the importance of the work and the privilege to, perhaps, get a crack at doing this work made me proud and hopeful. All in all, some of the reviews call the book a little thin . . . but it was entertaining and not the same-old-story. Furthermore, the author treats the law from a perspective that is quite new--and I think my feelings on the trip down and back from Columbus were what he wanted to conjure. A great story and I, too, look forward to the next one from this author."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"This book is brilliant and so, of course, is the author. The story is interesting, the characters brilliant, and the writing has a clarity beyond the telling. It is a privilege to read a book that is so outstanding in so many ways. The reader learns so much about the inner life of the characters and about the law and how it is practiced; and in such a lucid and entertaining way. I greatly envy this author's ability to write this well. I have seen many a prize given to books that I did not think warranted an award, but this particular book deserves a Pulitzer if a book ever did."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Well written and a lot of fun.

The big corporations are not always the bad guys in real life but that's alright, it's just a story.Senator Mike FairOklahoma State Senate, retired"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"An unusual first novel in the depth and dimension of the book. The basic plot is fairly simple, take a bunch of recent law school grads and put them in a how powered big time law firm and watch what happens. The real story is the break between the ideals of law school where everything is black and white while in the real practice of law the problems are much more mundane, like billing enough hours, putting up with the managing partner.The legal cases that come in, kind of on the side when compared to the rest of the story. To be sure they are interesting cases: trying to save a death row inmate, a class action suit against a Texas chemical company after an explosion killed dozens of workers.This is not a legal thriller where the answers are clear. A lot of time is spent on the philosophy of the law itself. I came away with the feeling that this is the way it is, and tat while this is the best system created so far, it's still pretty poor.It made it clear that I don't want to be involved with the law."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"First time author Kermit Roosevelt has at least two things going for him. First, he writes very well, which isn't necessarily the same as telling an interesting story, and second, he's got an unforgettable name that's a real attention-getter.I gave this book 4 stars primarily on the strength of Roosevelt's writing and elegant prose. He obviously knows a lot about the law and there are several times in this book where he's able to build a little tension and some excitement, but for the most part this book is a look into the physiological make-up of a dozen or so lawyers in a single Washington D.C. law firm. The use of introspection or reflection is overdone, at least to my way of thinking. I bought this book looking for something along the lines of Grisham or Turow, and was a little disappointed that this was not a story similar to what they write. While the book is interesting, if you are looking for a legal thriller or courtroom drama, you need to look elsewhere. This is clearly a coming-of-age novel for the main characters, who (male and female first year law firm associates) are filled with self doubt and second thoughts about their career choice. After reading this book, it makes me think that lawyers consider everything they do--even outside the office--in terms of lost billable hours.Probably enjoyed most by someone in the legal profession."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE SHADOW OF THE LAW as a first class debut novel & a powerfully elegant read, offering a deep look into the workings of top American law firms. The two lives of a lawyer -- the personal & the professional are also craftily highlighted. However, because of the legalese, this book will probably be better enjoyed by readers well-versed in law, or have a passion for legal-fiction. Not your usual travel or vacation read -- THE SHADOW OF THE LAW is meant to be savored, relished & enjoyed."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I read the book in little less than a day and I felt a great deal of impatience while so engaged. It is not a book that takes hold or allows the reader to luxuriantly sink into its depths. If you are interested in law, as I am, it might be worth borrowing. I bought it for a fraction and consider myself satisfied that it cost scarcely more than a good cup of coffee.No one is happy to be in the law and those that are, those that allow it to consume, are pitiful: Peter Morgan and his obsession with hours not billed and thus lost, Harold who can only view passionate engagement with another through the lens of efficacy as an advocate, and Ryan whose office games and frat-house view of women lead him at last to embrace the law as identity. It is a study in unhappiness and, while the structure of law firms does not seem conducive to human flourishing, the book on the whole seems slanted against the commercial, as opposed to academic/government, enterprise of law.Perhaps this the reason for my impatience is this: the characters are not particularly interesting nor are they drawn with a fine eye for detail. A two-word summation is sufficient for most--the dependable idealist, the fortunate incompetent, the airy prodigy, the garish litigator... The lawyers of Morgan Siler are faint sketches that are easy to care little about."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I tend to agree with parts of the one and five star reviews. The technical legal jargon can be overwhelming at times but not too much to take away from the intimate character portrayals. The plot lacks a little in the middle then picks up at the end. This novel is a good read but more legal philosophy than story. It's hard to tell if the author is writing for the layman or trying to impress the layman with his legal rhetoric. All in all it was a smart and in depth novel. I liked it."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Heard IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW, a convolutedlegal thriller by Kermit Roosevelt that didn't really hold myinterest . . . it is about the lives of men and women ata prestigious law firm who tackle cases involving the deathpenalty and a class action involving a prominent biochemicalfirm . . . there didn't seem to be anything that I hadn't read before,though Roosevelt's writing did give me a feel that I was learningat least a little something about the legal profession . . .

Again and again I came across scenes that seemed taken from my own experiences as the author so accurately and vividly portrays his characters, be it the associate who bills eight hours by midday while working only a few due to the magic of the \\"minimum\\" time charge, the senior partner on early morning patrol in the hallways ruing the billable hours being forever lost by those not there, or the mid-level partners using artificial deadlines to \\"motivate\\" those unfortunate to be on their team. In particular the discussion on how to get double billable hours while traveling reminded me of my first trip where I was advised I must count my time \\"portal to portal\\" no matter what I was doing.In addition, while the book would have worked wonderfully as simply a satiric skewering of the not-so-wonderful practices in which attorneys engage, it somehow also manages to show the good those caught up in the law firm system can do if given the opportunity. By doing so it creates a uniquely balanced as well as highly readable perspective of the legal system.In short, this book should be a must read for everyone in law school, everyone practicing in a firm, and everyone who remembers what it was like to be driven by the mighty billable hour."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"\\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" is not your typical legal thriller. Most of the story surrounds the day-to-day drudgery of legal practice, which is a welcome change from the 'lawyer as James Bond' formulation used in legal thrillers. This leaves Roosevelt plenty of room to explore the characters he introduces in the novel, and the mental state brought on by interaction with the modern legal system has plenty of space to be explored.The characters that take center stage are the partners and associates at this powerhouse law firm. Each comes with their own baggage and methods for coping with them. The partners have devoted their life to the firm and are struggling to come to grips with the implications of that choice. Are all of the missed dinners, birthdays, and vacations worth the rewards the firm offers? Each partner comes to a different conclusion on that question. The power of the novel comes from Roosevelt's ability to make the reader feel the stress the partners go through as they answer this question and struggle -- or not in one case -- accordingly.The associates are not yet struggling with a life that is passing them by. Instead, they are attempting to determine how they fit into a large, complex law firm and world. The reader comes to understand that each thought they had \\"made it\\" when they landed the big firm job. They have realized over time that the transition from law school to practice was a major change in their life, but it didn't change who they are. I felt as if I had shared the same feelings as these young associates, which led me to empathize and care about them in a way I couldn't with a John Grisham character. Who hasn't felt the next transition in their life would be a pinnacle -- graduation, marriage, children -- only to realize there are still many hills left to climb?The preceding discussion of character development shouldn't give the impression that this novel has not plot. The story and character development are moved along through two cases currently confronting the firm: a pro bono death penalty appeal and a massive, class-action lawsuit against one of the firms clients. For most of the book the two cases do a good job of moving the book along and serving as catalysts for the character development. Unfortunately, the plot takes over from the character development at the end of the book. Roosevelt must have felt he needed a dramatic ending for readers to be satisfied. Instead, it left me unsatisfied and feeling as if the ending was bolted on rather than a natural conclusion to the novel."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Reading Kermit Roosevelt's IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW, one is reminded of the admonition that judges give juries in American courtrooms: \\"Keep an open mind, do not come to any conclusions in the case until you have heard all of the evidence that will be presented.\\" This highly publicized and well-reviewed maiden novel by law school professor Roosevelt drags somewhat in its middle portions, but it makes a sufficiently strong recovery in its concluding pages to warrant a recommendation for those readers who favor the style of legal fiction followed by authors such as Scott Turow.IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW takes the reader behind the scenes of a fictional powerhouse Washington D.C. law firm. Morgan Siler, the firm in question, has all the attributes that one expects of a major K Street law firm in our nation's capital. Patrician partners cultivate corporate clients willing to pay enormous fees. Young associates are ground into hourly billing robots whose sole mission as lawyers is to find a way to bill 25 hours in a 24-hour day. Along the way the associates worry about whether they will become partners in order to do to the next wave of associates what has been done to them. The work is difficult, the days are long and the only thing missing from the equation is an important word: justice.Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, writes on a subject in which he is well-versed. He served as a law clerk to a Supreme Court Justice, as does one of his major characters, and later worked at major law firms in Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. One envisions the author gleefully sitting at his word processor, thinking of past acquaintances that he portrays in his novel as ruthless, greedy and heartless individuals totally wrapped up in their own selfish endeavors to live a life of wealth and power. Many former acquaintances of Professor Roosevelt undoubtedly will speculate on the real-life identities of his fictional characters.The novel focuses on two important cases handled by Morgan Siler and the partners and associates assigned to that litigation. In addition, readers will meet senior partner Peter Morgan, a legacy of the firm's founding partner. Every negative stereotype that one can conjure up about an attorney has been rolled into Peter Morgan. Not only is he a cold-hearted evil lawyer, in the end he turns out to be a disgusting human being. So many malevolent characters dominate IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW that the reader searches in vain for one attorney to admire. In 368 pages, no such individual can be found.In a class action lawsuit brought against a chemical company for an explosion at one of their plants, the reader learns how scorched earth litigation can be used to bring the wheels of justice to an abrupt halt. The partners and associates from Morgan Siler have several goals in defending this action. They seek to delay or deny the production of crucial evidence and take whatever steps can be taken to fight a war of attrition against the lawyers seeking recovery. Such action of course requires the billing of substantial hours and resulting enormous legal fees, costs that the client pays willingly because they still are far less than the price of a judgment against the company.In the second case, the firm has accepted pro bono representation of a Virginia man on death row. Even this noble task has selfish motives. The firm has accepted this case because young associates often have a noble streak in their make-up. The firm accepts this type of work as a project for summer associates who find this type of work exciting. But the Virginia case has dragged beyond the summer and now associates must be pulled from billable hours to handle this litigation. To their credit they achieve justice for their client, as well as glory that the firm is only too glad to accept.After reading IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW it is hard to predict what future novels by Kermit Roosevelt will yield. His characters are entertaining and his plots maintain the readers' interest. But he needs to write less like a lawyer and more like a novelist to keep readers coming back to his future efforts. After all, most of us who enjoy courtroom novels are not lawyers. We care much less about the intricacies of major law firms than we do about page-turning, exciting plots. Remembering that fact will make Roosevelt's next effort even more readable.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"Alan Dershowitz reviewed the book in the New York Times Book Review. Here are some excerpts:\\"THIS is an impressive first novel -- with equal emphasis on both adjectives. Kermit Roosevelt's legal coming-of-age story is quite commendable in its perceptive and witty insights into the post-law-school life of big-firm associates....I recommend this book with real enthusiasm. Why? Precisely because it doesn't glamorize its subject....The redeeming quality of Roosevelt's utterly realistic characters is that they know exactly what they are doing. Unlike Faust, they are not tricked or even seduced by the princes of darkness in their gentlemanly garb and corner offices. They step onto the treadmill with their eyes wide open and their antennae firmly in place. They, like the author who created them, understand the world of backstabbing and sucking up they are entering. I recognize these characters. They are my students, just a few years after graduation....I can't wait for his next novel....\\""},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I am not a big fan of novels (in spite of having a degree in English) but I gave this book a shot and was hardly able to put it down. It's beautifully written with characters so vivid, you can practically picture a movie version of the book. The only caveat I'd issue is that you probably need to be quite interested in the legal field to enjoy the book. I used to work in a K Street law firm, knew a lot of lawyers, and often wished I'd become one, so I was familiar with the world Roosevelt was talking about and also understood quite a bit of the legal theorizing involved. The only part that bogged me down was the discussion of \\"securitization\\" and other aspects of corporate law, but I don't think understanding all that is integral to enjoying the novel."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"This is an interesting novel, set in a (hopefully) mythical Washington, D.C., law firm focusing principally upon a small group of associates and partners and several dynamic cases (one death penalty appeal and a gruesome class action). The Washington Post review of this book emphasized the usual things one finds in such novels, principally associate hour-building strategies, overbearing partners, the toll endless hours of labor exact upon bright young minds (aka \\"is making partner really worth it?\\"), and how litigation is really a cooperative venture between adverse law firms with the purpose and intent of extracting huge amounts of money from their respective clents. Fortunately, I found there to be much more substance to the novel than I had anticipated. For one thing, the author clerked on the Supreme Court and (apparently) draws upon his own experiences in detailing the role of clerks in dealing with last-minute death penalty petitions, as well as demonstrating how death penalty litigation is conducted. He also makes good use of the recently-published memoir of John Knox, who clerked for the infamous Justice McReynolds in the late 1930's, as the basis for recounting the clerking experience of a lead character during the same period. I think he well captures the frustrations and satisfactions of being an associate in a major law firm, as well as demonstrating that not all partners are identical in their personalities or the way they practice law. But, alas, there are problems with the novel as well. After a while it is hard to remember who is who, since there are many characters introduced into the narrative. The novel eventually focuses upon a pro bono effort to save a death row inmate via a habeas corpus proceeding--which is depicted in a completely unrealistic fashion since the U.S. District Judge falls all over himself to grant the petition after an innocuous argument by a novice associate--my experience is that such victories are few and far between. However the most surprising plot twist is at the end of the novel where several associates decide to, in effect, sabotage their own client by producing damaging documents in discovery because the client deserves to lose. Needless to say, the manifod ethical ramifications of such conduct are not discussed. Nonetheless, Alan Dershowitz likes the book and so do I--a good summer read."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"I am a lawyer. This is the best book about lawyers I have ever read. Amazing."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"This is a very well-written, entertaining look at law firm life. You can tell the author has been in private practice. Forget about Turow and Grisham, read this book. It is much better."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"This is not your typical Grisham novel. Author Kermit Roosevelt, who shares the same name as a former CIA operative, busts open the myths surrounding the practice of law. Most media view the law as a battle between light and evil, with truth being the end goal. The reality, which this book reveals, is that civil law is mainly procedure: discovery (figuring out what documents to turn over); protection of property (creating special paper vehicles that protect or hide corporate assets); and the non-violent transfer of money to those who have been harmed. Criminal law is more trial-based, and the genius of this novel is that it juxtaposes a civil case with a criminal case, allowing the reader to see the major differences. However, the criminal case does not redeem the legal profession either, and the reader will be left with the sobering realization that the lawyers are the ones who determine whether justice will occur, and unethical lawyers can easily prevent justice from occurring. One major subtlety--without spoiling the ending--is that the unethical lawyers are actually the ones who save the day, which is made more interesting by the fact that the book's characters are primarily unethical from the beginning. It's a very subtle indictment of the entire legal system, and only one character--a federal judge--ends up looking good.If anyone is considering applying to law school or has recently started practicing law and is wondering what s/he's gotten himself into, this is a must-read. It seems to be one of the few legal fiction books that lawyers will respect."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Law","review":"While Scott Turow and George V.

Not only are the characters thouroughly complex and engaging, their depictions are refreshingly honest and human. The reader will find that no masks are worn in this story. The good and the bad of each are shown, and their internal struggles with this are expressed so well that readers themselves are allowed to determine at most what is just from what isnt and if not, at least why the characters are who they are.I will not describe the story in detail because I believe that it should unfold as a person reads. I will however say that the story itself is about relationships; familial, love, personal, communal, and societal; as well as struggle. However, what this story spends a great deal of time capturing and developing is what it means emotionally and psychologically, to be a poor black sharecropper and a man, living a dehumanizing and de-&quot;man&quot;izing existence in the South, during the beginning - mid part of the past hundred years. If you read this book and are not moved and educated by its story, stop what you're doing and read the book again, you have missed something big.This book makes my personal top 10 list and has opened me up to the world of Alice Walker. I will recommend this book to EVERYONE I know who is interested a well written, informative, and inspiring, quick, great read!

Obviously I have no way of knowing what it was like for a black man during the years of this book but every time Brownfield blamed someone else for his pitiful life I wanted to scream, grow up!! Brownfield blames everything wrong in his life on the white people, especially the men. Jealousy is really behind his rantings. He sees what they have and he doesn't. Could he have done better for himself and his family? I would hope so. Drinking and beating your wife until she hates you are not living. Then he starts beating his daughters. Only after he kills Mem and Ruth goes to live with her changed grandfather, Grange, do we see what black men can do to change their lives. Grange changed his. He puts his entire life into Ruth. He learns and he passes it on to her. He adores her and she him. Grange is exactly what a child like Ruth needed after living through hell with Brownfield. I do not want to give the ending away so I am not going to comment except that perhaps a circle was broken.I liked the book, but got very sick and tired of Brownfield's whining and whining. Get up and do something with your life then."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I have heard that Alice Walker is an incredible writer, which may be true (it is forgivable, since this was her first novel), but I found The Third Life of Grange Copeland to be extremely disappointing. First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over. I still plan on reading other books by Alice Walker, but I would not recommend this one to anyone demanding a good plot."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I know people think that Alice Walker is a great author and I can say that The Color Purple has had a very strong influence over the world, especially the African american community; but this book isn't nearly as impacting as The Color Purple. The characters are flat as paper, and don't have a voice. The only character I could really say that does have a voice is Ruth, but she is the only sane character in the whole book, and everybody else is just tangled in bad writing and horrible plot structure. Now, don't get me wrong, I can see where The Third Life and The Color Purple are similar, but NO one should read this book. It is horribly written, and it is weak. I was expecting better out of her since she wrote such a good and influencing book, but this books sucks. Don't even buy it, save your money and don't get it. Buy another book, like Private by Kate Brian. It is TEN times better and has more juicer drama. Better yet, buy the Color Purple and step away from any other book by this author. Just step away."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Walker sets the tone in this first novel for what has become a career of writing that liberates and educates. In \\"The Third Life of Grange Copeland\\", the author details an American tragedy, perhaps the great American tragedy, of a family destroyed by the effects of racial oppression in rural 1920's Georgia. We are introduced to father and son (Grange and Brownfield respectively) who collapse emotionally, mentally, and spiritually under the weight of what it is to be a Black man in this country. Although the majority of the story takes place pre Civil Rights Era, the effects of racial oppression portrayed in the novel are visible to the alert reader today.We are first introduced to Grange who has worked on a plantation enduring the hatred and cruelty from his white boss for so long he does not know what it is to be a man. Dismissed, disrespected and dejected, Grange's disdain for the oppressor implodes creating a hollow, spiritless shell of a man. In an effort to exert a misdirected sense of manhood, or perhaps feel what it's like to have the upper hand in something, Grange attempts to liberate himself by drinking, gambling and womanizing, further separating himself from a wife and son he feels unable to love, honor or protect. Grange endures the final insult at the hands of his tormentor when the plantation owner impregnates his wife. He heads North with hopes of finding something better, something new. It is up North that his metamorphosis begins allowing him to return to the South with a newfound sense of self and responsibility.Brownfield, Grange's son, is orphaned when his father leaves and his mother kills herself and her mulatto infant. Father and son meet again when Grange returns home and Brownfield has married. The dynamics of their relationship during this time is the true jewel of this novel. Brownfield finds himself in the same situation as his father - working a plantation, barley able to provide for his family, and eventually stripped of all self-respect. Having married an educated woman, he felt further minimized by his lack of schooling. Repeating the pattern of his father, Brownfield turns to a life of free spirits, using whatever force he can muster within him to reduce his wife (\\"knock her down a notch\\") to his standard of existence.Walker is relentless in her assertion that resistance, at any cost, is the secret of joy, the road to liberation. She is steadfast in her rejection of the subjugation of women by the patriarchy; unwavering in her denunciation of racial oppression. \\"The Third Life of Grange Copeland\\" is a very well done first novel. Definitely representative of the acclaim Walker's later work has achieved. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Often, if an author writes a book that becomes immensely popular and a mainstay in modern literature, their career is then divided up between before and after. For the majority, I'd say their entry point to an author's canon usually is the well-received work, so it's fun to browse an author's &quot;backlog&quot; and experience their earliest achievements. Having been a fan of Alice Walker for many years but only having read two novels (plus a great deal of short stories and non-fiction), I figured it was time to give her first published novel, &quot;The Third Life of Grange Copeland,&quot; a try.Had this been written by anybody but Alice Walker, I'd say this was one of the most impressive debut novels I've read. Since it *is* written by Walker, I should have known to not be surprised by the eloquence, the poetry and the grittiness of this book. Alice Walker is a storyteller with gifts bordering on the supernatural; if the Southern U.S. landscape could talk, it would sound a lot like Alice Walker. This is the story, told in razor sharp prose, of a man and the effect his actions have on his family over a period of many years. It's not an easy novel to read as there are hard truths in the story of Grange and Brownfield but there are lessons that will stay with the reader. This is also an interesting study on the actions of an individual, and who is to blame; society or the man/woman? There are no such easy answers in this book and I found myself wavering between sympathy and outright hatred for some of the characters, but it's the mark of a great read when I can feel so much for a story."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I enjoyed reading The Third Life of Grange Copeland because it left me, at the end of each chapter, wanting to know what would happen next. This novel was easy to read and understand. I recommend it to any age group from middle school or higher."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Is the perpetual question that comes up through successive parts of the novel.Is it the younger Grange Copeland when you see his behavior toward his wife and child?Is it his son Brownfield, the eventual killer of his wife?Is it the Jim Crow South that created the poisoned conditions under which such destrction could be wrought on a family?Is it the Northerners who brought deluded dreams that the black Southerners had of a free and better life in the North?As expected, this is one of Walker's novels that was written when she was &quot;young and hungry,&quot; and the care that she takes to lead the reader in sundry directions is painstaking and evident.A must read or anyone who is sufficiently cerebral to look for latent meanings."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"This is a beautifully written, eye-opening tale of life for poor blacks in the mid-twentieth-century South. I highly recommend it for lending perspective to the lives of oppressed people. However, it is an EXTREMELY DEPRESSING book, particularly for a white person who wishes her own race to be less horrible to others."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Exceptional writer! Vivid easy flowing language. Not only adresses pregidous, but addresses how humans of any color can sometimes be their own worst enemy."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I have only read one other of Alice Walker's books (the impressive, involving, passionate ''Meridian''). But I can tell from her works, she is both a good, and consistant writer. I found this book less involving than ''Meridian'', because it tells of the life of a black family, not a black woman. Alice Walker writes of the lives of a once-handsome, happy black man, named Brownfield Copeland, who grew up the son of a sharecropper named Grange Copeland, living in despair. When his father abandons them he runs from the sharecropper's home and builds a family with a beautiful woman Mem. Soon enough the reality of his trapped despair hits him, and he takes out his anger, and frustration at being a black man in a country where blacks (and other minorities), are treated as less than human. He beats and abuses his wife, and children. After a dramatic, life-changing event, one of his daughter's ,Ruth , goes to live with her grandfather, and Brownfield's father Grange. Being raised with Grange, Ruth lives in a happy and protected world, but is not without her share of pain. She reaches sixteen with her grandfather, but then Brownfield comes back to claim his child. Can Grange protect his beloved granddaughter, from having to live with her father, the monster?I suggest that before reading this book, you read '' Black Like Me'', by John Howard Griffin. This book helps to paint a better picture of the despair of African-Americans and the system of white injustice, which this book, despite all its strengths, does not do vividly.One thing I am exceedingly impressed with in this book, is that, although it is clearly shown that Brownfield's abusive behavior was caused by the trapped reality of his exsistence as a black man, Alice Walker refuses to excuse Brownfield's behavior with the injustices imposed by whites. She points out that there is a solace inside of all human beings, which can resist domination- an inner strength that refuses to allow the opresser to turn him to hatred. Not being a black person, but being a member of a minority group, I highly empathize with Brownfield- who for all his viciousness is still shown to have a side of humanity. But it's Grange who is the true main character in this book- and he is brought to life with honesty, clarity, and a goodness, although he is by no means a saint, or even meant as an example. I would highly recommend this poignant, and sensitive book."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"This is a great read. I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys reading about racial challenges, suspense, romance, scandal, etc...

I continue reading because it is such an interesting study of a Black man's life in the South. In my opinion, even though I doubt most people would agree with me, it is the best of Alice Walker's books, including &#34;The Color Purple&#34;/"},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Although I read it once in 1988 and now again in 2012, I can understand the way the main two characters related to the world and how the way the world treated them shaped they way they treated most people. It was a hard-hitting story that spoke of the very real notion of Blacks being in their place as it related to their interactions with whites especially back in the 1940-1960s in the US. A must read."},{"Title":"Young and Debt Free: Practical Advice for the Financially Challenged","review":"This book gives full of practical advice that I was not taught in my college classes.

The vignettes throughout the book helped me realize that I am not alone and am facing similar problems that plague other young adults. I have considered buying other self-help, debt management books but this is the best one I have found. This book was money well spent to putting me on the path to being financially savvy!"},{"Title":"Medicine in the Crusades: Warfare, Wounds and the Medieval Surgeon","review":"This book isn't very large, but it's to the point, it's unbiased, and it's packed full of information. The price tag is steep, but it's a good book that you will have trouble finding the likes of anywhere else.The information on the subject it gives is directly from medieval sources and compiled and studied by a knowledgeable author. This gives the usual exquisite effect of contradicting modern ideas on the subject (where most people believe what uneducated cliche is written now, not having read what was really done then).It gives excellent accounts and information on hospitals, wounds, treatments, and techniques, among other things, in good, though not thorough, detail. It is a great resource, and has an excellent bibliography and references.This book is even quite worthwhile to those who study martial history, as most of the subject is due to the effects of contemporary martial arts, and includes information on remains of such victims that can be found no where else.I hold back the 5th star due to the price tag, and due to the short, yet conversely uneducated/outdated theories on some weaponry, thier effects, armours and tactics. The price tag is only justifiable by lack of anything else like this on the market, not by volume or quantity of content or binding, though it is of quality."},{"Title":"Medicine in the Crusades: Warfare, Wounds and the Medieval Surgeon","review":"Very accurate textbook for historic reviewers and surgeons and people whom are looking for good litterature in medieval accurate data.It is a book that you can read like a roman and and essay at the same time.Not too short and not too long.

Maybe I shouldn't gripe about physics in a book involving FTL space flight, but when a ship accellerates at 3 gees for several days, it should have to decellerate at the same rate for the same time as well. Too often the ships just seem to come to a stop, or at least the author doesn't describe that several days of braking were involved. Minor gripe? Possibly, and I for one could have done without the sappy and cliche drama of Major Longknife and his wife as well. It's an okay book if you're just looking for some mindless entertainment, but thought-provoking, it is not."},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","review":"I have been signing since the age of 6, studied Deaf Education in College and was an interpreter for 3 years (until I became a Mom!).

This is a definate must have book for any parent that is wanting to learn American Sign Language, or just to brush up on skills.Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous book!!!"},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","review":"Strengths of the book:1. The signs are listed in alphabetical order;2. Many vocabulary for toddlers (e.g., diaper, all gone, blanket, cereal);3. provides concise information of American Sign Language (ASL), rationale for using sign language, FAQ, disphering the signs, and learning to sign;4. Each sign is accompanied with an illustration;5. This book could be used for babies as well, and probably could be used beyond toddler years (i.e., preschool and kindergarten).Needs for improvements:A. Illustrations:All llustrations are done with fine lines. Each shows a woman with a pony tail with a big bow signing the word or phrase, with arrows representing hand(s)/finger(s) movements. The illustrations looks great if they are artwork, but for illustration for sign language, I would recommend changes as follows:1. Get rid of the big bow of the woman because the fine lines of the bow sometimes make readers miss the movement arrows of the signs;2. Use thicker and darker lines for the arrows that make the movements clear;B. The organization of the book:It's great that the signs are in alphabetical order and has an index. However, since the signs are already in alphabetical order, the index is redundant -- It is as if a dictionary with an index. It would be better if the index is organized by topics, e.g., actions, animals, body, clothings, colors, food, people and pronouns, time, transportation,..."},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","review":"I think this little book is great for parents to use with their pre-verbal infant/toddler.

It has every word that I have wanted to look up for my signing baby boy. I bought the Sign With Your Baby book first and I needed more signs for my son. I found this book on Amazon.com and I love it. It has 500 signs(American Sign Language) in it just for babies and little kids. It has Mc Donalds, dinosaur, wagon and so many more signs. I can't say enough about this little book. I carry it around with me so when my son needs to know a sign like when he pointed to a bird in the Target parking lot, I pulled out the book and found the sign for bird. I was able to show him the sign right there when he needed it. I recommend this book to anyone that is signing with their child. It has reminders on almost every sign to help me remember how to sign the word. It is a great book to keep around even after the baby gets older and wants to learn sign language on their own. Elementary kids would love to have this book as a resource."},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","review":"This book is so helpful I carry it in our \\"Diaper\\" bag. (We actually use elimination communication so our baby hasn't used diapers since 11 weeks, but we still call it our diaper bag. SeePotty Whispering: The Gentle Art of Infant Potty Training) I frequently pull this book out when my son needs a word. He is 19 months and knows about 70 signs. He even signs in his sleep (I wonder what he was dreaming the night he was signing \\"paper.\\") This is the most comprehensive signing book I have found. Lots of good kid words--like yogurt and cracker--that I couldn't find anywhere else. My biggest complaint about this book (and why only 4 stars) is the food words. It mainly has sweet based foods (and even signs for McDonald's.) There are limited fruits, veggies, and other healthy foods. So I also carryFruits & Vegetables (Beginning Sign Language Series)Also, despite the great number of words in here, it is not totally comprehensive. It doesn't have the word \\"key.\\" Every toddler loves keys so I'm not sure why that's missing. I'd love it if there was a website where I could recommend words for future editions.For those of you uncertain about using sign as much as we do, it has really made having a toddler much simpler. He can tell stories about the time the dog had the bird in its mouth and we got the bird from the dog and took the bird outside. When he dropped his toy into a hole in the floorboards, his signing conveyed to me what had happened (since I didn't witness it.) When he got cactus thorns in his hands and was, naturally, screaming as I took them out, he signed \\"water.\\" I got him a drink of water and he calmed down. Without the ability to make that request, he would have kept screaming (I never would have thought to give him water.) Some people have questioned if sign language at our level will delay speech. I asked a developmental pediatrician about that. She considers children who sign bi-lingual. Bi-lingual children often do have slight delays in their speech. However, the brain development that occurs is so beneficial that it is better for the children. At 19 months our son has his 70 signed words and about 20 spoken words. He spends much of each day repeating a verbal word he is just now learning (dishes is one of his favorites.)"},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","review":"I've had this book for a little over a month. It's perfect for providing what you need to sign with your baby or toddler. The book shows you the ASL hand signs for the alphabet and numbers 1 - 10, then references these to use when making the signs. The signs are listed in alphabetical order and the diagrams are easy to understand. Just a great book if you want to learn signing quickly.I also purchased the \\"Signing Smart with Babies and Toddlers: A Parents Strategy and Activity Guide\\" at the same time.

The book isn't written for a college classroom so you don't have to for hunt for lemon in the middle of words like lesbian and Lenin. The pictures are simple and clearly illustrate the signs. The memory aids for the signs are extremely helpful. The book shows where differentation is needed (ie the homophone right) to ensure you are using the correct sign.It does not cover how or when or even why to sign with your baby/toddler. There are only 7 pages covering suggested usage; most of that is a FAQ about ASL. The book has all the beginning signs (milk, more and food), just not how to introduce them. An established method for teaching your child to sign is needed before this book can become truly useful.It isn't good first book, but is a great second book after Sign With Your Baby isn't sufficient for your child's curiosity."},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","review":"This book is wonderful!!!

I can't begin to list the ASL dictionaries that I have consulted over our 6 years of signing - most of which were directed towards adults and their wants and needs as opposed to a baby or child's needs which are quite different.Of course, this book doesn't contain all of the signs you may need, but it's an excellent resource for those who have outgrown their beginner sign language books and small enough to take with you on your outings.

At first thought, the book appears as a child's paradise, a sort of novel well suited to young boys who want to play &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; or &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;. However, these games, though included in the book, deal more with real life than at first thought. Seeming trivial pursuits in the novel possess a greater meaning and symbolism in association with the culture of America. A tale of rafts, rivers, and nature can be appreciated both for its literal sense and its deep underlying political and cultural commentary. Chronicling the life of a boy, Mark Twain masterfully utilizes literary elements such as dialect and satire along with his infamous and brilliant wit. Huckleberry is an incorrigible boy who longs to escape the strict restrictions of society and pursue a life free of woe, living off the land in expansive forests and forever gliding down the Mississippi River. Huck's adventures include interactions with a runaway slave, robbers, feuding families, and two scheming &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. The reader is transported into the world of the 1840's where one encounters the economical and cultural conflicts of the day. It seems that as the more Huck attempts to escape the society that ties him down, the more he encounters it and the more it attains a hold upon him. Twain expresses his views on such cultural issues as the elitist yet scheming upper class through the characters aptly named the &quot;king&quot; and the &quot;duke&quot;. These characters expose the gullibility of the American public as they scam and deceive their way to economic prosperity. Twain also utilizes literary motifs as a way of revealing common facets of American culture and goals of citizens. One such motif, money, shows how some characters (for instance the king and duke) view money and material possessions as a necessity for self-fulfillment. While on the other hand, different characters (Huck and Jim) are happy to enjoy the luxury of money but are more than able to do without it and fend for themselves. These evident yet subtle touches are what make the novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn enjoyable not only for its excitement and story line but for what can be learned from these instances. Overall, I found the novel Huck Finn an exciting and engaging experience. It allowed me to kick back and relax with my body as my mind floated on a river of ideas and symbols hidden in the novel. I liked the body of the tale and the in-depth relationship the reader develops with the character Huck. It would not be surprising to find yourself speaking with a southern drawl after an hour or two of reading. I did however find some fault in the way the book was completed. I found the ending section's plot a bit too excessive and overall unnecessary. It did not, however, detract to any extent from my opinion on the book. I would give the book a three point five or four out of a five-point scale. I recommend the book to just about anyone, especially to those with an active imagination and an ability to look past the words of novels into the extensive world they are capable of revealing."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huck Finn by Mark Twain is a great American novel because it touches on all the points of our nations history. Although this book has many racial slurs it should not be under contriversy because of its use of the &quot;N&quot; word. The story takes place when the &quot;N&quot; word was used frequently. In a way it shows the positive relations between two people of different races. Huck Finn the main character of the novel uses this ofensive slur just because he was brought up that way, he doesn't know any better. Within the novel this teenage misfit gets himself in tons of trouble. This is where the comedy comes into play. Every time Huck ends up in trouble he manages to think of some clever excuse. Like when the two slave hunters ran into Huck and Jim(the runaway slave)on the river. Huck said &quot;Oh ya my father has small pocks, you can see him if you realy want to.&quot; Of course the slave hunters wanted to stay as far away from the two because the don't want to get small pocks. Mark Twain not only writes truthfully about this time period but he also critizes the human race for being ignerent and stupid. Throughout this incredible book Twain makes suddle comments about the human race just to poke fun at us. There was a two year break while he was writing this book because he was unsure of what he was doing. This was written in a time period when blacks were looked down upon as if the were not as inteligent as the whites were and Twain is having a black man and white boy out smart several white men. Twain thought that his novel would be laughed at if he continued this unheard of stoiy line. He was in such a twisted mental state he took off thoes two years to think about what he was even writing about, then continued Huck on his journy. This awesome book deserves 5 stars"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I first read Huck Finn in Junior High school, and remembering how I'd liked it so much from the first reading, decided to go over it again. And, I liked it just as much. Huck &amp; Jim stealthly ride down the Mississippi, discovering and creating their own adventures from the places and people they come across. Lot of points were noted in this book, and I liked the way it was written. Although this story and it's characters are genuinely different, At times, Huck, Jim and the others, reminded me of Moriarty and Kerouac. They went on a journey &quot;On the River&quot; before their was a road."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It really upsets me to see some of the reviews about this wonderfull story.Some people say that the reason why they don't like the story is because they didn't understand it. But they probably didn't even try. Willing is all it takes to understand and fall in love with this incredible message of love and friendship that Twain shares with us through an orphan boy, to whom freedom is much more important than being rich and well educated. I feel the same way too, and if you do you really should read the book, and if you already have, recommened this book to your friends."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Twain's accidental masterpiece was meant to be merely a boy's adventure, a sequel to the engrossing &quot;Tom Sawyer.&quot; But lo and behold, it became an important comment on race and character. It also commanded the colossal metaphor of the Mississippi river journey, which haunts American literature as does Melville's white whale. Toward the end, unfortunately, Twain suddenly remembered he was supposed to be writing a comic adventure for boys, and it kind of peters out. But not before it has made itself an important milestone, deft in its use of point of view and wit to handle difficult issues."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"There is a deeper genius in the adventures of Huckleberry Finn in that the book is written from the perspective of 14 year old boy who is stuggling with what he has been taught and what he learns in this adventure. Huck is fleeing his troubled family life when he comes across, widow Watson's slave, Jim. He decides that he will help him find freedom in Ciaro, Illinois. He and Jim have exciting and at times very chilling adventures. In one great irony of the book, Huck and Jim are swept past the meeting of the two rivers and carried further and further into the slave south. Huck captures the spirit of a nation struggling with his/its conscience concerning slavery. In this book, Huck considers Jim an adventure but comes to respect him as a man who he cares about and a man who cares about him. Huck learns the value of friendship and the value of mutual respect along the way. I would say that the ending disappointed me in that I felt that the reappearence of Tom Sawyer played to the lessening of the lessons that Huck learns along the way. The trick he plays on Jim and Huck for that matter softens the blow that this book should level. My review as with others I have read cannot do this book justice for the very human experience it provides. One must come to grips with an era of American thought which is hard to stomach and not nearly reflected on enough."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"&quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; by Mark TwainThis book is intriguing in the fact that I, a country boy, read and understood it. This book is basically about a boy who inherits a lot of money, and he is tired of being cooped up and living rich, so he decides to go on an adventure. He eventually meets up with one of his Negro friends. They go on adventures while trying to not get caught. They meet many good and bad people. If you liked the book &quot;The Hatchet&quot; you'll love this book. I would probably give this book 5 stars and definitely 2 thumbs and 8 fingers-way, way up. So I encourage you to read this book if you like the old kind of stories."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read this, since it was my school's outside reading assignment. The printing was so small, that I first thought it would be a boring read. But I soon figured that I was wrong. I found myself slowly slipping into the story as if it was all happening before my own eyes. The characters were very interesting. Especially Huck Finn seemed like a very likable person with a strong identity, wit, and a soft heart. He does not want to sit and let the world rule over him, but instead test his own ideas and proves to the world that he can be better than what the society expacts him to be. And although many say it is a racially biased book because of its frequent use of N word, nobody can deny that it was a commonly used word in the 1800 where the rogue institution called 'slavery' was considered healthy and inevitable. As a matter of fact, this is a book that actually tries to tell the world about the evilness of racial prejudice not promote it. One should read between the lines, in order to acknowledge Twain's subtle attempts. It was a thrilling experience and I recommend people to have for their own!!!!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Highly, highly, highly politically incorrect and if you look at it on the surface alone you are likely to be offended. That is until you read into what Twain is really saying then you can see the absurdity of it all. Huck Finn lives in a time when an African-American is considered a property and not a person. The interaction between Finn and Jim is fantastic. This book is a classic because of how you'll find yourself uncomfortable reading how everyone looks at Jim. If your uncomfortable reading it then ask yourself why and maybe you'll learn something about yourself, society, and what strong a writer Mark Twain really was."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Twain's Huckleberry Finn has derived much controversy from its use of the \\"n\\" word in the dialogue as well as what some believe are stereotyped characters within the novel. As some have noted in defense of Twain, Twain's main object was to portray and depict the typical Southern dialect of this time period, and so his use of the word was to mainly show that this was a common expression used. This \\"overuse\\" of the word is most obviously an attempt at debunking the idea that people should speak this way. What some forget while reading Huckleberry Finn is that it is a satire aimed at breaking down and making fun of many of the conventions of not only the South, but other aspects of social life. Perhaps the biggest indicator of Twain's intent of facetiousness is in his \\"Explanatory\\" and \\"Notice\\" in the book's preface, where it is inferred that we are not to take everything so seriously in the book. There are many other things going on in the novel, and it is a shame that often we overlook that a classic like this has so much more going for it.For one thing, the novel is as much about growing up and striving to do good as anything else. Huckleberry Finn has this battle throughout the book, and mostly after he meets up with Jim on Jackson's Island and must do some serious soul searching to figure out what is right and what is wrong. An abolitionist wasn't thought of lightly in this setting, and so Huck is not easy to let go of society's laws. However, through much of Jim's guidance, Huck does learn morals and principles of life. Jim represents the father-figure in Huck's life, mainly because Huck's \\"real\\" Pap is an alcoholic, abusive, neglectful and mean-spirited to his son. If there ever were a case for a character breaking the stereotype idea, it would be Jim. After all, isn't it Jim who questions what Huck believes about him running away from slavery? When Huck examines ironically to himself is, and will always be, a \\"no good abolitionist\\", this admission and growth of character can be chalked up to Jim, who has already influenced Huck by then. Jim helps Huck grow up and be a more thought-provoking character. Huck gains a better picture as the novel progresses; for instance, he comes to understand that the duke and the king are not only frauds, but that they are lower than low because of their greed and callousness to the Wilks family.On another level, the novel is a lot about light-hearted fun, satire, poking fun of society and just Huck's imagination. Huck is a child who is not easy to civilize; he wants to be out in the world and living an adventure, being in a band of robbers with Tom Sawyer or adding \\"style\\" to a given situation. Huck often lives life by the moment, and has to use his \\"street smarts\\" to get out of predicaments, which might mean making up a story, faking his own death, dressing up like a girl to get information or using quick wit to escape a sticky situation. He seeks freedom and adventure, and the Mississippi River, where Jim and he spend much of their time on the raft, is a symbol for this escape.Over all, I found this to be a difficult review because Huckleberry Finn is probably one of my favorite books and Twain is one of my favorite authors. But, I think if you read Huckleberry Finn in the right light, it is an amazing read about adventure and growing up. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I have read and enjoyed \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" many times; but this recording enhances the text and makes it that much more enjoyable. The narrator, Tom Parker, does a superb job of bringing this odd assortment of strange and humorous characters to life. He does an especially fine job of pronouncing the numerous dialects that Twain put down for posterity. Hearing Mr. Parker's pronunciations and articulations brings these characters to life in all of their mid-nineteenth century motley. If you close your eyes you can picture Huck and Jim conversing as they travel on the Mississippi, lazily wasting their days and outwitting the numbskulls they encounter along the way. Parker does an especially fine portrayal of Pap Finn when he rants about the Guv'ment in a drunken stupor. His Duke and King are also delightfully portrayed in all their vainglorious pomposity.I was really impressed by how much value I received for so little cost. I laughed many times while following along with my text of the story. After all, Twain was primarily a humorist, and what's the point of reading a story like \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" if you refuse to see the humor in it? And Tom Parker's dramatic skills embellish this humor by bringing the text to life. Aside from the humor, Mr. Parker elicits the heart and soul of both Huck and Jim and shows how their views of each change as they both realize just how human and decent the other is. This is a story of some very human people from a time and a world that no longer exist. It's like reading a dream of a foreign world.This CD set is worth the money. It's a delightful and heartfelt reading of a most wonderfully compassionate and funny story about the common sense and innate humanity of an \\"uneducated\\" boy from the back woods of Missouri who discovers his own sense of morality and humanity while living by his wits and travelling up and down the Mississippi while meeting an assortment of colorful characters along the way. And, yes, it is unabridged."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Adventure of Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful book that blends entertainment and philosophy in an easy to read package. While this book can be fully enjoyed for its plot and story, the book shines for its ideas on morality as it is seen through the eyes of a teenage boy.Twain is an abolitionist, a proponent of anti- slavery and equality. Creating the character of Huck, Twain has injected his own ideas about slavery in the south into this novel. He presents his own ideas about morality though this young, and rather nave, teenage boy and his travels throughout a corrupt world. Everywhere he turns, he is greeted by an act of indecency. By leaving his home and traveling aboard, Huck matures every time he experiences an act of human kindness or malevolence. Huck struggles to understand what is right or wrong when his southern upbringing contradicts his own personal morals. At the end, Huck has learned and experienced enough to develop his own set of morals and help a fugitive slave escape, even though his action is an outcry towards southern values. Twain's novel is more than a story about a young boy on his wild adventures; instead it is a story of his growth.As irrelevant as it is to make comparisons, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a much darker book in comparison to Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry Finn contains countless lines of humor and satire but its overall ideas are deeper and gloomier as they concern human morality, especially in the context of slavery. While both are extremely enjoyable reads, Huckleberry Finn contains theological elements that make it a more serious book. Nevertheless, Twain's trademark humor and style are easily identified as he flawless weaves them together with the deeper elements within the book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Preceding The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which ends after both Tom and Huck receive a large sum of money after finding a gold stash hidden by robbers. Both take place in the small town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime before the start of the civil war. This helps to set up one of the main conflicts of the book, the issue of slavery. The story is told in the eyes of Huck Finn, who's skeptical view of the world allows him to think for himself what is right and wrong based on his sense of morals rather than jumping on the band wagon and coming out upright disliking slaves and regarding them as property, as much of what the south did during those times.After being kidnapped by his biological father, he runs away and hides out on Jackson's Island and meets Jim, a run away slave. Although he has initial doubts on helping a runaway slave, he acts on what he believes to be right and team up. Throughout the story, Huck is tempted many times to turn Jim in for reward, and Twain incorporates these ideas through the characters surrounding Huck, like the con artists he is forced to join together with one time. They eventually sell Jim to Tom's aunt and uncle, and through a misunderstanding they think Huck is Tom and Tom is Sid, Tom's younger brother. Although Huck is initially surprised by the fact that Tom is willing to help Huck rescue Jim, because unlike Huck who was a social misfit, Tom was the product of middle-class society, strictly enforcing to the established rules by society. He acts as the foil for Huck through his strict adherence to rules despite moral issues while Huck acts solely through his own independent way of thinking. When Jim is \\"free\\" Huck learns that Jim had been free all along in the will left by the former slave's master. He realizes that was the reason why Tom was willing to help him. From the first book, the reader generally regards Tom as the good guy of the story, but it seems that in this novel, our view of Tom changes. He is willing to cause harm and risk lives for his own selfish motives.When all is well and over, Huck begins to see the world more clearly for himself, saying that he does not want to be civilized because it would mean losing his sense of logic and acting on cold and strict rules. He decides to go west, toward Indian territories unbound by these rules where he can decide for what is right and wrong.Twain's story is seemingly focused on Huck's \\"coming of age\\" with his discovery of the hypocrisy of the otherwise barbaric society. Where they cold-heartedly abide by rules and treat black people, who are also human as pieces of property to be bought and sold at their master's every whim.I would advise anyone to read this book because it has such a strong message and it reads well due to all the action in the story. In addition, Twain's use of foils allow the reader to see both sides of the story, albeit a little biased because it was told from Huck's point of view. All in all, it makes for one great book to read!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I first read this when I was about the fictional Huck's age. Rereading it after nearly 50 years was especially enjoyable. Numerous incidentals and turns of phrase came flooding back, yet major portions were lost to memory. This has to do with my particular literary appreciation of course, but it may also reflect on the author's construction. My memory was strong for the first half, but after Tom came on the scene it was as though I were reading it for the first time. Ernest Hemingway remarked that the book should end where Jim is betrayed and returned to slavery. That would have made the novel more a tragedy and a truer picture of 1830s America.Somehow, I cannot enjoy Tom Sawyer's machinations and contrivances to romanticize Jim's escape. I appreciate Twain's satiric style, but it went on far past my point of tolerance. Tom Sawyer is exposed not only as a twaddle-headed romantic, but as an arrogant little cockalorum, eager to toy with regular folks for his own amusement. Had I been Mark's editor, I would have urged him to abbreviate Huck and Jim's association with the King and Duke and especially shorten Tom's influence at the end. Some would say I am making too much of this. The Tomfoolery is there to allow Mr. Twain to display his unique spoofing. I get it. But why allow the brave and noble Tom to be shown as such an overweening brat?"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\\"With characteristic humor and self-satire, Mark Twain inserted this warning into the preface of his classic American novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Perhaps he was thumbing his nose at his critics, who often criticized his writing as coarse and unsophisticated. Perhaps he was acknowledging that the book, which contains elements of an adventure story, a hero's journey and a tall tale, defies easy categorization. Using first-person narrative, Twain skillfully employs his command of language and masterful storytelling to explore the idea that true individualism means following one's own conscience, even if that means coming into conflict with society's rules and prejudices.I found this story to be an enormously good time as Twain wonderfully describes Huck and his magnificent adventure. Twain brilliantly writes of the innermost thoughts of Huck as he struggles with whether or not to accept and help Jim, a runaway slave. This is a great book that offers more than just a boy traveling down a winding river and what he encounters along the way. Twain satirical writing delivers immense insight into the society of the time. His explores the problems that existed in nineteenth century America (pre-Civil War era) with regard to slavery. Twain's comedic styles allows for a good read while subtly emphasizing the importance of personal understanding and acceptance. Twain threatened to banish anyone seeking a moral in this work, but it seems likely that his compelling themes of individualism and shared humanity contribute to the enduring popularity of this American classic."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"A vivid story of wit, growth, and adventure is provided in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The experience of reading this novel has proved equally exciting to the plot, inducing fear, anger, and happiness as I yearned to find out the next encounter of Huck and Jim. Through a mix of satire, irony, and subtle humor, Mark Twain voices his condemnations of the faults of society: its prejudice, discrimination, and racism. This is especially expressed in his exaltation of Jim the fugitive, revealing that one's qualities are shown through their actions, not a pre-existing judgment of physical properties. The strength of friendship and individuality is also greatly emphasized in this novel. I have learned from Huck's experience that respect and freedom is not gained by following the rules, but rather gained by reaching beyond what is expected. As \\"uncivil\\" and \\"savage\\" as Huck is considered, his purity and morality outshines the rest, illustrating him as the true protagonist. The flaws of society in Huck's time are just the same as our times: a drive of ambition and greed, selfishness, and cowardice in humanity. The average man follows his peers to gain acceptance, for without acceptance, one fears their capability to function. This dependence has made us fearful and suspicious of one another, trusting no one but ourselves. A true friend discovered is a priceless jewel - a needle found in the roaring sea. They will wait for us, accept us, and most of all, converse and trust us regardless of our flaws or looks. Huck is just as we are, but successful in finding true direction and acceptance."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great book if you are into that kind of reading. Huck is a young boy who is going through the hardships of an abusive parent. His father is a mean, nasty, cruel, and unkind person who wants Huck's money so he can use it for his own will. Huck doesn't like that idea, so he does what any boy would do: he runs away. After he runs away, a HUGE adventure unfolds on the muddy waters of the Mississippi River. He finds a runaway black man (referred to as the N-word in the book) and they set off to free him (the black man, not Huck). This book is a great book (like I said before) if you like this kind of reading. It has a lot of action in the beginning, but kind of fades off in the end. I think the book was pretty good because it was colorfully written. I really don't think that the author had a message in this book, but if he had one, then I think he was trying to say that adventures do happen, even to ordinary people."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Twain's characters are so much a part of popular culture and our national subconscious that any summary of the story would be repetitive. The book is a masterpiece - the call to adventure and subsequent journey of Huck Finn provide both a glimpse into antebellum America (the relations between whites and blacks, patterns of speech and pace of life are long gone) as well as a cold, hard look at who we are now (racially, socially, and the irrepressible urgency of being young). A classic of American literature in every sense of the word, it also is a fun read and a great story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I probably read this book 60 years ago and re-reading it reminds me what a great writer Twain is.

If I hadn't been reading it with my husband who HAD to read it for class, I would have quickly put it down.

In each case the author progressed from noteworthy effort to masterpiece. Huck Finn is a work of art. The funny thing is, he did it by breaking several of the \\"rules\\" in today's literature.Nowadays, aspiring writers are admonished to avoid writing dialect. According to the experts, it has all been done before and done well. They're talking about Huck Finn. Twain's book is a study in American rural dialect between the central and southern states in the nineteenth century. It is so dead-on and hilarious that you can't help but be drawn into the story.Another no-no he commits by today's standards is the preposterous coincidence. When Huck travels a thousand miles down river by raft only to show up weeks later and totally by coincidence at the home of his friend Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally, it's beyond belief. Of course, the rest of the story is so good and well knitted that we don't particularly care, but my reaction was not \\"Aha!\\" but rather \\"Oh no!\\" Cheap plotting tricks have fallen from favor over the past 150 years.At the heart of the book's greatness, though, is characterization. Huck Finn is one of the most enduringly likable literary characters of all time, the classic unlikely hero. Tom Sawyer is a close second. And yet they are so different. Their words and actions may have surprised us chapter after chapter, but they always stayed true to the characters Twain created. And Twain's sly humanization of Jim, the lovable runaway slave, was ahead of his time and probably second only to Uncle Tom's Cabin in its contribution to the reduction of racial prejudice. Bravo!..."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is the granddaddy of American literature. Mark Twain is an American icon. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn slyly purports to be a boys book about freedom on the river. It pretends to have no moral or motive at all. This is not so. Mark Twain, in spite his opening rebuke against anyone finding a meaning in the book, is seeking to make a statement. This is a polemic against the evils of slavery. I often felt that Huck Finn parallels Twains own youth. Huck grows to see Jim as a man and a friend. Twain came from a family which owned slaves but he himself came to be vehemently opposed to slavery. Huck Finn comes from a background where slavery is perfectly acceptable. The grand climax is when Huck decides he will go to Hell rather than let his friend be sold back into slavery. He continues to help Jim. This is an amazing tale although the ending is a bit anticlimactic. One is happy that Jim is free however. He emerges as the one true man and gentleman in the whole novel. This is one of the great underlying ironies of the novel. It is often overlooked due to the politically incorrect racial slurs. The slave is the man with the greatest dignity and integrity. It is unfortunate that this point is missed. Mark Twain wrote a masterpiece. The current controversy will eventually fade but The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will endure as one of the great works of American and World literature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I adore Mark Twain's hilariouse yet thought-provoking book. Not only does he have the talent to captivate the readers interest but also his characters actions and words have a deeper, often satirical, meaning which requires a sheer genius to produce. Huck is my personal hero because he is never short on solutions or a witty remark. I can relate to his social misfit qualities and some of his philosophys. My favorite line is, &quot;A dog will never bite the hand that feeds it and this is the principal difference between dog and man[kind].&quot; I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy to read yet not easy to put down book - the one you're always looking for and rarely are fortunate enough to find. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck Finn is, along with Faulkner's Sound and Fury, the greatest American novel. The novel is a hillarious slap at romantic chivalry, a great adventure story, an evolution of a man coming of age, as well as a plea to end slavery. I too was forced to read this novel in high school (this year), not once but twice. I am indebted to my teachers. The sinking of the Sir Walter Scott, Huck's decision to endure perdition in order to save Jim, and Tom and Huck's quioxic rescue of Jim are some of the most fantastic scenes in literature. The vernacular is well employed by Twain, not in a racist way, but in a tolerant one. As Huck travels farther into the slave country, he realizes that Jim is a man just like himself. Huck even says that &quot;I knowed he was white.&quot; Huck understands the implications of disagreeing with the orthodox barriers of the time (Walter Scott), but he knowingly violates these supposed values to set Jim free. A boat accident occurs and the response to the question of whether anyone was killed is &quot;Nome. Killed a nigger.&quot; Twain is satirizing the stupidity of this response, not advocating a racist dogma. Jim and Huck discuss the fact that frenchmen talk in a different manner from themselves, but frenchmen are still men. Huck and Jim speak differently, but both are men. This is the messege of this timeless classic. All American novels come from one novel, Huck Finn. If I'd a know'd how hard it was to write a review, I wouldn't a written one in the first place."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Even though the title of the book says \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and the author is listed as Mark Twain on the cover, this is a rewrite by an author lacking the wry wit and humor of Mark Twain. Why the Dalmatian press decided to take a book that is so wonderful and have it rewritten in such a dry and unexciting way is a travesty. Could someone have actually thought that Mark Twain didn't do a good enough job? I bought 4 of these Dalmation Press Classics books thinking that my children would love them. All four are rewritten in the same dry, unexciting and uninteresting way. I'm disgusted, disappointed, and feel cheated."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is a pleasure to read. I have listened to it unabridged on tape 3 times and hope to listen to it more. Full of humor and sadness, it is not a book for children as is Tom Sawyer. Huck is an abused youth who narrates an odyssey that he, the runaway son, and Jim, the runaway slave, have on the river. It is unfortunate that films cannot capture the Huck's narrative."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book I chose to read for my book report was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The conflict is man vs. society which is illustrated at the climax when Huck is forced to decide society or his heart. His action's results conclude the story. Huckleberry Finn, the main character in this story is perhaps one of the most well known fictional characters ever. His literal point of veiws provide humor and comic relief in suspenseful situations. He is definately a realist and takes everything literally. In Tom Sawyer, he appeared to be tough, yet in this story, his compassionate side is revealed. He percieves others only by how he feels society would feel about them. This is shown in his attitude towards Jim. Huck is very curious at this point in his life and in the story he is trying to determine what his veiws, opinions, and religious beliefs really are. This makes him succeptable to change throughout the story. Others look at Huck as an uncivilized person. The story does not say much about the people around him since the majority of the story is spent with only Jim and it is told in first person. He changes dramatically in that throughout the story, particularly at the climax, he is faced with many decisions where he has to do the right thing which is the wrong thing in societies eyes. I think that he becomes more secure in knowing what is right. The theme of this story is, &quot; Freedom Versus Civilization&quot;. What I liked in this story is that it had a little bit of everything. This story not only portrays the historical Mississippi River, but it also tells a heart- warming story with humor. This story makes you want to cheer on Huck when he is making those decisions. You become not a reader of the story, but a spectator of the events."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Not that Twain needs any more praise, kudos or whatnot, but I bother to write here only to point out that anyone taking issue with the \\"fine points\\" of language, political correctness (ersatz) or racial issues (contemporary or historic) has ENTIRELY MISSED THE POINT of this timeless American treasure.The entire subtext of this gem of a novel is a polemic AGAINST racism. Twain was a die hard abolitionist and fought tooth and nail against prejudice and bigotry wherever he found them. He was intolerant of intolerance. He wrote this wonderfully funny novel after the end of the bloodiest Civil War imaginable (more lives lost than in any other war we have fought) when the entire nation was wounded, suffering and in need of a good laugh. BUT he was not going to let anything pass, let anyone off the hook and was going to call out fools wherever he saw them. His genius was in putting the words in their own mouths and giving them the staqe on which to do so.The deep friendship he limns between Huck and Jim, an ignorant but sweet white boy and an uneducated but deeply loyal and sensitive runaway slave, will bring tears to the eyes of any reader who can, as it were, \\"read.\\"Twain creates such sympathy both between them and in the reader for them and their perilous situation that no one could have written a non-fiction tract, diatribe or polemic that would have better served the cause of racial equality and harmony.Fiction works through the creative processes and in the hands of a master such as Twain can work miracles. The book remains a miracle and one of our national monuments to good overcoming bad ideas and bad people. A battle won, the war ongoing. Take the time to read it and mind-mend your ways. And, for heavensake laugh, because the situation is so absurd, as are we all, so much of the time."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The curse of a novel that becomes a \\"classic\\" is that everyone is expected to read it. Every open-minded, educated, literate adult will read it, but so will every small-minded, semi-literate, uneducated ignoramus, and unfortunately these are the first to express their sentiments regarding Huck Finn. Add to this the number of reviewers on Amazon who are unable to grasp that they are reviewing a product, not a service, and a book that deserves five stars is demoted to four by the unread majority.It is ironic that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often cited for its racist language when, in fact, it is one of the most ferociously anti-racist novels ever written in America. The language used to refer to the slave Jim is not an instance of racism as the censors would have us believe; neither is it easily dismissable as the language of the time, as many of the novel's defenders claim. Either of these positions is simplistic and does not consider the attitudes of the author himself. As a teacher of American Literature for nearly fifteen years, I have read this book countless times, and I have taken an especial interest in the works of Mark Twain. In my opinion, Mark Twain was fully aware of the connotations of the N-word. If this word did not harbor these connotations in his time, the author was certainly far-sighted enough to know that one day it would. Remember, this was a man who was fully attuned to the problem of humanity. He was also an author famous for his scathing use of irony. Why should his use of the N-word to describe Jim be taken at face value? Jim is the most noble character in the book and the only character who consistently rises above his humanity. Even Huck has his lessons to learn, and Miss Watson does not rise to the occasion until she is near death, but Jim's conscience is consistently clear. That he is referred to by the use of any derogatory term must be ironic.This novel has often been criticized for its last few chapters, and perhaps rightly so. It is unsettling when a novel that has worked so hard to develop a theme suddenly abandons this theme for a simple romp a la The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Yes, this causes unity to suffer and makes for a lopsided work, but even here we can at least appreciate the author's intent. In order to fully appreciate how much Huck has changed and progressed, we must look at him again in contrast to his friend and foil Tom Sawyer. If this frustrates us, the readers, at least it does so with good purpose. Whether or not this purpose is fully realized is debatable, but I think we would be amiss to discard the last few chapters of the text simply because we don't get it, and certainly not because it does not suit our personal tastes.Concerning matters of taste, we should approach this book neither with the eyes of the pseudo-elitist who turns up a nose at the word ain't while failing to grasp concepts of regionalism and local color that should be a part of the mind of a literate adult; nor should we approach it with the mind of the simpleton who finds a book boring simply because it contains sentences of more than five words. (Incidentally, it is a sad reflection on literacy when a fictional son-of-a-town-drunk has a greater vocabulary and better grasp of English conventions than we have.) Mark Twain uses a style of writing that realistically tries to simulate the attitudes and vocabulary of people from different regions and cultures in mid-America in the nineteenth century, and to fail to grasp this is to fail to grasp not only Huck Finn but a huge chunk of American literature written during this time.At last, I would like to offer my personal opinion that no book is perfect, but this is one novel that offers a rare balance of enjoyment, humor and significance seldom achieved by any book or any author writing in any time or at any place. That the author is American and was writing at a time that we were becoming more aware of our own corruption, hypocrisy and greed should cause us to move forward, not back. The evils of humanity will never disappear until we are able to approach them with an open, educated mind."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This Kindle version of Huckleberry Finn is great. It is not abridged, which is excellent, as it retains all of Mark Twain's original writing. If you wish, you can navigate using individual chapters. Very successful Kindle version. (And if you've never read this before, it's a really wonderful story.)"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"We wanted a pure copy of the original text by Mark Twain with all its politically incorrect jargon. This is an excellent example to keep for posterity. Extra letters and information a plus."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I teach high school English, and some students just can't catch Twain's humor without hearing his \\"voice.\\" I found these recordings to be an effective way to jump-start my students' understanding of Twain's style of writing...many would have jumped ship straight to the cliff (notes, that is.) I planned 2-3 class periods to listen to some of my favorite passages, and it was a great success. Interest was up, and essays improved. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It is said that there are two great moments in all of American literature; one occurs in &lt;Moby Dick&gt; when Ishmael joins Queequeg in observing a pagan ritual. The other is found in &lt;Huckleberry Finn&gt; when Huck decides against turning Jim in, even though his soul would rot in hell for it. The point is that Huck really believed that he was going to be damned for helping Jim (which was why the decision was so difficult to make), but was willing to face the consequences anyway.The major letdown of this book is that last part with Tom Sawyer. The book's tone changes suddenly; it becomes almost juvenile. Those last chapters are what's keeping me from giving this book the full five stars.As for the dialects, I had surprisingly little trouble with them even though English is not my first language. A suggestion; if you come across a word you really don't get, try reading it aloud. If that doesn't work, read the whole sentence aloud. You'll be able to deduce what the word is supposed to be."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"After reading many of the reviews below, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps this novel should not be taught at the high school level. Personally, when I read &quot;Huckelberry Finn&quot; my junior year, I thought that it was an enjoyable break from reading other early American classics, but judging from some of the reviews, others didn't agree. I don't understand exactly what was considered so &quot;boring&quot; about this novel. This book provides the reader with action, humor, and morals; what any 'classic' should do. For those who think of themselves as highly intellectual and felt that the novel didn't have a point, you may want to check your IQ, because I think your ego is in for a massive let-down. Although Twain clearly states at the beginning of the novel that he doesn't want his readers to try to find a point in his 'coming of age' story, the theme of the novel almost smacks the reader in the face. The 'point' is that friendship is more important than social standards and sometimes you have to put yourself at risk in order to save those that you care about. This classic will remain so as long as those who are forced to read it lighten up a little and actually open their minds to a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is a very time specific book and it takes you back to a time when life seemed free and easy. It was anything but. Huck is footloose and fancy free but running in the background is his loyalty to his friends. He still 'tries' to get an education so he won't have to follow in his father's footsteps. He learns that there are people who care for him and he tries hard to please them. It is a wonderful, easy read that will take you out of your busy world. It's almost like taking a holiday.I have read both the unabridged and the sanitized versions and I have to say that for me the unabridged version stays closest to the time and era of the book. The way people spoke in those days has a lot to do with the flavor of the book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"All modern literature stems from this one book. There was nothing before, there has been nothing as good since.\\" I wish I could have been the one to coin that description of Twain's best known work. I guess coming from Ernest Hemingway it does carry a bit more weight. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of the more commonly referred to works when people speak of the \\"Great American Novel.\\" A fictional account of a young boy's voyage down the Mississippi River, Huck Finn guarantees that as long as he is around people will still care about American literature. It combines Twain's knack for humor with very real and mature social issues.The main character is of course Huckleberry Finn. When \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" . . . Huck had found $12,000 and was living with the Widow Watson. At the beginning of this book Huck is kidnapped by his Pap, who only has come back to get his son's money. Huck escapes his father and soon finds himself floating down the Mississippi River with a slave named Jim. Jim was the property of the Widow Watson and overheard her plans to sell him to a slave trader. When he realized he would be leaving the relative comfort of the widow's home he decided to escape.Brought up by a racist, abusive and drunken father, Huck at first sees the escape by Jim as totally wrong. However, as the two travel along the river enjoying one adventure after another Huck finds himself growing fond of his companion and the two form a strong bond.\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" can only be described with one word, classic. It is one of the few novels that can be read by a child and then re-read year after year without becoming the least bit stale. Such staying power is rare and is proof positive that this book before most others most assuredly belongs on the shelves of every school library. But don't read it because it's a classic -- read it because it's fun! And let me suggest another quick pick: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"There are many reasons to read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" --1. It is a great American classic novel2. It documents a period in history from the common-man's viewpoint.3. It is banned by some libraries and schools (a must-read, therefore on my list always!)4. It can teach you to write.5. It's a great adventure story that can be read aloud to groups, or enjoyed by yourself!The Fischer et al. edition attempts to reconstruct \\"Huck Finn\\" in the way Twain probably intended. In particular, there is a section showing how Twain revised the \\"Sunrise on the River\\" passage to perfectly reproduce the sound of English as spoken by Huck --so reading this is almost as if we are listening to a tape recording of Huck talking. If you are unsure about \\"Huck Finn\\", turn to the Sunrise passage and read it aloud. Then tell me you AREN'T an admirer of this novel.As a lesson for writers, Twain's search to perfect his craft and reproduce the very sound of his characters, along with a splendid use of language and an ability to create adventuresome plot are unparalleled in American literature. Banned? Are you people NUTS? This is possibly one of the greatest American books ever written.A MUST-READ if you love American literature, or really English language literature in general."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I have been a long-time lover of Mark Twain's books. And being analytical, I want to know why something is written the way it is; I want to know the historical details behind his expression. So when I find that the Mark Twain Library has published Huckleberry Finn the way Mark Tain wanted it (unlike every edition that's ever been published, including the first!), I had to get it. Using all the explanatory notes--which are NOT cumbersome--and the glossary, and other notes about the text, I came away knowing that this book was truly what it is proclaimed to be: the best American novel ever written.Having read just about all one can get their hands on by Mark Twain, this shed all new light on what Mark Twain was really saying when I read Huck Finn this time. The humour was more obvious, the sarcasm was more justified. The book itself opens up this door, but it helps to know what was in Mark's brain throughout his writing career.Truly a must have for anyone into Mark Twain. I have purchased all that the MTL has put forth so far, and put my other editions in the yard sale box as errant texted that no longer interest me. I think any fan of Mark Twain will be tempted to do the same. Why read errant editions when one can have the author's intended, authoritative publication--with the original neat pixtures, too. I was so taken by this last reading of H. Finn that I've taken to memorizing some of the glossary terms. They are truly classic; bring'm back.I am reminded of E. A. Poe's expectation that his works be published only as originally intended. This should not need to be requested by any author. To modify an author's writings for any reason is a type of sacrilege. Of course, even Poe's books are published different than he wanted. But thankfully, there are publishers who seek to restore the only versions worthy of publication. The Mark Twain Library is doing this, and any wanta-be authority in Mark Twain will never be such with \\"Penguins\\" and other bird-brained mass-market editions sitting on the shelf, or rather, in their hands."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present in 1955 when I was eight years old. I had wanted a baseball glove and was deeply disappointed. It sat for three years, unread and unwanted. When I finally did pick it up and begin to read, I was transported in a way that was to change my life. It would be years before I would understand the meaning of such words as irony, satire and metaphor, but I sensed these things in the way I believe they were intended as I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time.I am perplexed and disturbed when I hear how thoroughly misunderstood and controversial this book has become to some, and it saddens me that those that deem it offensive fail to understand how sympathetic it was towards more positive race relations at the time when it was written.William Faulkner spoke of what was most important to writing in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize for Literature. He suggested that the best writing deals with problems of the human heart in conflict with itself. Mark Twain's &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; succeeds in a beautiful and remarkable way by subtly illustrating the conflict in Huckleberry's mind between what he has been told by society and what he feels in the intellect of his heart.I shall always be grateful to Mark Twain for this work. It was the portal through which my young mind first grasped the immensity of great literature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"One hundred and twenty years after its publication, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remains the quintessential American novel. It is an amazingly well crafted piece of work, as complex or as simple as you want it to be. On one level, it is a dissertation on society, slavery, morality and the meaning of civilization. On another, it is simply an entertaining yarn. Whether you are 8 or 88, there is something here for you.At the heart of the novel is the unlikely but heartfelt friendship between Huck and Jim, a runaway slave. Both are outcasts of sort, running away from a society they cannot comprehend. It is through his friendship with Jim and their adventures together on the river that Huck truly finds himself. He is continually confronted with the question of right and wrong and he learns to stay true to himself and follow his own heart, regardless of conventional, social, or religious mores. Huck's instincts rarely fail him. And, as Huck suspects all along, he learns more on the river than he ever did in school or Sunday school.Many readers see the ending (Huck's adoption and continued \\"civilization\\") as a disappointment. I disagree. Huck has grown so much that his individuality has already been forged. Aunt Sally can't change him, no matter how hard she tries to \\"sivilize\\" him. Besides, Huck always has the option of escape.The book has been lambasted in recent years for its shocking language. But I think it is important to understand that Twain was simply being honest and faithful to the dialect, language, and social sensibility of the times. It would be unfair (and a mistake) to apply present day sensibilities and standards of political correctness (well intended or not) to this book. The language may seem harsh but it should seem harsh. There is value in that as well.It would also be lazy to infer that Twain was racist simply because he uses the \\"n\\" word in this book and because of his characterization of Jim as simple and naive. Jim is uneducated, yes, but in Twain's world, uneducated can also mean unspoiled, completely human, noble, and honest. Rather than demeaning Jim, Twain is holding him as an example of the dignity inherent in all human beings.The value of the individual versus the influence of society. The hope and opportunity of freedom versus the comfort and security of civilization. These are themes that have reverberated throughout American literature, American history, and the American psyche. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn develops those themes brilliantly in a captivating story with vibrant and unforgettable characters. It is, and always will be, an American classic."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck Finn was a very interesting novel. It showed alot of facts from the past, which I have learned from. Additionally it kept me in suspense. I highly recomend you read this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, is a timeless classic that provides a message to the reader through a huge adventure that Huckleberry Finn encounters. This is actually a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which only helps explain the beginning of the book a little more clearly. Everything else is a new journey that Huckleberry Finn takes. There are the same characters as in the first book as there are in this book, including Huck's best friend Tom Sawyer. When I first began to read it, I got a little confused about what was going on and having a little trouble starting it, because it had been awhile since I finished Tom Sawyer. However, it didn't take long for Mark Twain to start up an adventure between Huck and Tom. They decide to start a gang where they would rob and murder people. This idea eventually dies off, but I personally thought it humorous that a couple of boys in their teens decide suddenly to begin breaking the law. It really didn't seem that they had a chance from the start to do such a thing. After this, the main story really begins to unwind.You see, Huck's dad is a bit of a drunk and one who doesn't see the importance of work. They also only meet every once in a while, and Huck is doing just fine living with a lady by the name of Widow Douglas. Every time his dad does come, Huck gets scared of what he might do to him. I find that kind of sad knowing that a son is scared of his own father. Well, it turns out that one day his dad comes wanting to take money Huck had found in the previous book. Huck's father decides that since the judge won't give him the money, he'll prove that he's really the boss of Huck by taking him to live with him in very thick woodlands in a small hut. Huckleberry succeeds to run away one night through a very elaborate scheme and finds himself on an island in the Mississippi River. On that island he meets a runaway slave named Jim. Huck had built a raft too, and both of them decide to run away together. Huckleberry Finn realized he was transporting a runaway illegally. They can only travel at night and there's always the risk that someone will catch them. Not to mention a floating house with a mysterious dead man inside, Huck Finn dressing up as a girl, dangerous currents in the river, and even sneaking on shore into people's houses for supplies and information on what was going on. Each one of these events was both suspenseful and exciting at the same time.The two were also not on the raft alone the entire time. As time passed, they are joined by two men who thought of themselves as a king and duke. The only thing they're worthy of ruling is a good way to trick people out of their money. Now Jim and Huck are involved in all of their business plans to put on shows and make money. The two men's greed towards money is so great, that they put the lives of all four passengers on the raft in danger by lying to a family who has just experienced a tragic death. They pretend to be the people who are issued the money in the dead man's will. Jim and Huck are really beginning to dislike these men and know how bad they are. Huck then devises another devious plan that has such a high risk to steel back the money and turn in the two liars.Huck also manages to get himself tangled into an even bigger mess after Jim is finally captured. He's under a disguised name, but under a name and with a family he's closer to than he thinks. The last plan he invests his time into is setting Jim free, which is the most dangerous thing he's ever done. He meets up with Tom Sawyer, and they have one last great undertaking that will keep you flipping the pages of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed this exciting novel and it really gave a message on slavery. I think there's a little something in this book for every reader who likes a good adventure that will keep you asking for more. This book is what everyone says it to be. GREAT!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Some may find The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to be racist, but I do not. I think it gives an outlook on the way it used to be back in the time when the idea of free slaves was a new thing to America. It tells the story of a little boy and a runaway slave running away and trying to make it on their own. Striving for the American dream, there destianation is to the free states. Traveling down a river, they encounter many obstacles. It has a very good ending and is a very good book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Hucklebury Finn, written by Mark Twain, was an excellent book. The manner in which the novel was written caught my attention just from the start. Twain combined his distinctive dry humor with some of his exaggerations creating the Mark Twain style. The Adventures of Huck Finn was a sequal of The adventures of Tom Sawyer. Upon reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer I decided to read The Adventures of Huck Finn. The novel starts off telling us about the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. In conclusion Tom and Huck find a treasure so Huck is put a home living with Widow Douglas. Here Huck is'nt so happy. She is trying to teach him all of the proper ways. Soon after his drunken father finds out he has a treasure and beats him almost to death so Huck will give it to him. Huck runs away to an island where he meets a runaway slave, Jim. He and Jim become friends and decide to run away to the free states up north. They find a raft so they can travel by river. Hoping not to be seen, Huck and Jim travel by night. A little while later they encounter a ferryboat which recognizes that they are runaways. After selling Jim to be a slave again, Tom and Huck decide they must free him. In the conclusion of the book, Jim is freed because his prevoius owner had freed him just before she died. The Adventures of Huck Finn was an excellent novel. This work along with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer forever placed Mark Twain amongst the ranks of the greatest writers on earth let alone the United States. The Adventures of Huck Finn, often mistaken as a children's book, has since its creation instigated widespread timult. It and Tom Sawyer were banned in various places around the world for their &quot;questionable&quot; racist content. Nontheless, these novels made powerful statements about the anti-bellum South, in a manner that only Mark Twain could convey."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book sucks it makes no sense I had to get it for English and it was totally not worth it!

I didn't do my homework or read what I was supposed to read, etc. But growing up, after reading a few of my friends' recommendations, reading just becomes a lot more fun if it isn't work. Taking tests and writing reports sucks the life out of literature, and I have to say this is a big problem with the American public school system.But anyway, after reading this and that, I decided to catch up on classics. You know, so I don't seem like such an ignoramus about books since absolutely everyone but me has read them. So, I read 1984, Catcher in the Rye, to name a few. Then I come across Huck Finn. My high school junior class read this book, but of course, I hardly paid any attention.Racist? Sure, it's rampant with the horrid N word, but this is a book about a specific time period with slaves, and Twain captures the right feel and choice of dialogue perfectly, and sadly, it mirrors many of the guests that appear on Jerry Springer. The buzz word is just something you have to get over, it's not important to the story and it's not about hating African slaves and their descendants, but just a minor detail. People that say they should ban this book are just extremely ignorant. How racist is it for someone to help a slave ESCAPE?The story, overall, is very satisfying and enjoyable all the way through. Once you get to know the characters, you care about them and worry for their well-being. I'm not sure how I can better express what a great and well-written classic this is without quoting half the book, so you'll just have to give it a try.A word of warning, however, if you must read the Penguin Classics paperback edition of the book, DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION BY JOHN SEELYE. Not until you've finished reading the story. This is very important for your enjoyment of the story. While it's well-written and provides a lot of insight into Twain and the story, it's written on the presumption that you've already read the book, meaning, the ending and several important plot points are completely blown. Why would they call it an introduction if it assumes you've already read it?

Most sixteen-year-olds don't care what happened last week...to them, the nineteenth century never happened. I only hope their reviews didn't earn them school credit as &quot;book reports&quot;. Good luck kids...hey, isn't &quot;Friends&quot; on?"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The first time I read this book I was much younger. The novel was exciting and adventurous to me. It was about a young boy that escaped from his overbearing life and went on an exciting adventure down a river. It was humourous and entertaining at the time. I recently reread the novel for an American Literature class and the second time around realized there was so much more to the novel. Huck Finn is an American classic written by Mark Twain. The novel is essentially the conflict of man v. society. What seems to be a light hearted adventure story of a boy on the run, it is actually a satirization by the author of society during the time. These satirizations which are entangled within the plot and it's charaters, are a direct attack of Twain's opinion of society and societies &quot;morals&quot;. Throught the novel, Twain humorizes man's foolishness in the beleif of religion and superstition, and questions societies value of the individual and satarizes mans morality of money and time. Twain is satarizing the characters persistent beleif in superstition and a reason for exsistence and explanation of the unknown. The author is exploiting the need for a reason in life and that there is no satisfaction in just being there for no underlying and meaningful purpose. Mark Twain has also made it obvious that he is satarizing society for it's value of an individual. At a point in the novel there is a direct example of this point where the reward for a runaway slave is significantly more than the return of a man that has murdered a young boy. This obviously exploits the societies value of justice in murder, and a runaway slave. The last point is that the author satarizes man or societies value of money over a good deed. In a scene of the novel two characters would have rather given Huck and Jim money to go to a doctor rather than taking the time to assist them in their troubles. All in all, Huckleberry Finn is an extraordinary piece of American Literature and it's playful plot line and underlying truth in society has made it a classic in years past and years to come. If you take the time to read between the lines and through the adventurous plot line, you will discover thoughts and messages of an incredble piece of American Literature!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck Finn is a classic novel that almost every high school student has read at some point in their lives. I read it when I was young and it was an exciting novel about a boy that escaped his life and went on an adventure down a river and did what ever he pleased. I recently reread the novel for a high school American Literature class and discovered that it was much more than a childrens &quot;story&quot;. Mark Twain is a classic author who wrote a novel that is adventurous and exciting to the youngest of readers and is deep and intuitive to the most advanced readers. The author is actually satirizing the society of his time through a novel that eventually became a classic. Through his characters and their adventures, the novel exploits the faults of society and it's morals and twisted elements. Twain is satirizing societies value of a person, overbearing superstition, and it's importance of money over time. In the novel a strong aspect of the value of a person is shown when the reward for a runaway slave is significantly more than the reward for a murderer of a young boy. The characters superstition in the novel rules their lives. It seems as though they must have an answer to every question and reason for every occurence, good and bad in their lives. This includes the overwhelming need for religous beleifs and reason they ar here. Another good aspect is the fault over man to put his greed for money in front of everything else. This includes when a man feels, that instead of just offering time and help, they can contribute their money and feel good doing. Twains satirzations in the novel are also present in today's society. Which may be why the novel seems to still be analyzed and praised today. Although the novel may come across as a childrens adventure story the reality in the novel is greater than the perception. If you read between the lines, you will see a mans greater perception of the society around him and a reality of the society of today,"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I think this book is full of surprises and is very fin to read. Before I read it, I heard it was &quot;boring&quot; but after I read it, it became one of my favorite books. I Recommend reading this book. My favorite part of the story is when Huckle is forced to decide society or his heart. This story is one of the most popular stores by Mark Twain. I think Huckleberry Finn ( the main character) is very funny and brave in this story! He is definitely a realist and takes everything like it is. Tom Sawyer, Huckle's ally follows him all through the journey and keeps him company. I think story does not say much about the people around him since the majority of the story is spent with only Jim and it is told in first person.

Although this book has many racial slurs it should not be under contriversy because of its use of the &quot;N&quot; word. The story takes place when the &quot;N&quot; word was used frequently. In a way it shows the positive relations between two people of different races. Huck Finn the main character of the novel uses this ofensive slur just because he was brought up that way, he doesn't know any better. Within the novel this teenage misfit gets himself in tons of trouble. This is where the comedy comes into play. Every time Huck ends up in trouble he manages to think of some clever excuse. Like when the two slave hunters ran into Huck and Jim(the runaway slave)on the river. Huck said &quot;Oh ya my father has small pocks, you can see him if you realy want to.&quot; Of course the slave hunters wanted to stay as far away from the two because the don't want to get small pocks. Mark Twain not only writes truthfully about this time period but he also critizes the human race for being ignerent and stupid. Throughout this incredible book Twain makes suddle comments about the human race just to poke fun at us. There was a two year break while he was writing this book because he was unsure of what he was doing. This was written in a time period when blacks were looked down upon as if the were not as inteligent as the whites were and Twain is having a black man and white boy out smart several white men. Twain thought that his novel would be laughed at if he continued this unheard of stoiy line. He was in such a twisted mental state he took off thoes two years to think about what he was even writing about, then continued Huck on his journy. This awesome book deserves 5 stars"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is a story filled with action and adventure.

Huck's dedication to his friend, Jim, is truly touching and serves as an inspiration to all!Since the beginning of Huck's journey, Huck is living on his own without real adult supervision for the first time. He escapes from the custody of his abusive and manipulative father, and runs into Jim, who becomes a father figure to Huck later on in the story. Along with this \\"independence\\" Huck is forced to make his own decisions, which Huck first derives from the racist thoughts he had learned growing up, which he was having problems applying to his new African American, and escaped slave, friend. As Huck sees the cruelties of the world, where the white race call African Americans \\"niggers\\" and when the life of a slave is not valued, he eventually decides that what he was taught as a young child, no longer applied to the circumstances that he now lived in. As a reader, we can read and marvel at the brave adventures that Huck takes on and acknowledge him for his independent thinking!Huck's refusal to give up their friendship and trust, and the knowledge and wisdom that Huck gained should be envied by everyone.

Recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Through its abundantly exciting plot lines and Mark Twain's humorous narrative style, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has made its mark in the timeless classics. Situated in the early nineteenth century, Twain exhibits his opinions and concerns regarding society and racism towards African Americans through the voice of twelve-year-old Huckleberry Finn. In the beginning, Huck runs away from his town in order to escape society and its many rules. During Huck's journey, he is joined with a runaway African American slave, Jim, who not only becomes his friend but also a parental figure Huck has never had. Together, Huck and Jim venture through numerous towns in southern America, encountering discrimination, racism, lies, cons, and many other injustices in society. Their exciting adventures will keep the readers constantly entertained and amused. Though filled with humor and wit, underneath the comedy, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn contains several serious messages and topics. Through Huck's character, Twain primarily illustrates the injustices in society's rules and beliefs and its prejudice towards African Americans. Twain also tackles topics such as childhood, growing up, superstitious beliefs, and moral versus intellectual knowledge through satirical and situational events. This timeless tale is suitable for people of all ages because it allows adults to reminisce their youthful years and shows children the difficulties of growing up. If looking for fun, comedy, and entertainment, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the novel to read!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is my first time reading a Mark Twain classic, but it will not be my last! This book was an adventure all the way through. Like when Finn ran from his dad. I found it to be on of the most was awesome sections of the book, in my opinion, because it is like most kid think about it but he really had the guts to do it.I think Huck is just scared to be a civilized citizen not that he can't be, he just doesn't chose to be like the rest of the world or the rest of the people around him.Overall, I believe the reason that I liked this book so much was because I felt as though Twain was Huckleberry and I was a character in the book the whole time I was reading it. If you want a wonderful book to read then pick up Mark Twain's Huckelberry Finn."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain is one of the world's greatest literary figures. He's taken the simple story of a young man and a runaway slave escaping their respective lives for greener pastures and has turned it into a tale of adventure, humor, and social commentary. This story has been argued over from the first day that it was published. Of course, today most people who attack or criticize this book focus on the use of the word \\"nigger\\" throughout the book. If these people could actually get beyond their own hypocrisy, they would see that Twain takes Huck out of an abusive atmosphere with his drunken, no-good father, and places him into the loving hands of one of the most caring characters in literary history, ol' Jim.Jim essentially becomes a father to Huck Finn. He loves the boy with all of his heart and often mentions to him that he can't get over the fact that Huck is trying to help him get to freedom. Sure, Jim might be rather superstitious and not the most intelligent of men, but it's in his heart where his true strength lies. Keep in mind that Jim is a runaway slave in this story. Slaves weren't given much time to read, write, socialize, or do pretty much anything to further their intelligence along, so it should be understood that Jim isn't a very intelligent man as far as booksmarts go. However, Jim knows his way around the river and uses his common sense to try and make Huck do the right thing.Huck refers to Jim as \\"nigger\\" throughout the story, as well as all of the other slaves in the book. Remember that this story takes place in a time when that particular word was used to address blacks. Does that make the word okay to use? No, but it was the word used in Huck's time. Get beyond that word, and you'll see that Huck loves Jim perhaps more than anyone else in the world. Jim is Huck's friend and mentor and either of them would die for the other. Ironically, rappers and hip-hop performers of today use the \\"n\\" word almost as a badge of honor at once and then as a derogatory term, whereas Huck simply called Jim that word because that's what he was raised to believe.Few books have caused so much controversy as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" but the book itself isn't controversial, it's the idiots who can't look beyond their own noses who've made it what it is today, and I have to thank them for it. Why? Because as soon as you label something wrong or forbidden, human nature makes a person want that something even more. Tell a teen that they can't have beer if you don't believe me. Please \\"enlightened\\" individuals, keep banning books like \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" films like \\"Song of the South\\" and the Bible, you're only destroying your own cause."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Since the first day that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was published, it has been denounced with racial controversies. When released to the public, it was banned by different committees, stating the book to be racist and rude.The way Twain uses the racial term \\"nigger\\" in Huckleberry Finn, is read with offense to some people. In my opinion, reading the story with terms offensive like \\"nigger\\", made the book more realistic. The book is supposed to make people feel as if they are experiencing the times of Hucklebeerry Finn.In chapter 34, the quote \\"Tom told me what his plan was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it\\", implies that Tom still sees Jim's worth as less than his own. When Huck accepts Tom's plan, it surprised me and made me realize that even though Huck beliefs have matured, he still has alot to learn about racial equalities.I vigorously support Mark Twain for the message he was trying to communicate to his readers, through the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\"."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and \\"trash\\". To this day, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts.In my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O'Meally. He clearly states that the intent of Twain's word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur \\"nigger\\" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually.Besides the usage of the word \\"nigger\\", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality. In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Huck's thoughts: \\"Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.\\" Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.I strongly support Mark Twain's the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it 's dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a wonderful novel that is adventurous, humorous, and fun. The characters are believeable (one reason why is that Mark Twain writes in the character's dialects). The book really transports the reader into a differant time period.The story revolves around Huck Finn. Huck is an easy going young teenager who is the son of a town drunkard. He recently made a large fortune. Because of this Huck is confined by schooling, shoes, and ,worst of all, manners. Huck had enough of this so he runs away. His small town assumes that he is dead, so he enjoy's the life on Jackson's island. When Jim, an escaped slave, runs away to the island. Huck decides to go down the Mississippi River.Going down the river, Huck interacts with a variety of people, small towns, and adventures. The story is outrageous, but it doesn't matter. Huck more then makes up for it in his view of the world.I would recommend this to most people because it is a very easy read and is entertaining."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"What can you say? Yes, it's a classic. Twain in his introduction says it best, (paraphrasing) anyone attempting to find rhyme, reason, or a moral to this story will be shot. Well, two out of three ain't bad. The story hopscotches through a series of sharply drawn minis and vividly realized characters. The moral - Huck coming to accept the slave Jim's humanity and protecting him against his socially conditioned \\"better judgement\\" - is blunted by a meandering and needlessly cruel plot to \\"save\\" Jim concocted by Tom Sawyer toward the end of the novel.But how fresh and envigorating this novel must have been when it appeared, a truly American voice expressed for the first time. In true American fashion, it's style became much copied, softened, and cheapened over time (think The Andy Griffith Show some 90 years later) that it's easy to overlook how remarkable achievement it was. As a reslt, Twain is no longer a caricature for me.Jaklak sez check it out."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read Huck many years after I read Tom Sawyer.

Gave it a four star and its worth it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, reflects the development and maturity of a young man during early America. This novel includes many morals which the main character, Huck, comes across. He is an adventurous boy who has to make many adult decisions and had many pressures. Huck is being forced to be civilized by the Widow Douglas while his best friend Tom Sawyer encourages him to rebel and have a good time. All the while, Huck's drunk, abusive father stumbles back into the picture trying to use his son. The novel can be related to many different issues seen in society today such as individualism and racial problems. Narrated through Huck's eyes and literally in his own words, the book is written in a way to be enjoyed by a variety of readers. It was interesting to see a young boy escape on his own and befriend a runaway slave, defying the social norms. His attitude and freewill make him a very relatable character. This book would come highly recommended."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is the second time that I have read the book and it was just as good as the first time through. I love the witty dialect Twain throws in to create a southern ambiance of the 19th century. This book was a huge piece of controversy at its time due to the fact a young white boy and a run a way slave team up to sail the Mississippi in seek of adventure. I find the book really interesting and at the same time almost weird, kind of on a Sci-Fi level, with everything involving how the two families kill each other including their children. Today's world is full of people trapped in the routine of society's standards and Huck is a perfect example of what many people want - independence and free spirit. I like how Huck, even though without a proper family oriented upbringing, is able to distinguish from right and wrong. It shows the incredible mental capacity humans have in their ability to reason."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark twain did an amazing job at making the characters come alive.

Nevertheless, this book still deserves 4 stars and will surely stand the test of time(well...it already has but will continue to do so)"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn is a classic piece of American literature. School children from all over the world read this novel and write poignant essays on the evil of slavery. The various moral issues that influence the story are often ignored while the masses focus their energies on the well-known issue of slavery.I firmly believe that one cannot fully appreciate this novel without acknowledging how much child abuse influences this story. Huck wouldn't have been living with the Widow Douglas in the first place if his father were not an abusive alcoholic who neglected and abandoned his son. When Pap returned to \\"claim\\" his son, who he views as his property, the town doctor makes a half-hearted effort to protect Huck's fortune. However, none can stop Huck's father from kidnapping his son and dragging him to an abandoned cabin in the woods. Huck secretly enjoys not having to deal with the restrictive rules of society that he had to live by at the Widow's house. However, he soon tires of the ritualistic beatings that occur more and more frequently. Huck fakes his own death, and takes off to a small, uninhabited island. Jim, an escaped slave, and Huck travel on the Mississippi River and take turns protecting each other from the dangers of the world. Jim is eventually freed after narrowly avoiding death by a lynch mob. In all respects, Jim is more of Huck's father than Pap ever was.This story remains a classic novel that nearly all readers can relate to. Each generation has its own moral issues to address.

After he faked his own death, his path crossed with a black slave he knew, Jim.

This is truly an important and enjoyable book -- a timeless American classic certainly worth your time. A MUST READ!Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain has done a spetacullar job creating the character of Huck Finn. Huckleberry Finn is developed into a wonderful character, and the book is full of many elements of high drama, starting with Huck's escape from his wicked father, and going on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave named Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer. All of these characters have a lesson to teach or a moral to show the reader. You won't realize it though, which is one of the main reasons the story still remains enjoyable.This book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"n\\" word that will always make my skin crawl, to describe African Americans. However, reading of the book will quickly show you that the author had a deep rooted dislike for slavery and the treatment of African-Anericans during his lifetime. Why else would the character Jim keep his dignity throughout while the white men are shown as cruel and or foolish? The character of Jim also shows that he has a big heart and the reader cannot help but want his story to end well. Jim is only one of the characters that I mentioned earlier that will teach the reader without the reader being aware.I loved this book much to my surprise and found it very hard to put it down. If a person reads nothing else in life but one or two books, this should be one of them."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a fun book to read. I liked the adventures he had with his friend Jim. I really liked the historical part of this novel. Since Jim was a runaway slave everything in the book changed. They both had to be carful not to be seen by anyone, so as not to be suspicious. I think that was my favorite part. I found it very hard for me to understand the dialect or language. Because of this it made it hard for me to get into the book. All in all I think this was a great book to read and give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's seminal novel is a fine tale of high adventure, calamity, and profitable chatter. Gives you a good sense to recall your moments as a youngster, and jump right into a sense-making kids head.Huck Finn, abused by his pop and dog-tired of being \\"sivilized\\" by his Aunt, decides to pick his feet up and thrust out on the Mississippi for adventure. Faking his own death, to prevent his pop and other folk from giving him a good chasin', Huck hops aboard a raft and sets himself free.Jim, a slave Huck knows, takes to running from his owner. Eventually Huck and Jim decide to travel together (even though Huck suffers from pangs of conscience that explain that things like aiding a runaway slave are a clear path straight to hell) and head straight for Orleans--the place where Jim can claim his freedom, it not being a slave owning area.Along the way, Huck and Jim have a might good time finding heaps of adventure. This includes a Duke, not really a Duke at all, and a King, who is also not much of a real King, who are bonafide rapscallions set on defrauding the world of all of their possessions.All the while, Huck and Jim manage just fine, with an eventual ending that is happier than most.The book is as ironic as its author, and as subtly humorous and satirical of religion, 'society', being well-bred, and so on, as you could expect and hope for.Huck just can't understand what all the fuss is about with respect to things like religion, for instance. His view is that it wouldn't profit him to go to heaven anyway if folk like his Aunt were there to bother him. All the hoopla seems plain old misplaced.The contrast to this is Huck and Jim's devout belief in what the rest of us would consider naked superstition. All manner of things portend of bad luck in the novel. From touching a snakeskin to spilling salt to looking over your left shoulder at the moon, the whole lot of it is marked with the certainty of future ills.These superstitions seem to make a lot of sense to Huck who concludes that Jim must know quite a bit about such things. Each prophesy is, of course, fully revealed--being ambiguous enough to stick a cow through.\\"Bad luck\\" will be the consequence--of what sort and what kind they never say. Which is why such beliefs tend to last. Anything ambiguous enough can be read into, and confirmed.Thus being bit by a rattlesnake is what you get for touching a snakeskin. And having a hairy chest will certainly result in being wealthy--especially when wealth is defined broadly to cover both actual wealth, and relative wealth and, one supposes, emotional or spiritual wealth.Both Jim and Huck, however, hold it up as truth unconfounded and of the highest certainty. The comparison here to religion seems, in my eyes, to be somewhat obvious. The convictions of a Christian being compared to those of a superstitious and child-like lot.To Huck, the things that make a mountain of sense are a paradigm the rest of us easily sink into. The language, a crippled Southern dialect from back in the day, is addictive enough to irritate the people you are close to (just ask Ollivia, my girlfriend, what she thinks of my drawl and she'll tell ya she ain't glad about it one bit, I reckon).In conclusion, the book is a fine tale. A thread and yarn worthy of the praise and reputation heaped on it by others."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn is an American classic. I'm sure you have heard this a thousand times but I took it upon myself to find out the truth behind this statement. In my readings I found that the term classic was nearly an understatement. In this brilliant piece by Mark Twain you find young Huckleberry Finn and his Companion Jim being a little more then mischievous. They find their way traveling down the Mississippi by raft. They travel mostly by night, trying to avoid being caught. However they manage to find themselves in many troublesome situations.I really liked this book for a few reasons. One I feel like I can relate to Finn in my childhood, although I didn't have the family problems at home I was very adventurous and curious of the world around me. Second the way that Twain uses the interesting world view of Finn to tell the story makes it not only easy to follow but adds humor to the story at the same time.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures, humor or just likes to read for that matter."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was written Samuel Cleamins a.k.a: Mark Twain. This a book about Huck Fin and Jim (a run away slave) travel down the Mississippi River trying to escape up to the northern states.This book is the most controversial book of our time. It has been banned in some schools for being racist. It does have a racist tone, but it is also one of the best books of our time as well.

I read this last year, not by choice, nearly failed the final test (as did the enire class, and I get straight As)...I may have enjoyed this more had I not been forced by demonic Junior English teachers who have no idea how to teach. I thought the novel was boring, strung-out, and relatively meaningless. The plot was muffled, tiring, and nothing but go here, flee there. The only character I enjoyed was Jim. He had the &quot;you gotta love him&quot;-esque sort of aura. Anyway, my two cents...BTC&quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is essential to the understanding of the American soul&quot; said in the brief amazon.com review. That's a crock.

The tape was defective, and this poor 91-year old woman had to send her birthday present back.

And once again, the tape was defective. (For you technically inclined, the problem was that both sides of the audio tape were playing at the same time.) Here's what really makes me angry though. According to my grandmother, there was an insert included wit the tape that indicated that this problem may occur, that you can send away for something that will fix it. The manufacturer of this audio tape is AWARE of the problem with their merchandise. And rather than remedy it, or not ship at all, they are trying to sell some kind of product that will 'correct' the problem! This is nothing more than a scam. Stay away from this audio publisher."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Ever since Hemingway's unfortunate comments about HUCKLEBERRY FINN the book has been required reading for the literati. Like most people, I read it as but a lad. I had finished TOM SAWYER and was swept up in the stories of lost treasure and endless caverns and Injun Joe. I thought HUCKLEBERRY FINN would be more of the same, and was disappointed to find it was about a boy abused by a drunken father who runs away in a bildungsroman where he meets all sorts of unengaging characters. Even the Duke and the Dauphin come off better in the movies than on the original page.Before continuing, I suppose I ought to give my bona fides. I have nothing against &quot;classics&quot;. They've been my principle study for nearly thirty years -- Proust, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Tolstoy, &amp;c. all are great chums of mine. I'm unafraid of dead while males (oddly enough, unlike Huck, who says, &quot;After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.&quot; I get a grim satisfaction knowing Sam Clemens is now among their number, as everyone will be who criticizes what they've produced.I've recently turned 40, and just read TOM SAWYER again for the first time in a quarter century. It's still a solid book, exciting, well-written, and funny. It's a swell book, and great for imaginative children, as it was for me at Tom's age. I'm now fighting Huck again, and it's rough sailing and choppy seas. I wish I was back with Swann and Baron de Charlus! Huck's aimless drifting down the river is less interesting than seven volumes of Proust.The &quot;racist&quot; accusation is fraudulent. Twain is careless with his use of certain verboten words, but one must not judge a writer by modern standards of racial sensitivity (as with Twain) or plot development (as with Smollett) any more than future -- and I hope more rational and well-centered -- generations that come after modern writers are dead like Moses, that some of their books are not written off simply because of the twentieth century writers' rabid obsession with sex.One reason young people don't like to read is because in schools, which is unfortunately the first place many young people face anything to read, force them into areas over their heads. Tom Sawyer's story would be a better start. It's a book written by a man who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be a boy. Huck's book is written by a man exploiting a child's voice as a mouthpiece for his own prejudices and petty dislikes. It's written above the heads of youths.Perhaps its appeal is more like MOBY DICK or LES MISERABLE. As the vision of Ahab after the white whale is more powerful than can be contained in a book, as the vision of Javert after Valjean transcends a magnificent novel, so perhaps the image of Huck and Jim on the big river simply couldn't be expressed by a writer of Clemens' fine humor but rather limited abilities."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It's hard to imagine how anyone could read Mark Twains hillarious satire and social commentary, and so completely miss the point. Kerry Shale will have you absolutely spleeping through passages that would have you in a belly laugh if you were reading it yourself. And his interpretation of Mark Twain's characters is only adds to the boredom. Just because they talk in local dialect, and have predjudices and superstitions, does not mean that they are all ignorant buffoons. Mark Twain is hillarious and some narrators will have you peeing in your pants listening to his books.

However, I hadn't read much of it before I realized that it was going to be something to suffer through, not enjoy.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an extremely plotless, racist book relating the adventures of the rather tedious, annoying character of Huck Finn. Huck had recently left his hometown and went rafting down the MIssissippi with a slave, Jim. Huck is forever lying to and leaving Jim, in a fashion that made me wonder if he had ADD. The end of the novel, which had potential to make it better, made me hurl the book across the room, in a way certian to make any librarian weep.I also found the dialects that Clemmins used extremely annoying. I had to sound out the words to myself to see what he was trying to relate.If you want to read a book, any book, pick something, anything, else. Trust me on this one."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Or maybe -5. This book should have never saw print, much less read and loved by generations of Anerican readers. That goes to show how stupid Americans can be. Nor should it be regarded as the novel that inspired all other American novels. Nor should anybody be impressed by the seven or eight dialects employed within the novel's structure, which the fool author made up to fool us into believing people actually talked like that. The story is a couple of people floating down a river, with a number of utterly unsuccessful scenes meant to enhance and define a theme so obvious its not even worth mentioning. Then there is the structure of scenes themselves. Each uniformly the same in length and what occurs except the last where in the scene drags on and on and on and on. Then to top it all off at the end Hucleberry Fin regresses. This is worthless. Anybody who likes this novel is stupid. They have no linguistic intelligence or even logical intelligence. And yes you all should read Dean Koontz who is a better writer than Samuel Clemens ever dreamed of being. He will be our Shakespeare, never Mark Twain. I will come back from the dead to stop that from occuring.

This is my first Mark Twain book, and it's surely to be my last, as I was sorely disappointed. While the grammar and dialect are supposed to be written realistically, I found it cumbersome. The adventures changed constantly, and if Twain had written with one adventure in mind, then my attention span would not have diminished. When Tom Sawyer entered the book permanently, I became irritated, because when he arrived, the story became prolonged and trivial. I feel I wasted my time reading this book. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I really didn't like this book. Maybe it's because you need an imagination to read it, and mine isn't always there.

In England, a country that has produced legitamate masterpieces of literature, this work is often laughed at and deemed &quot;a silly children's book.&quot; You can read into this book all you like, but the major crux of this story is a kid and a slave riding down the Mississippi and having lame &quot;adventures&quot;. And the ending is so forced and tacked on you'd think the editor just added it on to make the book more than 200 pages. It's too coincidental, even more so than Les Miserables. Truthfully, I had to read this book for school, and I couldn't get past page 30, it was that boring. And the Cliffs' Notes put into perspective how utterly ridiculous and childish this book really is. For those who think this is a classic, I urge you to read Moby Dick, a true American classic. Or maybe The Mayor of Casterbridge, or Crime and Punishment, books by authors not hampered down by the lack of culture in America."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book really sucked ass.

While this novel is great, the quality of this particular version of the novel (Puffin Classics) is quite awful.

It had a great blend of mystery, suspense, and surprises. All of the chapters had a great sense of imagery. Mark Twain describes every character with great detail. You can imagine what every character is wearing and what they look like. It is a great fiction book.This book takes place out in the Mississippi River where two men from different races are looking for adventure and are traveling for freedom. There is murder, a feud, and a lot of adventure. In the book you are faced with many problems like how will Jim (the slave) get freed, or how will Huck Finn find a way to get away from his alcoholic father.This book had my attention ever since I picked it up! This is a good book for young adults because of the outdoor setting and some mature words.In the end this book has a great moral and teaches you so much on how to treat others and how you want to be treated. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants an adventure!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I liked this book a lot. Huck's adventures are way cool and it was kind of hard to keep track of them all. My favorite adventure is when he and Jim befriend the two aristocats and and they have that plan to steel the Wilkes' money. it is funny when they come back and they don't get the money anyway.Thet was really cool how Tom's aunt and uncle were able to trick Tom and Huck while the two friends were thinking that they were actually fooling them. The reason i liked this book the most was i loved how loyal Huck was to Jim. I can see why he struggled with keeping him a secret and i would also be tempted to turn him in at times. i also loved how Tom was so whilling to help his best friend that he hadn't seen for so long. Overall i loved this book a lot and it definatly taught me a whole lot about loyalty to me friends.

Twain comments on every major aspect of human society in \\"Huckleberry Finn;\\" if he missed anything, I didn't notice. Saying that Twain was \\"ahead of his time\\" here is trite - he's ahead of our time as well. Fast-forward a thousand years into the future, to the unimaginable cyborgs that will be populating the Earth then, and Twain will be ahead of them as well. It's unfortunate that he didn't anticipate future sensitivity to the N-word, as his liberal use of it throughout the book is understandably offensive to many people. It should be clear from his treatment of the \\"Jim\\" character that Twain's intention was to demolish the philosophies of racism and bigotry of his time.\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of those rare books that one may reread many times, from childhood to old age, and find something different in it each time. This isn't just because we change - our society evolves as well, and each time we will read it within a different context, as in Borges' \\"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.\\"Maybe I would give the Martian \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" but that would probably make them want to exterminate us.

I like the way Twain humanized Jim and goes in depth about his friendship with Huck. Yes, there are a lot of stereotypes in it, especially the way Jim talks and the over use of the N-word. We have to keep in mind that this book was written in 1885.My biggest problem with the book is the ending. I find the ending anti-climatic, or in other words boring. I would have given the book a 4 stars if it wasn't for the last few chapters. For me, it all started going downhill once Huck meets up with Tom Sawyer and they start scheming about getting Jim out.Regardless, this book is a part of American history and should not be censored out.

Huck would runaway to seek freedom for himself. In his adventure to freedom, he runs into Jim, a runaway slave. They would both run into different people in different situations, which were sometimes good and sometimes bad. Both of them encountered many different adventures together. Must read if you want to know what happens at the end. Would they find freedom for themselves or would they get back at being civilized? I liked this book because it is very interesting.

On the one hand, Mark Twain, as a humorous writer, created a lot of fun in this book, such as the &quot;revised&quot; soliloquy of Hamlet. On the other hand, the book is a vivid reflection of the life in the 19th century.Whenever Huck went to a new place, the detailed description of this place helps me enter the world of earlier times. In addition, this book also has linguistic value. Although the languages spoken here are not standard, they give me a different view of how other languages reflect their cultures.

What makes the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn so unusual is that it is no doubt a pleasure to read. The book makes the biggest moral issue America has ever faced its subject matter. Through impeccable character development, symbolism, and satire, Mark Twain tells of not only the coming-of-age of a young boy, but an entire nation. This seminal novel did for literature what the Declaration of Independence did for government. It chooses not to hide behind any pretexts, with its characters speaking in straight-forward language.

It's way better than the movie, like most books are. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry do things that would give your life such a rush.

Children these days can't do some of the stuff they do without being gounded for life or send to a military camp, but on thing they can do is use there imagination like Tom and Huck do in this book. This is a really good book to read and it feels like your part of the book, which is a cool feeling. This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it once already but I just want to open it and start reading it again. Mark Twain, AKA Samuel Clemens, had a taste for adventure now it's your to taste it. There are many moods to go thrugh in this book happy, sad, angry and etc. Just got to read it. There is excitement around ever corner.Uproariously funny, Tom and Huck even run away awhile, to show you how hard it is to live on your own if your a kid to see how hard it is to support yourself on you own.

A brilliant writer like Twain could have come up with something a little more believable than that."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I have read the past several reviews printed of this novel, and have noticed that the negative reviews are because the reader simply didn't understand the book. This novel is an adventure story brilliantly disguised as a tirade against the civilization of mankind. Twain makes his political points well felt throughout the story, but what saves this novel from being a dry and boring political statement is the grandness of the adventure contained within it. Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, and Jim are three immortal characters of literature. Huck especially I will always picture as traveling on his raft, up and down the Mississippi River forever, painting a picture of America that will never be equaled, for the novel was written in a defining time in American culture, when a sense of adventure that separated us from our English ancestry ran rampant throughout our country. A wonderment prevailed, asking questions about what lay out beyond the horizon. Huck Finn defines that sense of mystery. Maybe he was the first truly American hero, and maybe he was also the last. But his words, &quot;I been there before,&quot; will be immortal."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"A young innocent boy who feels the whole world is against him. Huckleberry Finn feels he is trapped and cornered. His actions are constrained and his freedom is limited. This is what civilization has done to Huck. The only place where he can find sanctuary is the river. For Huck and Jim, the river becomes a place where the only bliss in civilization exists. Everywhere else, civilization is just a force trying to mold them into shapes that they do not want to be. What is civilization? Is it like the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons who would do anything to kill each other or is it like Miss Watson or the Phelpses who buy and sell slaves as if they were chattel? None of the characters have totally civilized characteristics. It appears as though no one wants to be civilized. Even the proper Miss Watson cannot live without her dear slaves. Whether she is good to them or not is not an issue. The fact that she does not look at them as her equal takes points off her character. How can a society consider itself civilized if they deny the humanity of large numbers of people in it? The satirical novel ridicules civilization. Mark Twain tries to look for civilization everywhere but in vain, he finds it where it is least expected. He finds civilization away from the towns and away from the busy people's lives. Civilization lies in the almost isolated surroundings of the river. There is great contrast in the river and the shore. The hands of 'civilization' drive people onto the river. People want to believe that civilization exists on the shore. But the hopeless attempts to reach civilization on the shore show that the river is a better place that is more humanized. It is only in the parts where Jim is treated as a human being where the positive aspects of civilization are shown. Civilization is not when Huckleberry Finn has to wear his nice new clothes or when he has to come for supper when a bell is rung. As Huck says in the last line of the book - &quot;Aunt Sally she's going to adopt and sivilize me and I can't stand it. I been there before&quot; ( Twain 369) Huck doesn't feel he is 'sivilized' when he follows all the proper and decent manners of Aunt Sally. Only when he helps Jim escape from his dreaded fate does he feel humane and good about himself. Instances like when he does the 'right thing' by not giving up Jim, give Huck a more civilized character than anyone else in the book. There is irony in the fact that the person who cares the least about being civilized may in fact be having one of the most civilized emotions of all the characters. He is more civilized and mature than his elders precisely because he looks at the world from a different angle. He rejects the notions on what is necessary and real and goes by feelings other than what the supposedly civilized world follows. His non-conformist nature makes him bold and civilized. &quot;..and so when I couldn't stand it any longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags, and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied&quot; ( Twain 49) Everyone lives in their own unrealistic realm. Jim wants to be a free man, the Duke and the King believe they can get away with anything, Miss Watson and Widow Douglas think everything can be made perfect and Tom lives in a world of adventure and excitement. No one lives in the real world. If they would just look around they would realize that it is not civilization they are living in. They have created imaginary worlds. Nature and the river is needed to snap them out of their beliefs and bring them to the real world where civilization exists. Even Jim started to accept the fact that it was a next to impossible mission to make himself and his family free. The rich families of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons are in a feud. Huck Finn and Mark Twain see no sense in the killings between the families. Even for the time the book was written, when civilization was not as advanced as it is today, the feud was looked upon with amazement as to how people could kill senselessly. Both families indulge in uncivilized acts. It is certainly not expected for two families of such elite standing to follow barbarous doings. The King and the Duke hope to get away with their hoodwinking play. They believe that people would fall for it precisely because they haven't yet reached that advanced stage of social development called civilization. Both of them think themselves to be more civilized than any of the people on shore. But the reader knows just how civilized the Duke and the King are. They are nothing but mere scoundrels. And if they are more civilized than the people on shore, then those people do have a long way to go before they reach civilization. Although the people eventually see through their sneaky act, Mark Twain still does not think the people to be worthy enough to have reached the level of civilization that he pictures. The examples of uncivilized people in the book show how society thinks themselves to be civilized. This gives them a feeling of having an edge over those who are not civilized. It is this very feeling that also makes them uncivilized. This is how Mark Twain has viewed people in the book. This is his criticism of civilization. Out of a handful there lie very few that can be called civilized in the world."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Is &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; a racist novel? It certainly does not portray Jim in a very favorable light in the last few chapters especially after he had been portrayed as a warm, loving human being in the middle of the novel. But just because the book seems to fall apart after Chapter 31 doesn't make it a failure and it certainly is not a racist novel. Just consider Twain's use of Pap, of all the people he could have chosen, as the spokesman for white superiority as he denounces the black college professor from Ohio; who looks ridiculous? Pap, of course; the drunken, child abusing bum who contributes nothing to his society except bad breath after he drinks, who considers himself superior to Jim solely on the basis of his skin color. There are also many other instances in the novel that clearly show how Twain uses Huck's willingness to test things out early in the novel(remember his testing out of Miss Watson's ideas about prayer and also Tom Sawyer's story about the genie and the lamp?) to prepare us for his growth in love for Jim the black slave, whom he comes to love enough to go to hell for rather than allow him to remain in captivity. Huck gradually learns to have feelings for Jim, feelings that his society told him were wrong, and he also learns to accept the fact that Jim has the same feelings for his own family as a white person does. Huck says, &quot;It don't seem natural, but I guess it's so.&quot; Is he grudgingly admitting this here? No, no more than Twain himself is grudgingly writing about it. Is the book a racist book? Hardly. It is a book about the stupidity of racism, a major problem still in our society today, but one that hopefully one day will be wiped away just as Huck's was by the time Twain wrote Chapter 31. What happens after that chapter is a disappointment perhaps, since Jim reverts to the subservient slave he had been early in the novel, and Huck lets Tom take over, but at the end, when Huck rejects Aunt Sally's offer to adopt him and 'sivilize' him, he decides to light out for the territory; if what he has experienced in the white adult world is civilization, he wants no more of it. He is probably a lot like Biff Loman at the end of Death of a Salesman, who, having recognized the falseness of his father's dreams, rejects the crazy city of New York and heads out for his own territory. Both characters are reborn at the end of the respective works. But Tom Sawyer and Happy Loman have learned nothing from their experiences; Happy is going to stick it out in the big city and show them that Willy Loman did not die in vain; Tom Sawyer even gets shot in his game of escape but he wears the bullet around his neck as a badge of honor. Arthur Miller's &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; calls for us to reassess our values and to know who we are; but Mark Twain had Huck do the same nearly a century before."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, originally published in 1884. It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, originally published in 1884.

Despite this, I really enjoyed it, and now, near 20 years later, I picked it up in some second hand book shop for $1.50 and got engrossed in it all over again.Mark Twain (not his real name) sailed the Mississippi river as a riverboat pilot early in his career, and the truth of his depiction of people and way of life in this novel shines through, despite the fanciful nature of the adventure. I couldn't help but get caught up in the crazy tale of Huck Finn, hopeless trouble-magnet that he is, as he struggles to get free of his troubles with the less-than-helpful assistance of a large cast of characters.The language is a joy to read. The characters are fun to follow. And although the plot isn't the most complex, the characters themselves do a fabulous job of making the simple into convoluted mayhem. Several times I had to laugh out loud at the absurdity.Even though I picked this book up cheap, it's well worth hanging onto. I can easily see myself re-reading this again - hopefully before another 20 years pass!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book accurately depicts the lifestyle and thoughts and feelings of Americans during the time slavery was legal. This book incorporates many concepts from other books such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet when the Grangerfords and Sheperdsons feuded against each other over a marriage. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"How can one critically review what is arguably the greatest American novel? Very carefully! Twain, who briefly served the Confederacy was a river boat pilot, miner, reporter, lecturer, acerbic wit, devoted family man, was the premier writer of 19th century America.In \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" Twain thoughtfully and compassionately weaved a tapestry of mid-stream American life and culture which probably did more to positively change white America's view of its black minority than any legislation ever could. He achieved all that while creating a timeless world of youthful adventure to where countless generations can escape.This wonderful volume is a replica edition that contains almost 200 original illustrations by E. W. Kemble, which conveys the raw excitement of life on the Mississippi. It should be given as a present along with \\"The Complete Tom Saywer,\\" so the reader can have access to the the entire mythos that Twain recorded."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"First off, I love this book and I was very mad to hear stuff like \\"All people who like it are stupid\\" I read one review where the person said \\"It shows how stupid Anericans can be\\" You misspelled Americans buddy! People did talk like that. I know because they still talk like that. I loved the language, and snobs who just turn their noses up and say \\"that's not proper English!\\" are obnoxious and pitiful! How is it hard to read? The bad reviewers called lovers of this book stupid when they couldn't even understand the book. Twain uses the N word so much because that's how people talked back then! Americans who insult this book are uncultured, know nothing about history and are complete snobs. I find Jim to be a kind, patient, fatherly figure, Huck to be an interesting main character and Tom to be lovable and funny. People say it's childish and that Jim is childish, but that's because the book is written through the eyes of Huck, a 13 year-old boy. You would have to be racist to call this book racist. MARK TWAIN WAS VERY ANTI SLAVERY! I'm really mad that people can be so ignorant as to want to ban this book. People say that Huck's adventure were boring, but they were not. He is a 13 year-old helping to free a slave and then there's all the stuff in between. How many 13 year-olds do you know who have ever travelled down the mississippi river constantly being hunted for, without any parents? I love this book, the characterization is flawless and all Americans should read this and enjoy it. Mark Twain was a brilliant writer and all you people who hate on this book and are mean to people who like it, I feel kind of sorry for you that you are such stupid snobs who can't even understand a dialect which is still used today. This book takes place at America's most shameful time in history and yet I am still proud that this is a book that represents america."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is certainly a highly controversial book, but you can really enjoy it if you try to read it as a unique piece of writing, because there aren't really any other pieces of fiction written like it, except for maybe Tom Sawyer.At the beginning of the book Huck Finn is thirteen years old. His father is a drunk who lives slightly out of town and usually leaves Huck to his business. But Huck has recently come across $6,000 and his father just heard about it. Huck lives with an elderly widow and her sister Miss Watson and Miss Watson's slave Jim. The widow and Miss Watson are trying to \\"sivilize\\" Huck by getting him to wear nice clothes and go to church and school. Huck misses his own life out in the woods. But one day his father shows up in his room and tries to get him to give him the money he has heard about. Huck doesn't have it and so his father takes him to his shack out in the woods. Huck enjoys the fact that he is no longer being \\"sivilized\\", but he is often beaten and whipped by his father. One day Huck manages to escape and builds a raft, with which he floats down the Mississippi River. While living on an island, Huck finds the remains of another man's camp and starts to run away but then he realizes it is none other than Miss Watson's Jim, who is trying to run away so he can't be sold in New Orleans. Huck and Jim join forces and float down the river with numerous adventures and encounters and misfortunes through until the end of the book, which really has an interesting end, very controversial to some but enjoyable to others.It is important to read Huck Finn as a unique piece of literature. Some people are frustrated by its use of language, its slow beginning, sometimes an apparent lack of action, and Mark Twain's use of the confusing southern slave dialect. Try to get through the first 5 chapters and it starts to get more interesting. There are some spots later in the book where the story hits a speed bump, but if you read it from a historical perspective and have researched the area where this book takes place, it is far more easy to visualize the book and it can make it a great book to read. One of the best strategies is to read it slowly and to try to imagine yourself as a teenager alongside Huck, maybe just out of view. Another good idea is to read Tom Sawyer before Huck Finn."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The CD helped my students with the dialect.

As the title suggests, it follows the adventures of Huckleberry Finn who is paired up with an escaped slave, Jim. This story is just as fantastic as everyone seems to say; it definitely deserves the title of being a \\"classic\\" book. Each obstacle Huck Finn and Jim encounter is captured in stunning detail by Mark Twain and keeps the reader captivated.One of my favorite things about \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is how well the humor and drama balance each other. As the two boys work through each problem there is always a slight air of humor; although there are some intense situations in this book, nothing ever gets too serious. There is an absolutely perfect amount of sly, funny comments, mostly from Huck Finn, to counteract all of the drama. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" get even funnier and more enjoyable, though, when Tom Sawyer enters the story. His preconceived notions of everything that must be done in each situation provides endless entertainment. This book is a serious, dramatic book but has humor that makes it that much better.No matter how inventive and entertaining the storyline in \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is, though, it is still extremely difficult to get over the grammar. The book is written as if Huck Finn wrote it, with his accent and spellings. Also, the slaves' dialects are written in exactly the same way as they speak. I understand why the book is written in this way, but it does not make it easier to understand or less frustrating to read. Mark Twain wrote this book in a brilliant way; however, after a while, the grammatical errors wore on me and did take away from the story line a little."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I like the adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

The book comes with a COA that tells about the first edition and mentions several mistakes that were included in the first edition. This book is an exact reprint(including misspelled words and missing page numbers), except for 2 things. First, the outside cover is brown not green(Not a big deal. I like the brownish leather look better anyway). Second, there is one mistake that was not reproduced, someone apparently messed with the printing plate on a few of the first editions and added male sex organs to one of the pictures.

He meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, who was about to be sold to another master.

An excellent read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"First off, anybody else find it amusing that we had to pick a pen name to write a review on a Mark Twain novel. I just felt that was a little ironic. As far as the story goes, Twain did a good job of crafting a well written, well researched novel, but it was missing key elements that kept it from being great. The first part of the book up to the steamboat randomly crashing into the raft was pretty good. The characters were beginning to develop nicely and we started to understand why this book was being written, as in an allegorical sense. Of course, why didn't Jim skip and a jump to Illinois from Jackson island to get his freedom, for one Twain couldn't write about the river he was attached to. After the raft everything seems rushed and doesn't fit together very well. It begins to look more like a bad night for Homer as he is reciting the Odyssey instead of an American classic. The ending with Jim in captivity and Tom acting out things is probably one of the worst endings this book could have had. Overall it was a good book, but I don't feel like it captivated me like a real classic should."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"What I liked most about this book was the sense of nostalgia it induced. The events Huck experiences may be dramatized for entertainment value, but they highlight the real sort of internal struggles we all experience as young teens. Huck battles with loyalty, friendship,and trust issues. This is one of the best pieces of classic literature I have ever had to read for school. Twain has the sort of flaire in his writing that speaks of quiet wisdome and soul. He also has brilliant insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is an honest, down home critic of slavery 100 years ago. Mark Twain uses the observations of a young, homeless boy to let the reader know that African Americans are the same as white people. He has Jim, a slave, travel with Huck on a raft into the southern slave states. During their adventure, they meet a variety of crooks and very hypocritical people, including con men who pretend to be kings and dukes from Europe, a rich Christian family involved in a bloody feud, and many Christians who own slaves. I think Mark Twain is not only an great writer for his time, but also for any time, because he makes the reader see people as they really are. His open criticism of society is humorous and yet all readers get the message. I would recommend this book to all readers who can read the many dialects used in the book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I've always heard others talk about how groundbreaking \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was, but I never imagined that it would be such a controversial, yet beautiful novel. It comments on slavery and discrimination while also allowing the reader to watch Huck Finn grow into a mature character. There's a lot of adventure and mischief present in the novel to keep readers enticed; from Tom Sawyer's love for adventure novels to the lies that Huck has to tell in order to keep Jim safe. One of my favorite parts of the novel is when Jim realizes that Huck is his only friend, and then Huck accepts that Jim is a fellow human being, and not at all as horrible as Miss Watson and other characters may have portrayed him and slaves as a whole. Rebellion is prevalent in this novel, and it inspires the readers to not take everything at face value. After reading the novel I felt that it was important to be independent in one's thoughts. The scene with the sheriff made that evident being that when we're in a crowd we are more likely to be influenced by others, but when we're alone we have that moment of sincere reason. The more you read this book, the more you realize how harsh life was for slaves in that time. It really makes you question who you are, just as Huck had to when he decided to \\"go to hell\\" instead of turn Jim in. It reminds you that sometimes, a little reevaluation is needed, and that's what I believe makes the book so amazing. It has the power to make you question everything you've ever believed in."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The look at society's assumptions about colored folk was startling. I, for one, forgot how \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" could be so entertaining: rich with Mark Twain's humor and for us now, educational about how things really were.

Both were wonderful examples of life in the late 1800's and in both houses we got a picture of those author's lives and how they thought.I may have read Huckelberry Finn in high school, but if I did, I completely forgot it. Now I am reading it and realize the potent political messages Twain was sending about the life of the slaves, even after the Civil War, and the mentality of those from the North who were exploiting the people in the South, both whites and blacks. Written through Huck's eyes, it is a telling and explicit picture of life along the Mississippi during troubled times. I like this book and realize now why it is such a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read a German translation of Huck Finn as a teenager. When my husband found a pristine copy at a yard sale I cracked it open and was immediately captured by Mark Twain's miraculous gift for expressing the Old South in language and decided to read it again--this time the authentic version. Not wanting to dog-ear my husband's copy, I chose to buy it for my iPhone.My favorite part of the book is the long journey down the great river that moves slowly past villages and cities and it's human drama, past foolishness, kindness, and malice alike. I was not fond of the protracted adventure of breaking Jim out and did skim a little to spare myself some of the thoughtless cruelty he is put through for Tom Sawyer's entertainment, who enjoys the adventures of complications, even if he has to create them himself. But I have no objections to this part of the book, nevertheless.The historic business of human cruelty and thoughtlessness as expressed in the enslavement of Africans is more fully captured in the uncensored version and, reading Huck Finn, I wanted as accurate an accounting of it as Mark Twain originally provided. I believe if this version is read by a child, there should be supervision and discussion as it may otherwise lead to hurt and confusion. Or perhaps it should not be read by a child. But I think this unedited version is an excellent learning tool for teenagers and adults alike. Mark Twain is astoundingly good at limning the emotional and historic space of the Old South of slavery, using the tool of local language.After reading most of the book, I found myself becoming simultaneously numbed toward and hurt by the plight and blight of slavery, getting a chance to experience my own humanity. It's hard to believe we ever did this to anyone. And I think we should not forget.

Tired of the endles constraints of so called \\"Civilised Society\\" Huck \\"lights out\\" on a raft with his escaped slave friend Jim.What follows is a series of adventures with a few twists and turns in the plot which are all deftly handled by Mr. Twain. My English teacher had the criticism that the book was spoiled by the last few chapters when Jim becomes a steroetypical member of his Race. I believe that in doing this Mr. Twain was trying to point out to the reader that Huck and Jim were equals only when they were alone aboard their raft and as soon as the inevitaable demands of Society are placed on them Jim is no longer Huck's equal.This is a sad indictment on the concept of Society as it was back then. I never get tired of reading this book!!!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I happened to pick up this book recently as a free promotion by the New York Post. I had read it many years ago translated in Albanian, and I vaguely remember it to be an entertaining adventure story. Obviously in communist Albania, I had no idea about the racial controversy associated with the book.So now, fifteen years later, after hearing about the book being banned from some public schools I decided to get reacquainted with it and decide for myself whether it is appropriate or not. Needless to say, that after living in the states and down south for most of my adult life, I could immediately relate to the language used by Mark Twain. I can see how some black people can get offended by the extensive use of the \\"n\\" word, but I would have to give credit to the people can see beyond the negativity that surrounds the word and are able to enjoy the story.The story will take you into the most fascinating adventure that runs through America's main artery, the Mississippi river. Mark Twain went up and down the river for a good part of his life, and that's where he learned to relate to the mainstream America of the mid nineteenth century. So the language that he uses, should not offend anybody, because it accurately represents the sad reality of mid nineteenth century.The genius of Mark Twain is that the entire story is conceptualized and told from the perspective of 13-14 year old orphan boy, with almost no formal education at all. Yet, Mark Twain places a golden heart on this little boy, which after struggling with the brainwashing on the matter of slavery is able to see the light. A fourteen year old boy is able to distinguish right from wrong, on his own, at a time when slavery was taken for granted by white people, He was able to value Jim as a person and a friend, and not as a runaway slave.That is the most beautiful message that we inherit from Mark Twain. This message sounds coherent today more than ever. Look at a person for what they really are, and not for what their color, race, or ethnicity is. That is the American soul.I am going to highly recommend this book for the children of all ages. If you are skeptical about it, give it another chance and maybe you will be able to discover the Huck Finn that lives in your heart, and is dying to come out."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Always hesitant of the word \\"classic,\\" I picked up this book with trepidation. It wasn't required reading at any point, and some libraries still have problems with it today because of certain words and scenes. That said, I plunged right in and haven't been sorry since. This is a charming tale that will definitely take you someplace you've not been before. And isn't that what we all want?--to go where we haven't been or can't go? Though not as funny as some other of Twain's books (think \\"Life on the Mississippi\\"), \\"Huck Finn\\" is an easy read, told by a child narrator. Like other child narrated books--Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and McCrae's \\"Bark of the Dogwood,\\" Twain's \\"Huck Finn\\" uses this technique to great effect. This, coupled with a very distinctive style, not really like any other Twain work except one, makes this a highly unusual book. One must also take into consideration \\"when\\" this book was written and how new it must have seemed then with its incorrect grammar and style. Suffice it to say that \\"Huck Finn\\" will stay on my (and other's) bookshelf for a while.Also recommended: To Kill a Mockingbird, Bark of the Dogwood, Catch 22"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN REVIEW.The adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a heartfilled story. It shows one teens journey through the Mississippi River, running away from his father and helping a runaway slave named Jim, who he soon befriends, to the north. This story shows how different some people can be, though they do have hard times, but are still true friends.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is an exciting book that will keep you guessing. The writter Samuel Clemens, pen name of Mark Twain, really brings the story alive for you. He makes his story feel so real. It wasn't like I was just reading the story, It really felt like I was there, watching Huck and Jim floating down the Mississippi River on their log raft. Mark twain makes the journey so funfilled and full of enjoyment that you can't put the book down. I had to read this book for 6th grade during summer vacation. I thought it would be a drag, but as soon as I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down...not for a second. I couldn't wait to see what was comming next because with every chapter this book gets more and more exciting until the very last page.The Adventures od Huckleberry Finn is fun, suspensful, and comical at some times. I would recommend this book to anyone, of any age who wants to get swept away in an amazing story."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"If you believe that uncivilized way of life is better then an organized planed life, then you should read this book before going to college. I am first to admit that I hate to read, but this book kept my attention till the very end. I got so caught up in how huck tries to escape from the standard ways of living.This book takes me back to when I was little and would have my own adventures with my brother. This book is one exciting adventure.This book is about being you and not living up to other people's standards. The Mississippi river is the only place where Jim hucks friend and himself can be free and make up their own rules. Another big part in this book is friendship. This book shows you the true meaning of a friend. Some of the characters in this book are huckleberry Finn other known as huck. His friend Tom and his self discover twelve thousand dollars in treasure. Huck gets adopted bye the widow Douglas and Miss Watson. Huck gets fed up with this rich life style and runs away. But Tom manages to bring him back by promising to start a band of robbers. Then Hucks father comes back to collect Hucks money but Huck refuses. In return his father takes him to a log cabin and frequently beats him. Huck escapes and fakes his own death and, runs to Jackson Island. At Jackson Island he meets Jim an ex slave hiding out. As soon as you start to read this story the plot gets you and you will catch yourself saying what's going to happen next. I really loved the way Mark Twain used southern way of speech in this story, it made you feel like real southern people were taking. I loved the plot when you think Huck is save and free he meets somebody new and an all-new adventure takes place.After reading this book it made me think about my family, I would feel so lonely if I was Huck and spent all my time alone on the river. Mark Twain feels that a uncivilized way of life is better I disagree I'm glad we have rules to follow if not everyone would do what they want and there would be chous. Imp happy to say though im glad that I live in a time where I'm free to be me."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I know most people had to read this in school so I wondered why it was so important and I finally read it after college. I know it is suppose to be a kids story but I found it to be one of the best books on morality I have ever read.The book teaches how even the most dowdy, illiterate knows that it is wrong to have another person as a slave.Huck goes through lots of experiences on his trip down the river. He learns about the envy of his father, he can't understand why the families are feuding and killing each other year after year for an old arguement. He learns how to be a charlaton and what happens to people who lie.The best part is when Tom Sawyer meets up with him and makes him and Jim follow all the rules from the pirate story and drives all the adults crazy.I really enjoyed this book and believe every teenage should read it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain called a \`classic' a book that everyone praises but which no one actually reads. This book defies that description, and the result is a classic which is both very readable and very enjoyable. Few American authors have enjoyed such widespread popularity as Twain, and this work is, in my opinion, his best. The story is fairly simple, and the plot such that any average person could read and follow the story, yet the message the novel conveys is so deep and important that one cannot help but be greatly enriched by this book.This is the story of Huck Finn, the son of the town drunk from \`The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.' In this novel Huck helps a slave, Jim, escape from slavery, and the two of them float down the Mississippi in search of freedom for both of them. Along the way they have many adventures, and Tom even makes an appearance toward the end of the novel to complicate and romanticize things in true Tom Sawyer style.This book has much to say about the subject of slavery. The institution is so entrenched in Huck's world that it is preached from the pulpit, that aiding a slave to escape means eternal damnation for the accomplice. Throughout the novel Huck struggles with this issue, as his inner conscience (which knows he should help Jim, and which sees him as an intelligent and worthy friend) battles his knowledge of society's morals and values (which sees Jim as a mindless brute which should be returned to captivity). In many ways Huck is far more perceptive than most people in his time, because he sees Negroes as people too. Huck's final decision in the matter is one of the great moments in American Literature. He knows what it means to help Jim, but he has made up his mind, \\"All right, then, I'll go to hell!\\"I first read this book when I was young, and even then I was impressed by the story. I didn't understand most of the meaning, but the book nevertheless made an impact on me. This is the beauty of Mark Twain--he is readable for all ages."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain is rightly regarded as an icon of American literature. Of his works, Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer are the most famous, and of the two Huckleberry Finn is generally held to be the finer. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book as part of my introduction to American literature. Mark Twain had a sharp wit and his stories are rich with character, personalities, language, irreverant humor and situations. The historical aspect of the story is also interesting and important. The story gives a human-level view of Mississippi towards the end of slavery. The N-word is in common usage, but in an everyday context not as a derogatory term. The story shows some interesting and perhaps unexpected relationships and allegences. The wisdom and ignorance of the two main protagonists is a constant source of joy and humor. Highly recommended for adults and teenagers alike."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"this is an excellent and well written story. there are some truly memorable lines in this film as Huck and Tom take their adventures down the Mississippi.A wonderful read for kids of all ages, including 50 year olds."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I never read Mark Twain books and I sure missed out, because he is surely one of the finest American writers that ever lived. In Huckleberry Finn, he brought me right into the heart of his 19th century Missouri childhood and made me feel what life must have been like then. Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful character, and the book is full of elements of high drama as the boy escapes from his wicked father and goes on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave, Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer.Published in 1883, this book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"N\\" word to describe African Americans. However, a close reading of the book will see that Huckleberry recognizes the [cruelty] of slavery. Also, Jim keeps his dignity throughout while white men show up as cruel or foolish by contrast. Jim might be a slave, but he shows a deep humanity and the reader cannot help but identify with his plight.I loved the book and found I couldn't put it down. It's certainly an adventure story as well as a journey into the world Mark Twain knew during his boyhood. There were parts where I laughed out loud, parts where I felt a shiver of sorrow, and parts where I grasped the beauty and wonder of the Mississippi River and the countryside around it. Always it kept me fascinated. And, if the ending was a bit contrived, I was glad. There is nothing like a happy ending to leave me smiling. I give this book one of my highest recommendations. If you've read it before, there is no doubt you'll gain new insights if you read it again. If you've never read it, don't miss it; it's a real treat."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Fin was a good an exciting book. It was easy to visualize what was going on when you were reading it. It was about a poor 13 year old boy named Huckleberry FIn. His father was a drunk, and would beat him so he decided to run away. Huck ran away with A former slave named Jim. They shared many adventures as they went from town to town. Huckleberry fin was a good book, and if you take the time to read it you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":".I'll admit I've never been to hot on Mark Twain.But I'm also constrained to say that Huck Finn is a great book.Huck Finn is a great book.And I'ld recommend this edition:1) it's cheap 2) it's very readable 3) it's the perfect size 4) the type is neither large nor small, but closer to the latter"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"My son brought this book home from the parochial school he attends. As an educator, I was appalled. My son will know the truth, warts and all. Not some idiot's version of what they should know. Is anyone else sick of politically correct liberals? No wonder Odumba won."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I am not sure whether you know this or not (or even care) but reading books that seem too rooted in reality is a bit unbearable for me. It is like calling the sand man and allowing him to sprinkle his little magic on me in broad daylight. Unlike previous reviewers, I do not care for the racist slurs or \\"problems\\" as you can call it because I think it is ridiculous to dwell on something that happened nearly a hundred years ago when such words were acceptable. Mark Twain even said and I quote:\\" There are many humorous things in the world; among them is the white man's notion that he is less savage than all the other savages.\\" So, instead of coming to the conclusion that this is a racist book, maybe some people should read up on the author to find out whether all of it is a myth or plan truth.Unfortunately, I thought that the book was a little dry and got pretty boring some where in the middle. Without a doubt I think that Mark Twain is an excellent writer, but since this book was written a very long time ago and some of the dialect is pretty hard to understand, I find it pretty impossible to understand everything that is going on without having background knowledge of basic American History (but that is just my opinion). Otherwise, I would probably never read this book again, I really do not care for it and I do not think that it is garbage either. It is just one of those darn books that you had to read in high school."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I must say, I read Huckleberry Finn the first time when I was too young. However, this summer, it was on my summer reading list, so I started it once again. For the first half, I enjoyed it immensely- it was exciting, well written and interesting. However, this book seems like it goes on forever- and it stays the same, for me, after I'd read the first half, the second half was very similar- and by the end, I was very ready for the book to be finished."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As adventures go, Huck does experience a lot. But it is hard to keep up with them while you are sleeping in your chair. I never got into this book, I can sum it up in two words: &quot;Unbelievably Dull&quot; Of the many experiences he does go through, none of them are exciting. It looks as if Mark Twain took many small meaningless stories into one big one. Please...read anything else."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I recently had to read the book HF as a class assignment. As an interacal teenager I had a very hard time understanding and reading the book because the 'N'word is used SO frequently in the book. Am I the only one who finds it offensive? Just because HF is consider an American Classic does it change the meaning of the 'N' word. To me it doesn't make sense! I'm not agruing that it isn't a good book. It has its good parts. It doesn't make sense that because its an &quot;American Classic&quot; its O.K for students to say the 'N'word aloud because it a &quot;Classic&quot;, but in any other situations it IS racism. A &quot;Classic&quot; should not be an excuse to state offensive words! What kind of influence is this having on people (especially TEENAGERS!)? We as a nation already have a huge problem with prejudes and racism! Why is racism or offencive words O.K to say aloud, as long as its a &quot;Classic&quot;?

I'm sure it'll be great!&quot; Boy, was I wrong! Historically speaking, the book was accurate with its use of racial slurs, societal views, etc. Twain's colorful use of dialect was interesting, albeit difficult to sift through at times. Also, Twain's vivid descriptions absorbed me into the book and made my feel as if I were sitting next to Huck and Jim on their raft. However, those factors definitely did not make up for the boredom experienced as I read the book. The characters were bland and unappealing, the plot was absurd and dull, and the hefty symbolism was annoying.Sure, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is a literary classic. That doesn't mean that it's great.

THANX!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"In my opinion, this book was very boring. I say this because it went at a slow rate. There wasn't any exciting parts for me. It was plain boring but it is worth reading because you understand this person's life. But if you are like me, you'll think it is boring and don't want to read it anymore. But you have to continue and learn something. In my opinion, buy it to learn the person's detailed life, but don't be suprised if it is boring."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a dull book that is kept alive only by its strong moral lesson that contradicts the rights of slavery. Jim, an African-American runaway slave, is on the search for his own freedom by escaping to the south. Shortly into his journey, he phenomenally runs into and befriends Huck, a rambunctious wild child who is also coincidentally running away from home! Although the lesson is important, I found that it clouded Twain in his ability to entertain me as a reader. Insignificant chapters and random characters slowly drag along as Huck defeats all odds in his unrealistic encounters that take place on the Mississippi River. Repeated character personalities and storyline ideas created confusion for me as I was also perplexed by Jim's heavy dialect. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is actually looking for an actual action plot as it is a huge disappointment as a sequel to the thrilling Tom Sawyer novel."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the greatest piece of literature in America. Huck Finn dealed with a lot of sensitive and humanity issues, in which society at the time was not aware of. I admired Twain for his audacity of bringing such faults of society. HOWEVER, I found this book the most boring and monotonous book I've ever read. Twain did not capture my attention with his coloquilism, which I thought was extremely overused. His descriptive passages were painfully verbose, I literally had to slap myself a couple of times to stay awake and read this darn book. I just found this book disgusting boring, but that's just my opnion."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading and it was complete torture. It was the first story in America to be done in venecular which made it a classic and hard to read. some how his adventures are nothing but dull are semi-stupid. Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked. Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart. His story also implied that southerns are stupid just by the way they talk amoung other things. The story ends leaving you unsatisfied with what you that the main character should have learned.

I didn't get past the 12th chapter before I had to buy the Cliffs Notes (I've *never* done that before). Just thinking about the book makes me sick. Boring, rediculous, and full of cliches and stereotypes, this book made me wonder exactly WHY Mark Twain was considered a brilliant author and this one of his best books. At the time of reading this book I had a student teacher, which only made the experience worse. The ONLY thing we ever discussed in class was literary symbolism. I mean, we spent 30 minutes talking about a bowl of fruit!!!! (what did Twain mean by spending so much time describing the fruit? what does the fruit symbolize?

Everyone must read this American classic!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Those who would accuse Huck Finn of the atrocity of racism have probably never read this book. Yes, I am white, but the story is set up in such a way as to make Jim, the slave who is repeatedly referred to by that most forbidden of words, the most honorable and reasonable character in the book.The story follows Huck Finn, a rebellious eleven-year-old boy without a mother and with a drunken crook for a father, as he decides to run away when his drunken father returns to town after a long absence and takes Huck back home with him. As Huck runs away, he meets up with Jim, a slave owned by his best friend Tom's aunt, who has also chosen to run away, heading north and seeking a better life. As they make their way down the Mississippi River, they meet a great deal of colorful characters and, most importantly, Huck grows as a person. He and Jim develop a deep, meaningful friendship, and Huck comes to realize that Jim is a man, no matter what the color of his skin is.The book is hilarious and wildly entertaining, but is also tender and sweet. Mark Twain was truly a master author, and it is easy to see why this has been called The Great American Novel. The book never drags or fails to hold your attention. I would suggest that any child younger than thirteen or so would be talked to about the \\"N-word\\" before reading it, but I certainly do not feel that it should be yanked from their hands and forbidden. The book has far too much value to sit on a bookshelf and not be read. A simple explanation that this word was a part of the vernacular at the time the book was written but is now no longer acceptable and that only hateful people use it seems like it would suffice.Don't let this book drown in the controversy that it attracts.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of those books. Mark Twain is an entertaining part of American history.Most people who have been raised in America know at least Huck Finn's name. He is known for his escapades in early America and his friendship with the well-known Tom Sawyer. If you haven't read the book, you've seen the movie. That might be a bad thing.How can that be bad? Because if you only watch the movies and then years later read the book, you'll be very disappointed in what you read.The movies are so different than the book is. Yes, there are many movies, but the majority veer far from Twain's original works.It also doesn't help that I am mostly used to contemporary writing which is much different that of the writings of the 1800s and earlier. The works are more description of scenes and actions than we are used to today. The style is vastly different. In fact, you might it difficult to read because of that.You might also find it difficult to read where the dialogue is written exactly the way it was spoken. When the slave, Jim, speaks, it is not in formal English. It is written as he spoke it. In reading these parts, you might want to read it aloud so you can hear what he said instead of reading it.I also found reading of Huck and Tom's actions rather difficult. I don't see boys of their age really acting that way, but that is how Twain wanted them to be. I really think the movies ruined it for me. Though I still enjoy Twain's short stories. Maybe that is where I need to stay with him.Please be aware if you have your children read the book for school. Throughout the book, the \`n' word is used. It was a part of the culture's everyday language which makes it important to use in the story.
